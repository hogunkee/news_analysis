1,KR,"Kroger (KR) is getting serious about meal kits. The grocery chain is expanding its presence in the industry with a $200 million deal to buy Home Chef, the third-largest U.S. meal kit company. Kroger could pay out as much as $500 million more over the next five years if certain growth targets are hit, according to a statement Wednesday.XKroger has been testing the sale of its own meal kits at more than 500 stores as supermarkets try to spark growth amid competitive pressure in the aftermath of Amazon's (AMZN) takeover of Whole Foods Market. As the largest U.S. grocery chain, with roughly 2,800 stores, Kroger is the latest brick-and-mortar retailer to embrace boxes of ingredients as a way to connect with busy shoppers trying to figure out what to make for dinner.The deal for Home Chef will give Kroger a window into the data that comes with a direct-to-consumer e-commerce business and let the chain quickly scale up its meal-kit business, according to Yael Cosset, the grocer's chief digital officer.""It allows us to go faster,"" he said in an interview. ""We expect it to be extremely disruptive in the industry.""Home Chef saw its sales surge 150% to $250 million last year, putting it behind Blue Apron and HelloFresh in the U.S. market. The company, which says it has been profitable the last two quarters, has positioned itself as a meal-kit maker for the masses, favoring barbecue burgers and buttermilk chicken over some of the more foodie-inspired organic options offered by its competitors. Home Chef also sells smoothie kits and fruit baskets.The meal-kit industry has been grappling with the online subscription model, and a presence in brick-and-mortar stores puts the company's products in front of thousands of customers each day. Home Chef already offers its items online at Walmart.com and through Hannaford's click-and-collect program.Walmart (WMT) started selling meal kits earlier this year, with plans to have them in 2,000 stores by the end of 2018. Albertsons Cos., the second-largest U.S. supermarket chain, bought Home Chef competitor Plated last year for about $200 million as part of its response to Amazon's push into the grocery business, sources told Bloomberg News at the time.The grocery industry's insulation from e-commerce started to unravel a year ago when Amazon announced the Whole Foods deal. Less than 2% of food is bought online, but most observers expect that number to surge in coming years. That's caused grocers to bolster their digital capabilities.In addition to the Home Chef deal, Kroger recently partnered with Ocado, a British online supermarket known for automated warehouses that can quickly fill delivery orders.Home Chef's headquarters will remain in Chicago, and the purchase is expected to close in the second quarter. The company, which employs about 1,000, isn't planning any layoffs, Chief Executive Officer Pat Vihtelic said in an interview.While Home Chef has received offers in the past, Kroger is the right partner to gain a wider audience, Vihtelic said.""We really want to be everywhere our customers are,"" he said. ""We feel like Kroger is the best fit.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Best Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

2,KR,"Wage growth will likely accelerate in the March jobs report and beyond, with hawkish implications for the Fed interest-rate outlook. Goldilocks is on her way out.Wall Street economists expect the monthly employment report out at 8:30 a.m. ET to show a gain of 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate should dip to 4%, the lowest since December 2000. Average hourly wage growth should tick up to 2.7% on an annual basis from a so-so 2.6% in February.Expect the improvement in wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSecond, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes. Before its pay hike announced in January 2018, Walmart hadn't raised its base wage in nearly three years. That's a big deal. When Walmart hiked its minimum wage for all current associates to $10 an hour in February 2016, that wage hike was contagious.Walmart is big enough to put upward pressure on wages for other employers. Target and Costco (COST) were among those who quickly hiked pay shortly after that 2016 move. Average hourly earnings growth rose to 2.8% that July before momentum flagged.Walmart's 2016 wage hike came when the jobless rate was nearly 5%. Now it's around 4%, so competition for workers has intensified. At least for workers on the lower end of the wage spectrum, pay hikes appear to be broad-based. Starbucks (SBUX), Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all have said they're raising pay. Meanwhile, dozens of banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hiked their minimum wage to $15 an hour for tellers.As wage gains accelerate and the jobless rate moves below 4% in coming months, Fed policymakers may lean toward four interest-rate hikes in 2018, not just three. Fed models assume that inflation will follow wage growth higher. There's reason to be skeptical. For example, Kroger said last month that it will use the bulk of its tax cut to offset the cost of higher wages and lower prices.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Check Out These 4 Dow Jones Stocks; One Is Near A Buy PointBoeing, GE, United Tech Fall As China Hits Aviation But 737 Orders Roll InHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

8,KR,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Friday: What you need to know as an investor for the coming day. The June jobs report, often a stock market mover, could take a back seat to big news of the day — possibly the first big shots in the China trade war as Trump tariffs are set to hit at the stroke of midnight.If the Trump tariffs do kick in at midnight Eastern Time, adding 25% to $34 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports, Beijing is set to immediately retaliate — dollar for dollar — with tariffs on U.S. autos and agriculture.Stocks have fallen in recent weeks on Trump trade war fears. So it's unclear how the major averages and key sectors will react if the China tariffs go into effect, or not.But the broader implications are huge. If the tariffs take effect, then the U.S. will be at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing from which there may be no turning back. If they're off the table or on hold, then Wall Street will heave a sigh of relief, knowing that Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChina right now is set to slap a further 25% tariff on U.S.-built cars and SUVs. That will hit Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA) and others. Germany's Daimler (DDAIF) already warned that profits on Alabama-built SUVs will suffer. Chinese tariffs on U.S. agriculture, including soybeans, would indirectly hit Deere (DE), which thrives when American farmers rake in profits.LED maker Cree will be among the U.S. companies hit by the Trump tariffs after the Trump administration turned down its request for an exemption. Cree (CREE) warned that the tariffs would limit its R&D spending and planned manufacturing expansion.Trump tariffs hitting U.S. semiconductor makers will come in the next batch of $16 billion worth of goods targeted. Those tariffs still face a final review, but their likelihood will rise markedly if the first round of tariffs takes effect.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL). China has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Economists expect the June employment report to show the U.S. added 190,000 jobs last month as the unemployment rate held at 3.8%. The Labor Department report is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.Average hourly earnings is the big number to watch. Expect annual wage growth to tick up to 2.8%. That would match the best pay gain since 2009.Costco (COST) boosted its starting wage by $1 and other wages by 25-50 cents an hour effective June 11. That followed wage hikes earlier this year by Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), CVS Health (CVS), Kroger (KR) and more.Rising wage growth would offer more evidence that the historical link between lower unemployment and higher pay is still intact. Higher wages, in turn, are expected to fuel higher inflation. Any upside surprise in wages will boost odds of a third and fourth Fed hike this year, as long as rising trade war fears don't curb economic enthusiasm.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:As Trump Tariffs Hit, The U.S. Is Losing The China Trade War — Big TimeThese Auto Stocks Rev Higher; Is Trump Tariffs 'Ploy' Working?Breakout Watch: IBD 50 List Stock With 171% Growth Stock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchChart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart Patterns

16,KR,"Walmart's (WMT) decision to aggressively expand its grocery delivery from just six markets to over 100 cities by the end of the year closely follows Kroger's (KR) announcement earlier in the week to team up with Instacart. Both are indications that the option to shop for groceries online and have them delivered is now a must-have amid the ongoing footrace with Amazon (AMZN).Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart, the country's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, said late Tuesday that 40% of Americans would have access to its delivery service at the end of calendar 2018 through its website or the Walmart Grocery app. And the megachain plans to add thousands to its workforce of over 18,000 personal shoppers to aid the effort.""Ninety percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, and we serve more than 150 million customers a week, which gives us a unique opportunity to make every day a little easier for busy families,"" said Walmart U.S. Digital Operations VP Tom Ward in a statement.And in addition to the 1,200 Walmart stores that currently offer online grocery curbside pickup, the retailer is adding 1,000 more locations to the service in 2018.It's not clear how soon Walmart could bring same-day grocery delivery to all of its markets. In late January, a Walmart spokesperson confirmed to Investor's Business Daily that a recent grocery- and home delivery-related trademark filing, ""Wam! by Walmart,"" is related to active, ongoing projects.On Monday, No. 2 grocery player Kroger said it was expanding its partnership with delivery service Instacart. The supermarket heavyweight, which owns a slew of grocery store brands across the countries, currently delivers in 45 markets. The broadened Instacart footprint should help Kroger ramp up its reach online, said the company.

17,KR,"The candy and snack food industries are doing well right now, based on statistics released Tuesday at the Sweets and Snacks Expo. But you wouldn't know that from the share prices of publicly traded companies in the sector.""Consumer staples in general are extremely out of favor,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. ""Consumer staples have significantly underperformed the broader market.""IBD's confectionery industry group ranks near the bottom of 197 industry groups. It includes just four stocks: Mondelez International (MDLZ), Hershey (HSY), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR) and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF).Many makers of sweets and snacks are in IBD's packaged-food industry group, which ranks No. 161. It includes 29 stocks, among them Nestle (NSRGY), PepsiCo (PEP), General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), ConAgra Brands (CAG) and Hostess Brands (TWNK).Investors started rotating out of food stocks in mid-2016 in anticipation of rising interest rates, Weissman said.Amazon's (AMZN) acquisition of Whole Foods Market, announced in June 2017, added to the worries, she said.The Amazon-Whole Foods merger, completed in August 2017, led to large grocery sellers like Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) gaining more negotiating power with manufacturers, she said. That's made it harder for food makers to pass on cost increases, such as rising grain and cocoa prices.Another factor hitting major candy and snack makers has been the rise of store brands. They include Kirkland Signature at Costco Wholesale (COST), Member's Mark at Walmart-owned Sam's Club and Wickedly Prime at Amazon.To combat these private-label products, the major candy and snack companies are focusing on product innovation to attract consumers. They're using new ingredients, different combinations, bold flavors and novel textures to entice customers.Many of these new products were on display at the annual Sweets and Snacks Expo, which ran Tuesday through Thursday in Chicago. The show had about 900 exhibiting companies and was expected to attract about 18,000 attendees.This year's Sweets and Snacks Expo is the biggest yet in terms of number of exhibitors and attendees, said Christopher Gindlesperger, vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, which sponsors the show.Product trends among candy makers at this year's show include greater use of coconut and caramel in products, Gindlesperger said.Cocoa and chocolate producer Barry Callebaut is promoting its new ruby chocolate at the trade show. Introduced last September, it is the fourth type of chocolate after milk, dark and white. Made from the ruby cocoa bean, the pink chocolate has a ""berry-fruitness and luscious smoothness,"" the Swiss firm said in a press release.Candy sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $25.3 billion in 2018, up from $24.9 billion in 2017, marketing and consulting firm IRI said at the show.Snack sales are seen hitting $42.5 billion in 2018, up from $41.1 billion in 2017.""Consumers are still snacking,"" said Sally Lyons-Wyatt, executive vice president at IRI. ""On average consumers are snacking over 2.5 times a day. Younger consumers actually snack more than that.""Top growing categories in snacks include protein, fiber and energy snacks, she said. Consumers are also shifting more to crisps not made from potato or corn, she said. Consumers enjoy variety and are trying chips made from chickpeas, lentils, quinoa and other ingredients.Food companies are targeting millennials by offering products in smaller portion sizes suitable for snacking.""It seems like almost anything can be a snack right now,"" Edward Jones' Weissman said. ""You change the portion size and suddenly it's a snack. Everybody is focused on snacks. Yogurt went from breakfast to a snack. It's a much more crowded marketplace.""RELATED:Amazon Widens Its Influence Even More And Takes A Bite Out Of SnacksCampbell, Hershey, Humana Lead Frenzy Of Year-End M&A Activity

Long, tight curls spill out from under his baseball cap as he throws his head back and howls delightedly in selfies with nut-butter enthusiasts who approach him in a steady stream. One woman stops to tell Justin that her mother is a big fan.At food trade show Natural Products Expo West, where alternative meats and other health-conscious products reign supreme, everyone wants to say hi to the creator of Justin's Nut Butter. You probably can't say the same about the makers of Skippy.Such is the marketplace for natural foods now. Once the hippy-dippy niche of places like Whole Foods, the arena in 2018 is stacked with players hawking Greek yogurt and kale chips and high-protein everything on shelves at Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR).""It's a lot more competitive, but now there's more (shelf) space that's available,"" said Gold of the changes to the industry over the years. Larger retailers like Kroger, Target (TGT) and Walmart are looking to put more organic products on their shelves, he said.The interest means that Big Food heavyweights — such as General Mills (GIS), Nestle and PepsiCo (PEP) — have been snapping up natural and organic food startups, a trend that NPD's food and beverage industry analyst, Darren Seifer, does not see stopping.Acquisitions give legacy packaged-food companies entry to the natural and organics market with a brand that has ""believability,"" said Seifer.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportJustin's Nut Butter, for its part, was acquired by Hormel (HRL) in 2016. That brought the almond- and cashew-butter company under the same umbrella as Spam, Hormel Chili and peanut butter stalwart Skippy.The added resources of a food titan like Hormel gave Justin's the fuel to ensure that all of its products' secondary ingredients could also be organic, something that Justin's could ""probably not"" have accomplished by itself, said Gold.But that doesn't mean every new food company out there is looking to ultimately be acquired.The idea of being acquired ""would worry me, at this stage,"" said Snow Monkey co-founder Rachel Geicke. Snow Monkey, a plant-based, nut-free, vegan ""superfood ice treat,"" lists banana puree as its first ingredient. It is sold in about 300 stores across a dozen states and comes in flavors such as passion fruit, goji berry and cacao.""We've technically only been on the market for about 14 months, so it's still very new, and I think what's really important for a young company is ensuring we're shaping culture and as we grow we never forget why we started,"" she said.Better-for-you ice creams were popular at this year's Expo West. Not surprising, given that indie brand and Expo alum Halo Top managed to outsell freezer staples Ben & Jerry's (owned by Unilever (UN)) and Haagen-Dazs (owned by Nestle) in the supermarket pint category last year.""Companies like Halo Top are sort of what the industry needed,"" Snow Monkey co-founder Mariana Ferreira told Investor's Business Daily at the expo. ""It needed a little bit of a shake, to show the big guys you can't be comfortable. You can't put out the same thing all the time.""Smaller brands are the ones bringing the innovation, she added, something that ""isn't fast enough with these big companies.""Nevertheless, they aren't ruling out the possibility of M&A down the road. An acquisition could provide strategic advantages, and ""there could be some really great big partner for us to do that with,"" said Geicke.Either way, the current eating trends are good for business.""What's really promising for us to see is that health has never been so mainstream, and it continues to be,"" said Geicke. ""When you walk into Costco and you're seeing products that you would usually only find at Whole Foods, that's amazing to see the industry shift.""

21,KR,"Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in February, but the annual inflation rate held steady at 1.8%, undershooting expectations, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday.X The soft inflation reading could slightly lower odds of a fourth Fed interest-rate hike in 2018. After the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures extended gains, with the major averages opening modestly higher on the stock market today. The 10-year Treasury yield pointed lower.The overall consumer price index rose 0.2% on the month and 2.2% from a year ago, matching expectations.The Fed is expected to hike rates three times this year, with quarter-point moves, as the economy looks headed for relatively strong growth and the jobless rate could sink to a multidecade low. Fed policymakers expect that wage pressures will rise as unemployment falls, leading companies to pass on some of their higher wage bills in the form of price increases.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February.

Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Yet even doves on the Fed are beginning to sound more hawkish. ""Although last year we faced a disconnect between the continued strengthening in the labor market and the step-down in inflation, mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said last week.Bottom line: Inflation is going to remain a concern for Wall Street throughout 2018.The soft inflation reading came as medical care services inflation was unchanged in February, after January's 0.6% monthly gain, and prices for medical care commodities including prescription drugs slipped 0.3%.Meanwhile, prices for food away from home rose 0.2%, while the cost of food consumed at home fell 0.2%, more evidence of the competition from Amazon in the grocery arena.Outside of energy, inflation is showing up in transportation services, whose prices rose 1.0% on the month and 4.5% from a year ago.

Yet a host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour. Then Target, Costco (COST) and others followed. Walmart's minimum wage hike to $11 an hour has contributed to the same kind of dynamic early this year. Target subsequently hiked its base pay to $12 an hour and CVS to $11 an hour.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. In March, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

24,KR,"The economy added 164,000 jobs in April as the jobless rate fell to 3.9%, the lowest since 2000. Yet wage growth, the key number for stock market investors on edge about more Fed rate hikes, surprised on the downside, coming in at 2.6%.The jobs and wage data slightly lowered odds of four Fed interest-rate hikes in 2018, which should be positive for the stock market. The data didn't initially provide much of a boost. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite opened moderately lower after the jobs data, but the major market indexes staged a midmorning rally, fueled by Apple (AAPL). The Nasdaq led the way into positive territory, soon followed by the Dow Jones and S&P 500.Wall Street expected 191,000 new jobs, 4.0% unemployment and a 2.7% annual rise in average hourly wages. Yet the undershooting on two of three key jobs metrics may make the job market look less robust than it is.First, job gains in the prior two months were revised up by a combined 30,000, leaving the 3-month average at a rock-solid 208,000.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFurther, Jefferies economist Thomas Simons noted that wage growth is sometimes depressed in months that the Labor Department's survey of businesses doesn't include the 15th of the month, which occurred in April. If that's the case, wage growth could take a leap in May. However, March's wage gain was also revised down, from 2.7% to 2.6%.Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, noted that other gauges of wage growth have pointed to stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index released last week showed that private-sector wages and salaries grew 2.9% from a year ago in March.After the jobs data, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 2.935% while the 2-year yield, which more closely tracks Fed rate expectations, held around 2.49%. The narrow spread between long-term and short-term interest rates may reflect concerns that the Fed will hike rates too much in the near term as the economy gets a boost from tax-cut and spending stimulus, leading to an economic letdown.The stakes have increased for each jobs report as inflation has picked up close to the Fed's target 2% and interest rates have hit multiyear highs. The combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. For investors, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem confident that inflation pressures won't lag too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.To some extent, it's already happening as the Fed's favored gauge of core inflation hit 1.9% in March. Meanwhile, Wall Street has bumped up odds for a fourth rate hike this year to about 40%. Still, the Fed signaled on Wednesday that it won't be overly concerned if inflation rises a bit above 2% for a few months.There's good reason to expect a further pickup in wage growth in coming months. A host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour.

25,KR,"If the February jobs report out Friday morning comes in as strong as Wall Street expects, it will set financial markets up for another Fed interest-rate scare later this spring.X Here's the reason: Economists expect the new jobs data to match January's 2.9% hourly annual wage gain — the best since 2009. That's even though that surprising data point appeared inflated by a dive in the work week that disproportionately reduced hours for low-wage workers. But even bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which won't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Wall Street also expects that the jobless rate dipped to 4.0% in February for the first time since 2000, as the economy added a robust 205,000 jobs.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Start NowThe combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains fits perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.That's why an interest-rate scare is looking increasingly likely, even if a legitimate inflation scare doesn't materialize.Yet the competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018. Already those odds are about 1 in 3, up from about 20% a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

28,KR,"Age limits and bans on assault-style rifles are in vogue now, but the biggest threat to gun sales may still be President Donald Trump.X Consumer demand is falling to ""new, lower levels,"" according to the 166-year-old maker of Smith & Wesson firearms. The company, American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), is bracing for the downturn by cutting jobs and repaying debt. Rivals, including one in bankruptcy, are contending with the same slowdown.Call it the Trump slump. The gun industry thrived under President Barack Obama, as firearms enthusiasts expected crackdowns and rushed to stockpile weapons. Those fears have eased -- and sales have fallen -- since Trump won the White House in November 2016. Gunmaker stocks, already on the ropes, took a further hit after the shooting last month at a Florida High School that killed 17 people.""We will operate our business under the assumption that the next 12 to 18 months could deliver flattish revenues,"" American Outdoor Chief Executive Officer James Debney said Thursday on a conference call to discuss earnings.The shares tumbled 13% in premarket trading Friday in New York. American Outdoor fell 27% this year through the close on Thursday. That followed a 39% drop last year.Sturm Ruger (RGR), a rival, fell after the close Thursday. Remington Outdoor Co., the iconic gunmaker controlled for years by Stephen Feinberg's Cerberus Capital Management, plunged into bankruptcy last month.The gun industry has come under greater scrutiny since last month's shooting in Parkland, Florida, even if the potential for tighter restrictions on firearms seems lower than when Obama was president.A social-media movement against the National Rifle Association led to numerous companies cutting ties with the gun-rights group, including Symantec (SYMC), Hertz Global (HTZ), Avis Budget (CAR) and MetLife (MET).Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) said this week they would no longer sell assault-style rifles such as the AR-15, the weapon used in the Florida shooting and made by American Outdoor. The retailers also said they would increase the purchasing age for firearms and ammunition to 21 in their stores.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportDespite Trump's support for gun rights under the Second Amendment, he tweeted this week about potential restrictions. In a meeting with lawmakers late Wednesday, he said some politicians were ""petrified"" of the NRA. Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called on Trump to support tougher curbs Thursday, saying the gun-rights group has had Republicans in a ""headlock for decades.""By Thursday, the president had tweeted about a ""Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!"" The discussion with the NRA's chief lobbyist suggested that Trump could be shifting position again in a gun-safety debate that has been deadlocked for years.""Given the more fluid political environment, it's hard to read demand going forward, particularly given growing grass-roots push for controls on sales"" of assault rifles, Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co., said in a note to investors Friday.Some forms of gun control, including magazine restrictions and strengthened background checks, are unlikely to have much impact on the manufacturer,  James Hardiman, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a Feb. 27 report. Still, the buying sprees seen in past years, when gun rights were perceived to be threatened under Obama, haven't materialized under Trump.The larger problem is flagging demand. It's not just politics. There's also fewer hunters and a diminished sense of urgency around personal protection in an era of declining crime rates.American Outdoor chopped its profit forecast for the third straight quarter. The company projected earnings of 31 cents to 33 cents a share for the current fiscal year, which ends April 30. That trailed the lowest of six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Wall Street had been expecting 60 cents a share.The gunmaker also lowered its sales target for the year to a midpoint of $599 million from a December projection of $662.5 million. Analysts had predicted $655.6 million.""We've been adjusting in this challenging market environment and obviously, working really hard internally to get aligned with this market demand,"" CEO Debney said.Debney warned about the sales slump in December, saying the fear-based buying of years past was no longer happening. Slack demand and a glut of inventory were forcing firearm manufacturers to discount heavily, Debney said.Firearm background checks compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a proxy for gun sales, fell 8.4%t last year after increasing in 13 out of the last 14 years. The checks in January were the lowest in six years on an adjusted basis, Debney said.American Outdoor, preparing for an extended slowdown, has repaid $75 million in recent months and extended the due date on $75 million of notes to August 2020.

Without Whole Foods, Amazon fulfillment centers are within 20 miles of 46% of the U.S. population.Olsen, in a note to clients, said key takeaways from the analysis are that the broad coverage of Whole Foods can ultimately provide grocery delivery services to the vast majority of Amazon's footprint that already has same-day shipping. He also said Whole Foods, being close to most Amazon fulfillment centers, can support replenishment for Amazon Fresh, which delivers fresh produce and grocery services and currently is to a limited number of cities.""This reaffirms our belief that the Whole Foods deal is additive to Amazon's go-to-market strategy for in-store, click-and-collect, and delivery-based grocery sales,"" Olsen wrote.

By the 1950s, A&P was, briefly, what Wal-Mart  (WMT) now is, the nation's largest retailer, with a 75% share of America's grocery business. A&P was, however, about to learn that Karl Marx was right.In ""The Communist Manifesto,"" Marx testified to capitalism's transformative power: ""All that is solid melts into air."" Sixty-eight years after he wrote that, in 1916, in Memphis, just as Henry Ford's Model T was making personal mobility a universal aspiration, and that aspiration was making suburbs practical and alluring, the first Piggly Wiggly opened.This was the beginning of self-service grocery chains. Hitherto, shoppers handed their grocery lists to clerks, who plucked the goods from shelves. Soon shoppers were pushing carts along aisles lined with goods enticingly packaged to prompt impulse purchases.A&P flourished when people went downtown to shop. As new suburbs spread, A&P's stores were old and distant. A&P filed for bankruptcy in 2015. By Nov. 25, 2016, its last stores had closed.Last week, Kroger (KR) grocery chain's lowered earnings forecast caused a 19% drop in share prices, which had already declined 12% in 2017. This was before Amazon (AMZN) announced that it is buying the Whole Foods (WFM) grocery chain — more than 460 stores in 42 states, Canada and Britain — for $13.7 billion, which is approximately how much Amazon's market capitalization increased after the Whole Foods announcement.Whole Foods, like Kroger, had been experiencing difficulties from competitors and expanding consumer options. The Wall Street Journal reports: ""Consumers are buying more of their groceries outside of traditional supermarkets. Online merchants, discounters and meal-kit delivery services are all grabbing market share.""Daniel Patrick Moynihan's Iron Law of Emulation — competitive branches of government adopt their rivals' techniques — applies to the private sector, too. Neil Irwin of The New York Times writes of Amazon: ""The online retailer is on a collision course with Wal-Mart to try to be the predominant seller of pretty much everything you buy. Each one is trying to become more like the other — Wal-Mart by investing heavily in technology, Amazon by opening physical bookstores and now buying physical supermarkets."" Something similar, says Irwin, is happening in ""nearly every major industry,"" benefiting ""the biggest and best-run organizations, to the detriment of upstarts and second-fiddle players.""In the accelerated churning of today's capitalism, changing tastes and expanding choices destroy some jobs and create others, with net gains in price and quality. But disruption is never restful, and America now faces a decision unique in its history: Is it tired — tired of the turmoil of creative destruction? If so, it had better be ready to do without creativity. And ready to stop being what it has always been: restless.Americans just now are being plied with promises that the political class can, and is eager to, protect them from the need to make strenuous exertions to provide for themselves in an increasingly competitive world. If the nation really is ready to sag into a rocking chair, it can while away its days and ward off ennui by reading the poet Philip Larkin.""It seems, just now,
"
47,KR,"To be happening so very fast.""Those lines are from Larkin's 1972 poem ""Going, Going,"" his melancholy, elegiac lament about the pace of what he considered despoiling change that was, he thought, erasing all that was familiar in his England. The first line of Larkin's final stanza is: ""Most things are never meant.""This is a profound truth: The interacting processes that propel the world produce outcomes that no one intends. The fatal conceit — fatal to the fecundity of spontaneous order — is the belief that anyone, or any group of savants, is clever and farsighted enough to forecast the outcomes of complex systems. Who really wants to live in a society where outcomes are ""meant,"" meaning planned and unsurprising?
"
48,KR,"In his poem, Larkin explained why he wrote it: He was feeling ""age, simply."" He was 49.Soon America will be 241. It is too young to flinch from the frictions — and the more than compensating blessings — of a fast-unfolding future.RELATED:Ignore the Critics, The Amazon / Whole Foods Deal Is Good for ConsumersTrump, Clinton And The Forgotten ConsumerThe Death Of Retailing As We Know It?

50,KR,"If meal delivery service companies could package the aromas their recipes create, and somehow relay those to first-time users, I'm convinced sales of meal kits would be even hotter than they are now.Meal kits — recipes and ingredients packaged in precise quantities, usually shipped to your home by companies like Blue Apron (APRN), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) — already have a curiosity appeal, despite plenty of reasons not to like them. They take considerable work. The prices aren't exactly alluring. And like any new industry, several bugs remain in the system.Yet many people try them. And once you get a whiff of your first precisely concocted meal, it's all over. I've made meals from cookbooks as well as from scratch, and they've never smelled this good — even when I followed the recipe to a T. With meal kits, the appealing scent was always there — without fail. I began to wonder if they were manufactured.These aromas put a rose-colored tint on most everything I did when it came to meal kits, even when I botched my end of it. They make the meals taste better. They create the illusion you're a good cook. And for many Americans, they help make the time and money seem worthwhile.It's clear meal delivery service companies have found a niche. How big is this business? Statistics portal Statista says meal kits generated $1 billion in revenue worldwide in 2015 and will hit $10 billion by 2020. Packaged Facts put meal kit revenue at $5 billion last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseData analytics company Nielsen released data in March that showed 9% of U.S. consumers, or 10.5 million households, bought a meal kit in the prior six months. Another 25% of consumers, or 30.1 million households, said they would consider trying one in the next six months.I am now one of the 9%. In all, I tried six different meal kit companies over the past few months, and made 26 individual meals. I spent $287.51 of my company's money, or $11.06 per plate. I came away thinking this is a good idea — particularly since everyone I told about this story was curious about it.Still, there were questions. Can meal delivery service companies compete as retail giants enter the market? Walmart and Amazon.com are both selling meal kits, suggesting future price pressures. How long can smaller players like Blue Apron hold up? Shares of Blue Apron jumped nearly 6% Monday, but the stock remained at 3.21 a share. Walmart, meanwhile, is around 83 a share while Amazon is at an other-worldly 1,723.79.With a market basket full of competitors — and not a lot to distinguish one from the other — the business will only get more cutthroat as they jockey for position. Who can survive the shakeout?Meal-kit deliveries are somewhere on the cost spectrum between buying the ingredients yourself at a grocery store and going to a restaurant. In fact, some say meal kits are meant to be the bridge between the two, though market forces are moving it closer to the grocery store.A Chef'd chicken Marsala meal, shipped by Amazon, goes for $12.45 a plate. That's 31% cheaper than the $17.99 I'd pay for the same dish at the fairly nice Italian eatery in my neighborhood.But a meal delivery service is considerably more expensive than buying only the ingredients I needed at my local supermarket. The market price would've only come to $8.33 a head — that is, if you could buy only the amounts you need. On Planet Earth, they won't let you do that. So you'd need to make the dish two or three times — replenishing some ingredients along the way — to get that price. In addition to meal kits from Blue Apron, Amazon and Walmart, consumers can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of companies, including Home Chef, HelloFresh, Freshly, Sun Basket, Plated, Green Chef, Terra's Kitchen and PeachDish.Lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart is behind Martha & Marley Spoon. Even New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady is jumping in the game by partnering with a veggie-oriented service called Purple Carrot.Meal-kit discounts are getting more plentiful, so the margins are bound to get tighter for them all. You wonder why any company would make the effort, particularly if the cost curve is getting steeper.So far, only one pure-play meal kit provider in the U.S. has gone public, Blue Apron, and its stock is trading near 3, down 72% from its 11 IPO price in June 2017. Blue Apron has yet to turn a profit, and its sales have declined in the past two quarters.HelloFresh is traded on public markets, but only on its home court in Germany. After some ups and downs, the stock has a 2018 gain of 9%. Sales growth is strong, but like Blue Apron, the company is not yet profitable.At first blush, shelling out money for the privilege of slaving over a hot stove seemed unappealing when I could pay just a little more for someone else to do that for me at a restaurant. Not only do they place a meal before me, they do so while I'm sipping a cocktail.I also don't do that much cooking at my house. I do a lot of eating, as evidenced by my formidable girth. And don't get me wrong, I can cook. I grew up in a family that did a lot of work in restaurants. I just don't cook much anymore. It's one of many reasons my wife should be considered for sainthood.Third, my local grocery store — Ralphs, a California chain owned by Kroger (KR) — is less than one block away from my house. Ordering something online and having it delivered seems supremely lazy given my geographical situation, and waistline. But should I get even cheaper and lazier, my local store says it may soon be among the Ralphs stores offering prepackaged meal kits from Home Chef. And I hear the prices may be more inviting.That said, there's plenty to like about meal kits. It's not just the smells. The tastes were quite good, too. There wasn't a bad meal, even though I fumbled the cooking chores a couple of times.The aim of meal kits is to make cooking simple. If you can read, you can cook using this method. You just have to follow directions, which shouldn't be that hard.One plus is you're introduced to cuisine you normally wouldn't cook. Instead of Tuesday's rubber chicken, you can have the elegant-sounding Steak Moutarde with roasted sweet potato wedges. Still insist on poultry? They can dress that up, too. There's the aforementioned chicken Marsala with Linguine and roasted broccoli with goat cheese on the side. No rubber included.You also might encounter a wealth of new ingredients and tastes you never knew existed. Ever heard of Gochujang red pepper sauce? How about shredded Chihuahua cheese? I discovered those, plus Tumari sauce, Fregola Sarda Pasta and a cooking wine known as Verjus Blanc. What's great is if you find you don't like any of these, you're only allotted what you need for that meal. No waste.Further, you get a certain satisfaction from cooking the meal yourself. People who never thought they could cook probably will discover they can.Guys can fool their girlfriends into thinking they're debonair, at least for an evening. Busy people can do it in relatively short order, though probably not in the compressed time frame the makers of meal kits claim. And lazy husbands can help out their soon-to-be-canonized wives.Here are some of the highlights I personally encountered on my prepackaged culinary adventure. In order, we used Blue Apron, HelloFresh, Walmart, Chef'D via Amazon, Freshly and Home Chef.

62,KR,"The biggest problem cited by McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN) and a host of other fast-food and fast-casual restaurant chains got even worse in August: The cost of eating in got even cheaper relative to dining out.Food at home prices fell 0.2% last month, while the price of food away from home rose 0.2%, adjusted for seasonal factors, the Labor Department said on Friday.Compared with a year ago, food at home costs 1.9% less, while food away from home costs 2.9% more. The divergence in prices has accelerated over the past year as the restaurant industry digests higher wages, yet the problem has been building for close to two years.Over the past two years, prices of limited service meals and snacks are up 5.9%, while food-at-home costs 1.1% less than it did two years ago. That gap of 7 percentage points is the biggest gap since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began breaking out fast-food prices in the late 1990s.Restaurants wanting to lure customers may have to limit menu price hikes, pinching margins.On an Aug. 10 earnings call, Wendy's said it was picking up market share in the hamburger segment of the fast-food industry, but industrywide demand has been flat.Wendy's CEO Todd Penegor explained why: ""It's gotten a lot cheaper, relatively speaking, to go get fresh beef at your local butcher and go home and grill it.""Prices for uncooked ground beef are down 8.8% from a year ago, despite a rare 0.8% rise last month, as cheaper corn for feeding cattle has helped reverse an earlier spike in prices. Poultry prices for home consumption are down 2.9% from a year ago.McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said on a July 26 conference call, ""While we are benefiting from favorable commodity costs around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition.""He noted that menu prices were up about 3% from a year ago in the second quarter.IBD'S TAKE: If rising labor costs already are a concern for the fast-food industry, can low-cost chains live with a $15 minimum wage? Check out this Industry Snapshot to understand why a high minimum wage will be so difficult for fast-food franchises to digest.Jack in the Box (JACK) reported a 3.7% decline in transactions in the second quarter, citing a ""migration (of business) from our industry to supermarkets.""Still, margins at Jack in the Box brand restaurants increased 0.5 percentage point to 22.5% ""as favorable commodity costs more than offset wage inflation,"" said Jerry Rebel, Jack's chief financial officer.On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that sales at food and drinking places rose 0.9% in August after being flat in July. Overall, retail sales fell 0.3% last month, so the restaurant industry isn't the only one seeing challenging conditions.Same-store sales at restaurants were down 0.6% from a year ago in August, though not as bad as July's 1.4% year-over-year decline, according to TDn2K's Black Box Intelligence. Quick-service chains fared somewhat better than fast-casual.Ruby Tuesday (RT) said on an Aug. 10 earnings call, the last one before its CEO resigned, that ""business continues to be impacted by declines in guest traffic, pervasive softness in the casual dining industry and increased promotional activity by our peers.""Still, Brinker International (EAT), which owns the Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy chains, says it's staying on plan to raise prices 1.5% to 2% a year, amid labor-cost increases and doubts that food-at-home prices will keep falling.""It's a little different in retail where you just resticker the product every day, but for us, we believe that it makes more sense to be more consistent in your pricing,"" CEO Wyman Roberts said on an earnings call.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is still seeing positive same-store sales growth, but in the 2% to 4% range after double-digit growth the prior year. The steakhouse has resisted big wage increases, reporting only moderate wage inflation of 3.5%, but it's seen staff turnover spike to 120% of hourly workers on an annual basis, down from 20% several years ago. Now it is also facing potential cost increases from the Labor Department's overtime rule that takes effect in December.""We expect to experience continued food cost deflation again next year along with continued labor inflation,"" Texas Roadhouse CEO Wayne Kent Taylor said on an August 1 earnings call via a Seeking Alpha transcript. ""As always, we remain committed to protecting our everyday value positioning and will be conservative when it comes to taking any price increases.""Another consideration for franchises is that for McDonald's, the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain and others, franchise fees and rent, in some cases, is a fixed percentage of sales. That means lower prices would directly cut into franchise royalties, a cash cow.Meanwhile, grocery stores are struggling with lower food prices as well.Kroger (KR) lowered its earnings guidance earlier this month for the second half of 2016, citing food deflation and expectations of same-store sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%. In part, Kroger is passing along lower commodities prices to its grocery store customers, but analysts have also cited price-cutting pressure from Wal-Mart (WMT). Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), SuperValu (SVU) as well as dollar stores and distributors have reported weak grocery results in recent weeks.

63,KR,"Retail sales fell 0.3% in August, the Commerce Department said Thursday vs. estimates for a 0.1% decline. Excluding the auto sector, sales fell 0.1% vs. views for a 0.2% gain.July retail sales was revised up a tenth to a 0.1% gain but excluding autos they were revised down a tenth to -0.4%. The report likely reinforces market expectations that there will be no Federal Reserve hike in September.Economists had expected a solid bounceback in sales outside the auto sector during the key back-to-school month. But one of the only truly consistent sources of strength, Amazon (AMZN) and its category of nonstore retailers, saw a 0.3% decline in sales, a possible aftereffect of Amazon Prime Day in July. Nonstore sales still rose 10.9% vs. a year earlier.A second straight weak report may raise questions about the state of the consumer after the August jobs report showed a big slowdown in weekly wage gains and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index backslid this month.Auto sales for August showed a drop in the seasonally adjusted annual rate to 16.98 million vs. a 17.88 million pace in July, an apparent confirmation that sales will come in shy of 2015's record.Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) both reported year-over-year declines in vehicle sales during August. In fact, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) was the only one of the seven top U.S. sellers to report higher demand.Autos are a key component of industrial production. The Federal Reserve will release August industrial production data on Thursday, while the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed mixed readings for September manufacturing activity in their regional districts.The tepid 0.1% rise in nonauto sales in July came despite Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. A host of other retailers seized on the event to offer bargains of their own, potentially moving some back-to-school spending into July. Clothing stores saw a 0.7% gain. But general merchandise stores saw flat sales and department stores saw a 0.7% decline from July.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense. Watch this IBD Video for tips on how to quickly identify and research leading stocks that may be ready to be bought.Electronics retailers saw a 0.1% sales gain despite likely weak demand for Apple (AAPL) iPhone sales ahead of September's launch of the iPhone 7. Costco (COST) reported that its August same-store sales were flat from a year ago, as gains in other categories didn't outweigh lower gas and food prices.Grocery stores reported a 0.3% monthly sales gain while restaurants advanced 0.9%. That's despite a raft of negative news from those sectors amid falling prices.Same-store sales at restaurants were down 0.6% from a year ago in August, though not as bad as July's 1.4% year-over-year decline, according to TDn2K's Black Box Intelligence. The problem cited by McDonald's (MCD) and multiple industry players is that food at home is looking like an unusually good deal relative to the cost of food away from home.Kroger lowered its earnings guidance earlier this month for the second half of 2016, citing food deflation and expectations of same-store sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%.

The stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base in June following the organic grocery distributor's last quarterly report, but shares have trended downward since the middle of last month, below their 50-day line.Why It Matters:  United Natural Foods' results will come as the grocery sector deals with an oversupply in some types of food -- particularly meat, poultry and dairy -- that have dragged prices lower and forced grocery stores into more aggressive promotions that some have compared to the industrywide price wars that took place in 2009.SuperValu (SVU), a grocery-store operator and distributor, last week warned about lower food prices and said Wal-Mart (WMT), which is undertaking a big price-cutting campaign, has ""always been a tough competitor.""

67,KR,"Grocery retailer and distributor SuperValu (SVU) on Thursday became the latest industry player to warn about stiffer competition and lower food prices, slashing its full-year outlook amid what some analysts call signs of another grocery-store price war.The announcement comes a day after natural foods store Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) cut its full-year outlook for similar reasons. Dollar General (DG) also cited retail ""food deflation"" as a difficulty. Investors will be watching to see if grocery-store operator Kroger (KR) reports the same when it reports second-quarter earnings on Friday.""The current landscape is now beginning to look a lot like 2009, when meaningful deflation resulted in an industry price war and multiple quarters of declining earnings,"" Credit Suisse analyst Edward Kelly said in a research note dated Wednesday.He added that the fall in food prices could last a few quarters and make it even harder for Whole Foods Market (WFM) to spin itself as a more value-oriented grocery store.The slide in prices has occurred largely in beef, poultry and dairy, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.Beef prices, he said, have largely fallen due for cyclical reasons -- the general balancing of supply and demand. Last year's bird flu outbreak constrained supply of poultry, drove up egg prices and prompted more people to buy egg substitutes, he added. But when some kept using those substitutes after the bird flu passed rather than switching back to eggs, egg production got too high and prices fell. As the U.S. dollar strengthened against other currencies, demand for milk in Asia and Europe waned, leading to an oversupply, Yarbrough also said.Amid those trends, grocery stores have tried to cut prices to move items off shelves more quickly. Recent price cuts at Wal-Mart (WMT) have begotten price cuts at its rivals.""The deflation in certain proteins has been sustained in a way that I have not previously seen,"" CEO Mark Gross said at an investor conference.""It's interesting,"" he continued, ""the ability of U.S. producers to spring back from, let's say, supply constraints of last year, particularly, say, the Avian bird flu that affected chicken flocks -- the ability of producers to come back so fast and so strong that we would be experiencing substantial deflation in normal Grade A eggs is significant.""At the conference, SuperValu management shied away from calling the climate a price war but did say that Wal-Mart, whose price cuts have reportedly also hurt the dollar stores, has ""always been a tough competitor."" SuperValu also cited changes and cuts in food stamp benefit as affecting sales, as have others.In a statement, SuperValu said it expected full-year adjusted EBITDA — or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — to be around 5% lower than last year. Earlier, the company had forecast for a 1.5% slip, according to the Wall Street Journal.Shares sank 9.5% in the stock market today following the news, puncturing their 50-day and 200-day lines after finding support at the latter level for a few weeks. The stock fell 3.9% on Wednesday, joining the Sprouts-led sell-off.SuperValu serves and operates conventional grocery stores and operates Save-A-Lot, a discount chain. The company said its retail division in its fiscal second quarter ""has been impacted to a greater than anticipated degree by competitive openings and a challenging sales and operating environment for its stores.""The Save-A-Lot segment in the second quarter had been hit by ""deeper levels of deflation as well as lower levels of SNAP (supplemental nutrition assistance program) benefits compared to the first quarter,"" SuperValu said, referring to a federal program that helps people in low-income brackets buy food.IBD'S TAKE: Cheaper groceries have also hurt the restaurant business, with more people opting to save money and eat in. However, Papa John's is nearing a buy point. See why stocks like Papa John's and Domino's Pizza are rising above rival restaurants. Sprouts Farmers Market stock fell 1.3% after crashing nearly 14% on Wednesday. Kroger (KR) closed down 1 cent at 31.31, but that followed a 4% loss on Wednesday. and Whole Foods Market rose 0.6%, but after tumbling 5% on Wednesday.Wal-Mart fell 0.3%, still stuck below its 50-day line.Natural foods distributor United Natural Foods (UNFI) sank 3.7% after losing 4.3% on Wednesday.Cheaper prices at grocery stores can't be good news for restaurants either. Fast food prices have risen much faster than the cost of eating at home. Eateries may need to rein in menu prices to sustain customer traffic, but that could squeeze profit margins with labor costs rising from tighter job markets and higher minimum wages.Kelly, in the research note, said it was ""too early to call the bottom"" of the current price drop. And predictions across the industry vary.""I don't think any of these grocery stores or any of these guys have any better idea than we do,"" Yarbrough said. ""I think they're just speculating, and I think of it may be wishful thinking.""RELATED:Tractor Supply Crashes, But Sell Signals Were Already ClearFast Food Prices Have Never Risen So Fast Vs.

The forecast was below Wall Street's expectations for $2.21.And management said they've seen a ""gradual tightening of budgets"" among consumers and that customers have told the company they expect the economy to get worse over the next three months.Those remarks came as some observers see similarities to the drop in food prices in 2009, when the U.S. was still shedding jobs and feeling the aftereffects of a housing bust. Kroger noted that the economy then was more difficult than the one the nation has today, and the company stuck with its long-term EPS growth rate of 8%-11%.""We've been through periods like this before,"" CFO Mike Schlotman said on the company's earnings call.In the aftermath of the recession, however, Kroger's stock was a laggard, essentially moving sideways from February 2009 to September 2012 while the overall market shot up during that period.This time around, the oversupply and resulting drop in beef, poultry and dairy prices has been driven by several factors. Among them: the natural supply cycle in beef; a massive rebound in poultry and egg production following last year's Avian flu that has overshot demand; the stronger dollar and general weaker demand for dairy in Asia. Grocery stores have cut prices to rid themselves of items more quickly, spurring cuts from rivals.Kroger, which operates chains like Ralphs and Food 4 Less, earned 47 cents a share for its fiscal second quarter, up 7%, topping estimates for 45 cents. Revenue rose 4% to $26.6 billion, just below Wall Street forecasts for $26.7 billion. Same-store sales excluding fuel rose 1.7%.The company also cut its expected capital investments, excluding mergers and other costs, to $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for the year, down from an earlier outlook for $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion. That cut would likely ""be viewed positively,"" BMO Capital Markets said in a research note.Shares closed up 0.6% at 31.51 in the stock market today, amid the worst market sell-off since the Brexit vote.

However, Papa John's is nearing a buy point. See why stocks like Papa John's and Domino's Pizza are rising above rival restaurants. Kroger sees same-store sales growth for the rest of the year at 0.5%-1.5%, or 1.4%-1.8% for the full year. The company sees tough same-store-sales comparisons for the third quarter, but added that it was too early to get a better read on the trends.""While expectations were increasingly lower into the quarter in recent weeks as other food retailers have more drastically cut guidance on the heels of accelerating deflation, we think these results may not be as bad as feared,"" BMO analyst Kelly Bania wrote in the firm's research note.""However,"" she added, ""given our expectation for deflation to accelerate in the Fall and linger into the 1H17, we believe the question going forward will be, 'Is it conservative enough given low visibility?'

Adjusted EPS will be $1-$1.05 vs. its old range of 85-90 cents and analyst estimates of 90 cents. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 33%, versus the old forecast of 32%, due to the improved mix and pricing.

The annual rate rose partly because a weak year-earlier reading, when Verizon (VZ) shifted to unlimited data plans, was dropped from the calculation.Overall CPI dipped 0.1% on the month, while the annual increase accelerated to 2.4%.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 10-year Treasury yield fell before the report and remained lower.The Fed is expected to hike rates three times this year, as the economy looks headed for relatively strong growth and the jobless rate could sink to a multidecade low. Fed policymakers expect that wage pressures will rise as unemployment falls, with companies on passing some of their higher labor costs via price increases.Last week, the Labor Department reported that average hourly wage inflation ticked up to 2.7% in March after February's surprisingly soft reading. Faster wage growth is just beginning to show up after recent wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), Bank of America (BAC) and dozens of others.Kroger (KR) from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods face fierce competition.

75,KR,"The favored Fed inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 0.2% on the month and 1.6% from a year ago in February, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.Core inflation came in a tad hotter than the 1.5% annual rate expected. Including food and energy prices, the PCE price index rose 0.2% on the month and 1.8% from a year ago vs. expectations of 0.2% and 1.7% increases.After the report, Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index futures rose a little more, while the 10-year Treasury yield was little changed around 2.77%.If the inflation data stay tame, and core PCE inflation remains well below the Fed's 2% inflation target, the U.S. central bank probably won't hike its key interest rate four times this year. At last week's Fed meeting, policymakers' projections saw core inflation rising to 1.9% this year as the Fed hikes three times.Policymakers are getting more confident that inflation will start to firm. Their projections point to 2.1% core inflation in 2019, just above their target.The Fed still believes in the Phillips curve, which predicts rising wage growth as unemployment falls. Before too long, wage pressures put upward pressure on consumer prices.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February. But faster wage growth should begin to show up this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX) that didn't happen soon enough for the latest jobs report.As those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. Earlier this month, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Still, inflation is likely to remain near the top of investors' concerns this year. Fed policymakers expect to hike rates another three times in 2019 and two more in 2020, which is far more than financial markets think can or should happen.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchWill Techs Drive Stock Market Into Bear Territory?

76,KR,"Roadie — a startup that gets everyday folks to deliver packages while on their way to wherever they're already driving — has notched a lot of oddball same-day delivery jobs that Amazon (AMZN) doesn't do. A glass aquarium from Fountain Valley to Long Beach, Calif. A set of keys to someone locked out of her house in Georgia at 2 a.m. A box of trial evidence from San Francisco to Napa in time for a panicked lawyer's court date.Around 80%-85% of its shipments are same-day affairs, fueled partly by individuals with curious packages, but mostly by bigger businesses. And Roadie, which provides Kroger (KR) grocery delivery in select areas and brings lost luggage to Delta Air Lines (DAL) customers in about 40 markets, is not alone.Roadie rivals Instacart and Deliv have separately joined forces with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Kroger, Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY) on same-day shipping. Target (TGT) even went so far as to acquire Shipt for $550 million. The bull's-eye is ""becoming the first retailer to offer same-day delivery nationwide,"" said Target CEO Brian Cornell last month at retail conference Shoptalk.The driving force behind this latest retail trend, as ever, is Amazon. Its Prime same-day delivery service follows a free-shipping perk that is now a de facto requirement for online shopping. But after scrambling to catch up to Amazon on free shipping, these old brick-and-mortar titans are rushing to stay ahead of the e-commerce giant on same-day delivery. And this next online battleground might actually tilt in their favor, some analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeedy delivery doesn't come cheap. Customers could pay anywhere from $5.99 to $9.99 per shipment for the pleasure. But demand continues to mount, which makes it ""absolutely essential"" for retailers in order to compete in this ""instant-gratification economy,"" said Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins, who thinks one-hour delivery might be the next goal. ""People want to see a package on their door when they return from work.""As President Trump continues tweeting his rage at Amazon on a near-daily basis over its use of the U.S. Postal Service, it's the Shipts and Instacarts and Delivs (not to mention the Postmates and DoorDashes in food delivery) that are harvesting this ripe market. And they may not even emerge as the biggest winners. Instead, logistics giants like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) have the scale and infrastructure to capture at least 80% of the future same-day delivery market, a 2017 McKinsey report noted.To a physical store, looking to a web-based firm to hurry along online orders might seem like hastening one's own demise.But the McKinsey report called same-day a ""$200 billion opportunity for retailers in Europe and North America over the next decade."" And it pinpointed brick-and-mortar stores as potentially recapturing turf from online pure plays.The firm said that only traditional retailers ""have the dense network of physical stores to support same-day order fulfillment and delivery.""Perhaps surprisingly, that dinosaur of retail — shopping malls! — is also poised to benefit from the interest in same-day delivery.Daphne Carmeli, CEO of delivery startup Deliv, had an aha! moment when she realized that this could offer shopping centers a ""line of sight ... into e-commerce revenue"" that they wouldn't otherwise have.If you live in Palo Alto, Calif., and place an order on Macys.com, for example, that purchase is likely to be shipped out from a nonlocal distribution center in, say, Atlanta. In that scenario, only Macy's and UPS make money off that transaction.But if you place that online order through Deliv, and the nearby Stanford Shopping Center fulfills that order (and a few dozen others) from its own in-house Macy's, then the mall owner gets some of that revenue, because of the way that leases are structured.Malls ""make money on real estate and rent,"" said Carmeli, adding, ""the more sales the actual Macy's makes, the more the actual mall operator makes.""Which is why malls are willing to carve out parts of their own budgets to hire runners to fulfill Deliv orders. Deliv has partnered exclusively with — and has strategic investments from — major operators Simon Property Group (SPG), Westfield, General Growth Properties (GGP) and Macerich.Luckily for Deliv and its rivals, the technology to make same-day drop-offs happens to have come a long way since the early dot-com days. Deliv's Carmeli, whose company serves 1,400 cities across 35 U.S. markets, was once told her idea was the ""stupidest idea ever.""""Do you remember Webvan? Do you remember Kozmo? Do you remember all the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that were deployed to build up these companies that ended up exploding in colossal fashion?"" she recalls being asked.Deliv, like many of its peers, avoids being blown up by using modern-age technology to orchestrate an algorithmic symphony of scheduled pickups and drop-offs from nearly 150 retailers — including Macy's, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Sam's Club and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Express — straight to people's homes.Retailers nowadays have a better grip on inventory visibility, says Carmeli. And smartphones make it easy to crowdsource drivers.Her predecessors, like Leonardo da Vinci dreaming up helicopters in the early 1500s, tried to make same-day work on a mass scale before the right equipment existed.Boston Retail Partners analyst Scott Langdoc knows that serious pain. As a former C-suite exec at ""mini-Webvan"" delivery company PDQuick at the start of the new millennium, he says that Google Maps would have made all the difference.""If I had the tools that are available today, starting with Google Maps but fast-forwarding to the (artificial intelligence and machine learning) tools that are available today, it's amazing to think what I could've done at my scale or what Webvan or Kozmo could've done at their scale,"" he said.Like many of its peers of the time, PDQuick didn't survive. It was bought out and went back to its roots as a scaled-down SoCal neighborhood delivery service, Pink Dot.""What we'd intended to do before the 2001 implosion was basically do what Shipt did, which was to generalize the delivery and logistics capability for any retail platform so we could bring in inventory. A retailer brought in drivers and you would be able, based on location, to provide that capability,"" said Langdoc.""Fast forward 15 years, that is what Shipt is; that is what Instacart is.""That doesn't mean that same-day delivery is not without major challenges. It's expensive, for one. And as grocery delivery emerges as the next massive battleground, the stakes are being raised beyond mere speedy delivery of things like T-shirts, to more delicate items like yogurt and tomatoes.Even first movers are encountering issues.""It's not free and you can lose an awful lot of money trying to do it for free,"" said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. ""Amazon will approach $10 billion in absorbed delivery costs this year. There aren't a lot of companies that have the ability to absorb that, either from a financial flexibility perspective or shareholder patience.""That has bestowed upon Amazon a ""fairly significant advantage,"" he said.Still, other companies have advantages too. If any physical retailer could conceivably take on same-day delivery in-house, it's Walmart, say experts.So far, Walmart's grocery-delivery pilot employs its own trucks in just one of six test markets, Denver. It relies on Deliv in San Jose and on Uber in Dallas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa.The Bentonville, Ark.-based mega-retailer recently declared that over 40% of American households across more than 100 cities will have access to its online grocery delivery service by year-end. That effort is expected to add thousands more to its already 18,000-strong force of personal shoppers.On Tuesday, Walmart said it enlisted courier Postmates to deliver online grocery orders starting in Charlotte, N.C., before rolling out to other cities.""We know one thing's for sure: that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman told Investor's Business Daily in late January. The company filed to trademark grocery delivery-related ""Wam! by Walmart"" earlier in the year, which Blakeman confirmed is associated with active, ongoing projects.Still, even as analysts agree that same-day shipping, including grocery delivery, has to be an option for shoppers now, some question if the effort is worth it.""In this arms race to provide faster delivery, are you providing too many resources to a very small niche product, or a small niche customer base?"" asked Moody's O'Shea.There are more households in America that make less than $30,000 a year than more than $100,000, he said. So the idea of same-day, for most products, isn't hugely compelling at current price points.""I would not say that the demand is minimal, it just has a definite ceiling — at least as far as the pricing stays where it is,"" echoed Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett.And if you're wondering whether same-day delivery could ever scale up and reach rural settings, the answer is: ""No way,"" he said, laughing.""Simply put, that's not going to happen,"" said Barrett. ""We have seen traditional grocery stores struggle to sustain enough traffic to justify real estate and actual brick and mortar, let alone expensive delivery, let alone even more expensive same-day delivery.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

Odds of four Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, one more than expected, eased to about 26% after the report, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Average hourly wages rose 8 cents to $26.82 an hour, lifting the annual gain to 2.7%, in line with expectations.Wall Street economists expected a 175,000 job gain, 4.0% unemployment and 2.7% average wage growth.Still, job growth has averaged a solid 202,000 the past three months, including revisions. A balmy February likely shifted some seasonal job employment forward, depressing March job creation.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit, pointed out that jobless rate actually did decline in March — if you don't round to the tenths — from 4.14% to 4.07%. Over the past 12 months, the labor force has increased by 125,000 per month, on average, well below the pace of job creation. ""Looking forward, we continue to expect the jobless rate to fall towards 3.5% by the end of the year.""Employers also have been increasing work hours, further evidence of less slack. On a weekly basis, the average wage rose 3.3% from a year ago in March, the best gain in seven years.Investors should expect the improvement in hourly wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Second, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes. Before its pay hike announced in January 2018, Walmart hadn't raised its base wage in nearly three years. That's a big deal. When Walmart hiked its minimum wage for all current associates to $10 an hour in February 2016, that wage hike was contagious.Walmart is big enough to put upward pressure on wages for other employers. Target and Costco (COST) were among those who quickly hiked pay shortly after that 2016 move. Average hourly earnings growth rose to 2.8% that July before momentum flagged.Walmart's 2016 wage hike came when the jobless rate was nearly 5%. Now it's around 4%, so competition for workers has intensified. At least for workers on the lower end of the wage spectrum, pay hikes appear to be broad-based. Starbucks (SBUX), Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all have said they're raising pay. Meanwhile, dozens of banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hiked their minimum wage to $15 an hour for tellers.As wage gains accelerate and the jobless rate moves below 4% in coming months, Fed policymakers may lean toward four interest-rate hikes in 2018, not just three. Fed models assume that inflation will follow wage growth higher. There's reason to be skeptical. For example, Kroger said last month that it will use the bulk of its tax cut to offset the cost of higher wages and lower prices. The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The Big Picture: Here's The Problem With The Stock Market RallyThis Defense Giant Breaks Out As 4 Peers Target Buy Points: Investing Action PlanHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

80,KR,"What sort of supermarket-domination plans does Amazon (AMZN) have in store now that it owns Whole Foods Market? Here's a big one: Prime members who live in Austin, Texas, Cincinnati, Dallas and Virginia Beach, Va., can now get Whole Foods Market groceries delivered to their doors in just two hours.X The e-commerce behemoth, which announced the rollout Wednesday night, said fresh produce, meat, dairy, seafood, certain alcohol products and other Whole Foods items are available for home delivery — for free — through Prime Now's site and app. (For a fee of $7.99, on orders of $35 or more, one-hour delivery is available.) The service will expand to more American cities this year.Not long after its $13.7 billion takeover of the high-end grocer last June, Amazon was quick to cut product prices and erect Echo sales displays in Whole Foods stores. It is currently working on integrating Prime into Whole Foods' point-of-sale system; the membership program will become Whole Foods' rewards system.Supermarket giant Kroger (KR) delivers groceries through Instacart, ClickList and other services.

The deal was announced in a regulatory filing Tuesday that didn't include terms. Green Chef is expected to contribute about $15 million in quarterly revenue, starting in the second quarter, according to the filing.HelloFresh, which is the largest meal kit company in the world and ranks second in the key U.S. market, saw sales gain more than 50% last year to about $1.1 billion.

The company generates more than 60% of its revenue in the U.S. Privately held Green Chef is based in Boulder, Colo.The meal kit industry has been dogged by concerns since the troubled public offering from New York-based Blue Apron, which has seen its shares plunge since the stock debuted at $10. The shares have been battered by Amazon.com (AMZN) push into the grocery industry and concerns about the subscription meal-kit model.Blue Apron recently said it wants to start selling meal kits in brick-and-mortar stores, part of a broader trend of conventional retailers getting into the business in response to shifting shopping habits.

Smucker Co. (SJM), ConAgra (CAG) and Mondelez (MDLZ). Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup hit the sector last month on their weak quarterly reports.Shares of General Mills plunged 8.85% to 45.51 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest level in nearly five years.

Natural, wholesome and premium fare is in demand in pet food, as in human food, according to General Mills.Packaged food is under strain as private-label house brands as well as organic and natural offerings displace mainstream products on grocery shelves at the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Whole Foods.Walmart is General Mills' biggest customer, accounting for some 20% of sales.Packaged food companies have responded with cost cuts, including on marketing, to preserve profit margins, but that strategy is running out of steam.

83,KR,"Walmart (WMT) remains tight-lipped about its recent grocery- and home delivery-related trademark, ""Wam! by Walmart,"" but the active application is associated with ongoing projects, Investor's Business Daily learned from a Walmart spokesperson.X ""Wam!"" is described in the mega-retailer's U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filing as ""retail and online grocery store services featuring home delivery service."" Though Walmart would not say more at this time, the trademark comes as Amazon (AMZN), Kroger (KR) and Target (TGT) are all hustling to innovate on the grocery front, and as a growing number of shoppers take interest in home delivery of fresh food and consumables.Walmart is currently pilot-testing fresh grocery delivery in six markets, via several couriers: Deliv in San Jose; Uber in Phoenix, Tampa, Orlando and Dallas; and in-house trucks in Denver. (The company no longer works with Lyft on grocery delivery, it said.) The pilot program is meant to provide insights into the process — presumably so Walmart can later figure out how to best scale up operations.""We know one thing's for sure, that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" said Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman. ""And you're going to hear more from us this year on delivery.""In those half dozen cities, Walmart shoppers can have groceries dropped off at their doorstep in as soon as four hours, or as far away as six days in the future. More than 1,100 Walmart locations across the country also offer online grocery pickup.Battling for customer dollars isn't easy. The already-low-margin supermarket sector now has to contend with a click-happy consumer environment in which speedy delivery and in-store tech savvy is increasingly an expectation, and not a bonus feature.A not-insignificant part of Walmart's recent progress in the e-commerce space has come through acquisition, most notably its 2016 buyout of Jet.com, a smaller Amazon rival that sells food and household products. In October, New York-based same-day grocery delivery startup Parcel became part of Walmart, the nation's biggest retail chain.Walmart also has an active job listing for a Design Director, Grocery, a senior-level role that ""establishes and drives the overall strategy for design and execution of our e-commerce properties,"" per the posting.Kroger, which delivers groceries through services such as Instacart, said Wednesday that it is rolling out a ""Scan, Bag, Go"" feature at 400 locations. The technology, which allows in-store customers to scan and bag products using an app or wireless scanner in order to expedite the shopping and checkout process, sounds similar to Walmart's version of the feature.Walmart said just a few weeks ago that it is expanding its test of the ""Scan & Go"" app to 100 more stores, on top of the Dallas-Fort Worth, Orlando and Northwest Arkansas markets it is already available in.And Amazon, of course, debuted its cashierless, cash-free Amazon Go store last week to much fanfare. Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition last year adds fewer than 500 physical grocery stores to its arsenal, a small presence compared to Walmart and Kroger, but the integration has meant that Amazon Prime members can order Whole Foods products through the e-commerce titan. On the flip side, the company has reportedly scaled back its Amazon Fresh grocery delivery presence.Target, which delivers groceries via Instacart, announced last month the acquisition of grocery delivery service Shipt. The big-box retailer plans to roll out same-day delivery to half of Target stores — an effort that will include groceries — this calendar year.Walmart slipped 1% in the stock market today.

90,KR,"The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, the Labor Department said on Friday.X Average hourly wages rose 4 cents to $26.75 an hour, up a tame 2.6% from a year earlier. That missed consensus expectations of 2.9% rise. January's wage gain, originally reported as a 2.9% rise, was revised down to 2.8%.Wall Street expected a gain of 205,000 jobs and 4.0% jobless rate.December and January payrolls were revised up by a combined 54,000.After the jobs report, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures moved significantly higher on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index, which closed a point below its 50-day moving average on Thursday, reclaimed that key level at Friday's open.The 10-year Treasury yield rose a few basis points to 2.9% but the jobs and wage data didn't substantially bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to add an extra interest-rate hike in 2018.Despite the blowout jobs number, the data may give stocks a tad more running room before Fed hike expectations begin to bite, but investors shouldn't take too much comfort.While the data don't show that Goldilocks-type wage gains are history, bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which don't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The retail sector added 50,000 jobs, while construction employment surged 61,000 and manufacturers hired a net 31,000.The likely combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018.

94,KR,"Grocery giant Kroger (KR) and China e-commerce heavyweight Alibaba (BABA) have recently chatted about potentially working together, according to multiple reports. The talks are happening as stores continue to eye Amazon's (AMZN) moves in the food space following its multibillion-dollar acquisition of Whole Foods Markets last year and its debut this week of cashier-less convenience-store concept Amazon Go.X The discussions were in the early stage, said Reuters, and will not necessarily result in a deal. According to the New York Post, which first reported the news, senior execs on both sides met in China last month. Alibaba has reportedly been expanding the store count of its Hema supermarkets in the country.The Kroger-Alibaba news follows last week's report that Kroger was mulling a bid to acquire online home goods seller Overstock (OSTK), which would bolster its e-commerce operations and expand its presence in the home-furnishings market.Kroger, which operates 2,790 stores under the Food4less, Fred Meyer, Harris Teeter and Ralphs names among others, is also said to be in advanced talks to acquire Boxed.com, a wholesale e-tailer that has earned the moniker ""Costco for millennials.""Despite Amazon's smaller presence on the grocery front — there are fewer than 500 Whole Foods stores and only one Amazon Go — Wall Street is keenly aware of the online retailer's disruptive potential. After the takeover, Amazon was quick to cut prices at the upscale grocery store, offer Whole Foods products on Amazon.com and install Echo displays in Whole Foods stores.Kroger shares closed up 2.65% at 30.26 in the stock market today, finally retaking the 30 price level for the first time since Amazon first made its bombshell acquisition announcement last June. Alibaba rallied 1.4%, and Amazon added 1.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now?

95,KR,"Art instructor and mother of three Amy Frankson has cut back on her trips to Pavilions supermarket from three times a week to maybe three times a month. For the most part, her groceries — including perishables like eggs and milk — are now dropped off at her doorstep in green totes marked ""AmazonFresh.""Her household used to rack up about $300 in weekly supermarket receipts from Pavilions, a Safeway chain. Now Frankson's family spends about $200 a week on groceries, and buys an estimated 85% from the Amazon's fresh-grocery home-delivery service. There's also the convenience factor.""If I order it in the morning, it could be there by dinner time,"" she said from her home in Newport Beach, Calif.Shoppers like Frankson have Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and others scrambling to get ahead of Amazon (AMZN). The e-commerce giant has swallowed up segment after segment of the retail business and spit out bookstores, electronics retailers and clothing chains along the way. Now Amazon hungers to pile groceries onto its plate.And millennials, who are finally starting to form their own households, could accelerate Amazon's push into refrigerators around the world.In fact, even as Amazon rolls out new shows on its streaming video service and new gadgets with artificial intelligence, some analysts believe everyday groceries could deliver the biggest boost to its revenue.Amazon shares have pulled back a bit after hitting new highs earlier this month but were up 0.1% at 744.86 Friday. The stock is up 10% so far for 2016, compared with the S&P 500's 6% year-to-date gain.Wal-Mart rose 3 cents to 73.55 on Friday, and Kroger edged up 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon's earnings report next week could propel the stock even higher. Here is how investors could have approached Amazon's earlier run-up and why the lowest stock price isn't always the best.For now, Amazon controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart, including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to a March analysis from Cowen analysts John Blackledge and Oliver Chen. Kroger's 9% market share puts it at a distant second, and Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix round out the top five with low- to mid-single-digit shares apiece.But when it comes to online grocery sales, Amazon is already No. 1, bagging a 22% share in 2015 vs. Wal-Mart's 13%.First tested in Seattle almost a decade ago, AmazonFresh has quietly popped up since then in about a dozen cities along the coasts. They include Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Baltimore and New York.A new offensive has brought Fresh back into public focus. The service recently launched in Boston and across the pond in London.An Amazon spokesperson said the company does not comment on its product roadmap.""We're branching out as fast as we can while being careful not to sacrifice the quality and convenience our customers expect from AmazonFresh,"" says Amazon's help page.To shop on AmazonFresh, customers have to sign up for Prime Fresh, a higher-tier Prime membership that costs $299 annually. At $200 more than a regular Prime subscription, the service isn't exactly cheap, but Frankson said it ""definitely pays for itself.""Gen Xers like Frankson and her husband, Brian Mackerer, both 42, are contributing to growing online-grocery penetration. According to a recent Cowen analysis, 16% of surveyed 35- to 44-year-olds used such a service in February. As for millennials, the firm found that 21% of 25- to 34-year-olds had bought groceries online, with 28% pegged as ""likely future buyers.""""Particularly with a younger generation, there's no desire to drive to a store and push a cart down an aisle and load heavy items and stand in line at checkout and then throw stuff in your trunk or in bags on the bus or whatever and take it home, when there are other more convenient options,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian told IBD.Fellow tech titan Alphabet, meanwhile, has taken a different route with its Google Express service, positioning itself as a courier between residents and nearby stores like Target (TGT), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), rather than a direct competitor.Google Express memberships cost $95 a year or $10 a month; nonmembers are charged $4.99 per delivery. It's available in a sprinkling of cities across the country. Cold grocery delivery is only featured in parts of Los Angeles and San Francisco.Perhaps mercifully for legacy players with established supplier relationships and infrastructure, the complex fulfillment strategy associated with fresh food is slowing down Amazon's grocery takeover.Handling produce and perishables is a whole different animal at an Amazon fulfillment center. There are temperature checks, quality requirements and inspections, according to an MIT report cited in Cowen's analysis. Plus, just like at the supermarket, bags have to be packed with extra care to ensure that berries are not smashed and eggs aren't cracked.Why bother with a low-margin business that has difficult logistics?Because people go grocery shopping about four to five times a month, and the added operating income dollars outweigh the unattractive margins, say Blackledge and Chen. Plus, it lures shoppers into Amazon's Prime ecosystem.""For (Amazon), we think the purchase frequency fits well with the Prime value proposition and the incremental operating-income (dollars) offset the low-margin profile,"" they wrote, adding that Amazon will benefit from scale and logistics expertise, among other things.That should translate to billions more dollars at the top line. The Cowen analysts estimate the U.S. food and drink market is Amazon's ""biggest category for upside impact to revenue and/or"" gross merchandise volume. They see the company's grocery volume shooting up to $23.2 billion five years from now from an estimated $8.7 billion this year.Of the additional spending that goes to online food and beverage sales in the U.S. from 2016 to 2021, Blackledge and Chen think Amazon alone will capture 38% -- and that's a conservative forecast.Longtime food suppliers to grocery stores are expected to hop on board the Amazon train as shopping habits shift, margins be damned.""At this point, a lot of suppliers realize Amazon is absolutely a must — a channel they have to be on, even if it comes at the expense of their margins,"" said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. ""The amount of velocity and product sales you're going to get through Amazon, you absolutely have to be a partner in some way.""When it comes to online grocery shopping, traditional grocery bigwigs are throwing everything to the wall to see what sticks, including partnerships with last-mile delivery services like Instacart or features such as in-store pickup.""It's very clear that all of those players are looking for a solution,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton. But which solution works best is still a mystery.Target (TGT) has been testing online grocery delivery in Minneapolis. Kroger shoppers can use ClickList to order online and pick up in a store, or Vitacost.com to order health foods and vitamins for home delivery. Wal-Mart offers curbside delivery pickup in dozens of markets, and has plans to expand.Of the major players, market leader Wal-Mart ""appears to be the farthest along with future-proofing, in our view, with online grocery pickup up in 20 markets now and adding an additional 22 this year,"" according to the Cowen report. It noted that Wal-Mart sees online grocery pickup as a ""key growth strategy"" for its U.S. stores and online business in fiscal 2017 and beyond.At a Deutsche Bank consumer conference in mid-June, Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs sounded bullish on the company's online grocery prospects, while noting that its shoppers may in fact prefer in-store pickup over home delivery.""(Customers) like — while they're out — being able to come pick up their groceries,"" he said. ""So it's an area that will evolve a lot. We think we have a good competitive position where we're at, and I think it'll be a big part of our future.""Costco, on the other hand, doesn't care for the ""order online, pick up in store"" model. Instacart and Google Express enable home delivery of certain perishables and other items, but Costco mostly wants customers to pay its warehouses a visit.""We don't want somebody to come by necessarily and pick it up,"" said CFO Richard Galanti during the company's Q2 earnings call in March. ""Maybe that would change if we were having minus-3% comps in our lives. So we want to do everything possible to get them in the store and not just come and pick something up. So I don't see that as being a strategic focus of ours, at least in the near term.""Whole Foods Market (WFM) has taken its relationship with Instacart up a notch. The specialty grocer announced in March that it would roll out in several new markets over the next year, in addition to the 17 metro areas that it already serves.But for Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and the like, AmazonFresh isn't the only worry.Meal-kit services like Blue Apron and HelloFresh, which deliver pre-measured ingredients along with a recipe, are a ""fast-growing market"" and an ""incremental headwind"" to the specialty grocery space, according to Naughton. He said 25% of people who say they shop primarily at specialty grocery stores have tried home-delivery meal kits.Indeed, Frankson said Blue Apron is ""eroding"" what is left of her family's need for Pavilions. She has also tried snack subscription box Graze, but said she was ""not crazy about all the snacks and they just piled up.""Amazon has its nose in that, too. Tyson Foods (TSN) will debut a meal-kit delivery service, Tyson Taste Makers, in partnership with AmazonFresh later this year.But for some people — and some foods — the in-store experience will continue to be essential.A Nielsen global study found that 61% of poll respondents think going to a supermarket is ""enjoyable and engaging,"" and 57% believe the act of grocery shopping is ""a fun day out for the family.""Plus, people get picky about their produce.""There's still an element of consumers wanting to touch and feel what they're buying,"" said Hottovy. ""I think that's still the biggest hurdle for them in becoming a major disruptive player.""Frankson, however, is ""very happy"" with AmazonFresh's produce.""They don't give me dodgy-looking avocados,"" she said.

97,KR,"Shares of Hain Celestial (HAIN) and Amplify Snack Brands (BETR) popped Thursday after France's Danone (DANOY) agreed to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), the owner of Silk soy milk, Horizon Organic and other brands, in a $10 billion deal. The companies valued the deal at $12.5 billion ""including debt and certain other WhiteWave liabilities,"" according to a press statement.Hain, the maker of Earth's Best baby food and shelf stable products, Celestial Seasonings herbal teas and other natural and organic food products, leapt 7.1% to 50.63 on the stock market today.Amplify, which specializes in GMO-free healthier snacks, rose 2% to 15.05. Intraday, the stock rose as high as 15.60, clearing a buy point at 15.14. Amplify came public at 18 last August.WhiteWave Foods stock shot up 18.55 to 56.23, hitting a record high.Like other small natural foods suppliers, Hain was hurt as large grocers such as Kroger (KR) moved into the space in recent years with their own brands of organic and natural foods, such as Kroger's Simple Truth line, making WhiteWave, Hain Celestial and other natural food companies more vulnerable to takeover.In addition, larger food companies like General Mills (GIS) have been buying small natural foods makers. General Mills gobbled up Annie's Homegrown, a maker of natural and organic pastas and other foods, in late 2014 for about $820 million cash. Kroger was down fractionally and General Mills edged up less than 1% early Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Food companies have fared better in recent weeks as investors have clamored for defensive plays. Pepsi (PEP) has hit a buy point after a glowing earnings report. Hain stock plunged 53% from an all-time high 70.65 set on Aug. 5 of last year to a 33.12 low in late January and then it turned up.Among other highly rated food companies, TreeHouse Foods (THS), a maker of healthy snacks, beverages and prepared meals, was up 0.8%. J&J Snack Foods (JJSF), which makes baked goods, frozen snacks and other foods, rose 0.2%.

98,KR,"Kroger (KR) will be one of the last big companies to announce quarterly financial results as earnings season winds down, and its stock price is up recently.The world's largest supermarket chain will announce its first-quarter results Thursday before the market opens. Consensus is for earnings to rise 9.5% to 69 cents a share. If Kroger tops earnings estimates, it would be for the eighth quarter in a row.The parent of its namesake stores, as well as Ralph's, Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less and other branded grocery chains, is projected to see revenue rise 5.5% to $34.88 billion.Pivotal Research said in a client note Friday that it's seen weaker consumer sentiment on Kroger this past quarter. The research firm cited ""decelerating top-line trends"" among other factors. Kroger's EPS growth over the last three quarters has decelerated from 26% to 23% and then to just 10% last quarter. Pivotal has a buy rating and 44 price target on Kroger.Still, Kroger shares have been on a roll lately, closing higher in 11 of their last 13 trading sessions. However, the stock, which rose above its 50-day line on June 6, closed down 1.8% the stock market today, finding support at its 50-day.Kroger continues to expand its Simple Truth natural and organic foods line, which as of late 2015 accounted for $11 billion in revenue. It's trying to counter intense competition in recent years from Whole Foods Market (WFM), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and others catering to the consumer trend toward fresher, more natural foods.Whole Foods Market in June 2015 debuted the 365 by Whole Foods Market store concept, which involves smaller, value-oriented stores targeting millennials.On May 25, Whole Foods opened its latest 365 store, a 28,000-square-foot outlet in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles. It plans to open 10 more by the end of 2017. Also last month, Kroger launched My 365, a digital loyalty program that gives customers up to 10% discounts.On June 1, Credit Suisse upgraded its rating on Whole Foods to outperform from neutral.Whole Foods Market shares fell 2.4 Monday. Sprouts Farmers Market dropped 1.9%.

99,KR,"Kroger (KR) fell short of fiscal-first-quarter sales forecasts, but more muted growth in costs helped earnings top estimates.The top U.S. supermarket chain's earnings per share minus one-time items rose 13% to 70 cents, beating consensus views by a penny. Sales rose 4.7% to $34.6 billion, boosted in part by its purchase of Roundy's for $866 million in December, but it missed forecasts for $34.8 billion as low gas prices weighed.Same-store sales, excluding fuel, climbed 2.4%, below the 2.5% gain that analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected.But the 3.5% growth in merchandising costs lagged the 4.7% sales gain, boosting Kroger's operating margin to 3.5% from 3.3%.Shares reversed lower, closing down 0.7% in the stock market today, after rising as much as 3.6% earlier. Kroger said full-year EPS will be between the low end and midpoint of its $2.19-$2.28 guidance due to ""current fuel margin trends."" The analyst consensus is $2.24.Kroger also reaffirmed its same-store sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, of 2.5%-3.5% for 2016.After consumer tastes began shifting to grocers such as Whole Foods Market (WFM) and Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Kroger has aggressively expanded its own natural and organic offerings. Whole Foods recently responded by launching its 365 By Whole Foods store concept, which features lower prices.Whole Foods Market dipped 0.3%, and Sprouts lost 0.1%. Discount grocer Supervalu (SVU) fell 1.5%.

103,KR,"The U.S. economy isn't growing like gangbusters. So how can you inject real zip into your business? Going international may sound impractical, but for Brian Levin's Perky Jerky meat snacks firm, the decision to cross the Pacific brought his company invaluable lessons -- and a real growth opportunity.Explore. In June, the Greenwood Village, Colo.-based company is set to be the first American enterprise to sell beef products in Japan following the end of a 13-year ban on imported meat items. (The ban was due to the global scare in the late 1990s and early 2000s over mad cow disease.) Perky Jerky will launch two flavors in 7-Eleven convenience stores across Tokyo, and Levin hopes to eventually grow that partnership across the country's 18,768 stores.The U.S. Department of Agriculture assisted Perky Jerky in attending trade shows and learning about the Japanese market. ""Their food safety standards are far higher than anything in the U.S., even in the 7-Eleven stores,"" Levin told IBD. ""It made us step up our game.""Learn from your best fans. Customer feedback convinced Levin to place a money-back guarantee on every package if a customer did not think it's the best-tasting. After millions of packages delivered, Levin says they've gotten just 50 inquiries. He put the nutritional info -- calories, total fat, sodium, protein, sugar -- on the front of each package, not back, because consumers want to know.Have patience. Levin worked two years on the Japan project. The time helped him appreciate how serious Japan's trading companies and retailers get about succeeding, once they get behind a product. ""Resist the temptation to be overly optimistic, and then anticipate time-to-market very conservatively. It's simply impossible to predict how long it will take to build the necessary relationships and establish the right network,"" Mona Pearl, author of ""Grow Globally,"" told IBD. ""You cannot put a time frame on building trust.""Meet ""face to face."" Relying on email and meetings online can magnify differences between cultures, Pearl notes. Do your homework in understanding those differences and avoid misunderstandings.Turn failure into progress. Tucson Tamale turned heads at this year's Expo West natural products expo in Anaheim, Calif., as a top maker of premium-quality corn tamales. In 2015 alone, the company rolled 1.25 million tamales, up from 200,000 in 2009. One lesson that owner Todd Martin learned: Never sacrifice quality over an order, no matter how large. Years ago, it hired a co-manufacturer to help fill an order for 40,000 tamales; the customer rejected the entire batch because a banned ingredient was used.Martin ultimately gained by forming strong internal review processes. ""Do not hesitate to make decisions,"" he said. ""You will make some bad decisions, sure, but the freedom you get from good decisions far outweighs the problems of bad decisions.""Don't overanalyze. Levin's former boss, Grey Goose vodka creator and billionaire Sidney Frank, taught him to sometimes go with your gut on a new product rather than spend millions on a market study by an outside firm. For instance, Perky Jerky's Jammin' Jamaican flavor came from Levin's experience with Caribbean jerk chicken at roadside stands in Jamaica. Kroger (KR) and Publix chains now sell it nationwide.Don't stand still. Older products can lose favor fast. ""The next generation does not trust legacy baby boomer brands,"" said Steve Hughes, head of Sunrise Strategic Partners, an equity owner in Perky Jerky. Why? The older brands ""do not reflect their passion for pure and simple ingredients,"" as well as a ""mission-driven and authentic back story.""Related: TV And Movie Characters Teach Leadership TraitsIntegrity And Trust Are At The Heart Of Great LeadershipLearn From Self-Made Billionaires To Reach The Top.

The S&P 500 lost 1.2% and the Dow 1.1%. The Federal Reserve took a more dovish stance on rate hikes, but was still more hawkish than markets.

Circuit, delivering a big win to the Federal Communications Commission, as well as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix.

106,KR,"As Whole Foods Market (WFM) gained popularity over the past decade or so, the chain also developed a reputation as a wallet-gouging food utopia exclusive only to moneyed bohemians.Sales and the stock price suffered, but investors can now scoop up shares on the cheap ahead of a likely recovery driven by lower prices, easier comparisons and other efforts to reclaim increasingly selective consumers from rivals, Credit Suisse said Wednesday in a research note.""We see a unique opportunity to own this leading specialty food player while still in the early stages of a repositioning that should reinvigorate growth,"" wrote analyst Credit Suisse Edward Kelly, who upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and raised the price target to 40 from 30.Whole Foods shares gapped up 4.9% in the stock market today, climbing their way through a consolidation base begun in December. The stock is now 3% below a 35.09 buy point.Whole Foods stock had plunged earlier, as more value-oriented competitors like Kroger (KR), Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST) stepped up their attempts to lure health-conscious but less-wealthy consumers with higher-quality products.But Credit Suisse said Whole Foods has focused more over the past year on cutting prices to repair its image -- an investment that has dragged profits but is poised to pay off in the quarters to come, as consumers gradually come around.Whole Foods this month also opened its first 365 by Whole Foods Market store in Los Angeles' boutique-ish, tattoo-and-beard-heavy Silver Lake neighborhood.Those smaller stores sell cheaper products, cost less to build, take up less real estate and make it easier to reach more customers.""The format allows WFM to reach markets where demographic constraints make its core stores uneconomical,"" Kelly wrote.Credit Suisse's note comes a week after a Retale survey found that only 8% of millennials would cut grocery spending amid economic uncertainty. BB&T Capital Markets last week said those findings were a good sign for higher-end grocery chains like Whole Foods and Sprouts (SFM), as well as chains like Kroger.Whole Foods' same-store sales appear to be close to a bottom, Credit Suisse's note said, adding that the company is heading into some easier year-over-year comparisons. Whole Foods last year suffered following allegations that it overcharged consumers in New York City. The company settled with the city for $500,000 in December following an investigation of the chain's prices.The company has also focused more on tech spending -- including the expansion of digital marketing, new point-of-sale systems and its loyalty program, the Credit Suisse note said. To fund cutting prices, the company also said it would trim $300 million in operating costs over two years, with much of it coming from salaries and benefits, while other adjustments to staff scheduling could help too, Kelly wrote.However, the note said, ""the company will need to be careful since high service is a key differentiator."" The in-store experience also helps mitigate the need for Whole Foods to cut prices even more.""Pricing is the company's biggest problem,"" Kelly wrote, ""but the company does not need to be in-line with peers to be successful, in our view, given its significantly better shopping experience.""

108,KR,"A major expansion by Amazon.com (AMZN) into private-label goods, which could come this month, elevates its ability to further challenge legacy retailers across the board.Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates Amazon will be the No. 2 player in the $425 billion consumable market, excluding food and beverage, surpassing Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), CVS Health (CVS) and Target (TGT) but still lagging well behind market leader Wal-Mart (WMT).He defines consumables as four segments: personal care products, household products, baby products and pet products.Blackledge also estimates Amazon will be a top-10 player in the $785 billion food and beverage grocery market by 2019.“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption, given younger demos increasingly purchasing grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge wrote.The leader in the food and beverage category is Wal-Mart, followed by Kroger (KR), Albertsons/Safeway and Costco Wholesale (COST).Last week, the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying Amazon is set in the coming weeks to roll out new lines of private-label brands that will include its first broad push into perishable foods.According to the Private Label Manufacturers Association, sales of private-label store brands in the U.S. topped $118 billion in 2015, with supermarkets and drug chains accounting for over $70 billion of the total.In the grocery and consumables market, Blackledge says, Amazon’s growth has come at the expense of Wal-Mart, Target. Walgreens and CVS. Amazon’s key competitive advantage is its multiplatform approach with Amazon Prime, which includes same-day delivery for many goods, “all of which should lead to rising number of consumers skipping the trip to the local supercenter, drug store or grocery market,” he wrote.Amazon has sold private-label products since 2009, primarily under the AmazonBasics brand, though that effort has concentrated largely on consumer electronics.Amazon stock rose 0.6% to 702.80 in the stock market today. Amazon stock hit an all-time high of 722.45 on May 12. It carries a strong IBD Composite Rating of 94, putting it among the top 6% of all stocks on key metrics such as revenue growth.Walgreens climbed 1.3% but CVS fell 1.5%. Target climbed 2.4%. Wal-Mart advanced 1%, hitting a nine-month high intraday, after spiking nearly 10% Thursday on strong earnings and same-store sales.

Maybe there’s a drive of a half-hour or more to Wal-Mart (WMT), then the epic journey across an airfield-sized parking lot and through a massive store to a long checkout line. But if you need just a few items for dinner that night,…

110,KR,"Kroger (KR), KKR (KKR) and TPG Capital were said to be vying for The Fresh Market (TFM), but Apollo Global Management (APO) will ultimately acquire the specialty grocery chain.Funds managed by Apollo affiliates will purchase The Fresh Market for $28.50 per share in cash, or about $1.36 billion, said Apollo and TFM in a joint statement. The offer represents a 24% premium over the grocer's Friday closing price. The acquisition follows the grocer's strategic and financial review of its company, which began last October.The Fresh Market's shares rocketed 23.5% to 28.39 in the stock market today, gapping up past their 200-day line. The stock had been trading above its 50-day line after popping 22% on Feb. 11 on reports that supermarket heavyweight Kroger was in talks to buy the 186-store grocery chain. Apollo, TPG and KKR were also said to be bidders in the auction at that time, according to Reuters.The deal is seen closing in the second quarter of 2016, pending certain conditions. The terms of the agreement allow the Fresh Market to actively seek out alternative proposals until April 1.""We believe there is a significant opportunity to enhance the brand, merchandise offering and price-value combination to make The Fresh Market a primary destination for food shoppers while at the same time being committed to social responsibility through partnerships with local vendors and communities,"" said Andrew Jhawar, the head of Apollo's retail and consumer division, in the announcement.Apollo shares rose 0.4% to 16.98. Kroger shares fell 0.7% to 38.39.RELATED:Kroger Gaps Below 50-Day, 200-Day On Q4 Sales Miss, But Guidance OKFresh Market Shares Soar On Report Of Kroger Buyout Talks

111,KR,"Recent consumer IPOs were a more fitness-focused bunch than those of years past and have largely outperformed new-issue cohorts, offering a clue into who the hot newcomers may be when the current IPO chill starts to gradually thaw.Of the 15 consumer companies that went public in 2015, over half of them were tied -- directly or indirectly -- to the health and wellness trend. The Class of 2015 included fitness tracker maker Fitbit (FIT), gym operator Planet Fitness (PLNT) and SkinnyPop popcorn maker Amplify Snack Brands (BETR).“If you add fast-casual to your list, a lot of these have a focus on health,” said Kathleen Smith, co-founder of IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. “It resonates. Some of it is that the younger people realize they’re going to live longer and if you’re going to live longer you’ve got to be healthy and eat well and exercise.”Next up could be SoulCycle, an upscale spin-studio operator with a celebrity following. The prospective IPO, a popular choice for hipsters and workout junkies looking for an Instagrammable workout, most recently took its rave-like studio classes to SXSW, hosting ""cardio parties"" in partnership with Spotify.Even Fido’s in on it. July IPO Blue Buffalo (BUFF), which makes natural dog and cat food, is an extension of the consumer demand for more health-conscious, less-processed fare. And on the tech side, Mindbody (MB) went public last June with its class-booking and appointment-scheduling software for gyms and spas.One could even include the outdoorsy Duluth Trading (DLTH), a clothing company that caters to the “modern, self-reliant American” with plaid shirts and waterproof cargo pants for those who live a “hands-on lifestyle.”As more companies sprout from the soil of demand for health-conscious products, many of them tap the IPO market to fund growth, said Smith. That includes Shake Shack (SHAK), the fast-casual purveyor of antibiotic-free and hormone-free Angus burgers that went public at the start of 2015, and David’s Tea (DTEA), the Canadian chain that offers over 150 types of tea -- and not a single espresso drink.While a number of them are trading below their IPO prices, their performance has outpaced that of last year's new issues.Of the 170 companies that went public in 2015, the average return has been a 19.6% decline as of Monday's close, according to Renaissance Capital. But shares of the 15 consumer IPOs from last year, which includes all of the above names except Mindbody, have experienced a collective rise of about 1.1%.Planet Fitness, which went public at 16 last August, is up 18% from the market's low point of Feb. 11 this year to 15.60 by Monday's close. Amplify, which priced at 18 less than a year ago, has rebounded 44% from Feb. 11 to 13.60. Blue Buffalo has leapt 60% to 24.77, above its initial offering of 20 a share.That compares to the S&P 500's 11% rise in the same period. And investors have shown an eagerness to hop on board, though not all stocks have been cooperating with hopes for a fitter future.Within a few months of trading, Shake Shack’s stock more than quadrupled to a high of 96.75, and Fitbit more than doubled from its initial offering price. But they collapsed soon after that. Shake Shack lost two-thirds of its value and Fitbit three-fourths. Both are essentially flat since Feb. 11.“The investor interest is very high in fitness (and) healthy eating, but I think people struggle with exactly how to play the trend, as it is really relatively broad-based,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton, who covers Planet Fitness, Amplify and other consumer stocks.Plus, recent market volatility has put a damper on enthusiasm for privately owned businesses looking to take to the market. Only seven companies have gone public this year, said Renaissance Capital's Smith, vs. 28 during the same time frame in 2015.SoulCycle filed last July to go public but has yet to start trading. The company declined to comment, as it remains in a quiet period.“I think, overall, (SoulCycle has) performed rather well,"" said Smith. ""It’s not like there isn’t competition in this area.""The New York City-based chain raked in $112 million in 2014 revenue from its 38 locations, growing sales by nearly 49% from the prior year.But if the current market rally continues, the window for IPO issuance might be on the verge of reopening, after closing in December.Smith predicts that investors will see a trickle of companies ready to start trading sometime in April. With it might come names like SoulCycle or Honest Company, the baby and home product company founded by actress Jessica Alba.“When the market opens up, it will not be a tsunami wave of IPOs,” said Smith. ""(It will be) slow, steady, below-average.""She expects that health care, technology and consumer companies will likely lead the new-issue market this year, with a similar health-bent possibly flowing throughout.""The SoulCycles and Honest Companies -- we'll see more of it,"" she said. ""(And) more fast casuals.""But as competition heats up, smaller companies riding the health and wellness trend -- newly public or not -- have to watch out for traditional heavyweights fighting back.Legacy names like General Mills (GIS), Kroger (KR) and Target (TGT) have have been adapting to the consumer shift toward natural and organic foods, putting pressure on the likes of Whole Foods Market (WFM), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and others.""Generally speaking, the better-for-you food players and the better-for-you grocery stores -- they’ve under-performed their traditional peers, really over the last eight months,"" said Piper Jaffray's Naughton.Image provided by Shutterstock.

112,KR,"Kroger (KR) stock fell 7% Thursday, breaking support at its 50-day, 100-day and 200-day lines as fourth-quarter revenue missed views.Earnings grew 10% to 57 cents a share, surpassing forecasts by three cents. But the company's total sales, including fuel and its Midwest-based Roundy's stores, rose almost 4% to $26.17 billion, not quite enough to top analyst estimates for $26.29 billion. Kroger acquired Roundy's late last year.During the quarter, same-supermarket sales -- minus fuel and Roundy's -- rose 3.9%, missing estimates.After breaking out of a flat base in early December, Kroger shares have been trading choppily around their 50-day line. After briefly retaking support last week, the shares fell past the other two key moving averages on the sales miss. Shares plunged more than 8% in the early going and were down more than 7% in recent action.Kroger expects full-year same-supermarket sales growth of 2.5%-3.5%, minus fuel. The company is targeting fiscal 2016 per-share earnings of $2.19-$2.28, the midpoint of which is a hair above current consensus views for $2.23 a share.BMO Capital Markets analyst Kelly Bania called the quarter ""disappointing"" but noted that full-year earnings guidance was ""solid."" She has an outperform rating on the stock.Kroger is said to be interested in acquiring 183-store specialty grocer The Fresh Market (TFM) and according to Reuters is in the second round of an auction process that also includes Apollo Global Management (APO), KKR (KKR) and TPG Capital as bidders.Peer Whole Foods Market (WFM) shares ended virtually flat.

113,KR,"Stock opened with mild losses Thursday as mixed economic data and quarterly reports stirred the bulk of early action.The S&P 500 fell 0.3% while the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 eased 0.2%.The stock market today sets out with both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 working on a third straight weekly advance and reaching to test resistance at their 200-day moving averages. The S&P 500 ended Wednesday 2% below that psychologically important line. The Nasdaq is still 4% below its 200-day mark.Thursday's heavy economic calendar opens with Challenger, Gray & Christmas reporting that employers cut 61,599 jobs in February. That was up 21.8% vs. year-ago levels, but down sharply from January's  spike to 75,115 layoffs. The energy industry accounted for more than 25,000 of the jobs lost and its cuts of 45,154 jobs this year are running 24% above the industry's cuts last year.Initial jobless claims climbed more than 2% to 278,000 in the week ended Feb. 27, the Labor Department said -- the opposite of economist consensus expectations for a dip to 270,000. The four-week moving average declined to 270,250, down for a fourth straight week.The Labor Department also revised its Q4 productivity estimate to -2.2%, improved from an initial -3% view.  That was better than expectations for a revision to -3.2%.

Intel (INTC) popped more than 2% to lead the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 after an upgrade to outperform from R.W. Baird. Boeing (BA) descended 0.9%, the widest loss among Dow stocks, on a Canaccord Genuity downgrade to hold from buy.Grocery chain Kroger (KR) shed 7%, the S&P 500's worst loss. It reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings, but revenue and same-store-comparisons both missed consensus projections. Kroger has been climbing the right side of a two-month consolidation.Leading stocks were generally quiet, with the exception of Smith & Wesson (SWHC), which fell 1% ahead of its earnings report after the close. The stock slipped nearly 2% in moderate trade Wednesday, a move too slight to dent its progress up the right side of a cup base. It ended Wednesday's session 5% below a 26.64 buy point.The worst loss among IBD 50 stocks in the early going was a 1% slip from Ryanair (RYAAY).

Joy Global (JOY) jumped 16% after the maker of mining equipment stuck to its forecast for the fiscal year ending in October. That overshadowed a 179% plunge in profit for the latest quarter, which was much worse than expected.Meanwhile, Kroger (KR) plunged 8%, slicing through its 50-day and 200-day lines, after the supermarket operator posted a less-than-expected 4% increase in quarterly sales, outweighing a better-than-expected 10% rise in profit.In the IBD 50, Prestige Brands (PBH), which markets personal-care products such as sore-throat drugs and household cleaners, climbed 2% as it makes progress toward a possible 54.35 buy point of a 14-week consolidation.On the downside, Universal Display (OLED) slipped more than 2% but was getting support at its 50-day moving average.

117,KR,"Kroger’s (KR) profit and revenue are both expected to grow about 4% when the supermarket heavyweight reports Thursday. A 4% rise would mark a pickup for revenue growth but a deceleration from seven prior consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings gains.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fourth-quarter per-share earnings of 54 cents on $26.27 billion in revenue. Earnings per share grew 23%, 26% and 15% in the three most recent quarters. The company has reported flat year-over-year revenue for two out of the last three quarters.Kroger shares have mostly been bobbing below their 50-day line since mid-January but found support Monday, and closed up 1.2% in the stock market today.The grocery-store chain is reportedly interested in acquiring The Fresh Market (TFM). According to Reuters, Kroger is a bidder in the second round of an auction process that also includes Apollo Global Management (APO), KKR (KKR) and TPG Capital.Shares of The Fresh Market, a chain of 183 specialty grocery stores, popped 22% on Feb. 11, when the news broke.

118,KR,"A company could be making many millions of dollars in sales, but if those sales don’t produce a profit, it does little good.Thus, for companies and investors, the amount of profit made from each dollar of sales is crucial. That’s called the profit margin, and it is a financial measurement as important as sales and profits.Obviously, the higher the margin, the better. If you can make 90 cents profit on every dollar of sales, you’re on your way to becoming a millionaire. If you make just a nickel per dollar, you’re having to sell massive amounts of inventory just to cover your costs.But how much is a good profit margin?It really depends on the company’s industry and its past performance.Margins will vary from industry to industry. For example, a top-notch software publisher could easily extract, say, 60 cents out of each dollar of sales. That’s especially feasible after development costs are paid for, and all the publisher has to do is just make more disks -- or put the program on the Internet and save even more on distribution.But retailers tend to have much smaller margins, because manufacturers often mark up merchandise to ensure their own healthy margins, and there are shipping, selling and operating costs for the store.So investors can’t just look up a number and judge the margin to be good or bad. They need to study the company’s market and compare the margin against those of competitors. They also should compare current margins to what they were over the past few years.That’s not to say a small-margin company can’t become a great stock. For example, grocery chain Kroger (KR) was a winning stock in 2014 and early 2015 while generating annual pretax margins of around 2%. Supermarket margins are notoriously tight. Yet the company’s push into organic foods proved to be a success.Sometimes, a company’s superior return on equity can offset weakness in profit margins. An ROE of at least 17% should be the minimum for a leading stock, and 25% or more is even better.Quarterly after-tax profit margins are important too, and more timely since they are measured on a three-month basis.In IBD, the annual pretax profit margin is shown on the table for the IBD 50 stocks published every Monday and Wednesday. It’s also on the Big Cap 20 table on Tuesdays.The SMR Rating (Sales + Margins + Return on Equity) incorporates the company’s margins and is available in the stock tables and other places in IBD.There’s a bit more detail at Investors.com, where the IBD Stock Checkup displays the annual pretax margin for each company you look up. The Checkup also provides a checklist with a color code for margins. Strong margins get a green dot, mediocre ones a yellow, and bad ones a red dot. This grading system does not take into account industry-specific factors.The pretax profit margin also appears in stock quotes at Investors.com.The table above lists companies with IBD Composite Ratings of at least 95 (a general definition of leading stocks) with pretax and after-tax profit margins of at least 20% in the most recently reported periods.Image provided by Shutterstock.

119,KR,"And on the fifth day we rested......After 4 days of an explosive rally - taking the Dow up 900+ pts or 5.8%, the S&P up 117 pts or 6% and the Nasdaq up 280 pts or 6.6% - the mkt took a breather...and this makes perfect sense...Stocks closed slightly lower yesterday after teasing with 1925 all morning.....unable to really break thru as investors/traders/analysts and strategists tried to make sense of what the Oil Freeze really means. What the commentary from the FED really means. What will Uncle Mario (Draghi) do now? Will the dollar back off? Will we see negative rates here at home? Etc.....Like I said yesterday - Bear mkt rallies tend to be swift, explosive and sometimes violent.....as the bull and bear thrash around - trying to take control.....and we can go from being way oversold - causing the sellers to back off to being way over bought causing the buyers to take a breather.....but this does not mean that this most recent rally is finished at all...it just means it is figuring it out...so a test of the descending 50 dma at 1960 is a reasonable assumption - I mean at some point - the mkt will have to test this resistance level to see exactly how much resistance there is....So - let's take a look - Yesterday - Wal-Mart (WMT) reported an 8% drop in profits, an 8% drop in income - and then they cut its sales forecast (again) citing store closures and dollar strength for this latest move - ....as they continue to compete against the likes of Amazon (AMZN), Kroger (KR), and other discount stores - now it wasn't all bad - they tried to sugar coat it by saying that they see underlying strength in the US and this is good - considering that they will be raising wages to $10/hr on Saturday for its 1 million employees....Just FYI - even at $10/h for a full 40 hr week - Wal-Mart is only paying that person $20,800/yr....a far cry from solid 'middle class' wages - but I suppose it is better than the $18,700 that they were earning.And Apple ( (AAPL))? Well that's a whole nother issue and there is no lack of commentary from both sides - but in the end - Tim Cook has to hold the line or risk leaving many to wonder if Apple is really just a gov't informant......now trust me - as someone that lived thru 911 and had an office on the 55th floor of tower 2 - I say - Hack the Phone on those bastards..... But I also understand the counter argument.....which leaves me with a pit in my stomach......What in the end is the RIGHT thing to do?Also - yesterday the Philly Fed Index (another read on regional manufacturing) came in at -2.8%. (A bit better than the -3% exp) but interestingly enough, the indexes for all business indicators showed lower readings than the prior month and it was only 1 index -- shipments index -- that showed improvement. February marked the 6th straight month that the general business activity index was below zero - and this my friends suggests that there is relentless pressure on regional manufacturing activity. This is not a bullish report....now it is not the end of the world - but it just continues to hammer home the difficulties that continue to haunt us.Traders took profits across a range of sectors yesterday -after the move higher...and for them - that makes sense...traders are NOT long term investors - so they need to create Alpha when then can and they do that by being strategic.In the end - none of the real worries that existed two weeks ago have really gone away. Investors are still worried about earnings and FED policy. Do not discount the Presidential election cycle - either - we are now moving into the time frame where even some of the stronger candidates will no longer be able to continue as national primaries take place. Next week - we get South Carolina and Nevada and then on March 1st we get Super Tuesday - which takes us from Alaska to Massachusetts with some 1585 delegates at stake across the two parties.By then - the field will start to really consolidate at least on the GOP side - Trump appears to be losing some appeal as Cruz runs right up his backside.....Rubio and Kasich jockeying for position........For the Democrats - they have a real problem on their hands....Hillary - the once anointed 'shoe -in' apparently maybe isn't so.....Which leads me to ask: Does the Democratic party really want Sanders as the candidate? (I mean really want him??) And the world turns...Overnight - Asian mkts closed lower .. Japan - 1.42%, Hong Kong - 0.40%, China - 0.10% and ASX - 0.79%.In Europe - Mkts there are also under pressure as they consolidate as well. Oil is a bit weaker this morning and the talking heads are blaming the mkts moves on oil's weakness despite talks between Putin and the Saudi's. But like we have been discussing - those talks have not produced anything new and Iran remains the key to whether the global production freeze will go into effect - and my sense is that it will not. FTSE -0.54%, CAC 40 -0.98%, DAX -1.08%, EUROSTOXX - 1.32%, SPAIN -1.9% and ITALY -1.77%.S&P futures are - 6 pts....as they consolidate. A test of 1900 on the downside is reasonable as consolidation continues.

122,KR,"Today's IBD 50 list, which pinpoints top-performing growth stocks, includes five that made the elite list, fell off and then climbed back aboard.They are Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Michael Kors (KORS), Five Below (FIVE), Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Smith & Wesson (SWHC).Here's a look at what's happened at these top performers that's put them back on the IBD 50.Natural and organic foods grocer Sprouts Farmers Market continues to rise on strong earnings growth while rivals Whole Foods Market (WFM) and The Fresh Market (TFM) saw lackluster growth last year amid rising competition from supermarket giant Kroger (KR), Amazon (AMZN) and others.On Feb. 25, Sprouts reported a 50% surge in Q4 earnings  and a 27% pop in revenue to $930.3 million. Both figures crushed analyst estimates.Meanwhile, reports that Kroger is looking to buy The Fresh Market have added to expectations of industry consolidation.Sprouts, which boasts a 98 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99, fell 1.6% Friday.The trendy Hong Kong-based maker of fashion clothes, footwear and accessories took the U.S. and Europe by storm a few years ago. Its stock price soared 405% from 20 at its initial public offering in December 2011 to an all-time high of 101.04 on Feb. 28, 2014, before it consolidated amid execution problems.In February, Kors had its biggest up week in four years on an earnings report that surprised Wall Street analysts.On Feb. 2, its stock shot up 24% and continued rising. Shares ended essentially flat Friday.Deep discount retailers such as Five Below, which sells preteen and teen products for $5 or less, along with Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG) and bulk discounter Big Lots (BIG), saw sales surge during and after the Great Recession, when people were pinching pennies.The trend among consumers to buy at discounts has lingered even as the recession has receded. On Wednesday, Five Below opened its first store in Miami, expanding its store count in the state to 17, with plans to open over 100 more in Florida.Five Below rose 2.8% to 38.77.The nation's largest firearms maker, Smith & Wesson, sees dramatic swings. The Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting in July 2012 and the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012 sent sales, profit and the stock soaring as fears of tougher laws sparked a rush to buy ahead of any legislative action.But demand waned as attempts in Congress to pass new gun limits failed, sending Smith & Wesson's stock tumbling.The mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., on Dec. 2 revived the gun debate and helped fiscal Q3 results top views late Thursday.Its stock cleared a cup-with-handle base on Friday, touching an all-time high at 27.99 before closing at 27.06, up 6.5% for the day.No. 2 U.S. firearms maker Sturm Ruger reported Q4 results last month that handily beat Wall Street forecasts.On a conference call with analysts, CEO Michael Fifer predicted a ramp-up in demand if Democrats take the White House and Senate, as the next president could get several opportunities to appoint new Supreme Court justices.Sturm Ruger shares closed up 5%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

123,KR,"Kroger (KR), the largest grocery chain in the U.S., is joining Walmart (WMT) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) in tightening gun restrictions following last month's school shooting in Parkland, Florida.X Kroger's Fred Meyer chain, which carries general merchandise in addition to groceries, will no longer sell firearms and ammunition to buyers under age 21, the company said on Thursday.""In response to the tragic events in Parkland and elsewhere, we've taken a hard look at our policies and procedures for firearm sales,"" Kristal Howard, a spokeswoman for the retailer, said in an email. ""Recent events demonstrate the need for additional action on the part of responsible gun retailers.""Kroger's decision comes after Dick's and Walmart announced on Wednesday that they would both increase the purchasing age of firearms to 21. Dick's said it would stop selling assault rifles altogether, which Walmart has not done since 2015. In addition to increasing the age to purchase guns and ammunition, Walmart said it would stop the sale of items ""resembling assault-style rifles,"" such as airsoft guns and toys.""We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms,"" Walmart said in a statement posted on its website Wednesday evening. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based chain said it requires ""customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm.""Dick's said it would stop selling assault rifles like the one used in the Parkland, Florida high school massacre on Feb. 14. Walmart stopped selling them in 2015, citing slow sales.The decision by America's largest retailer is the latest by companies re-evaluating their relationship with the firearms industry. Last week, MetLife (MET), Symantec (SYMC), and Enterprise said they would no longer offer discounts to members of the National Rifle Association. Delta Air Lines (DAL) parted ways with the NRA too, spurring Georgia Republicans to oppose a planned $50 million tax break for the Atlanta-based carrier.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech Report""American voters and companies are waking up to the scope of our nation's gun violence crisis.

Wal-Mart also offers in-store pickup for online grocery orders, and is tooling around with avant-garde concepts such as ""in-fridge delivery,"" which allows delivery drivers to ostensibly place groceries directly inside customers' refrigerators at home, using smart-home technology.Last month, the megastore even announced a partnership with BuzzFeed's social food network Tasty, prompting users to purchase Walmart.com and Jet.com products — frying pans and the like — directly from recipes in Tasty's app. The team-up will soon integrate Wal-Mart's online grocery services into the app.IBD'S TAKE: What does retail look like in 2018? Well, for one thing, the whole ""death of the mall"" narrative might be a bit exaggerated.

That was the gauge's first decline since October 2013, with the drop putting it below the 50 level which divides expansion from contraction.The services gauge from the Institute for Supply Management was less gloomy, easing to 53.4 from January's 53.5 tally.

129,KR,"With events such as Apple's (AAPL) recent wrangling with the feds pushing the issue of digital security to the forefront, it's no wonder payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) is growing more prominent in the ongoing battle against cybercriminals.The No. 2 company in its field by volume, Vantiv continues to reap the rewards of merchants' and financial institutions' move to chip cards and their corresponding terminals. Its suite of other cybersecurity products continues to play a key role in the company's upward climb.Vantiv processed $842 billion in transactions last year, and this is showing up in the company's numbers. Fourth-quarter results surpassed analyst estimates as adjusted earnings jumped 23% to 65 cents a share, marking a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Net revenue increased 13% to $453 million.“Vantiv has strong secular tailwinds, in our view, spanning digital payments, security, software and e-commerce with little exposure to macro headwinds like (currency exchange), gas, regulation, credit or discretionary spending,” Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck said in a recent note to clients. He also notes that Vantiv has ""above-average industry growth.""Vantiv can thank a number of entities for lifting awareness of cybersecurity, with the most recent example being Apple. The tech behemoth brought the issue of smartphone security front and center in recent days with its controversial refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that could contain terrorism evidence. The company says it wants to protect customer privacy.Cyberhacks have also struck customer databases at such merchants as Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) in recent years, and the threat they'll keep scouring the Internet for further vulnerability persists.One relatively new security measure in the U.S. payments space is that of chip cards and terminals known as EMV. Named for the three consumer credit companies that originated the technology -- Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) -- EMV uses a chip embedded in the card, rather than the traditional black strip, in an attempt to process payments in a much more secure way.The card-and-terminal upgrade cycle is driving significant growth for Vantiv, which plays on both sides of the equation. Some 80% of the company’s revenue comes from merchants, via the sale of new terminals, as well as other e-commerce, mobile, compliance and data analytics products. Clients include Macy's (M), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Kroger (KR) and the U.S. Postal Service.The other 20% comes from financial institutions, with Vantiv behind the reissuance of the cards that contain EMV chips. Partners include Comerica Bank (CMA), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One Financial (COF).Fortunately for Vantiv, the EMV upgrade cycle has a long way to go. Vantiv said last month during its fourth-quarter earnings call that, as of the end of 2015, more than two-thirds of the terminals of its merchant clients still needed to be upgraded. And more than half the debit cards of its bank clients still needed to be reissued as chip cards.""Some 15% of Vantiv's merchant transactions are chip-on-chip, meaning a chip card used by a consumer at a merchant that has a chip terminal,"" Beck told IBD. ""That gives you a sense that we're still pretty early, and my view is that this a multiyear cycle for Vantiv.""Further, the urgency for financial institutions and merchants to convert is growing. October 2015 marked a shift in liability to whichever party -- card issuers or merchants handling payments -- has the weaker technology. Prior to that, the card issuers were primarily responsible for cyber fraud liability.The company expects to see continued growth from EMV-related sales at least through early 2017, with an even longer tail from smaller clients on the merchant side, according to Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker.""On the financial institution side, we're seeing the large banks adopt fast and reissue the cards,"" Drucker told IBD. ""The mid-size banks, as you pull into early 2017, you're going to see a lot of the cards out there with chips in them.""Along with upgrades, Vantiv is helping guide clients through the ever-changing regulatory environment, Drucker says. And its large clients are implementing Vantiv’s entire security suite, including end-to-end encryption and tokenization, a process that removes the credit card number completely from the retailer’s system.Beyond that, a number of merchants are buying terminals that also have near-field communication, or NFC, technology, which enables payments from the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google-owner Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Android Pay.The introduction of Apple Pay in September 2014 helped create a turning point in the payment processing industry, with nearly 1 in 5 point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. now enabled to accept billions of dollars in mobile payments, according to Juniper Research.""Most of the merchants, when they are designing their system, they're designing it in a way that when they get EMV, they are able to implement NFC inside of it,"" Drucker said.Another area of growth for Vantiv has been in the integrated payments space. For example, when a server enters an order into a restaurant's software system, Vantiv is embedded in that process. Plus, Vantiv is expanding into new verticals in the integrated payment category, including health care.Vantiv earns a near-best IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. Shares are trading 1%-2% below a cup-shaped base buy point of 53.46, with the stock retaking its 50-day line several weeks ago.Vantiv also has less exposure to the current volatile economic environment because of its concentration in everyday spending categories, including grocery stores and drug stores. The company doesn’t have much foreign exposure at this time, but in the long term, Drucker sees an international investment in the e-commerce space.And with the vast amount of information its transactions contain, Vantiv sees data analytics as a long-term growth driver as well.""Merchants and banks continue to be more interested in data analytics -- whether it’s banks using it to activate customers or see trends inside their base, or merchants using it to give a better customer experience, or to improve ticket sales that they have,"" Drucker said.

130,KR,"Shares of The Fresh Market (TFM) soared more than 20% Thursday before trading was halted on a report that the natural and organic grocery chain is in talks to be bought by supermarket giant Kroger (KR).The Fresh Market has been exploring a sale of the company, Reuters said, citing people familiar with the situation.Kroger is said to be a bidder in the second round of an auction process for the specialty grocery chain. Apollo Global Management (APO), KKR (KKR) and TPG Capital are also believed to be participating in the bidding, Reuters said.Shares of The Fresh Market closed 22.1% higher at 22.68 after trading resumed on the stock market today. Its stock had plunged 56% since March 2015 amid rising competition in organic foods from mainstream supermarkets such as Kroger as well as from big-box discounters like Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT).Kroger closed down 1.1%. Among other organic grocers, Whole Foods (WFM) was up 0.2% and Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) rallied 0.4%.

131,KR,"While Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) continues to deal with the fallout from E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at many of its restaurants, other companies that sell prepared food — including health food grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) — have an opportunity to pick up new business.That's the finding from RBC Capital Markets analyst William Kirk, who said in a note to clients Wednesday that Chipotle’s food safety concerns “represent a $933 million revenue opportunity for competitors.” For Whole Foods, much of that opportunity involves attracting ex-Chipotle customers in the immediate area.In addition to groceries, Whole Foods also sells prepared items such as sandwiches, salads and sushi. About half its locations have a Chipotle within one mile, Kirk said. Nearly 85% of Whole Foods locations are within three miles of a Chipotle.Kirk reckons that Whole Foods can capture 25% of Chipotle’s lost sales when a store is located within a mile. That percentage falls to 10% for stores located within one to three miles, and 3% for those located within three to five miles.“Put another way, we have Whole Foods’ opportunity as about 3% of lost Chipotle sales,” Kirk said.He estimates Whole Foods can add $31 million in sales from former Chipotle customers — a drop in the bucket when you consider the company logged nearly $16 billion in revenue last fiscal year. But those sales could grow exponentially in future years, giving Whole Foods a little extra defense against rising competition from mainstream supermarket chains like Kroger (KR).“Conventional grocers have been a major headwind to comparable store sales (at Whole Foods),” Kirk noted.Shares of Whole Foods closed down 0.3% in the stock market today. The stock has fallen about 45% over the past year. Chipotle's stock price fell 1.9% while Kroger lost 0.2%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

(VFC) fell sharply Friday following a fourth-quarter miss and 2016 outlook that fell short of Wall Street forecasts, as the shaky energy market weighed on workwear apparel sales.Per-share earnings dipped 3% to 95 cents during the quarter, falling short of consensus estimates by 6 cents. A steeper-than-anticipated sales decline of almost 5% to $3.41 billion missed views for $3.64 billion in total revenue.VF expects full-year currency-neutral EPS to grow 11%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect nearly 12% growth to $3.44 per share in 2016.Revenue for the year is seen growing at a ""mid-single-digit percentage rate,"" a little lower than views for nearly 8% revenue growth. The company expects currency changes to weigh on results by 1 percentage point.Q1 currency-neutral revenue and earnings are expected to be ""about flat,"" also short of estimates.VF shares closed down 4.4% in the stock market today but had fallen as much as 10% earlier in the day. Other clothing companies finished lower as well. PVH (PVH) fell 1.8%, G-III Apparel (GIII) 1% and Gildan Activewear (GIL) 1.25%. Columbia Sportswear (COLM) ended flat.Hefty declines in imagewear and contemporary brands hit Q4 results. VF's imagewear segment revenue tumbled 13% as low-single-digit growth in its licensed sportswear unit was ""offset by more than 20% lower revenue in the workwear business, due primarily to the impact of considerably lower oil and gas exploration.""The contemporary brands segment revenue, a portfolio consisting of Ella Moss, Splendid and 7 For All Mankind, sank 19%.Warm weather late last year hit North Face and Timberland sales, with revenue from its outdoor and action sports segment -- which also includes Vans and JanSport, among other brands -- down 3% for the quarter.Jeanswear revenue, which includes Wrangler and Lee brand denim, dipped 2%. Sportswear segment sales experienced a 9% revenue decline in Q4.""Our focus, discipline and agility amid a softer consumer environment, record warm weather and a strengthening U.S. dollar have us well positioned to navigate what we believe to be a relatively short-term challenge,"" said CEO Eric Wiseman in a statement. ""Going forward, I remain confident in VF's ability to deliver continued long-term profitable growth and value creation for our shareholders.""On Wednesday, the company announced the election of Kroger (KR) CEO Rodney McMullen to the VF board of directors.Image provided by Shutterstock.

133,KR,"When you book air travel, you usually plan a round trip. When your stock has apparently made similar plans, what should you do? The question requires a multilayered answer, especially when the market goes topsy-turvy.First, avoid round trips (when a stock erases all gains from a buy point) as much as possible.When you've bought a stock correctly at the breakout, and the stock has stretched 20% to 25%, sell at least some shares. You've booked a great gain and you're selling on the way up.TAL Education (XRS), the Chinese cram school operator, sprinted past a 38.75 cup-with-handle entry in mid-November. In less than six weeks, TAL hit a high of 48.84.""A handsome 26% gain,"" you might think. Indeed. But given the market's choppy ways, it was a good time to sell.MaxLinear (MXL) reaffirms this rule.After a second-try breakout past 13.06 on Oct. 15, the specialty integrated circuits designer shot 36% higher in nearly seven weeks. Any sell once the gain surpassed 20% was a good decision. As the market began to roll over in December, so did MaxLinear. Now it's struggling to rebound back above its 50-day moving average. The breakout gain has been steamed down to about 15%.Second, what if the stock didn't reach the silver-lined zone of a 20%-25% profit?You could still sell on the way up if the gain is 10% to 19%. That's a respectable profit, especially when the market is not being so generous as it was in, say, 2003, 2009 or 2013.Third, never let a double-digit gain slip away.If a 16% gain turns into 6%, and the market goes into a correction, the wise decision in most cases is to take the gains and move on. Letting a stock's double-digit gain vanish means wasted effort. It could dent your trading psychology.Adobe Systems (ADBE) cleared an 86.41 entry and rallied 11.6%. Now it's up a few percentage points.Kroger (KR) cleared a 38.61 entry and rose 10.7% in December. Early on Thursday, it gutted all of those gains.

The stock extended gains this week amid hopes of a bidding war for the natural foods company.In addition to Wal-Mart, Kroger (KR) and Target (IBD) were said to be on the list of potential bidders.Shares of Whole Foods closed 0.6% lower at 42.94 on the stock market today, after rising as much as 43.84 intraday, and lost another 0.1% in late trade.

135,KR,"Amazon (AMZN) sparked mass panic in the grocery and retail space when the e-commerce giant said it was buying Whole Foods Market (WFM), but everyone should calm down and stop clutching their pearls about megaretailer Wal-Mart (WMT), argues Moody's.X ""While the deal will certainly help Amazon's competitive position in the grocery business, the proposed deal still falls well short of being a real threat to Walmart, which remains the world's biggest retailer and grocer,"" wrote Moody's analyst Charles O'Shea on Wednesday, adding that Wal-Mart is expanding its footprint at a time when other brick-and-mortars are shrinking.He sees Wal-Mart's food business accelerating at a quick clip, highlighting the company's in-store pickup feature as its ""latest weapon."" Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs said in May that the company's online grocery service had expanded to 670 locations.For the select areas where Walmart Grocery is available, many shoppers can get same-day delivery, similar to Amazon's grocery-delivery service, Amazon Fresh. And Wal-Mart's Jet.com acquisition last year for over $3 billion has helped the retailer try to keep pace with Amazon's sprawling e-commerce tentacles.IBD'S TAKE: As Whole Foods' share price creeps higher than the 42-per-share that Amazon offered, some speculate that Amazon may not even be the final bidder: Whole Foods Stock Signals Another Bidder Is Coming, But Who?Notably, even with the pickup of 460 Whole Foods stores, Amazon still doesn't have the on-the-ground reach of Wal-Mart's more-than-5,300 physical locations (including Sam's Club). Biggs has also said that 90% of Americans have access to the big-box store within a 10-mile radius.""Our view for the short to medium term is that for Walmart this moves the competitive needle a mere smidge,"" said O'Shea in a separate note out Wednesday. ""Realistically speaking, a challenged $16 billion food retailer is merely changing owners. And Walmart, already the world's largest retailer, also is the world's biggest grocer.""Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock, rose 1% to 1,002.23 in the stock market today. Whole Foods Market climbed 1.1% to 43.26, as investors still see a rival offer.Wal-Mart shares climbed 0.9% to 76.24, third third straight modest gain after tumbling 4.7% Friday and breaching their 50-day moving average for the first time since February after the Amazon-Whole Foods deal was announced.Shares of Kroger (KR), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Target (TGT) and others are also still trying to recover from the news.

136,KR,"As a candidate, Donald Trump raised the idea of antitrust action against Jeff Bezos and Amazon (AMZN) ""because he's controlling so much."" As president, the Bezos-owned Washington Post had the scoop that led to the firing of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Trump sees the paper as a leading example of the ""Fake News Media.""Despite that background — and despite calls by Amazon critics on the left for Trump to block its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets (WFM) — Wall Street's initial reaction to the deal is that there's no reason to worry about it being challenged on antitrust grounds.Shares of Whole Foods were up 29.1% to 42.68 — slightly above Amazon's $42-per-share bid — on the stock market today. That's a sign of confidence from investors that the deal will go through and possibly that the sale price could rise, if another bidder emerged, for example.Trump's nomination of White House Deputy Counsel Makan Delrahim as assistant attorney general for antitrust also casts doubt on the likelihood of any opposition from the Trump administration.In an interview with The New York Times in April, the paper paraphrased Delrahim as saying that ""he would not go after a company just because it was big, and would do so only if there were violations of antitrust law.""As candidate, Trump criticized AT&T's (T) pending acquisition of Time Warner (TWX), owner of CNN, but he apparently hasn't interfered in his administration's scrutiny into the deal as president.On its face, the Amazon-Whole Food deal wouldn't seem to raise traditional antitrust issues, because the combined companies would still have a tiny slice of the overall grocery business. Yet the political left is trying to push the envelope of antitrust law.Barry C. Lynn, Director of the Open Markets Program at the New America think tank, said the Amazon-Whole Foods deal ""would worsen the already severe damage that Amazon is doing to America's competitive, open market system. This private corporation already dominates every corner of online commerce, and uses its power to set terms and prices for many of the most important products Americans buy or sell to one another. Now Amazon is exploiting that advantage to take over physical retail.""Financial market reaction to the deal implies a significant shift in economics of the grocery business, which is already seeing intense price competition.Shares of Wal-Mart (WMT) fell 4.65% and Costco (COST) 7.2%. Kroger (KR) tumbled 9.2%, hitting a three-year low, On Thursday the pure-play grocer cut full-year profit guidance amid aggressive industry discounting, sending its stock down 19%.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesAmazon Is Buying Whole Foods For $13.7 Billion; Grocery Stocks DiveAmazon-Whole Foods Deal Lifts Impinj Stock; IDT Gets Price-Target HikeKroger Trashed, Rival Grocers Spoiled On Earnings Warning

137,KR,"X Amazon.com's (AMZN) planned $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market (WFM) would put the resources of a $470 billion company with a massive delivery infrastructure behind the growing demand for better, fresher ingredients and seems likely to upend the way Wall Street thinks about companies that have anything to do with food.The planned merger marks a ""seminal moment in the world of eating,"" RBC analyst David Palmer said in a research note, calling the combined company a potential ""category killer"" in home meals.""Virtually all of the companies in coverage — both in the food and the restaurant space — should be huddling up about the long-term implications,"" he wrote.Prior to the deal, some eateries were making moves in e-commerce. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) have already worked digital ordering into deliveries, while fast-food giants like McDonald's (MCD) have also made a push into delivery and mobile ordering.The merger seems almost certain to deepen the bruising price war between chains like Kroger (KR), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT) as an oversupply steers supermarkets toward discounts.Weaker demand in Asia and Europe has in recent years contributed to an oversupply of dairy, while cyclicality has pushed beef prices lower, spurring price cuts to move items off shelves more quickly.Meanwhile, discount European grocers like Aldi and Lidl plan to expand in the U.S., which could bring lower prices for shoppers but also lower profits for the industry.But in Amazon, the industry now faces a retailer that can ""price aggressively, and the smaller regional supermarket chains and independents will bear the most pain,"" Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha said in a statement.Amazon's move also seems likely to hasten consolidation in the industry, Chadha added. Rumors have persisted through the year that Whole Foods or Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) were possible takeover targets by Albertsons.For now, news of Amazon's plans to barrel into the grocery business proved merciless to shares of many of its rivals-to-be.Shares of Kroger tumbled 9.2% to finish at 22.29 on the stock market today, but closed well off intraday lows. On Thursday, the stock sank nearly 19% after Kroger slashed earnings guidance but vowed not to ""lose on price."" Target fell 5%, and Wal-Mart, whose own discounts have escalated the price war in supermarket aisles, dropped 4.7%. Sprouts sank 6.3%. Grocery store operator and distributor SuperValu (SVU) crashed 14%, and distributor United Natural Foods (UNFI) lost 11%.The Amazon-Whole Foods deal would create a top-five grocer in the U.S., but it wouldn't be without challenges. Fresh groceries are lower-margin and require more work to handle.UBS analyst Michael Lasser said in a research note that wholesaler Costco (COST) could be protected from Amazon's move. He added that dollar stores Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) serve rural areas, where consumers have limited resources or are just looking for quick, fill-in trips.""Thus, those models may not see as much change as is feared,"" he said. ""We would use this as a chance to parse through the noise.""Cowen analysts in March said the intersection of food sales and digital technology could drive U.S. e-commerce growth over the next five years. Their survey data said that younger consumers, who do more through their smartphones, were ""leading the U.S. shift"" and that U.K. survey data suggested ""3x more online grocery purchasers than the U.S., a positive indicator for U.S. adoption.""As more analysts speculate about retail's connected future — with the store perhaps not vanishing completely but sharing more space with online and mobile shopping — an Amazon-Whole Foods tie-up could help normalize a kind of shopping that bounces data from the price-tags in the store to the device in your pocket.""Amazon now has a high-end retail space where they can truly experiment with IoT, retail analytics, behavioral management, and consumer tracking techniques,"" Stephen DiFranco, an investment advisor to Silicon Valley venture capital firms, said in an emailed statement.As also stated in that email: ""You will never be alone in aisle 6 again.""RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailCould Trump-Bezos Tension Imperil Amazon-Whole Foods Deal?Wal-Mart Beefs Up Online Ops With $310 Million Bonobos Deal

138,KR,"X Amazon (AMZN) is acquiring upscale grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) for $42 per share in an all-cash deal worth $13.7 billion, including the grocer's net debt, the companies announced Friday. The deal makes Amazon a huge player in the brick-and-mortar grocery business, sending shares of grocers and other big food sellers down sharply.Whole Foods Market will continue to operate stores under its brand, and CEO John Mackey will stay on in the top spot, according to the official statement from Amazon. The company's headquarters will remain in Austin, Texas.""This partnership presents an opportunity to maximize value for Whole Foods Market's shareholders, while at the same time extending our mission and bringing the highest quality, experience, convenience and innovation to our customers,"" said Mackey.Amazon shares rose 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods shares rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above the offer price. Several big Whole Foods investors said Amazon's bid was too low and looked for another buyer to swoop in.The deal is expected to close in the latter half of the year.Grocery-store operators Kroger (KR) and Albertsons were other names speculated to be mulling a bid.Jana Partners disclosed an 8.3% stake in Whole Foods in April, calling shares ""undervalued and represent an attractive investment opportunity,"" and was said to be nudging the grocer toward the exploration of a sale.Amazon already controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart (WMT), including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to a March 2016 analysis from Cowen analysts John Blackledge and Oliver Chen.IBD's TAKE: As we said a year ago, Amazon's next big growth play would surprise you. Even before the Whole Foods acquisition, Cowen estimated that Amazon's grocery volume would rocket to $23.2 billion five years from now, up from an estimated $8.7 billion in 2016.Kroger, the largest pure-play grocer, is a distant second with a 9% market share. Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix round out the top five with low- to mid-single-digit shares apiece.Kroger, which crashed 19% Thursday after slashing its full-year profit guidance, tumbled 9.2% on Friday, hitting a three-year low. Grocery sellers have come under heavy pressure as Amazon and Wal-Mart (WMT) have helped suppress prices.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), a natural foods rival to Whole Foods, fell 6.3% after losing more than 9% on Thursday. Sprouts said Thursday that it has been ""significantly impacted by deflation.""Wal-Mart shares fell 4.6%, gapping below its 50-day moving average. Wal-Mart has been stepping up its online efforts, as well as introducing curbside online grocery order pick up and an automated grocery store kiosk.Grocery rival SuperValu (SVU) and Target (TGT), another big grocery seller, were selling off, down 14% and 5%, respectively.

140,KR,"It's hard to grow in an economic downturn, but that may be what soup king Campbell Soup (CPB) has to do to continue what appears to be a successful transformation.Economic growth in the U.S. lost some gas in the back half of 2015 due to global headwinds, dumping of excess inventory and the energy-sector slump. In addition to economic uncertainty, Campbell also is grappling with a long-term trend among consumers away from shelf goods like canned soup and more toward fresh, natural foods.The fresh and natural trend hit grocery stores several years ago with the rise of Whole Foods Market (WFM), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and others. Mainstream supermarkets responded by adding more of those products.For example, No. 1 U.S. supermarket company Kroger (KR) -- parent of its namesake chain as well as Ralphs, Fred Meyer, discounter Food 4 Less and other brands -- rolled out its own line of natural and organic foods, Simple Truth, which has proved to be popular. This trend toward fresh and natural initially left Campbell Soup at a disadvantage.""Campbell is heavily reliant on soup. It's more than 50% of their business (by revenue). Long term, consumers are moving away from that market,"" Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo told Investor's Business Daily.Campbell says it garnered about 59% of all U.S. retail canned and packaged ""wet"" soup sales -- as opposed to the kind where you add water, like Unilever's (UL) dry-packaged Lipton soups -- in its latest quarter. But now it's focusing on fresh, natural ingredients and talking to consumers to find out what they want in their foods.As a result, Campbell is expanding in the fresh and natural category, selling everything from bags of fresh carrots to a new line of organic soups. It's also made a series of acquisitions to grow in that category and internationally.Campbell bought Garden Fresh Gourmet, a maker of fresh salsa, chips and hummus, in June for $231 million.In 2013, the Camden, N.J.-based company bought Plum Organics, the No. 2 U.S. provider of organic baby foods and snacks. To expand its global footprint, it bought the Kelsen Group, a Denmark-based maker of quality baked goods and snacks sold in 85 countries. Kelsen is the biggest provider of sweet biscuits in China, the world's largest consumer market.In August 2012, Campbell made its biggest purchase ever, paying $1.55 billion cash to a fund managed by Madison Dearborn Partners for Bolthouse Farms. Headquartered in Bakersfield, Calif., Bolthouse has market-leading positions in fresh carrots and premium health beverages such as smoothies and protein drinks, and is a growing presence in refrigerated salad dressings.Those moves get Campbell off the inner store shelves and into the coveted outer ring of items, according to Darren Seifer, executive director and food and beverage analyst for market tracker NPD.""Companies at the center of the store are having difficulty attracting customers. The place to be is the outside of the store, where the fresh vegetables, meats and deli counter are,"" Seifer said.Campbell's drive into those parts of the store is helping get customers engaged.""Campbell does try to keep their fingers on the pulse of what's happening in health. They're trying to stay on top of and maybe in front of the trend,"" Seifer said.Analysts say Campbell's recent rapid growth is due in large part to strategic initiatives launched by Chief Executive Denise Morrison, a 13-year company veteran who assumed the helm 4-1/2 years ago.In early 2015, Morrison announced the company was reorganizing into three business divisions, primarily by product categories rather than geographies or brand groups, and she began implementing a plan to trim costs by $250 million over three years, among other moves.""Generating growth in this environment has been and remains difficult,"" Morrison told analysts on the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings call at the end of November.But she also noted the company has made recipe changes to appeal to consumers, shifted marketing dollars to digital channels and is ""advancing the 'health and well-being' imperative across our company,"" including the launch a year ago of the Campbell Organic line of soups.Those soups, which include vegetarian and gluten-free varieties, come in recyclable paper cartons, as Campbell tries to move away from the traditional metal can to more environmentally friendly packaging.Campbell's stock price recently hit a series of highs. It rose 11% in just over three weeks to close at 56.69 on Feb. 1, and was nearing its all-time high close at 60.05 set in March 1998. Its stock has a 92 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 92% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Last quarter, Campbell reported a 28.4% jump in fiscal Q1 earnings per share to 95 cents based on originally reported figures, 22% when taking into account a recent accounting change, easily topping analyst consensus for 76 cents a share.Revenue fell 2.3% year over year to $2.203 billion in the company's first quarter, just below Wall Street's $2.207 billion target, due to the negative impact of currency translation. Campbell doesn't break out soup revenue, but it accounts for the bulk of revenue in its Simple Meals and Beverage division, which also includes broths, pasta sauces, V8 juices and other products. Simple Meal was $1.3 billion of the quarterly total.Edward Jones' Russo cautions that the company isn't seeing bubbling growth yet. Although EPS reversed from a drop of 12% two quarters ago to a robust 28% rise last quarter, its revenue growth rate has shrunk for four quarters in a row.A Dec. 16 Edward Jones report projected Campbell will report $2.85 EPS for 2016, up 16% year over year and above consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.82. Russo has a hold rating on the company.For 2016, Russo predicted: ""Soup will have a tough year, partly because the weather has been unusually warm across much of the U.S. The rest of their categories will be fine.""In particular, Russo looks to Pepperidge Farm, the 79-year-old maker of cookies, bread and crackers, to add flavor to Campbell's bottom line.

157,KR,"Antitrust: The European Union has once again kicked a giant U.S. tech firm in the shins in yet another pathetic fit of jealous pique. Last time, it was Apple (AAPL), supposedly because it didn't pay enough taxes. This time, it's Google, largely because, well, European companies just can't compete.XThe EU's so-called Competition Commission — whose name suggests the same level of irony as the Ministry of Truth did in George Orwell's ""1984"" — says that Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google must cough up a record fine of $2.7 billion because Europe's homegrown firms can't compete.""Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors,"" said the EU's top antitrust bureaucrat, Margrethe Vestager. ""What Google has done is illegal under EU rules.""This is a really unique idea. A company comes up with a great, new, innovative service that it does better than anyone else. It then takes advantage of that service's uniquely inventive characteristics to help its own business grow and to benefit all its customers — something the world's most successful businesses do all the time.And yet, the EU defines that as ""anti-competitive""?This is nothing less than an attack on American innovation and inventiveness by a jealous foreign bureaucracy. And it's a problem that's not limited to just the U.S.""Recently, questionable antitrust probes have grown like topsy around the world, many of them aimed at America's most creative high-tech firms,"" wrote Alden Abbott, deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation. ""Beneficial innovations have become legal nightmares — good for defense lawyers, but bad for free market competition and the health of the American economy.""The fact is, Europeans use Google's search service not because there are no other choices, but because they like it. It has lots of functions. When they stop liking it, they'll use another search engine. Google, to its credit, has added more and more functions over the years, making it extraordinarily useful — basic searches, maps, satellite images, roadside pictures of virtually every road, highway and street in every major city on Earth, entire libraries online, the list goes on and on.Yet, the linchpin of the EU ""case"" against Google, if it can be called that, is that Google gave pride of place to its own shopping service when displaying search results.True enough. But as Abbott notes, ""This is akin to saying that Kroger (KR) or Wal-Mart (WMT) harm competition when they give favorable shelf space displays to their house brands. That's ridiculous.""He's right. If anything, the EU's attack on Google — and on Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple and Microsoft (MSFT) before them — is a transparent attack on the U.S.' world-leading tech industry, which the EU can't match, and our prosperity. Instead of reforming its own socialistic and outdated industrial policies, it instead hobbles its competitors with unwarranted and possibly illegal intrusions on companies' rights to their own patents and to run their own businesses as they see fit. That European companies can't compete is their own problem.Sure, Google isn't too worried about the fine. Though huge at $2.7 billion, Google has $92 billion in cash in the bank, and won't go bankrupt from the EU's action. But, as we said, this is worrisome not just for Google, but for all U.S. tech firms, which now face spurious antitrust legal actions around the world to keep them from dominating global markets.In a piece this week in IBD, former Justice Department Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust James F. Rill argues ""the potential misuse of competition law to further industrial policy is now a key area of focus for lawmakers, regulators and private enterprises.""And it should be. Nor should citizens of the EU be happy with these policies. They'll face fewer choices, not more, higher prices, and less innovation in their markets, thanks to the meddling of the European Union's antitrust warriors.Besides, there's a reason why companies in the increasingly socialistic and bureaucratic EU struggle to compete on an equal footing in the global tech world: They're smothered by their own EU bureaucracy, which prescribes in excruciating and mind-numbing detail all that European businesses must do. This includes everything from workhours and labor conditions to what ingredients their products have and even what they call their products.In short, in the name of  ""competition,"" Vestager and others of her Eurocratic ilk have helped turn the 28-nation EU into a stagnant economy where innovation is viewed as a threat, since its own companies lag the U.S., Japan and China in innovation, patents and startups.It's one thing if the EU wants to destroy its own once-thriving culture of entrepreneurship and innovation, quite another if it wants to abuse the idea of antitrust enforcement to hobble the U.S.' best companies.Both the president and Congress should work together to put an end to this kind of abusive antitrust behavior by foreign governments. It's time to put a halt to these peevish, anti-free market assaults on American innovation.RELATED:Apple Now, Google, Amazon Next?

158,KR,"Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Broadcom (AVGO) are three stocks that show why $1.7 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is smart for using two oars rather than just one.The fund's management is divvied up between two teams, one tilting toward value-oriented stock, the other toward growth stocks. Last year, when the postelection Trump Bump lifted value-oriented stocks like energy and financials, bets in those sectors boosted the fund's value-oriented sleeve. This year it's the growth sleeve's turn to shine brighter.And with year-to-date gains of 34% for both Amazon and Facebook and 39% for Broadcom going into Thursday, those stocks have added octane to the growth sleeve's fuel. So have consumer discretionary names like Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH). And likewise for health care names like Hologic (HOLX) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The fund aims for a 60%-40% split in assets between its growth and value sleeves. ""That split makes sense in achieving a core fund experience for our shareholders,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves. Subadvisors from Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss run the value sleeve. An in-house team from USAA mans the growth sleeve.Most of the fund's dividend comes from the Barrow Hanley sleeve.The tandem arrangement has resulted in a 23.46% return over the 12 months going into Thursday, topping 95% of its large-cap-blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was up 19.06%.So far this year, the fund is up 9.74% vs. 8.82% for its peer group and 9.86% for the big-cap bogey.John Jares, who runs the growth sleeve along with John Toohey, likes Amazon's strength in retail and web services. ""It's referred to as Hurricane Amazon because it's so disruptive,"" he said. Amazon Web Services' operating margin soared to 24.3% as of the first quarter, up from 3.8% in 2014. It's expected to hit 29% by the end of 2017, he says. With AWS' profit growing much faster than the overall company's, the overall company's operating margin will be pulled up by AWS, Jares adds. And its rapidly growing free cash flow will give the company ""more ammunition to invest against any of its competitors,"" he said.He's less enthused about Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), wondering what role it will play in Amazon's future.His team is crunching numbers to decide whether investors have oversold other grocery chains. The fund also owns Kroger (KR).Jares likes the way Facebook has become a magnet for advertising dollars, largely by providing advertisers with sharper targeting of consumers. ""They can see the effectiveness of ad campaigns,"" Jares said. And Facebook can post additional ads at minimal cost. ""That's what attracted us to the stock,"" he said.The stock is trading around 153. Jares says 200 is not out of the range of possibility.A third cruise ship line that the fund owns is Carnival (CCL). ""The cruise lines have been on a tear this year,"" he said, referring to all three of his cruise ship stocks. ""Because of improved demand, they've had better pricing. Last year, there were problems from terrorism in Europe, fears about the Zika virus. With the improvement in employment and the future economic outlook of the U.S., cruise lines have seen rising demand. Plus, they've enjoyed easy comps (earnings comparisons) from last year.""Royal Caribbean is up 39% so far this year. Earnings per share grew 13%, 31% and 74% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Royal Caribbean ranks No. 3 in the Leisure-Services industry group. It has four straight years of annual earnings per share growth. Norwegian ranks No. 6 in the group. You can compare the two stocks fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy to use Stock Checkup tool.Norwegian, trading around 55, is up 29% this year. The stock is within its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.In health care, Jares says his team likes Hologic because relatively new CEO Stephen MacMillan is shifting the company to a faster growth profile serving female health, diagnostics and aesthetics.The team's view of UnitedHealth is that investors have underappreciated its Optum division, which includes a number of fast-growing ancillary businesses that improve the effectiveness of their standard insurance business.Building materials maker Owens Corning (OC), in the Barrow Hanley sleeve, is up 30% this year. EPS grew 9% and 60% the past two quarters. The stock has been driven by the housing rebound and strength in the U.S. economy.Michael Nayfa, a manager of the Barrow Hanley sleeve, said, ""Underlying fundamentals remain strong in the roofing and composite businesses, and the insulation business looks set to recover in 2017 as housing starts remain below normal and pricing is picking up. OC remains an attractive value trading at 14 times normalized earnings with a 1.2% dividend yield.""RELATED: Microsoft would surpass Amazon Web ServicesUSAA Growth & Income Fund Shows Two Heads Are Better Than OneHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

160,KR,"Kroger stock jumped to a record high Thursday after the supermarket chain beat quarterly earnings views on strong same-store sales growth and lower costs.The Cincinnati-based grocery giant reported adjusted earnings of 43 cents a share for its fiscal third quarter, which ended in October. That was up 23% from the prior year and 4 cents ahead of consensus. It was the 14th straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth.Kroger (KR) revenue gained 0.4% to $25.1 billion, in line with estimates. Top-line growth has been sluggish in recent quarters, partly because of lower fuel prices.However, its identical supermarket sales have been growing at a pretty rapid clip, helped by a bigger emphasis on fast-growing organic and natural foods.Q3 identical supermarket sales excluding fuel rose 5.4% vs. a year earlier — above consensus for a 4.5% increase. That followed Q2's 5.3% core comps gain.Meanwhile, expenses fell as a share of total sales on cost curbs.Kroger stock rose 4.7% to 39.91, breaking out to a record high.Kroger has managed to beat expectations despite several headwinds, RBC Capital Markets analyst William Kirk said in a Thursday note.These headwinds include rising competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) as well as Winter Haven, Fla.-based Publix, a privately held chain that mainly operates in the Southeast.""Kroger continues to be one of the best operators in the category, but will be less immune to deflationary pressures than it has been year-to-date,"" Kirk noted.One thing Kroger has done well lately is grab market share in organic and natural foods from more focused rivals such as Whole Foods Market (WFM) and Fresh Market (TFM).Kroger entered the organic foods business with its Simple Truth brand and recently said that natural and organic foods accounted for 10% of total sales.""Simple Truth continues to grow at an astonishing rate, set ting a record high for total sales in the third quarter while continuing to establish weekly sales records throughout the quarter,"" CFO Michael Schlotman said on a conference call with analysts.Kroger raised its full-year EPS guidance to $2.02-$2.04 from $1.92-$1.98. Analysts expected $2 EPS before the Q3 earnings beat.Meanwhile, Kroger is expected to finalize its $800 million acquisition of Roundy's (RNDY) in the next few weeks, in a deal that will expand its presence in the Midwest.Whole Foods stock fell 0.1%; Fresh Market lost 0.7%.

162,KR,"When it comes to holiday wish lists, gift cards remain a top choice among consumers this season. That's music to the ears of prepaid card and payments company Blackhawk Network (HAWK).""Blackhawk is one of the big providers of gift cards and related services,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Investor's Business Daily. ""It helps content providers like retailers that want to sell outside their premises on grocery store shelves.""Blackhawk uses proprietary technology to offer a broad range of prepaid gift, telecom and debit cards, in physical and electronic forms, as well as related prepaid products and payment services. The company supports the management and distribution of these products in a number of different retail, digital and incentive channels.It sells to consumers through its retail distribution network, whether in stores or on websites. Blackhawk also provides services, software and prepaid products to business clients for loyalty, incentive and reward programs, using its own sales force, as well as third-party resellers.23 CountriesBlackhawk's retail distribution partners showcase gift cards on displays that Blackhawk manages. Outside the U.S., Blackhawk distributes to its non-U.S. partners in 23 countries via grocery stores and other retail channels.The company seems to be in the right place at the right time. Gift cards remained the most requested holiday gift by consumers in a November National Retail Federation survey. And a recent poll by Deloitte found redeemable cards are the No. 2 gift that shoppers plan to buy this holiday.Consumers showed just how popular gift cards are over the Thanksgiving/Black Friday weekend. Stored Value Solutions reports sales of gift cards in the U.S. were up 4% year over year for the four days of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, double 2014's year-over-year gain of 2%.Blackhawk distributes merchant-branded prepaid, or ""closed-loop,"" cards for companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Apple's (AAPL) iTunes, Macy's (M), Starbucks (SBUX)and Best Buy (BBY), in addition to other prepaid products like telecom cards, open-loop gift cards that can be redeemed anywhere, and reloadable prepaid debit cards.The company isn't content with that, however. Blackhawk has bulked up with a steady flow of acquisitions, new businesses and expanded distribution. That's helped it gain traction in its traditional space and in the ""incentive"" gift card arena, where customers are rewarded for loyalty.New DivisionMany of the buyouts are part of a new division, Blackhawk Engagement Solutions, that was formed this year.""Our strategy since inception has been to connect great brands to consumers through a productive global network,"" Teri Llach, Blackhawk's chief marketing officer, told IBD. ""Motivating employees via a prepaid card or gift card is a logical expansion going from a retail presence, where we're connecting brands to consumers, to corporate incentives, where we're connecting employers to employees.""The incentives and rewards business has proven to be the fastest-growing segment for Blackhawk and is driving its rapid expansion, says Wedbush's Luria.""Their biggest business, which is closed-loop gift cards, has slowed down to maybe single-digit growth,"" Luria said. ""To generate growth, they've been making acquisitions of these corporate incentives and rewards companies.""Showing In NumbersIt's showing up in the numbers. In the third quarter, Blackhawk's adjusted earnings grew 52% to 35 cents a share. Adjusted revenue jumped 54% to $193.4 million.Its incentives and rewards segment's adjusted operating revenues soared 392% from a year earlier, primarily due to the acquisition of Parago and the purchase of Achievers, Chief Executive Bill Tauscher said in a recent press release. Meanwhile, its U.S. retail segment grew adjusted operating revenue 21% in the third quarter. The international retail segment posted adjusted operating revenue growth of 27%.Luria says the corporate incentives and rewards business is more of a year-round concern, while the company's core gift card segment is seasonal, with all of its business generated in the fourth quarter around the holidays. Luria expects the company to continue to make acquisitions since its core business is slowing down.Latest PurchaseBlackhawk's latest buy came last month with the purchase of Didix Gifting & Promotions.Based in the Netherlands, Didix issues and markets leisure-themed gifts and promotions using a prepaid card that can be redeemed for services at multiple leisure outlets, including regional retailers, restaurants, cinemas and spas. It develops gifting and promotional products and brands across the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium.Blackhawk's Llach says all of the company's acquisitions have been a ""significant driver of Blackhawk's earnings growth.""""We are in 23 countries, and we are looking at smart ways to expand where we see a market (opportunity),"" Llach said.Safeway SpinoffBlackhawk was spun off from privately held grocery giant Safeway in 2014. Safeway and other grocers such as Kroger (KR) are distribution partners.Other partners include Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Staples (SPLS) as well as online giants Amazon and eBay (EBAY).Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Blackhawk's full-year 2015 earnings to rise 31% to $2.31 a share. They see a 14% gain in 2016 and an 11% increase in 2017.""As long as they continue to make acquisitions, they will grow (at a rapid) rate,"" said Luria. ""At some point it will be harder to do. If they run out of balance-sheet ability (because of too much debt), it will be harder for them to borrow more money to make acquisitions.""Blackhawk is part of IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors industry group. It leads the group with a 99 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99.

166,KR,"The broadest, timeliest data on the health of the job market show that financial markets may be wrong about the economy.Federal employment and income taxes withheld from paychecks rose a strong 6.2% from a year ago over the past 10 weeks, an IBD analysis of daily Treasury statements shows. That growth reflects, in part, wage increases at companies like American Airlines (AAL) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Jack in the Box (JACK).By comparison, tax withholdings grew a modest 4.3% during the same period in 2016.The latest 10-week period of data provides a clearer signal on pay, as it started in early April. The year-over-year growth rate spiked early this year during bonus season, which wrapped up at the end of March.After accounting for roughly 2% payroll growth, the 6% gain in tax withholdings implies paychecks are about 4% larger than a year ago, reflecting higher wages as well as more hours and incentive pay.That presents a much different picture than Labor Department numbers showing that average hourly wage growth fell back to 2.5% in May. It also contrasts with the view held by markets, which see falling inflation and tepid wage growth.While the Federal Reserve's hawkish outlook calls for four more rate hikes over the next 18 months, markets are pricing in just one quarter-point hike through June 2018.The picture offered by the tax data seems roughly consistent with what companies have been saying in their earnings calls.Companies like Jack in the Box, AutoZone (AZO) and Union Pacific (UNP) have reported accelerating wage pressures in recent months, while American Airlines and JPMorgan Chase implemented broad pay hikes. Last week, Kroger (KR) said it moved to ""increase starting wages to try to reduce the turnover we have,"" even as it faces a price war against Wal-Mart (WMT).On a June 6 conference call, Casey's General Stores (CASY) CFO Bill Walljasper talked about a ""very tight"" labor market in which ""it's not uncommon for people to jump shifts, $0.25 raise here or there, and so that's been a challenge,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.""We've definitely seen that throughout our market and some of these wage rate pressures for us to remain competitive around some of the noncore hours of the 24 hours stores, the pizza delivery, things of that nature,"" Walljasper said.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street is increasingly of the view that the Federal Reserve has an ulterior motive for its hawkish policy tilt in the face of falling inflation: reining in the stock market. If so, the Fed has so far been impotent. On Monday, IBD upgraded its market outlook to a confirmed uptrend as the Nasdaq enjoyed its best day of 2017.Jack in the Box says it's seeing 6% wage inflation, driven in part by minimum-wage increases. AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes noted ""accelerated pressures on wages,"" with minimum-wage increases playing a secondary role. ""Probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers,"" Rhodes said on a May 22 call.Those ""other retailers"" likely include Wal-Mart, which raised its base wage to $10 an hour in early 2016.RELATED:Fed Hikes Rates, But Hawkish Tone Unnerves MarketsSlow Hiring, 16-Year Low Jobless Rate Shift Fed Outlook

168,KR,"XWhole Foods Market (WFM) shares continued to climb Monday, signaling increased belief that someone else could top the $13.7 billion Amazon.com (AMZN) deal for the high-end grocer.Barclays analyst Karen Short said she ""would not be surprised if there is a bidding war"" for Whole Foods, upgrading the high-end grocer to overweight from equal weight and raising her price target by 26% to 48, well above Amazon's announced acquisition price of 42 a share.A fresh bid could be as high as 57 a share, Short says, giving a big potential upside. Meanwhile, the regulatory risk for Amazon's deal is low, so the potential downside from buying Whole Foods shares is low in her view. And beyond fending off the e-commerce giant, Short added that a strategic retail bidder could create up to $600 million in synergies.Is this a plausible scenario? Barclays isn't the only one that seems to think so. Oppenheimer upped its price target to 45 on Friday, not long after the deal was announced, on the grounds that the deal undervalued Whole Foods' prospects and ""powerful brand."" Analysts there see a mid-40s-range buyout as more appropriate.Shares of Whole Foods Market rose 1.3% to 43.22 in the stock market today — even after closing up 29.1% on Friday to 42.68.So who, exactly, could pop out of the woodwork to beat Amazon's $13.7 billion offer? In Short's view, the list of suspects is long: ""all retailers that sell food and compete with (Amazon) because we think most have too much to lose not to bid."" Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are on that list.The nation's grocery chains and big-box stores have already lost a lot since Friday, as shares of Kroger, Target, Wal-Mart and Costco (COST) suffered mightily from the merger announcement.(The only grocery retailer that isn't getting further kicked Monday on news of the deal is Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) — and that's likely because Oppenheimer pegged it as the next possible takeover target. Sprouts rose 3.5% on Monday.)Kroger rose 1.6%, but after crashing nearly 28% last week. Wal-Mart edged up 0.3% while Target fell 1.7%.Costco continues to suffer Monday, falling 2.7% to a 2017 low and undercutting its 200-day moving average. Deutsche Bank downgraded Costco to hold, citing intensifying competition from efforts by Amazon and Wal-Mart to ramp up their in-store and online business.The Whole Foods acquisition ""represents a game changer with (Costco's) competitive moat of grocery under greater threat while its digital platform lags peers, putting membership renewal at higher risk for decline,"" wrote Deutsche's Paul Trussell. He cut his price target on Costco to 172 from 187.Still, the membership warehouse's traffic and margins are solid, he said. And Cowen's Oliver Chen, who has an outperform rating on Costco, believes the retailer's vertical integration and low prices will continue to be brick-and-mortar traffic drivers.For his part, Chen isn't so sure that Costco would be interested in — or Target would be capable of — proposing a buyout for Whole Foods, and Wal-Mart might only have interest insomuch as a buyout would be a defensive measure. But he is wondering about Amazon's next shopping spree.""We believe there are likely capabilities, routes to market, and specialized brand propositions at retailers which could be synergistically combined with largely pure-play online retailers such as (Amazon),"" wrote Chen.Who?

169,KR,"X The stock market closed mixed Friday after indexes bounced off session lows, leaving the general market in the same uncertain outlook it's faced for a week now.The Nasdaq lost 0.2%. Amazon.com (AMZN) — the Nasdaq's fourth-largest-weighted stock — jumped more than 2% on the acquisition of Whole Foods Market (WFM).The S&P 500 erased early losses all the way into the close and finished a fraction higher. After last Friday's sell-off, the market didn't do enough to recover and remains under pressure.The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. Wal-Mart (WMT), which could be hurt by the Amazon-Whole Foods deal, skidded nearly 5% in about six times more volume than usual. Wal-Mart closed below the 50-day moving average for the first time since Feb. 15.Small caps performed in line with the Nasdaq as the Russell 2000 slipped 0.2%. Since it hit a new high June 9, it's fallen four of the next five days. The Dow utilities outperformed with a 0.4% increase to a record high.Volume was sharply higher amid the simultaneous expiration of various options and futures contracts. Despite that, indexes closed mostly lower. Winning stocks led losers by nearly 6-to-5 on the NYSE. But on the Nasdaq, losers topped winners by 8-to-7.Besides Amazon's internet retail industry group, energy, fiber optics and some health care groups were among the best performing. Finisar's (FNSR) 8% surge after strong quarterly results was the main cause of the fiber-optic industry's rise Friday.The retail sector was broadly lower, with discount chains, drugstores and office supply retailers down 2% to 5%. The grocery stores group was only modestly lower. Whole Foods' 29% surge cushioned sharp losses in Kroger (KR), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and several smaller stocks in the same group.Kroger already had tumbled 19% Thursday on an earning warning, and lost 9% more Friday. The week's 27% plunge left shares at their lowest level in more than three years.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Deal Lifts Impinj Stock; IDT Gets Price-Target HikeKroger Trashed, Rival Grocers Spoiled On Earnings Warning

171,KR,"X Unhinge jaw, devour Whole Foods Market (WFM). Amazon's (AMZN) latest acquisition is its largest ever at $13.7 billion, and one that promises to shake up the retail space — though exactly how is unclear.A combined Amazon and Whole Foods Market would create the fifth largest U.S. grocery retailer behind Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR), Costco (COST) and Albertsons/Safeway, said Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Friday note.As Investor's Business Daily has previously reported, Amazon's foray into the grocery aisle isn't new. Through Amazon Fresh and Prime Pantry, Amazon already has some level of grocery-delivery built into its fulfillment strategy, though the complexity of handling produce and perishables at its fulfillment centers means that the rollout has been relatively slow.It was not until the latter half of 2016 that Amazon ""meaningfully ramped up its expansion efforts"" to be in approximately 20 major U.S. markets, wrote Blackledge in an earlier report from March.Engulfing Whole Foods now brings 460 additional brick-and-mortar locations in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and around 87,000 more employees to Amazon's arsenal. Whole Foods raked in $16 billion in sales in fiscal 2016.That expanded presence in the real world could mean all manner of retail ripples. Amazon could use the acquisition to increase its product offering through Prime Now or expand its beta-tested curbside pickup offering, among other things, noted Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson. The e-commerce titan could also incorporate its private-label items, ""compressing costs and removing differentiation currently enjoyed by retailers like (Wal-Mart).""Whole Foods will expand Amazon Fresh's potential footprint to most of the U.S., especially in upscale areas, Olson added. ""We believe Amazon can therefore launch nationwide grocery delivery coverage within 12-18 months.""For Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), ""it will likely complicate its delivery partnership with AMZN through Amazon Prime Now,"" wrote UBS analyst Michael Lasser. Amazon and Sprouts announced a Denver grocery delivery partnership on Thursday.Additionally, ""we consider it to be a negative read for (Target), as it could further complicate its efforts to gain traction creating a stronger, better-for-you food offering in its stores,"" he said.The buyout could also increase the existing allure of Amazon's Prime membership.In the cybersphere, Amazon Prime was already the ""most used"" platform to buy groceries online in 2016, according to a Cowen survey from March. Prime's 47% share outguns Wal-Mart 39% piece of the pie, and Cowen's Blackledge added that the U.S. grocery retail market is ""greatly underpenetrated online,"" projecting earlier this year that online grocery sales could reach $177 billion in 2022, up from an estimated $71 billion this year.And there appears to be plenty of room to grow within Amazon's own ecosystem: Consulting firm Magid said only 13% of Prime subscribers buy groceries on Amazon.Analyst reaction has been swift. BMO Capital Markets upped its price target on Whole Foods to 42, Amazon's offer price. Oppenheimer raised its target on Whole Foods to 45 from 40, and said it can't rule out the possibility of another bid for the upscale grocer as a defense measure against Amazon.Some investors apparently agree with Oppenheimer. Whole Foods shares shot up 29.1% to 42.68 on the stock market today. Amazon rose 2.4% to 987.71.Calling the buyout a ""somewhat surprising step"" from Amazon, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney also noted surprise that Amazon is wading further into brick-and-mortar retail.The question of what Whole Foods can bring to Amazon appears to be answerable in a dozen different ways. A murkier question appears to be what Amazon can do for Whole Foods.""We could see AMZN perhaps improving WFM's procurement processes, but it's very unclear to us how Amazon would improve the rest of WFM's operations,"" said Mahaney, noting that Amazon ""has typically not bought fixer-uppers.""""So we see substantial execution risk here, offset only by the reality that in the AMZN scheme of things, this is actually a relatively modest acquisition,"" he wrote.UBS' Lasser sees potential for ""deeper price investments"" at Whole Foods, which he says is ""necessary"" to re-accelerate same-store sales growth at the grocer.Looking to Amazon's peer in China might offer some clues about what comes next in the plan.""If you look at Alibaba (BABA) and what they've been able to do in China with the grocery stores that they've invested in, that might be a model, but you don't know because Amazon is always going to be on the forefront,"" ACSI Funds CEO Phil Bak told Investor's Business Daily. Amazon and Whole Foods Market are both holdings in the company's fund.Alibaba recently inked a deal with Chinese supermarket heavyweight Shanghai Bailian Group, which has 4,700 locations in the country, and the China e-commerce giant has an approximate one-third stake in Sanjiang Shopping Club.Amazon ""is not following anyone else's model,"" said Bak. ""They're going to pave the way, and they're going to create a new model for how grocery shopping can be.""One thing is clear: This massive acquisition means that the list of Amazon-proof stores is getting smaller.""As other brick and mortar retailers have come to realize the hard way that competing with Amazon is a formidable challenge, supermarkets will now have to contend with not only competition with each other and nontraditional grocers like Wal-Mart and Target, but with a retailer like Amazon which has the financial capacity to price aggressively,"" said Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha in an emailed statement, adding that ""smaller regional supermarket chains and independents will bear the most pain.""Kroger, which plunged 19% Thursday after warning on full-year earnings, sank 9.2% on Friday to a two-year low.Wal-Mart, Costco and Target shares also were big losers, along with dollar stores and drugstores with significant grocery operations. Sprouts Farmers Market was down 6.3% after losing 9.4% Thursday.Wal-Mart has been seen as a growing Amazon competitor online, reporting revived e-commerce growth in recent quarters and making several initiatives such as curbside delivery and discounts for in-store pickups. It's also made several online acquisitions, announcing Friday that it will buy Bonobos, an upscale online men's apparel site, for $310 million.But UBS' Lasser said the Amazon news may have a more limited impact on Costco and specialty stores.""COST's limited assortment, low cost structure, and deep private label penetration probably means that its fortunes will be preserved, at least for the foreseeable future,"" Lasser wrote. ""Further, the dollar stores like DG and DLTR tend to serve a customer segment that lives in rural areas or has limited resources or looking for a fill in trip. Thus, those models may not see as much change as is feared.""RELATED:Amazon Is Buying Whole Foods For $13.7 Billion, Roiling SectorAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesCould Trump-Bezos Tension Imperil Amazon-Whole Foods Deal?Amazon's Next Big Growth Play Will Surprise You

234,KR,"Greg Steltenpohl is a pioneer in the nonalcoholic beverage industry. And he has advice for the entrepreneur who thirsts to make it big. If you want to win in a product category, study hard and truly grasp what your competitors do.Then go out and create something unique. Or make the product a different way.That advice from the head of Califia Farms may be easy to swallow, yet it's hard to do.How does one get started on the right path and do both things well?The CEO revs up his team by inspiring it to imagine, think, design and execute steps into the future.""At Califia we're trying to build innovation and kind of asking the question about the question after the question,"" Steltenpohl told IBD. ""We're trying to build that kind of culture of inquiry into everything that we do. And when you apply that type of cultural attribute to fundamental business aspects like manufacturing, it emerges as a core strategy.""Sweet TriumphsSteltenpohl knows about success in the tough field of beverages.He turned the U.S. fruit and vegetable juice market on its head after co-founding the Odwalla brand in 1980. That firm focused on minimally processed juice. He sold it to Coca-Cola (KO) in 2001 for $181 million, worth $242 million today.Steltenpohl is doing it again, this time via 5-year-old Pasadena, Calif.-based Califia Farms, which he co-founded with Sun Pacific.Califia has become a giant in almond milk, one of the fastest-growing niches in the food and beverage industry. How does Califia take Steltenpohl's advice to heart?When he started the company in 2010 and began production in 2011, he re-entered the citrus juice market. In his eyes, since citrus is the No. 1 beverage-flavoring agent in the world, Califia could not become a serious player without having at least one product in that category.So his team pondered this point: What could grow to become as popular as orange juice?They decided to develop a market in specialty flavors such as mandarin orange and clementine.Four years later, according to Steltenpohl, Califia is the country's largest producer of tangerine juice.Califia created California Lemonade with its different taste. ""The Meyer lemon has 10% to 15% less acid (than other lemon types). It has a much rounder flavor, and so you can lower the sugar content (and) increase the drinkability and the (beneficial) effects on people's stomachs,"" Steltenpohl said.Soon he moved into almond milk. Before making a single quart, his team thought hard about how to approach the market.Here's To Improvement""We weren't the first to market. Our thought process was, 'How can you make it better? How can you leapfrog where the pack is and really make something that provides a benefit and is not simply another brand?'"" Steltenpohl said.His solution was to reinvent the manufacturing process. Large almond milk makers cook up the nuts with heat and oil, then mix the resulting butter with water.Such a process creates oxidized byproducts, affecting taste.In contrast, Steltenpohl uses a method that he equates to recipes that date back to the Middle Ages.Rather than heat the almonds, Califia artisans blanch the skin off, make what Steltenpohl calls soaked milk flour, and then apply filtering steps. ""This allows us to place more almonds per ounce than most of our competitors and come up with an ultracreamy, velvety mouth feel without traditional food science techniques and lots of gums and binders,"" he said.Califia continues to innovate with products that range from almond-milk-based horchata to Double Espresso Pure Cold Brew Coffee With Almondmilk to agua fresca drinks with flavors such as watermelon, strawberry, mango, basil, ginger and chili lime.As of July, Califia products are in 27,000 retail outlets, including Kroger (KR), Safeway, Wal-Mart (WMT), Whole Foods (WFM), Gelson's Markets, Fresh & Easy and Stater Bros.Steltenpohl forecasts annual sales to hit $100 million in 2016.""Greg is a once-in-a-lifetime leader with whom to work,"" said Kaitlin Walter, a Califia marketing officer who joined the firm after a stint at Coke. ""Greg takes everyone's point of view seriously, weighing the various opinions from his team carefully before making executive decisions. He encourages all Califia employees to think creatively and out of the box, both by example and through encouragement.""Big MoneyFurther growth looks likely. On Sept. 15, Califia announced a $50 million investment by Stripes Group, a New York equity firm focused on consumers and tech.While almond milk industry sales are growing at a 40% annual clip, according to a report in May by market researcher Packaged Facts, Califia's Almondmilk brand enjoys 177% yearly growth.Dan Marriott, managing partner at Stripes, calls Steltenpohl a ""true product visionary"" and adds, ""Greg is assembling an amazing team and has cultivated a culture of rapid innovation focused on delivering premium, healthful products.""Steltenpohl, 60, has lived near oranges his entire life. During childhood, his family moved from Homestead, Fla., to Southern California's Highland area, once a hotbed of orange growth.""My father always picked houses away from people and near orange groves, so I was raised near the smell of orange blossoms,"" he said. ""This made a deep imprint on me. So when I was just out of college and broke, making fresh squeezed orange juice just made sense.""That college was Stanford, where he says he was the first to design and complete an undergraduate degree in environmental studies.After college, he joined two partners to start Odwalla as a simple business, selling fresh-squeezed orange juice out of a van in Santa Cruz, Calif. The idea was to offer something of premium quality.Sales grew, and Odwalla expanded outside of California by 1994.Two years later, an outbreak of E. coli bacteria contaminated a batch of apple juice shipments. Odwalla juice used blemished fruit, killing a child and sickening 66.It was not only tragic but also a public relations disaster. Sales dropped 90%, according to a Harvard Business School case study published in 1997. In 1998, Odwalla agreed to pay $1.5 million and admit guilt to charges of selling contaminated juice.Steltenpohl learned that to prevent such a calamity from recurring, a leader must have operating principles in place for factory workers to report any problems directly to top management.Steltenpohl is married with three sons, all of whom work in the beverage industry. He carries such passion for his products that he hasn't let a liver transplant several years ago slow his effort to meet with buyers at big trade shows such as Expo West in Anaheim, Calif.Winning WayIt's clear to Steltenpohl that corporate culture is vital.""One of the biggest things I learned is that you can use your culture as a significant competitive advantage and as a kind of business systems strategy,"" he said, adding: ""All of a sudden, you're bringing in all sorts of creative opportunities. You're bringing in a higher degree of quality control. And you're bringing kind of an excitement, you're infusing culture with a closeness to the product. I feel all of those pay off in the long run. I learned that at Odwalla, and I've been applying it in spades here at Califia.""

253,KR,"Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.Weakness in the IPO market continued Thursday, as electronic-payments-processing giant First Data (FDC), the largest new issue this year, struggled to get out the door.First Data priced late Wednesday at 16, below its estimated range of 18 to 20. The IPO raised $2.6 billion, below plans to raise $3 billion. The stock opened at 16.39 and remained up a fraction much of the day, but closed down 1.6%, at 15.75.The initial public offering still managed to be the largest this year, surpassing Tallgrass Energy (TEGP), which raised $1.2 billion with its IPO on May 6.First Data provides a range of credit-card and electronic-payment-processing services, including fraud prevention, for merchants and financial institutions. In 2014, it processed 74 billion transactions globally, the company said. First Data reported revenue of $11.2 billion for 2014, with a net loss of $458 million.First Data was taken private by KKR (KKR) in a leveraged buyout eight years ago for $25.6 billion.Signs emerged heading into the IPO that First Data was struggling to attract institutional investors at its price range.Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPO Boutique, was advising clients to remain ""extremely cautious"" about the deal due to the high level of long-term debt ($20.7 billion) held by First Data, its slow revenue growth and other factors.""It's a buyer's market, a tough IPO market right now,"" Sweet told IBD in an interview Wednesday.Albertsons, SynCardia Hold OffAnother IPO that was scheduled to price Wednesday, supermarket chain Albertsons, was postponed ""due to market conditions."" Albertsons was set to be the second-largest IPO this year. It planned to raise about $1.6 billion, offering 65.3 million shares at 23 to 26 each.Albertsons is the No. 3 U.S. grocery-store chain, behind Wal-Mart (WMT) and Kroger (KR). An investment group led by Cerberus Capital Management bought Albertsons nine years ago and combined it with Safeway, acquired for $9.4 billion in March. The company operates 2,205 stores across 33 states.SynCardia Systems, a developer of implantable artificial hearts, withdrew its plans for an initial public offering on Tuesday.Of the five IPOs that debuted last week, four priced below their estimated range. The only one that didn't was Pure Storage (PSTG), which priced at 17, the midpoint of its range. Pure Storage, a provider of flash-chip-based storage products for the enterprise market, raised $425 million. The stock closed Thursday at 19.68, down a fraction.In Q3, the IPO market slowed to 34 deals, down 43% from the year-earlier quarter, says Renaissance Capital, amid a broad market sell-off and the near absence of technology deals. The IPOs raised $5.1 billion, the lowest amount since Q3 2011.Initial public offerings backed by venture capital also fell sharply in Q3. Thirteen venture-backed IPOs raised $1.75 billion in Q3, a 55% decrease in the number of offerings from Q2 and a 54% decline in the total amount of dollars raised, reports the National Venture Capital Association.The NVCA says that 50 venture-backed companies have filed with the SEC to make an IPO. Mobile-payment services provider Square filed plans late Wednesday for an IPO. The SEC filing did not include the number of shares to be offered or the price range, which will be determined later.Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Twitter (TWTR), is also co-founder and CEO of Square.Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.

254,KR,"The time when customers paid for their purchases by swiping their credit cards and signing a paper receipt is coming to an end. New cards with a microchip and PIN have made their inroads into the financial payments market. And October 2015 marks an important steppingstone in this transition.
"
255,KR,"Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) stands to benefit from this industrywide shift. The Ohio-based company operates on both sides of the same market: It provides a full suite of payment services to merchants on the one hand; and on the other, it produces the physical cards for financial institutions across the U.S.
"
256,KR,"Thanks to its extensive distribution network and access to both large and small merchants, Vantiv is the second-largest merchant acquirer in the U.S., representing an 18% market share in total payment transactions, overtaking a unit of Bank of America (BAC) in 2014. First Data ranked at the top. Vantiv also ranks as the No. 1 U.S. merchant acquirer in PIN debit transactions. An acquirer is a bank or other institution that accepts card payments in the merchants' behalf.
"
257,KR,"On the financial services side, Vantiv holds a 10% market share in the U.S., representing more than 1,400 banking and financial customers. ""It is the electronic middleman that enables and links electronically retailers and point-of-sale systems to the card brands and to the card-issuing institutions,"" said Raymond James analyst Wayne Johnson.
"
258,KR,"Among its clients are Macy's (M), Office Depot (ODP), Kroger (KR), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), In-N-Out Burger, Wendy's (WEN), Comerica Bank (CMA) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB). More recent additions include Rabobank, Capital One Financial (COF) and the U.S. Postal Service.
"
259,KR,"Among The Big Processors
"
260,KR,"The company ranks fourth among 28 names in IBD's Finance-Credit Card-Payment Processing industry group. Other players in the group include Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Total System Services (TSS)and Heartland Payment Systems (HPY). The group itself is ranked No. 29 among IBD's 197 industries.
"
261,KR,"Originally a spinoff from Fifth Third Bank, Vantiv loaded up on technology and additional distribution capabilities to conquer the fast-growing market of electronic payments. It expanded its growth organically via a strong referral business and inorganically through a few key acquisitions.
"
262,KR,"As a result, it's been able to grow revenue at a 40%-plus rate for the past nine consecutive quarters. Earnings per share increased 15% to 26% during the past six quarters. Its stock is up 36% so far this year.
"
263,KR,"The transition to chip cards, or what the industry calls EMV migration, has challenged the industry. October is the target for the so-called ""liability shift."" After the shift, when a transaction takes place, the party with the weaker technology will bear the cost of the possible hack or fraud.
"
264,KR,"That's why most national merchants, retailers and banks have been working hard to issue the EMV cards and install EMV card terminals. Those cards carry a chip and are accessible with a PIN instead of the classic magnetic cards that require a signature. The technology embedded in the chip is much more complex; it makes point-of-sale transactions a lot more secure and the cards nearly impossible to duplicate. The chip cards alone do not enhance online payment security, though.
"
265,KR,"This system has already been in use for many years in Europe and elsewhere in the world. EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), the originators of the standard. The U.S. is the last payment market to migrate to it, mostly due to the vastness of the old tech and the cost and complexity of the transition.
"
266,KR,"The result is that more credit card fraud migrated to the less secure U.S. market over the years. Now that chip cards will enhance the security on that end, the risk may shift to the weaker links in the industry: small and medium-size businesses and online users.
"
267,KR,"That's where Vantiv comes in.
"
268,KR,"In addition to being a leader in the EMV transition, Vantiv also has taken steps beyond it. ""We think that the best way for the merchants to protect information is to do what we call a security suite of products, which is accepting EMV cards but also encrypting the information and tokenization,"" said Vantiv CEO Charles Drucker.
"
269,KR,"Point-to-point encryption helps merchants protect client data. ""If the data is encrypted from the point they swipe the card to the point that it's received by us as payment processor ... that data is now protected and virtually impossible to unencrypt, and that's a value-added service we make revenue on,"" said Andrew Ciafardini, vice president of corporate communications for Vantiv.
"
270,KR,"The other tool is tokenization, which removes the credit card number completely from the retailer's system. Instead, the retailer gets a representation of the number, which is called a token and is specific to that retailer, Ciafardini explained. ""So even if the system were breached, a criminal could not use that token anywhere else.""
"
271,KR,"Growth By Acquisiton
"
272,KR,"Vantiv has made three acquisitions in recent years. At the end of 2012, it acquired Litle, an independent e-commerce payment processor for Internet and direct-response marketing transactions. Its customer base includes Overstock.com (OSTK), Ancestry.com and Wayfair (W).
"
273,KR,"""That was a technology-based acquisition,"" said Nathan Rozof, senior vice president of investor relations at Vantiv. ""Today, we're using that e-commerce technology to win clients like the USPS, where they need help processing not only in all their post offices but also USPS.com and the kiosks.""
"
274,KR,"The other two acquisitions relate to the integrated payment space. Whenever a merchant, such as a restaurant, buys the software to manage its orders, inventory, kitchen, employee time and accounting, Vantiv can integrate the payment processing technology and offers 24/7 help lines for all platforms if any issues arise.
"
275,KR,"Vantiv's purchase of Element in 2013 brought innovative technology into this integrated payment space, while the larger Mercury buyout in mid-2014 brought with it one of the largest distribution channels in the U.S.
"
276,KR,"More Sales, Cybercrime
"
277,KR,"The company is certainly benefiting from a positive secular trend. ""The macro backdrop has been a positive (for Vantiv), and the declining gas prices have helped fan its sales growth,"" said Jason Deleeuw, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""We think payment security at the small and midsize merchant level is a key driver of growth for the larger, more sophisticated merchant processors like Vantiv.""
"
278,KR,"Vantiv also plans to use its large cash position to consider offshore acquisitions, grow its core business and return capital to shareholders.
"
279,KR,"As with any business, there are risks. Analyst Johnson mentions integration risk of its acquisitions, pricing pressure from financial institutions, PIN-network transaction-fee declines and economic risk.
"
280,KR,"But the company has ambitious plans to grow its market share. From its spinoff in 2009 to today, Vantiv has grown its U.S. payment transactions share from 13% to 18%.

297,KR,"Whole Foods Market (WFM) has named a new chief financial officer, chair of the board, chair of the nominating and governance committee, and five new independent board members, as the upscale grocer slinked by second-quarter revenue estimates after the close. The move comes amid continued business struggles and buyout buzz.""We are accelerating our path to enhanced value creation to deliver better returns for our shareholders,"" said Whole Foods CEO John Mackey in a statement that outlined updated strategic initiatives. ""Today's announcement is a powerful combination of accelerated initiatives and new cost savings with clear timelines to deliver. We are on a path to return to positive comparable store sales and earnings growth next year.""Incoming CFO Keith Manbeck, who starts in one week, comes from Kohl's (KSS) as senior vice president of digital finance, strategy management and business transformation.Gabrielle Sulzberger, a longtime independent director, was named new chair of the board. Mary Ellen Coe is the grocer's new chair of nominating and governance committee.Among the new independent directors: Panera Bread (PNRA) CEO Ron Shaich, as his bakery-cafe chain recently accepted a buyout from JAB Holdings.The Wall Street Journal reported before the close, citing people familiar the matter, that the board changes were not a settlement with Jana Partners, the activist hedge fund that recently disclosed a sizeable stake in Whole Foods.Estimates: Profit to tumble 16% to 37 cents a share on a 0.8% revenue dip to $3.73 billion. That would be the first sales drop in years.Results: 37 cents per adjusted share on revenue of $3.74 billion. Same-store sales tumbled 2.8%.Outlook: Diluted EPS of $1.30 or greater, vs. prior outlook for $1.33 a share. Revenue growth of 1% or more, down from previous guidance for 1.5% gains. Whole Foods reaffirmed a same-store sales decline of 2.5% or better in fiscal 2017.Stock: Shares rose 2.1% to 37 in late trading after closing down 0.9% to 36.25 in the stock market today. Buyout chatter has lifted the stock in recent weeks, most noticeably on April 10, when shares popped 10% on news of Jana Partners' 8.3% stake in the company and the hedge fund's reported interest in a Whole Foods sale.The stock is up about 18% so far in calendar 2017.Why It Matters: Because of all of the M&A whispers. Ceberus Capital Management-controlled Albertsons is reportedly exploring an acquisition of Whole Foods, according to a late April report from Financial Times. Jana Partners has taken an 8.3% stake in Whole Foods, seeking big changes or a sale. The reported Whole Foods board shakeup could be a preemptive move to fight Jana Partners.Among other takeover news, a Bloomberg report from earlier last month that Amazon (AMZN) had ever-so-briefly internally toyed with the notion of buying out Whole Foods, and an earlier Bloomberg story from March that said Albertsons was in early talks to buy Whole Foods peer Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and take it private.Sprouts topped estimates when it reported last week, as EPS grew 10% to 33 cents and revenue rose 14% to $1.13 billion. Analysts had expected 30 cents in per-share earnings on $1.11 billion. Sprouts rose 1.3% to 23.63, its best close since July 2016.Grocer sellers from Whole Foods to mainstream giants such as Kroger (KR) to dollar store operators have come under pressure amid food cost deflation, in part due to renewed price cutting by retail giant Wal-Mart (WFM). Wal-Mart is offering curbside pickup while Amazon is expanding its AmazonFresh home delivery. Whole Foods relies on tech unicorn Instacart to provide delivery.RELATED:Whole Foods Shares Up On Report That Albertsons Is Grocery ShoppingThis Stock Is Up On News That Amazon Even Thought About Buying ItWhole Foods Jumps On Jana Stake As Private Equity Eyes Grocers
"
298,KR,"Whole Foods Market (WFM) shares rallied on a Financial Times report that Albertsons is exploring an acquisition of the natural-foods grocery chain.Albertsons parent Cerberus Capital Management is said to have held preliminary talks with bankers about a potential takeout offer, though no formal bid has been made, said the outlet, citing sources.This is not the first reported takeover chatter in the grocery space that has stemmed from the same private equity firm. Bloomberg said last month that Cerberus-controlled Albertsons was in preliminary discussions to merge with Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and take the grocer private.Shares of Whole Foods closed 2.1% higher at 36.46 on the stock market today after surging as much as 4.5% intraday, while Sprouts sold off 3.3% on fading hopes for an Albertsons buyout.Discussions between Sprouts and Albertsons have not proceeded, said Financial Times sources.Whole Foods had previously leapt 10% on April 10 after Jana Partners disclosed that it had acquired an 8.3% stake in the company, with a potential goal of nudging it toward a sale.Two days later, reports emerged that Amazon (AMZN) had briefly pondered internally whether to buy Whole Foods, also bumping up shares. Kroger (KR) also has been mentioned as a possible Whole Foods buyer.Since the latest takeover chatter began last month, Whole Foods stock has soared 25%.RELATED:This Stock Is Up On News That Amazon Even Thought About Buying ItWhole Foods Jumps On Jana Stake As Private Equity Eyes Grocers
"
299,KR,"Shares of Whole Foods (WFM) spiked to their highest level since July after Jana Partners disclosed an 8.3% stake, reportedly with an eye toward pushing the upscale grocer to gauge interest from potential buyers, just weeks after Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) became the subject of takeover talk.In an SEC filing on Monday, Jana and others disclosing a stake said the shares were ""undervalued and represent an attractive investment opportunity."" The disclosure also said that Jana and the others intended to hold discussions with management about Whole Foods' ""chronic underperformance for shareholders.""The discussions could also concern potentially shaking up the board and management, ""optimizing"" its real estate strategy, and addressing weakness in customer loyalty, analytics, and digital and other technology.The Wall Street Journal reported that Jana would try to get Whole Foods to assess how much someone might want to pay to buy the chain.Shares of Whole Foods jumped 10% at 34.17 on the stock market today, shattering through the ceiling of a flat base. Sprouts rose 1.1%, climbing intraday to an eight-month high.United Natural Foods (UNFI), a distributor of natural and organic groceries, crashed 8.2%. Kroger (KR) rose 1.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Whole Foods likely isn't the only company that may have to ""optimize"" its real estate strategy. The retail sector overall has been seen as having too many stores.Whole Foods has also suffered as Kroger and others that have typically competed more on value stock their own aisles with fresher, higher-quality fare.Even as Whole Foods works to shed its ""whole paycheck"" reputation with its ""365"" format, which is more focused on cheaper products, grocery prices have trended lower in recent months, resulting in discounts that shoppers like but that hurt sales.The disclosure comes after Bloomberg last month reported that supermarket operator Albertsons, which is controlled by the private equity firm Cerberus, had engaged in early-stage discussions to possibly combine with Sprouts Farmers Market and take Sprouts private. Kroger was also rumored last year to be interested in buying Whole Foods.RELATED:Kroger Expects Grocery Woes To Continue After Same-Store Sales Fall

300,KR,"Call it a different kind of ""Amazon Effect"" on retailers: Shares of Whole Foods Market (WFM) rose 1.7% in the stock market today following a report that Amazon.com (AMZN) internally toyed with the idea of acquiring the upscale natural-foods grocery store chain.The notion reportedly didn't take off past the discussion stage, but the idea was that Whole Foods would reinvigorate Amazon's grocery efforts, according to Bloomberg, citing a person familiar with the matter.Whole Foods, with a near-$11 billion market cap, would be a huge challenge for Amazon. But Wal-Mart (WMT) is quickly becoming a serious online rival that is taking advantage of its physical locations. Wal-Mart already offers curbside pickup for online grocer orders and just announced that it will offer discounts for many online orders that are picked up in stores.Activist investor Jana Partners ultimately took an 8.3% stake in the grocer, saying in an SEC filing that Whole Foods shares are ""undervalued and represent an attractive investment opportunity,"" and that it would discuss with management the chain's ""chronic underperformance,"" among other things.That disclosure from Jana, which included the possibility that it might engage in a sale or merger for the grocer, sent Whole Foods shares up nearly 10% on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon has been plowing into the grocery space for a while now, developing online grocery delivery and reportedly planning to build convenience stores. Amazon shares fell 0.65% to 896.46 on Wednesday, still in range from an 860.96 buy point from a four-weeks tight pattern.Along with Amazon, Kroger (KR) and Albertsons were also names tossed into the mix of Jana's potential bidders, according to Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with Jana's thinking. Kroger rose 1%.Albertsons, controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, reportedly had held preliminary talks with Whole Foods rival Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) in March. Sprouts fell 1.3%.RELATED:Wal-Mart Will Pay You To Pick Up Your Online Orders; Your Move, AmazonKroger Expects Grocery Woes To Continue After Same-Store Sales FallAmazon Pushing Deeper Into Grocery Business With New Store Plans

301,KR,"Online giant Amazon (AMZN) on Tuesday fired another salvo at brick-and-mortar retailers with a new service designed for the time-sensitive shopper who purchases groceries on the internet.Dubbed AmazonFresh Pickup, the offering allows consumers to order groceries online and then collect their purchases from a physical location at a convenient time. So no more waiting in line at the grocery checkout — or even waiting for the delivery truck to show up.Instead, at AmazonFresh-branded pickup locations, a company employee will load shoppers' grocery bags into their cars. There are no purchase minimums and orders can be picked up in as little as 15 minutes, according to the company.The long-rumored move intensifies Amazon's attempts to shake up the U.S. supermarket industry — one of the largest retail segments in terms of total sales, and one of the few where traditional brick-and-mortar companies have been able to successfully defend against competition from online retailers — said Christian Magoon, founder of Amplify Investments.""Grocery shopping has the unique issue of consumers wanting to see their food and have it be fresh and to pick it up themselves,"" Magoon said. ""If Amazon gets a foothold there, it will be an incredible growth opportunity for them.""However, one equity research firm expects online groceries to be a key driver of accelerating online shopping activity in the years ahead, growing at two times the rate of overall U.S. e-commerce growth. And young Americans are driving the charge in online grocery shopping, according to March 1 report from Cowen and Company.Roughly one in five millennials between the ages of 25 and 34 bought groceries online — more than any other age group, their survey found.The AmazonFresh truck delivery service, now a decade old, helped Amazon make inroads as a grocery brand. However, that service costs $15 a month for delivering groceries to a shopper's doorstep, while AmazonFresh Pickup locations will be free to use.AmazonFresh Pickup is currently in beta testing with employees at two locations in Amazon's Seattle headquarters. It is not yet open to the public.Shares of Amazon punched up 1.1% to close at 856 on the stock market today amid an analyst upgrade and an announcement that the company is set to acquire Souq.com, one of the largest e-commerce firms in the Middle East.Supermarket rivals Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and Kroger (KR) also rose Tuesday.The supermarket and mini-market industry group ranks No. 176 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, one of the many segments of the retail sector that is struggling as more and more Americans choose to do most of their shopping online.Magoon's Amplify Online Retail (IBUY), a young exchange traded fund offering exposure to online retailers, has gained 15.33% since its April 2016 inception.By comparison, SPDR S&P Retail, an ETF peer with a hefty stake in brick-and-mortar stores, has given up roughly 9% over the same period.RELATED:Amazon Makes Big Middle East Play With Souq.com Acquisition

302,KR,"Shares of natural foods grocery chain Whole Foods (WFM) rose Monday, potentially due to report that grocery-store operator Albertsons was considering a merger with Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM).Whole Foods also rose last week following a massive run-up for its natural and organics grocer rival last week, although the reasons behind Sprouts' gains were unclear at the time. Friday was a quadruple witching day, during which several options and futures expired.Bloomberg reported on Sunday that Albertsons, controlled by private equity giant Cerberus, had recently held preliminary discussions to potentially merge with Sprouts and take it private. However, no deal was yet in place, and one might not materialize.Sprouts popped at the open, climbing as high as 23.07, but reversed to trade down 0.9% to 21.83 Monday. But that's after soaring 23% last week.Whole Foods rose 1.1% to 29.85 after reaching as high as 30.17 in the stock market today, finding resistance near its 50-day moving average. Whole Foods climbed nearly 4% from Tuesday's intraday low to Friday's close as Sprouts took off.Kroger (KR) was rumored last year to be interested in buying Whole Foods.Whole Foods has struggled as more traditional grocers — such as Kroger — take a page from its playbook, offering more organic and higher-quality fare on their own shelves to compete.But Kroger and other mainstream and value grocers also have struggled in recent months amid broad food price deflation, in part driven by Wal-Mart (WMT). Wal-Mart, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, is the No. 1 U.S. grocer.Kroger fell 1.2%.

303,KR,"Albertsons Cos. has held preliminary takeover talks with Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Bloomberg reported Sunday, after Sprouts stock enjoyed its best weekly gain since its initial IPO week 2013.Albertsons, backed by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, has been in negotiations in recent weeks to take the natural foods grocery private, Bloomberg said, citing sources. Albertsons Cos. owns the Albertsons and Safeway chains.Sprouts surged 23.4% to 22.02 in stock market trading last week, its best post-IPO debut weekly gain and its second-heaviest weekly volume. Sprouts retook its 200-day moving average for the first time in more than nine months. The stock is still in a downtrend that goes back to October 2013, just a few months after the chain came public.There was very little news at the time to explain the stock's advance, which came during a quadruple witching of options and futures contract expirations.The grocery business is under intense pressure. Food price deflation is weighing on natural food chains such as Sprouts and Whole Foods Market (WFM), but also broadline operators such as Kroger (KR) and discounters such as Dollar General (DG) and Target (TGT). Whole Foods Market, after its latest earnings report, said it would close a few locations, the first time it's done that since the recession.Wal-Mart (WMT), the world's largest retailer, is the largest U.S. grocery seller. Wal-Mart, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, has made a greater effort to push prices lower to boost sales. Wal-Mart also is trying to step up its online grocery offerings, as Amazon (AMZN) and a slew of upstarts try to upend the business.RELATED:Kroger Expects Grocery Woes To Continue After Same-Store Sales FallAmazon Fresh Rival Instacart Valued At $3.4 BillionWhole Foods Market Closing Stores After Weak Sales, Guidance

312,KR,"Department stores such as Macy's (M), J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) sold off Monday on little news, as investors continue to lower their prospects for traditional retailers as shoppers increasingly shift to Amazon.com (AMZN) and other e-commerce sites.Macy's fell 3.8% to 29.37 on the stock market today, trading at its lowest levels since early February, when takeover buzz began.Kohl's sank 4.8% to 38.56, setting a seven-month low intraday.J.C. Penney retreated 2.3% to 5.85, hitting a five-year low. Regional department store operator Dillard's tumbled 4.5% to 49.79, also hitting its worst levels since early 2012.IBD's Retail-Department Store group, rated dead last out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, was the biggest losers in Monday's session. Macy's and Kohl's were among the very worst performers on the S&P 500 index Monday.Department stores are working hard to try to be viable, emphasizing their online presence. But Amazon is grabbing a huge share of online sales growth and boasts bigger shipping discounts than even major retailers. Brick-and-mortar chains hope to better-leverage physical stores for online pickups and returns. But at the same time they are slashing their store count. That lowers costs, but calls into question the very omnichannel model they are trying to use to battle Amazon.IBD'S TAKE: Despite their brick-and-mortar woes, traditional retailers are seeing big online sales gains, but from very low levels.Target (TGT) fell intraday to a five-year low, though the retailer closed up 8 cents to 54.37. Target has been lumped in with department stores, especially after its weak Q4 earnings report and guidance.Amazon, for its part, rose 0.55% to 856.99. Amazon is still in buy range from an 821.75 entry and is setting up in a four-weeks-tight pattern with an 860.76 buy point.As for other retailers, Wal-Mart (WMT) isn't doing as badly as some of its rivals. Wal-Mart saw sharp online sales growth over the holidays, with U.S. same-store sales rising. Wal-Mart is re-emphasizing lower prices, a push that's squeezing everyone from Macy's to Target to grocers such as Kroger (KR).Wal-Mart shares closed up 0.1% to 59.98 Monday. But Wal-Mart stock is below its 200-day line and its relative strength line shows the retail giant is an S&P 500 laggard.Off-price retailers such as TJX (TJX) and Burlington Stores (BURL) are near highs, but they too retreated Monday, down 1.3% and 2%, respectively.RELATED:Macy's, Costco, Kohl's And Other Retailers Are Getting SlammedRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingTarget Dives To 2014 Levels: 'We're Slow And Have Too Much Inventory'J.C.

Investors eyed the highly anticipated initial offering of social networking site Snap (SNAP).The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropped 0.2%.A strong session Wednesday sent the Dow industrials to their first new high above the 21,000 mark. That left the Dow 5% above its 50-day moving average — the level that has generally been followed by moderate pullbacks since April 2016.The stock market today is riveted on the launch of Snap, which priced its initial offering above expectations at $17 a share Wednesday. Five minutes after the opening bell, trading in the stock had not yet started. That put the market cap of the popular video messaging app near $24 billion, making it the largest tech IPO since China's Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) in 2014.But Monster Beverage (MNST) was the early newsmaker, surging 13.5% after reporting late Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings jumped 52%, hurt by distributor termination charges and just shy of analyst targets. A 17% revenue gain handily beat expectations, and management announced a new, $500 million share buyback initiative. Monster has been consolidating and is now back above its 50-day moving average for the first time since August.Broadcom (AVGO) pounded out a 4% advance to new highs. The diversified chipmaker turned in earnings growth of 49% on a 134% rise in revenue for its fiscal first quarter, comfortably above analyst forecasts.

317,KR,"A yawning trench of dirt, wood and exposed cables currently sits at the mouth of the Westfield Century City in west Los Angeles. The Apple (AAPL) store is still open and the Tesla (TSLA) showroom has been moved to a different spot, but much of the shopping center remains under construction.When it reopens this year, it will have expanded into a glamorous 1.2-million-square-foot beast of a mall — 422,000 square feet larger — complete with Italian food emporium Eataly, hip burger joint Shake Shack (SHAK) and ""new high-fashion streetside boutiques.""XIn fact, the Century City mall won't just be a mall, it will be ""an immersive sensory experience unprecedented in the modern retail space,"" according to a 2015 Westfield press release. This location hardly needs a tuneup. With $1,457 in sales per square foot, it is the ninth-most productive mall in the country, according to a CNBC story from May, citing real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. So why spend $800 million on a makeover?Looks matter more than ever, particularly as social-media bragging rights become an essential part of the millennial shopping experience. So these days, every retailer has to put on a good show, ramping up the drama to boost foot traffic and cheat death as Amazon (AMZN) spells doom for more and more American malls.""(Young people are) very into cataloging everything they do via social media, and so these more luxury experiences have more social currency,"" said Talmage Advisors CEO Liz Dunn.That could mean Snapchatting from inside a Tiffany (TIF) — regardless of whether you buy something — or taking a topside photo of your artisanal lunch. (Never has flat lay photography been so popular.)""Whatever it is, there's a lot more social currency to that than saying 'I'm at a TGI Friday's,' "" she said.The mall's transformation into an ""immersive sensory experience"" contrasts with the post-World War II bloom of malls, which attracted Americans to cookie-cutter hubs with their one-stop-shopping convenience. That has since given way to the splendid isolationism of two-day shipping via Amazon Prime, hollowing out traditional malls and forcing the survivors to become purveyors of experiences that can be shared online.Fellow L.A.-based shopping center The Grove, owned by Caruso, underscores the trend and is a social-media maven's dream.It houses many of the same stores as a regional mall does — like Banana Republic, J. Crew and Anthropologie — but also features a fountain, trolley and live music, helping put it at No. 2 on CNBC/Green Street Advisors' list with a $2,200 in sales per square foot. The photogenic plaza was even once the backdrop for Hollywood-gossip show ""Extra,"" which has no doubt upped its social cred among tourists who want a glimpse of glam.""This is where all the B-list celebs, YouTube stars, and Instagram influencers shop (I saw an Instagram male model there myself when I went),"" gushed one Yelp reviewer visiting from Toronto.The lure of exclusivity, that close cousin of luxury, is another way retailers have amped up the theatrics.It's a tactic long employed by an athletic-footwear industry that routinely releases shoes in small batches, driving up demand from sneakerheads and high-schoolers alike. There's even a sneaker stock exchange, StockX, devoted to the resale of Jordans, Kobes and anything Kanye has ever designed for Adidas.Other retailers have since caught on. Coach (COH) and Disney (DIS) last year introduced a limited-edition House of Mouse-themed handbag line. Spice Girl-turned-fashion designer Victoria Beckham is behind Target's (TGT) upcoming capsule collection. And H&M seems to have an endless series of designer linkups in the pipeline.The New York Times even declared 2016 ""the year of the drop,"" referring to the slew of limited-edition releases and pop-up shops, like Kylie Jenner's blink-and-it's-gone store, designed to create shopper frenzy.The Hollywood Reporter called the December opening of Jenner's pop-up, located within the Westfield Topanga Mall in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, ""mayhem.""Mayhem is the antithesis of convenience, when it comes to shopping. But that is the point. No one wants to stand in line outside for hours waiting for laundry detergent. A Kylie Lip Kit, however, is not long for this world.To get a teen or 20-something to the mall — and most ""drop"" shoppers are under 30, noted the Times — the mall must act a little more like a nightclub, velvet ropes and all.Even supermarkets are in on the action: Some Whole Foods Market (WFM), Kroger (KR) and Gelson's locations feature wine bars, a premium add-on meant to keep grocery shoppers in stores longer.Such theater may seem gimmicky, but it works, and is also being seen in actual theaters. The local cineplex, a requisite component of any shopping mall, is also undergoing a revamp.On the defensive from Netflix (NFLX) and massive TVs, theaters have been making screens bigger, audio better, and seats more spacious. And as an alternative to grabbing popcorn from the concession stand and trying to find a decent seat, more theaters now serve cocktails and dinner to your reserved Barcalounger while that summer blockbuster plays in Imax 3D.AMC (AMC), for example, embarked three years ago on a $600 million reseating project to rip out traditional chairs and replace them with recliners.AMC, which has called its collective upgrades a ""winning playbook,"" outlined at a recent presentation that attendance has grown 53% and revenue leapt 70% in its 1,500 or so reseated theaters. It has thousands more theaters in line to be updated.Top exhibitor chain Regal Cinemas (RGC) also recently attributed recent outperformance to plush seating, calling out recliner sites as the ""biggest driver.""""Theaters have to do something to differentiate themselves from the in-home experience,"" said RBC analyst Leo Kulp. ""That's really what's driven these investments over the past several years.""Theaters, full-service restaurants and other bells and whistles have woven themselves into a successful mall's narrative, but it may be a while before the experiential stuff surpasses retail stores that sell shirts and shoes.""The future will certainly bring less retail, but it will take a few years to tip the scale"" so that retailers become a mall's minority residents, said NPD Group retail analyst Marshal Cohen.There is also some hope for once-reliable mall anchors like Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), even as Macy's reportedly considers selling itself after a brutal holiday season.The Grove has a Nordstrom, and the revamped Westfield Century City is actually adding a department store to the mix, for a total of three major names. It will now house a two-story Macy's, three-story Bloomingdale's and a three-story Nordstrom that is being relocated from the next mall over.But the massive upgrades being made to shopping arenas could even further widen the gap between top-market malls and their less-moneyed brethren.Of the more-than-1,000 malls in America, the 300 or so top-market ""A-malls"" account for 75% of mall value (a metric comprised of sales productivity, size and other factors), according to Green Street Advisors.So what's a midtier mall to do? For developers, the answer may be: Change or die.Strong anchors are ""imperative"" for a shopping center's long-term viability, according to Green Street's 2017 mall outlook report, since income-generating tenants want malls with ""vibrant,"" traffic-driving anchors.As department stores waver, Green Street's research points to restaurants, movie theaters and ""traditional power-center tenants"" — like Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and pet stores — as rising power players.But Talmage Advisors' Dunn is not optimistic.""The problem is, it's a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophesy,"" she said. ""The landlords aren't willing to invest in the lower-tier centers, and the thing that would potentially take a lower-tier center to help it jump a bracket is investment. But it's hard to justify the investment if the center's performance isn't in that top-tier range.""

The merger has put the company firmly into the Big Cap 20 this week.Qorvo makes high-performance radio frequency products that work in mobile devices.The combined company had triple-digit earnings growth the past few quarters. Analysts are forecasting a 79% year-over-year earnings increase for the current quarter.Qorvo's trailing four-quarter return on equity is an impressive 40.3%, well above the 17% standard that investors should seek. After-tax margin is 27.3%.The stock is consolidating. To a novice, it might look like it's formed a cup-with-handle base, but it has consolidated for just six weeks, shy of the seven-week minimum for a proper cup with handle. It may be better to treat the pattern as a cup without handle.Kroger (KR) might seem an unlikely growth stock. But the operator of grocery stores has redesigned its stores and is offering more organic and natural foods, keeping pace with changing customer tastes and with competitors like Whole Foods Market (WFM).Whole Foods is another Big Cap 20 member.Earnings growth at Kroger has accelerated from 17% to 30% to 33%. In the next report, analysts forecast a 12% year-over-year increase in EPS.Revenue over the past year has run in the high single-digit to low double-digit zone, which is fairly typical for the industry.

Revenue is seen growing 9% to $3.69 billion vs. 10% growth in Q2.Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh expects same-store sales to miss consensus views, which could weigh on the grocer's stock.""Based on our work, we believe comps could come in around 2.5%, slightly below a 2.9% Street figure,"" said Parikh in a Monday note. ""Historically comp shortfalls have represented negative catalysts for shares.""Shares have been falling since July 17, edging down 0.9% to 40.07 in the stock market today. The stock has been trading below its 50-day line since breaking support last week.Parikh cut his price target to 48 from 50 ""to reflect increased risks with the company's new strategy, as well as what appears to be a step up in the competitive environment for natural/organic lately.""As more stores widen their selection of natural and organic fare, Whole Foods has faced pressure from traditional grocers like Kroger (KR) and big-box retailers such asTarget (TGT).Part of the company's ""new strategy"" also includes an attempt to draw the millennial market. In June, it unveiled 365 by Whole Foods Market, a ""streamlined, value-focused brand"" that will open shop next year.The millennial-focused concept didn't sit well with some analysts. Cowen and Co. analyst Jerry Gray reduced his price target on the company to 46 from 53 on July 13 on the ""increased risk"" the new chain poses.""Although our proprietary survey data suggests the market opportunity for 365 is massive, we see elevated risk to sales and margin due to competition with the core Whole Foods brand and online search data points to slowing mind share among consumers,"" Gray wrote.But delivery — a feature more companies are rolling out — could be a sweet spot for the company.Gray wrote Monday that Whole Foods, which has a partnership with grocery delivery service Instacart, is ""best positioned to gain share"" in the online grocery delivery market. Instacart also offers delivery from membership warehouse store Costco (COST).Panera Bread (PNRA), Starbucks and Whole Foods Market ""are best positioned to benefit as these brands have favorable perceptions among higher income and urban demographics and have demonstrated the most willingness to grow the delivery channel,"" he said.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has also recently introduced its own delivery options.Last month, Whole Foods came under fire for allegedly overcharging New York City shoppers, though it has denied doing so.

406,KR,"The sales numbers from big U.S. retailers over the holidays were deflating — with the notable exception of e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN), which had its best holiday season ever.But the pressure Amazon has applied to Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and other retailers is about to get more intense with Amazon's expansion into its opponents' lair: brick-and-mortar retail.Amazon is set to open its first Amazon Go convenience store, an actual physical store. Other Go stores will soon follow.Amazon Go, announced in early December, is a small (1,800-square-foot) convenience store with a novel twist — there are no check-out lines. In-store wireless technology will tabulate your purchases and charge your Amazon account.Physical-store retailing may never be the same, some observers say.""The most impressive thing they are doing is tying together the best retail technology into one operation that should effectively reinvent the basic retail model as we know it,"" said Bill Bishop, co-founder and managing partner of Brick Meets Click, a consulting and retail advisory services company. ""What Amazon is doing will radically increase the efficiency and productivity of the retail model.""IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is gaining ground in large retail markets beyond its core markets of electronics and media, putting the e-commerce giant in position for a strong performance in 2017.The Amazon Go stores will sell a range of groceries, specialty foods and ready-to-eat meals. The first Amazon Go, near Amazon headquarters in Seattle, is being tested by Amazon employees ahead of the official opening, which the company says will be early this year.Amazon says its checkout-free shopping experience ""is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning."" The technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track.Amazon hasn't said how many Amazon Go stores it plans to open, but its usual intent is to make every market it enters a multibillion-dollar business. The company does now have three physical bookstores (in Seattle, Portland and San Diego) that are more or less conventional stores, though customers can download books they find in the stores to their Kindle or other devices. Five more bookstores are in the works, in New York City, Chicago, New Jersey and two Boston suburbs.The stand-alone grocery store, however, marks a new phase in Amazon's ambitions to rule at least parts of the conventional brick-and-mortar store world. Besides Go, Amazon reportedly is exploring other formats for food stores and curbside pickup facilities.Amazon stock, trading near record highs touched in October, rose 0.74% to 827.46 in the stock market today. The stock has formed a cup-with-handle base, with a buy point of 843.94.Wal-Mart is paying attention. The No. 1 retailer intends to bring online ordering of groceries and curbside pickup service to nearly a quarter of its roughly 4,600 U.S. stores by year-end, Wal-Mart executives recently said. Wal-Mart also has reorganized its e-commerce unit and assigned new executive positions.And in September, it bought rising e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Jet.com founder Marc Lore is now CEO of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operation.Meanwhile, Amazon continues to experiment in the grocery business aside from the Go stores. It offers a same-day and next-day grocery delivery service, through Amazon Fresh, in several big cities. But delivering groceries that customers order online has been a failed business model for about 15 years — first tried then abandoned by companies such as Webvan during the go-go dot-com bubble period around 2000.Bishop says Amazon, too, might be such a casualty — unable to attract the high volume of customers needed to make grocery deliveries a profitable business,""I think they hit a bit of a wall in terms of growth and penetration,"" Bishop said. ""I believe that Amazon Fresh has not met their expectations, and that the Amazon Go store is a response"" to that failure, as Amazon tries ""to figure out how to get more people buying their groceries.""Amazon is attacking the grocery market from the angles of a hybrid model that includes online shopping, a grocery pickup service and in-store no-checkout shopping, approaches ""we believe will accelerate Amazon's penetration in the grocery business,"" Bishop said.Amazon is deep in a test-and-learn stage with groceries and Amazon Go, says Meaghan Werle, an analyst at broad-based retail consulting firm Kantar Retail""We expect a slow and pretty disciplined rollout of this store concept as Amazon tries to figure out how to sell groceries and tackle the brick-and-mortar space,"" Werle said.Amazon Go extends Amazon's foray into the physical world that started with the bookstores — the first one opened in Seattle in November 2015 — where besides books Amazon also features its consumer electronics products, the Kindle e-readers, Echo and Echo Dot home smart speakers, Fire tablet and Fire TV stick.Amazon also reportedly plans to open dozens of small pop-up retail kiosk-type storefronts  in shopping malls over the next year to showcase its hardware devices.""Amazon has acknowledged that there is value in brick and mortar,"" Werle said.There is a lot of value, in fact. Annual U.S. grocery and beverage sales alone approach $800 billion,""Consumables are such a huge interest to Amazon,"" said Werle. ""And in order to expand their grocery presence they need to establish more brick-and-mortar stores.""The small-store concept in groceries, however, already has been tried and abandoned by retailers such as Wal-Mart.In 2011, Wal-Mart began experimenting with a small-store concept called Express, which included low-cost goods and groceries. Wal-Mart eventually closed all 269 stores.Werle says Amazon has a better shot at success thanks to its efficiencies in its supply-chain delivery process and other technologies that fit better with small-store economics.A report from Cowen last March said Amazon already controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion U.S. food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart, including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to Cowen analysts John Blackledge. Kroger is No. 2 with a 9% share, followed by Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix.In December, Amazon announced it would expand its full-time U.S.-based workforce by 100,000, to a total of 280,000, by mid-2018. The company said the added employees are needed in large part to staff the expansion of their order-fulfillment centers.But Pacific Crest Securities says the new hires also could be part of Amazon's push to accelerate efforts to build physical stores.""Amazon will also add nonfulfillment center jobs, but we think that still leaves a significant and unexplained gap,"" wrote Pacific Crest analyst Edward Yruma. ""We believe that this could be explained by an accelerated rollout of physical stores.""In particular, he wrote, ""We think that a potential grocery pickup concept looks particularly promising.""RELATED:Amazon: Still The E-Commerce Elephant In The Retail Room?After The Mall Doors Close, Analysts Cut Macy's, Kohl; Chipotle UpgradedRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingNordstorm's '1972' Warning Is Another Sign Of Dying Malls

409,KR,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) should win regulatory approval soon, the New York Post reported Wednesday, sending shares of both drugstore chains higher.The Federal Trade Commission is trying to get the $9-a-share deal, first announced back in October 2015, OK'd before Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20, the New York Post said, citing a source. Trump is expected to ask FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez to step down, leaving the FTC with just two commissioners on a five-person board.The FTC deal will include Rite Aid's planned sale of 865 stores to Fred's (FRED) to satisfy antitrust concerns. That action will more than double Fred's footprint.Walgreens Boots Alliance climbed 2.1% to close at 84.43 on the stock market today after rising intraday to 85.26. Rite Aid jumped 3.4% to 8.60. Fred's initially rose but reversed to trade down 5% to 16.93.Kroger (KR) at one point had been in the running to buy some Rite Aid locations, but reportedly had wanted to close many of those sites and make them in-grocery locations. The FTC wanted stand-alone stores. Kroger shares dipped 0.4% to close at 33.07.IBD'S TAKE: Telecom companies could make a flurry of takeover deals during the Trump administration. In 2017, telecom M&A scenarios trump earnings outlooks.Separately, Walgreens and FedEx (FDX) announced a deal to offer FedEx pickup and drop-off at Walgreens locations. The service will begin at a few stores in the spring, but the plan is to expand to nearly 8,000 locations by the fall of 2018. The deal would expand FedEx delivery options and give e-commerce shoppers a reason to come into Walgreens.FedEx shares fell 0.4% to 189.24.

George for men will also be getting a refresh. The latter is a popular brand at the firm's Asda stores in the U.K., where it is marketed as quality fashion clothing at affordable prices.The new brands will be available in online and in stores starting March 1.Walmart will also be jazzing up its clothing departments, with signs and fitting group upgrades coming to select storesIt is also launching the Allswell line of mattresses and bedding, which will be Walmart's first digital brand. It will be sold through AllswellHome.com rather than in stores.The S&P 500 component has acquired small online brands including Shoebuy, Modcloth and Bonobos over the past 12 months as it works to boost growth in its clothing and accessories business, a popular space among online consumers. It is also dedicating space to department store Lord & Taylor on the Walmart website, a tie-up which comes into force this spring.The moves come as analysts question whether Walmart can compete with online retail giant Amazon.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.""Compared to Amazon's 24% growth in the fourth quarter for online stores and third-party seller services off a dramatically larger base, it is becoming increasingly clear that Amazon's lead over the traditional retailer is only growing,"" Evercore analyst Anthony DiClemente said in a research note.""This lead is likely to take on greater importance as billions of e-commerce dollars come up for grabs in the coming years from greater penetration of FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] categories,"" he added.Amazon shares edged down 0.7% Tuesday.However Walmart is working to close the gap, and last month it emerged the retail behemoth had trademarked the name ""Wam! by Walmart,"" which was described in its U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filing as ""retail and online grocery store services featuring home delivery service.""Walmart also is currently pilot-testing fresh grocery delivery in six markets, via several couriers: Deliv in San Jose; Uber in Phoenix, Tampa, Orlando and Dallas; and in-house trucks in Denver. The pilot program is meant to provide insights into the process — presumably so Walmart can later figure out how to best scale up operations.Walmart also offers in-store pickup for online grocery orders, and is tooling around with avant-garde concepts such as ""in-fridge delivery,"" which allows delivery drivers to ostensibly place groceries directly inside customers' refrigerators at home, using smart-home technology.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

435,KR,"Kroger (KR) is said to be considering a bid to acquire Overstock (OSTK), a move that would put America's largest supermarket chain squarely in the home decor business and expand its digital footprint.X The New York Post, citing a source, reported the possibility Friday. Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne told CNBC in December that he was looking to ""walk away"" from the e-commerce company's retail business in 60 to 90 days amid a pivot to blockchain technology. He floated, as one option, the possibility of selling the retail unit to a traditional brick-and-mortar.Kroger currently hawks home fashions and home decor through its Kroger Marketplace locations, but an Overstock deal would expand its presence. It might also give the supermarket chain some breathing room from the low-margin grocery business amid an ongoing price war with the likes of Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Amazon.com (AMZN).IBD'S TAKE: Everyone's getting in on the online grocery action. As Investor's Business Daily reported Thursday, Wal-Mart has trademarked ""Wam! by Walmart,"" described as ""retail and online grocery store services featuring home delivery service."" The move comes as the nation's largest retailer competes with Kroger and Amazon for shopper dollars. Overstock shares spiked 9% in the stock market today. Kroger shares rose 2.3%. Amazon climbed 0.1%.Such a deal would also give Kroger a bigger footprint online, as brick-and-mortar retailers continue to seek out ways to fend off Amazon and other online shops. Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year has also put it more squarely in competition with traditional grocery stores.Kroger has reportedly been in advanced talks to acquire digital wholesaler Boxed.com, dubbed ""Costco for millennials,"" a company that the Post says has also gotten investment interest from General Mills (GIS) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY). The startup would bolster either company's distribution network.Costco Wholesale shares inched up 0.4%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Raises Monthly Fee On Prime Membership Program 18%Here's Why Wal-Mart Is 'Still Very Much In Control Of Its Own Destiny'Here Are Your 20 Cities Vying For Amazon's New Headquarters

440,KR,"Concerns that Whole Foods Market (WFM) has too many rivals in upscale groceries are overblown and have gone ""stale,"" Sterne Agee said Wednesday in upgrading the stock to buy from neutral.Sterne Agee analysts said in an upgrade note that while there was little to drive same-store sales growth in 2013, Whole Foods has emerged from 2014 as a ""stronger and more focused"" company that was ""back on the offensive."" Sterne Agee also raised its price target on the stock to 60.The investment firm also raised its first-quarter earnings-per-share expectations by a penny to 46 cents, which is also a penny above analyst consensus. Sterne Agee also hiked its EPS outlook by 7 cents to $1.77, above views for $1.72.Shares rose 3.4% to 53.08 on the news in the stock market today. Earlier, they peaked at 53.29, their highest point since March.The high-end grocery chain, which has helped steer consumer tastes toward healthier, purportedly higher-quality food, has faced competition from the likes of Kroger (KR) and Costco (COST), which have tried to appeal to more refined tastes without the steeper costs.But Sterne Agee cited a variety of recent developments at Whole Foods to justify their upgrade that may encourage shoppers to keep paying a bit more: the growth of home-delivery plans via Instacart; stronger marketing efforts; the incorporation of Apple Pay in all of its locations; a produce rating system and events such as its ""Wine Club"" delivery service.As the economy continues to rebound, wealthier shoppers, who were more protected from the downturn to begin with, will continue to help drive Whole Foods' same-store sales to the upper end of the company's 2015 forecasts of gains in the ""low to mid-single digits"", Sterne Agee said. Sterne Agee also said that the company has directed more effort toward reducing employment costs, via a more effective combination of part-time and full-time staff, and making shipping more efficient.Sterne Agee also said that those savings would free up more opportunity to cut prices. In particular, they see Whole Foods' recent moves to cut prices for produce and meats, where the price difference between Whole Foods and rivals is often the widest, drawing more customers.Since Whole Foods' most recent quarterly report in November, shares have spiked 33% and coasted well above their 50-day line. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 and has outperformed the broader market.Kroger shares rose 0.7% to 66.83. Costco fell 0.3% to 138.90.

495,KR,"Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) initially moved into a buy zone after delivering some pleasing preliminary earnings results. But shares reversed to close lower.X The natural foods grocery-store chain said late Monday that it expects to report per-share earnings ""slightly above its previously announced guidance"" of 98-99 cents, as well as a 15.3% net sales gains and 2.9% in full-year same-store sales growth.That compares to current analyst estimates for 99 cents EPS and 14.9% in sales growth for the year, according to Zacks Investment Research.Shares rose as high as 35.50 in the stock market today, crossing a 25.10 entry point from a stage-one bottoming base. But Sprouts reversed, closing down 1.5% to 24.39.In the release, Sprouts CEO Amin Maredia called the performance ""a direct result of our unique model offering health and value across the store, consistent execution and focus against our strategic initiatives.""For Q4, Sprouts said it sees 4.6% same-store sales growth. The announcement preceded a presentation Tuesday morning by Sprouts' CEO and CFO at the yearly ICR Conference, a key retail and restaurant-industry event.But Morningstar analyst John Brick remained cautious.""We believe the announcement shows the benefits of Sprouts' differentiated model and value proposition to its customers, but we aren't wavering from our no-moat rating, as we fear the intense competitive environment will constrain profitability, as well as the firm's ability to generate excess returns on invested capital over time,"" he wrote.IBD's TAKE: What is a ""bottoming base""? Here's how to spot one.Sprouts, Kroger (KR) and other grocer stocks faced pressure last June after Amazon first shocked the market with news that it was acquiring Whole Foods market. Then soon after the deal closed, Amazon cut prices on certain items at Whole Foods, pressuring shares of its rivals further.And now, Whole Foods products are available via Amazon, as major grocery players like Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Kroger work on developing their own grocery delivery capabilities.With Tuesday's move, shares of Sprouts have finally recovered above the 25 price point, a level not seen since the days before Amazon's bombshell announcement.Separately, Sprouts announced Tuesday a new partnership with Instacart, a move that will help the grocery store to expand home delivery service to major markets beyond the eight cities that Sprouts currently services.Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz. will be the first cities to benefit from the deal, with more cities to be announced at a later date, said the company.""Home delivery is a natural way for Sprouts to engage with our customers on their healthy living journey, and our partnership with Instacart allows us to quickly scale for growth,"" said Maredia in a release on the partnership.Target said last month that it was acquiring Instacart rival Shipt, axing its relationship with Instacart.Shares of Amazon rose 0.5%, and Kroger lost 0.7%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Here's How Target, Amazon Are Expanding Same-Day ShippingKroger Earnings Unexpectedly Rise Despite Amazon CompetitionHere's Everything That's Changed At Whole Foods After The Amazon TakeoverRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

496,KR,"What kind of person is most likely to shop at Amazon's (AMZN) new cashierless, cashless convenience-store concept, Amazon Go? The same kind of shopper who already makes frequent pit stops at BJ's Wholesale, Trader Joe's and Wal-Mart (WMT)-owned Sam's Club, according to research and consulting firm Magid.X ""These three stores should be looking at what Amazon is doing as the overall concept provides the greatest opportunity, or threat, to their business,"" said analysts in a release.The first Amazon Go, located in Seattle, flung open its doors Monday, finally inviting everyday shoppers to peruse aisles powered by computer vision and deep-learning algorithms, and walk out the door without having to line up at a cash register. (The app automatically charges your Amazon account for whatever you take.) The store had, before that, only been open to employees as part of a beta rollout.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon isn't the only major retailer furiously developing tech-forward grocery concepts. As Investor's Business Daily previously reported, Wal-Mart recently trademarked ""Wam! by Walmart,"" a concept that relates to ""retail and online grocery store services featuring home delivery service.""Target (TGT), Kroger (KR) and Costco Wholesale (COST) should also be concerned, said Magid, since more than half of Target and Kroger customers, as well as 44% of Costco shoppers, said they would consider shopping at an Amazon Go-style store.Traditional grocery stores are also at risk of losing shoppers to Amazon's concept, said the firm.Amazon hasn't indicated what its plans are for scaling up the concept, but it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine the e-commerce behemoth trying to incorporate the technology into its Whole Foods Market locations, or Whole Foods' millennial-focused ""365 by Whole Foods"" stores.After acquiring the upscale grocer for $13.7 billion last year, Amazon quickly began offering its smart-speaker devices at Whole Foods, and says it is working on integrating Amazon Prime into Whole Foods' point-of-sale system, intending for the online retailer's membership service to act as the grocery store's customer rewards program.Magid says Amazon Go's largest potential market consists of millennials and households with kids, with more than three in five of either category likely to shop there.""The implication is clear for retailers that desire to appeal to the growing millennials subset, which is becoming more and more comfortable with an online, on-demand world: Amazon will play large in the mindset of these customers and it is imperative that they catch up,"" said the firm.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: FANG Stocks News & Quotes Apple (AAPL) Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart AnalysisBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And TrendsRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

497,KR,"Bitcoin's rebound paused Friday afternoon, after stabbing below the $10,000 barrier earlier this week on fears that regulators here and abroad could be looking to stamp out various forms of  cryptocurrency trading.X Bitcoin was up 1% at $11,371 after nearly retaking $12,000 earlier, according to CoinDesk. Ethereum was up 0.3% at $1,037.61.The cryptocurrencies' recovery comes after the SEC, in a letter dated Thursday, said it had asked fund sponsors to withdraw  registration statements filed for any funds with substantial investments in cryptocurrencies. The agency said there were a ""number of significant investor protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin offering these funds to retail investors.""Meanwhile, South Korea's government said it was ""considering both shutting down all local virtual currency exchanges or just the ones who have been violating the law,"" according to a Reuters story dated Wednesday.Reuters on Tuesday also reported that a China central bank official said centralized trading of cryptocurrencies and related businesses should be banned.And the operators of the lending and exchange platform for Bitconnect, a cryptocurrency that some have alleged is a scam, said Tuesday the platform would be immediately shut down. They cited ""bad press"" and two cease-and-desist letters from regulators in Texas and North Carolina as among the reasons.A day later, a post on Bitconnect's website said only the lending platform would be closing and that the exchange ""will work as usual"" starting Thursday.The moves by regulators come amid growing warnings about cryptocurrencies' volatility, security and potential for fraud.IBD'S TAKE: Bitcoin's meteoric rise has done more than make some daredevil investors rich overnight. It's also put blockchain — the software technology enabling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — on a trajectory of its own.Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan on Wednesday said during the company's earnings call that ""customers should be careful"" when approaching Bitcoin.Goldman Sachs (GS) CFO Martin Chavez on Wednesday also weighed in on Bitcoin, saying that blockchain, the record-keeping technology behind Bitcoin transactions, was likely among the ""important drivers of innovation"" for the company.And he said the issue behind Bitcoin — how to get a bunch of people to agree on a ""shared reality"" — had been around for decades.He also said there were many issues to sort out before moving forward on trading financial products tied to Bitcoin.""Now, the broader question of will there be trading in these instruments that are linked to Bitcoin, there is just a huge number of topics to address and being a part of the industry, we're working on all of that,"" he said.""Custody is a part of it and it's a very complex one,"" he continued. ""So, it's really too early to say how that will evolve for the industry or for ourselves.""As for blockchain-related stocks, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) closed 0.6% higher at 19.91 on the stock market today.

514,KR,"Investors looking to buy a great stock should not only study its earnings and sales growth. Be sure to also check out a company's profit margins. Profit margins measure how much a company keeps on every dollar of sales. For example, a company that earns 22 cents for each dollar of sales before taxes has a 22% pretax profit margin.Profit margins are closely watched by Wall Street analysts and fund managers because they provide an indication of a company's fundamental strength.In some cases, a company's margins may be rising because it enjoys strong pricing power due to unique or superior products and services versus the competition.In other cases, a company may be superior at keeping costs low.Rising profit margins can justify higher stock prices. On the other hand, falling profit margins can hurt a stock, especially if they're caused by a company that's cutting prices to sell its products.On Jan. 13, the stock of KB Home (KBH) crashed 16% after the homebuilder warned that margins were declining. The company said it was being squeezed by rising building costs and falling home prices.There are a variety of definitions for profit margin, but IBD focuses on quarterly after-tax and annual pretax margins.Looking only at quarterly margins can be misleading, as some companies' products or services may be influenced by the seasons.For example, Apple's (AAPL) sales tend to rise around Christmas, while those of homebuilders such as KB Home tend to fall in the winter due to harsh weather.In such cases, it's best to compare quarterly after-tax margins to the same period a year earlier.Also, since profit margins vary widely by industry, it's important to compare companies in the same industry.For example, tech stocks like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) tend to have much wider margins than grocery stores like Kroger (KR) that have famously thin margins.Just because a stock has fat profit margins doesn't mean it's a buy.Investors should look for accelerating quarterly and annual margins. They should be near or at the company's historical peak and among the highest in its specific industry.A company's annual pretax margin can be found in the Stock Checkup feature at Investors.com and in charts accompanying the IBD 50, the Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and Income Investor columns.A pair of other measures give an indication of a company's strength.IBD's SMR Rating combines a company's sales, profit margins and return on equity into a single indicator. Stocks are ranked on a scale of A to E, with A being highest. Investors should look for those rated A or B.The stocks in the table accompanying this story were taken from a recent IBD 50 list. All show strong annual pretax margin in the prior fiscal year.

Kroger shares rose 3.5% on Wednesday, continuing a two-month rally.IBD'S TAKE: In a discount world, companies like Amazon and Target are looking to private labels to make a bit more money. Last month, Kroger said it is looking at selling its $1.4 billion convenience-store business.The decision comes as Amazon bought Whole Foods back in August, cutting prices on select staples like ground beef, eggs, fish at the at the upscale grocery store.Over Thanksgiving, Amazon Prime members were able to get organic and antibiotic-free Thanksgiving turkey at Whole Foods at a discount to draw more customers to buy its Prime membership.But Kroger had a strong Black Friday.""The holidays are always Kroger's time to shine,"" McMullen said.  ""In fact, we had our best ever Black Friday results for general merchandise, led by record sales at Fred Meyer. Everything we are doing revolves around our associates providing friendly service and fresh products to our customers.""But not everyone is feeling the squeeze from Amazon. Earlier this month, Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) crushed Q3 same-store sales forecasts and raised full-year guidance above consensus views.Wal-Mart is the largest U.S. grocery seller, and has expanded online ordering and curbside deliveries.Amazon rose 1.3% Thursday, Sprouts Farmers Market climbed 1.3%, and Wal-Mart dipped 0.3%.RELATED: Here's Everything That's Changed At Whole Foods After The Amazon TakeoverRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

548,KR,"Amazon (AMZN) Prime members can now get their organic and antibiotic-free Thanksgiving turkey at Whole Foods for a little bit cheaper than everyone else.XThe massive e-commerce company, which bought Whole Foods in August, is offering a discount on organic and no-antibiotic turkeys for anyone who enters one of the upscale grocer's airy, lushly stocked stores. But Prime members can buy organic turkeys for $2.99 a pound and antibiotic-free ones for $1.99 a pound — that's 50 cents cheaper than the discount for people who aren't Prime members.The discount is the latest attempt by Amazon to draw more customers into its Prime membership program. The move could also help Whole Foods compete for a customer it hasn't always been successful at attracting — that is, the many who don't have $10-$20 to blow on, say, a sampling of Robusto and a bottle of Saison Dupont.""This offer is a sneak preview of the special savings and in-store benefits Prime members can expect when Prime becomes the official rewards program of Whole Foods Market,"" the companies said in a release.Other items will have their prices trimmed starting Wednesday as well. Those items include some boneless skinless chicken breasts, raw peeled shrimp, potatoes, Chobani yogurt, pasture-raised eggs, canned pumpkin and salad mixes.The companies said those price cuts were ""in addition to the reduced prices that customers are already enjoying."" After Amazon bought Whole Foods, the grocer slashed prices on beef, eggs, bananas, fish and other items.Amazon closed down 0.9% at 1,126.69 in the stock market today. The stock is still within range of a 1,083.41 buy point of a late-stage base. Grocery-store operator Kroger (KR), seen as a potentially big loser in Amazon's foray into groceries, fell 1.9%. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), which turned out strong Q3 results despite Whole Foods' earlier price cuts, lost 1.8%. Supervalu (SVU) edged up 0.2%.Big-box chains that also sell groceries like Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) dropped 10% and 1.4%, respectively, after Target gave a disappointing earnings outlook and warned of a ""highly competitive"" holiday quarter.IBD'S TAKE: In a discount world, companies like Amazon and Target are looking to private labels to make a bit more money. Grocery stores over the past year have struggled with lower prices due to a glut of certain types of goods. Consumer preferences have also shifted to the fresher items often found on the perimeter of the store, rather than the prepackaged goods in the center aisles.While Amazon's deep pockets give Whole Foods more room to cut prices, Target and other grocers, whose value game is stronger, have also tried to be a little bit more like Whole Foods.But while Target has tested a few new grocery strategies, the results have been ""underwhelming,"" an Edward Jones research note said Wednesday.""We expect the issues within the grocery business will continue to negatively impact results for the next few years because the company lacks a clear, defined strategy to improve the business,"" it warned.RELATED:Kroger Surges As It Considers Selling Its Convenience StoresThe Huge News Wal-Mart Didn't Make About WagesKroger's Hurricane-Less Outlook Adds To Amazon, Wal-Mart Fears

549,KR,"Organic foods distributor Hain Celestial (HAIN) has helped stimulate the popularity of healthier foods, a trend analysts expect to continue when it reports second-quarter results Wednesday.Analysts see Q2 earnings per share rising 18% to 52 cents and sales growing 33% to $715.51 million. The company, whose brands include Terra chips, Celestial Seasonings tea and Rice Dream milk substitutes, has turned out EPS and sales gains ranging from the high teens to the upper 30s over the past two years.Hain shares rose 2.4% to 54.05 in the stock market today after testing a recent low Monday morning.On Aug. 20, shares gapped up and finished 11% higher after reporting fourth-quarter results that topped views. After losing and retaking the 50-day line for much of the year, the Q4 report jolted the stock above the line for the next two months. The 50-day line is often a key test of investor support.Shares bounced off the line in October, and rose on Nov. 6 after the company's Q1 EPS topped views and sales missed slightly. The company during that quarter voluntarily recalled Arrowhead Mills nut butters on fears they might have contained salmonella. The stock fell below the line last month. Still, the stock is up 17% since the beginning of 2014.The company has grown through acquisitions as well as online and international sales. As reported here, Hain's U.S. market chief John Carroll said over the summer that Amazon (AMZN) was one of the company's biggest accounts. During the Q1 earnings call in November, CEO Irwin Simon said acquisitions grew revenue by $131 million during the quarter and cited continued strength in the U.K.Amazon shares rose 2.8% Monday.Hain's results come amid a more upbeat analyst sales outlook for natural foods, which are likely to be found in such upscale grocers as Whole Foods (WFM), Sprouts (SFM) and Fresh Market (TFM). Cowen, Sterne Agee and Bank of America analysts in recent weeks have cited consumers' increasing willingness to pay more for presumably healthier, higher-quality products, potentially rewarding those stores and the companies selling there.Still, RBC Capital Markets in December downgraded Hain to sector perform, saying organic sales had slowed domestically. And Zacks noted that the natural foods space has become more crowded, potentially weighing on Hain's Q2 resultsWhole Foods shares closed up 2%, while Sprouts and Fresh Market shares both fell about 0.5%.Hain's products aren't exclusive to higher-end stores and wealthier consumers. They also appear in Chipotle (CMG) restaurants as well as Kroger (KR) and Costco (COST) stores, a reflection of growing health awareness.Kroger shares were up 0.9% while Costco climbed 2.1%.WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), which competes with Hain, reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2014 results on Feb. 12.

586,KR,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance Report
"
587,KR,"The $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.
"
588,KR,"Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
589,KR,"That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.
"
590,KR,"And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.
"
591,KR,"In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.
"
592,KR,"Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.
"
593,KR,"The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.
"
594,KR,"Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.
"
595,KR,"IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?
"
596,KR,"Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.
"
597,KR,"In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.
"
598,KR,"Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.
"
599,KR,"So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.
"
600,KR,"IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?
"
601,KR,"Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.
"
602,KR,"IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.
"
603,KR,"Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
"
604,KR,"IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?
"
605,KR,"Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.
"
606,KR,"IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?
"
607,KR,"Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.
"
608,KR,"Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.

609,KR,"IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?
"
610,KR,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.
"
611,KR,"And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.
"
612,KR,"IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?
"
613,KR,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.
"
614,KR,"IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?
"
615,KR,"Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.
"
616,KR,"Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.
"
617,KR,"IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth. Is this a beneficiary of ObamaCare?
"
618,KR,"Hollond: The Affordable Care Act means more people are covered by insurance, so more people get health care and drugs. The ACA is a driver, but not the full story.
"
619,KR,"AmerisourceBergen is a pure play on drug distribution. If that's what you want to invest in, you can get that solely through AmerisourceBergen.
"
620,KR,"They've got some favorable fundamentals driving long-term attractiveness. With generics, after this year there will be robust acceleration in the generics launch calendar. That will provide a lift.
"
621,KR,"IBD: What about specialty pharmaceuticals?
"
622,KR,"Yogasundram: That's another area for them. They have key expertise. And there's robust growth in the specialty area. And it's higher margin. So it's an increasingly larger part of their business.
"
623,KR,"Let me mention one last thing. They acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, which presents an increasing market they can go after.
"
624,KR,"IBD: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a play on heightened concerns about network security, right?
"
625,KR,"Yogasundram: You're right. What you have today is an installed base of security that is woefully behind the threats.
"
626,KR,"Palo Alto is a next-generation security company, enabling customers to better defend themselves. Palo Alto is a secular share gainer. And it provides many more services than its layered defenses.
"
627,KR,"Their initial sale to a customer is an appliance. The second, third and fourth sales are higher margin. Their services can tell a customer exactly what happened (when a security breach occurs) and how to prevent that breach.
"
628,KR,"IBD: Lighting sounds dull. What's attractive about Acuity Brands (AYI)?
"
629,KR,"Yogasundram: Acuity is the largest lighting equipment company in the U.S. Adoption of LED lights is accelerating, especially as costs go down, so customers are layering in more products with LEDs.

630,KR,"When you have both cyclical and secular drivers, we really like that. That's what we have here.

631,KR,"IBD: What's your outlook for Electronic Arts (EA), which plans to release its next ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game about a month before December's scheduled debut of the next ""Star Wars"" movie?
"
632,KR,"Yogasundram: We started investing a couple of years ago when a new management team came in. They found a heavily bloated infrastructure. In the past couple of years they've reduced costs, reduced the number of (game) titles. Margins expand from 9% and 10% to 25% in the four or five quarters.
"
633,KR,"IBD: Is your stake in Hain Celestial (HAIN) a play on the growing appeal of organic and healthful foods?
"
634,KR,"Yogasundram: Correct. They've been in organic foods for some time. But we're really seeing two things happen. One is that organics is not just a Whole Foods (WFM) story (which the fund also owned as of its latest disclosure). It is also a Kroger (KR) story. It is a Target (TGT) story. Organic food is going from early adopters to more mainstream consumption.
"
635,KR,"That's a trend we're playing in a few different directions, including Whitewave Foods (WWAV) and Constellation Brands (STZ).
"
636,KR,"With Hain, they're selling more to Whole Foods and to Target and Kroger, so they're expanding distribution. And they're layering in more products. So it's a solid organic secular growth story.
"
637,KR,"IBD: Constellation isn't an organic play, so what is your thesis?
"
638,KR,"Yogasundram: There is a consumption change. Millennials and people in general are drinking beer less and wine and spirits more.
"
639,KR,"Constellation was part owner of Corona, the largest U.S. beer brand, and they brought the brand in-house and a few others like Pacifico. Since then, they've boosted advertising and brand awareness, and really started to grow that business. Beer is a 1% to 2% grower, but they've been growing it 10% to 11% to 12% the past couple of years.
"
640,KR,"They've seen better margins and better capital allocations and buybacks, but the crux is that they're a share gainer.
"
641,KR,"Corona grows faster than the U.S. market. There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.
"
642,KR,"Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.
"
643,KR,"IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?
"
644,KR,"Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.
"
645,KR,"And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets. If Yum (YUM) wants to grow in China, it needs more restaurants, more ovens.Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance ReportThe $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that.

On Friday, shares were trading near 63. Hain's stock rose more than 28% in 2014.Hain's equity outperformance ""should continue,"" said analyst Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research in a research note on Thursday, which had an ""outperform"" on the stock.""While valuation is high, we believe Hain can continue to outperform the market due to the uniqueness of its business,"" he wrote.Hain's health-focused products are carried in a number of grocery, specialty and mass-market stores, including Whole Foods (WFM), Kroger (KR) and Wal-Mart (WFM). Among its well-known brands are Celestial Seasonings, Earth's Best, Health Valley, Terra and BluePrint.Mushkin raised his earnings estimates for fiscal 2015 and 2016 to $1.89 and $2.20 per share respectively. That's higher than analysts' consensus of $1.88 for this fiscal year and $2.16 in 2016, which would imply year-over-year growth of 18% and 15% respectively. Hain's fiscal year ends in June.""With growing demand for natural and organic products, Hain is becoming a sought-after partner for many retailers,"" Mushkin said.Foreign exchange headwinds and the lingering impact of a nut butter recall and factory fire in the U.K. caused Hain to lower its outlook for the current fiscal year. It expects revenue to grow 23%-24% to $2.65 billion-$2.67 billion and earnings to come in at $1.85-$1.89, up from $1.59 last year.To better appeal to younger customers, Hain revamped packaging on its Celestial Seasonings tea line with lighter and brighter colors and is adding aseptic and ready-to-drink lattes, Mushkin noted.Continuing a long string of acquisitions, Hain acquired Empire Kosher Foods in early March. Empire manufactures kosher, antibiotic-free chicken and turkey products.Hain earns a strong 96 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99. Its the top stock by Composite Rating in IBD's food-packaged goods industry group, which is ranked a relatively weak 103 out of 197 groups.WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), a maker of plant-based beverages, is another strong performer in the group, with a Composite Rating of 94.

668,KR,"Kroger (KR) is slated to disclose third-quarter earnings early Thursday amid renewed strength in the grocery sector.The nation's largest supermarket chain is forecast to report double-digit percentage increases in both earnings and revenue compared with Q3 2013.The Cincinnati-based company on Nov. 14 announced plans to hire 1,200 employees to staff its Southern California Ralphs stores, which will push its total employee count above 20,000 in Southern California. Kroger employs 343,000 people in 31 states with the Ralphs, Dillon's, Fred Meyer, Fry's, Kroger and Smith's brands. It also runs the Quik Stop and Kwik Shop convenience stores.Consensus of 19 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for Kroger to report a 15.1% increase in earnings to 61 cents per share. The company beat Wall Street's target the prior three quarters.Kroger is projected to see revenue grow 10.2% to $24.81 billion, which would be its third quarter in a row of double-digit growth.The supermarket chain's stock price has surged 71% from a Feb. 5 intraday low of 35.13, hitting a series of all-time highs along the way.Its stock, which carries a strong 95 IBD Composite Rating, out of a best-possible 99, was trading at 59.96, up 0.2% in Monday afternoon trading after hitting a fresh high on Friday.Kroger is in the Retail-Super/Mini Market group, ranked a strong 29 on IBD's list of 197 industries, up from a lowly 140 rank six months ago.Analysts will be looking for indications of how Kroger is faring in the fast-growing organic and natural foods category. Kroger and Safeway (SWY) are trying to expand in the sector, challenging natural food grocers Whole Foods Market (WFM) and Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM).Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said on the company's last earnings call that more than half the company's customers buy some groceries in that category. ""That continues to increase,"" he said.Kroger is targeting that sector with its Simple Truth line of meat and other grocery items. Jefferies estimated the organic/natural food sector is already a $4 billion to $5 billion category for the company.Kroger's Q3 results will also reflect its Aug. 18 purchase of online vitamin, supplement and organic grocery retailer Vitacost for $237.7 million.Among other large grocers, Safeway was down 0.1% Monday afternoon.

He also noted ""extreme high-low marketing strategies.""Lower-priced competition will result in ""some painful changes at Whole Foods, but we have great respect for what the management team is trying to do,"" he wrote.Whole Foods' shares, which had been down sharply since May, bounced back earlier this month after the firm reported better than expected earnings and positive guidance.Still, Kroger's earnings are expected to grow faster than both Whole Foods and especially Wal-Mart, which is expected to log a 2% per-share decline in its January ending fiscal year, followed by a 5% gain next year.Shares of all three companies have moved higher in recent weeks, presumably due to the improving U.S. economy and consumer environment.

676,KR,"D.C. news moved markets during the week. The Dow and S&P 500 index hit record highs as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and other financials rallied on tax-cut hopes and rising bond yields. Stocks dipped Friday on a report that Michael Flynn, briefly President Trump's national security adviser, is willing to testify against Trump as part of a plea deal.Tech leaders, including many chip stocks and China internets, struggled. Bitcoin frenzy continued amid growing acceptance and concerns. General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019.X The Dow and S&P 500 rallied to record highs as tax-cut hopes lifted stocks generally, with the Flynn-Trump news only paring gains.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and other financials also rallied on rising bond yields while many retailers rebounded on holiday sales hopes.

The jolts came as smaller investors get more active in trading the much-hyped cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, big financial names continued to weigh in on the prospects of digital currencies: Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles called digital currencies a ""niche product"" that could pose ""serious financial stability issues"" if adopted more widely. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein told Bloomberg that something that ""moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel like a currency.""

Macy's (M) said it will hire extra holiday workers due to strong demand.General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019. The top carmaker in the U.S. sees self-driving vehicles as a cornerstone of future mobility — and a potential profit driver. It faces a slew of new entrants in a rapidly transforming auto sector, not least Alphabet (GOOGL) and its Waymo self-driving unit. Waymo — often seen as being furthest along on autonomous technology — said it will soon put passengers in driverless cars — without even a ""safety driver"" to take over the controls if things go wrong. But GM says its ability to both develop self-driving solutions and manufacture cars gives it an edge vs. tech rivals in the race to put self-driving cars on public roads on a commercial scale.

Powell also hinted that he favors a lighter touch on bank regulation.Meanwhile, the economy continues to show broad strength.

702,KR,"Michael Kors (KORS) slumped 6% on Aug. 4 in massive volume despite reporting another strong quarter of double-digit profit and sales growth.The culprit? Worries about the company's profit margins.Why are profit margins so key?They measure how much a company actually makes out of every dollar in sales. It's displayed as a percentage. For instance: If a company has a 22% profit margin, then it nets 22 cents per dollar of sales.Let's say that it costs a company $50 to manufacture a purse. If the manufacturer sells purses for $100 each, then he or she keeps $50 per purse as net income. That's a profit margin of 50% before tax.But if he/she sells purses for $25 each, then he or she is losing $25 per purse. There's no profit, or a 0% margin.The less it costs to produce goods, generally the higher the profit margin. Thus many U.S. companies have shifted production to China, India and other overseas countries, where labor costs are typically much lower than in the U.S.But strong margins can also come from a company's outstanding pricing power.Comparing Apples To ApplesProfit margins can vary widely by industry. Grocery stores are infamous for having razor-thin margins, for instance.Taking Kroger's (KR) 1.7% after-tax margin and comparing it with Facebook's (FB) 37.5% in their latest reported quarters isn't a fair comparison. Look at profit margins for companies in the same industry.Markdowns can affect profit margins, particularly in the retail space. The more that a company has to slash prices to sell an item, the lower its profit margin.This is what Kors is contending with. The Hong Kong-based company has been rapidly expanding — but it's also had to mark down prices on some of its affordable luxury goods. Kors expects second-quarter retail gross margins to fall 50 basis points.The stock fell 4% to breach its 200-day moving average on July 14, followed by a 7% drop as analysts lowered their price targets due to margin-related concerns.Where can you find profit-margin data? IBD looks at a company's quarterly and annual pretax and after-tax profit margins. You can find a company's latest annual pretax margin in our Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and Income Investor charts, just above the stock graph. It's also available online in IBD Stock Checkup at Investors.com. Or you can calculate net profit margin from a company's income statement by taking net income and dividing it by sales.To help readers save time, IBD offers its SMR Rating, a proprietary gauge that takes into an account a company's sales, profit margin and return on equity.Stocks are assigned a letter grade from A to E, with A being the best. Investors should focus on those that earn an A or B.The table above lists stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or better, Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings of 90 or higher, average trading volume of at least 400,000 and a profit margin of 10% or more.

720,KR,"Kroger (KR) kicked off its biggest rally in two years after saying it might sell its convenience-store business, a $1.4 billion operation that spans 18 states.XThe company began exploring strategic options for the business after a review found that it might have more value outside of Kroger, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday. The Cincinnati-based supermarket giant hired Goldman Sachs (GS) to help handle the process.""Considering the current premium multiples for convenience stores, we feel it is our obligation as a management team to undertake this review,"" Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman said in the filing.Kroger is evaluating operations at a time when Amazon (AMZN) is pushing into the supermarket business. The outlook for groceries, already a low-margin business, has been further complicated by the recent arrival from Europe of low-cost competitors Aldi and Lidl.Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., meanwhile, has been snapping up convenience stores across North America. The company agreed last year to buy the gas-station chain CST Brands Inc. for almost $4 billion, its biggest deal yet. That transaction brought Couche-Tard thousands of locations in the southeastern U.S., Texas and New York, as well as eastern Canada.Investors applauded the idea of Kroger's convenience-store sale, sending the shares up 6% Wednesday. That was the biggest intraday gain since September 2015. The stock had been down 41% this year through Tuesday's close.Kroger operates 784 convenience stores, employing about 11,000 people under the banners Turkey Hill Minit Markets, Loaf 'N Jug, KwikShop, Tom Thumb and QuickStop.

"
721,KR,"The news that Wall Street analysts, bond investors and Wal-Mart's (WMT) competitors all feared on Tuesday didn't happen.XShares of Wal-Mart had underperformed in the two weeks leading up to Tuesday's annual investor day, ever since rival Target (TGT) announced that it was hiking its minimum wage from $10 an hour to $11, with a commitment to hit $15 by 2020.The worry was that Wal-Mart, facing the same kind of wage pressures as Target amid 4.2% unemployment, would have to embark on a new round of pay increases. While Wal-Mart unquestionably enhanced its competitive position by investing an additional $2.7 billion in employee compensation in 2015 and 2016, while also investing heavily in e-commerce capabilities, the combination has been tough on profitability.Even as Wal-Mart's U.S. sales, excluding Sam's Club, rose nearly $20 billion, or 6.9%, from its January 2015 fiscal year through January 2017, operating income slid by $3.6 billion, or 16.8%.Wal-Mart signaled on Tuesday that those days of shrinking profits to secure its competitive position may be behind it. The company stood by guidance that earnings per share would grow 5% in the fiscal year starting February 2018.While Wal-Mart investors cheered the news, the whole retail sector likely breathed a sigh of relief. AutoZone (AZO) CEO William Rhodes said on an earnings call last month that wage pressures had accelerated ""significantly more than I have experienced in my nearly 23 years of AutoZone.""Rhodes said minimum wage laws explain only part of the pressure. ""Probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers.""""Other retailers"" surely referred to Wal-Mart, which bumped up its base wage to $9 an hour in 2015 and $10 in 2016. A host of other retailers, including Costco (COST) and Target, responded with their own wage hikes in the spring of 2016. Kroger (KR) and Target were among the best performing S&P 500 stocks on Wednesday. (Kroger also said Wednesday it is considering selling its convenience stores.)IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Wal-Mart cleared a buy point of 82.09 on its welcome guidance. A buy point is the point when an investor has the best chance of near-term gains. So far, Wal-Mart's stock has been a case in point, rising to 85.73. The stock is barely still within the 5% chase zone, above which it  is considered extended. To find other stocks poised for gains, start with these IBD lists.A new round of wage hikes by Wal-Mart, which has 1.5 million U.S. employees, would have put pressure on other modest-wage employers to match, and hawkish Federal Reserve policymakers keeping a close eye on wage growth as a precursor of rising inflation would have surely taken note.Because Wal-Mart's wage outlook has pretty sizable implications for the U.S. economy, the big question is why Wal-Mart doesn't think it will need to match Target's wage hike, at least in the near term. It's now been 20 months since Wal-Mart implemented its last big wage increase. Wal-Mart said at the time that the $10 minimum only applied to associates hired by Jan. 1, 2016, and that new entry-level hires would get a $9 starting wage. That will pale compared with Target's $11 an hour and the $12 starting wage that Amazon.com (AMZN) offered as it tried to recruit 50,000 workers during a one-day hiring spree in August.While Wal-Mart hasn't precisely spelled out its reasoning, here are some of the factors likely at play.One of Target's reasons for hiking its minimum wage to $11 right now is to help it attract 100,000 seasonal employees. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, which hired 60,000 seasonal workers back in 2015, has said it will get by without seasonal workers for the second straight holiday season. Instead, it plans to offer current associates additional hours.That potential for more hours is one of the ways Wal-Mart can deepen its relationship with its workers, while providing them with more income, even if it's not necessarily coming from higher wages. Under another new Wal-Mart program, associates can earn extra cash by delivering packages on their drive home from work, while helping to speed delivery to customers. Increased sales at Wal-Mart also have led to performance bonuses. In March, the company said that 850,000 associates shared $157 million in cash bonuses based on their stores' fourth-quarter performance.After Wal-Mart's first big minimum-wage hike in 2015, there were concerns that the morale of more experienced workers just up the pay ladder might suffer if they were left out. That explains, in part, why Wal-Mart broadened out the pay hike in 2016 to include 1.2 million workers. It's easy to see why Wal-Mart wouldn't want a repeat, if it can avoid it.At Wal-Mart's investor day, management said that the company has continued to increase pay, as needed, though on a market-by-market basis, depending on local conditions. The company also stressed, though not specifically with regard to wages, that it was more focused on having a performance-based culture after previously having ""set the bar too low.""By rewarding workers with promotions — 200,000 in fiscal 2017 — more hours and incentive pay, it's possible Wal-Mart may be able to defer another minimum-wage hike for some time without experiencing a troubling increase in turnover.Still, Wal-Mart's profit outlook doesn't look quite as impressive once you consider that the company also plans to buy back $20 billion in shares over two years. Buying $10 billion worth would shrink the share count by nearly 4% in the coming year at current prices, so 5% EPS growth might only translate to a 1% to 2% earnings rise, unadjusted for share count.RELATED:Wal-Mart Breaks Out On Buyback, Bullish Online Sales ForecastHurricanes Hit Payrolls, But Wage Gains May Speed Up Fed Rate HikesDid Target's Wage Hike Just Prove Fed Hawks Right — Or Wrong? Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Amazon announced that purchase in June, completed it in August, and began cutting prices on ground beef, eggs, fish and other items at the upscale grocery chain.BMO analyst Kelly Bania said in a research note last week that ""food retailers are likely to continue experiencing heightened volatility during this period of Whole Foods transformation under Amazon. We estimate price cuts of this magnitude, if they continue, could put prices on par to slightly below Kroger.""Amazon's acquisition also came as grocery chains were already mired in a discount battle after an oversupply of some goods lowered prices. Kroger, in reporting first-quarter earnings in June, said that the so-called food deflation was ""less severe"" during that quarter than in the prior one.But Amazon, in August, said it intended to make Whole Foods' ""high-quality, natural and organic food affordable for everyone"" and that this was ""just the beginning"" — words that probably delighted some shoppers but sent chills through grocery-chain investors. Shares of Kroger, Target (TGT), Wal-Mart and SuperValu (SVU) reeled on the announcement. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), a rival natural foods grocer, was among the biggest losers.Amazon also said it would make Amazon Prime the rewards program for Whole Foods and make some of Whole Foods' private label products available via Amazon.com.Prior the Amazon acquisition, Kroger had enjoyed strong growth in natural and organic foods, grabbing market share from high-priced Whole Foods.Wal-Mart, the largest grocery seller in the U.S., has fared better than most grocers and retailers competing against Amazon, with shares trading just below a buy zone.Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha said in a statement on Friday that even as deflation eases, the competition made passing on any price improvements to customers difficult.He added that the price war among grocery chains will stay competitive this year as discount German chains like Aldi and Lidl advance in the U.S. and Wal-Mart and Amazon continue to keep their weight on prices.""This will result in Kroger's profitability to remain pressured in the second half of the of the fiscal year,"" he said, ""however Kroger's scale, diverse store base, high private label penetration and strong execution ability is a distinct competitive advantage.""RELATED:Amazon To Cut Whole Foods Prices Monday; Grocery Stocks SlammedHow Wal-Mart, Google Are Taking On A Common Internet FoeRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch

Netflix (NFLX) rose 0.7% as it forms the right side of a potential cup base with a 191.60 buy point.Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) only slipped about 0.3% each.Among other leading growth stocks, Electronic Arts (EA) fell 0.2% despite being initiated with a buy rating with a 136 price target at Goldman Sachs. Shares of the video game maker have mostly stayed within the 5% buy range from a 116.14 flat-base entry since the July 26 breakout. Rival Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) was also started with a buy rating at Goldman. Its price target is 118. Shares traded down 0.4%, but remain well-extended from an 80.64 cup-base entry.Among companies reporting earnings, Kroger (KR) reported mixed results early Friday, prompting shares to fall over 6%. The stock is approaching multiyear lows amid new competition from Amazon.com (AMZN) when it acquired Whole Foods.Credit bureau Equifax (EFX) plunged 14% after the company announced a major cybersecurity breach late Thursday. Shares had been building a flat base, but today's action send the stock back down through its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.Meanwhile, cybesecurity companies were on the rise in the stock market today.

726,KR,"Cracker Barrel (CBRL) on Tuesday reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, but the countryside-themed restaurant chain raised its full-year earnings forecast above Street estimates.The company's earnings per share rose 18% to $2.01, topping views for $1.84. Revenue rose 1% to $710.0 million, short of estimates for $713.73 million. Same-restaurant sales rose 1.3%.The results reflected ""our ability to leverage our cost saving initiatives and the favorable commodity environment,"" CEO Sandra B. Cochran said in a statement.Cracker Barrel raised its full-year EPS outlook to $8.10-$8.25, above views for $8.13. In September, the company had forecast full-year EPS of $7.95-$8.10. Q1's beat of 17 cents fully covers the 15-cent hike in the full-year range.The company held to its full-year revenue forecast of $2.95 billion-$3 billion, which it said reflected a handful of expected new store openings. Same-restaurant sales are seen up 1.0% to 2.0% for the year, the same forecast as in September.However, Cracker Barrel, which has a restaurant segment and a retail segment, cut its retail comps forecast and expects a greater impact from food deflation. Cheaper groceries have weighed results of grocery companies like Kroger (KR) and restaurants. Cracker Barrel's comparable restaurant traffic also fell 1.7% during the quarter.Shares rose 5.7% to 163.01 in the stock market today, hitting a four-month high. That follows a rapid postelection ascent driven by hopes that a Trump administration could cut taxes and regulations for businesses.Eighty-five percent of Cracker Barrel's stores are located in states that voted for Trump, and the chain could get a boost from consumer confidence, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Jake Bartlett said in a research note last week.But the chain's low to middle-income consumers are unlikely to see any additional benefit from Trump's tax-cut plans, he said, and Trump's infrastructure bill might not help the restaurant development projects that take place outside of the rural areas where Cracker Barrel outlets are located.IBD'S TAKE: Even as an array of restaurants join the Trump rally, pizza stocks like Domino's and Papa John's have outperformed a sector weighed by discounts, cheaper items at the grocery store and election-related anxieties. McDonald's (MCD) edged 0.2% higher to 119.69.Jack in the Box (JACK) initially sold off to 97.52 but closed up 6.1% to 107.82, clearing a 102.73 buy point. Jack in the Box reported mixed fourth-quarter results on Monday but guided low.RELATED:McNuggets, McPick 2, Breakfast Help McDonald's Beat Restaurant SlumpTyson's Weak Profit Outlook Sinks Shares, Other Meat Producers

727,KR,"Stock futures rose solidly Monday morning, suggesting a positive start to the week after a volatile, split market over the last several sessions. Techs were leading the way, but the Dow Jones industrial average may open at a record high.A U.S. Boeing (BA) F/A-18E Super Hornet on Sunday shot down a Syrian government bomber, a day ahead of the Paris Air Show. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) starts the week under heavy pressure even as Facebook, Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) find key support. Markets are still digesting Amazon's $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods Market (WFM), which may yet get a rival bid.Boeing and Apple are both members of the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is now the top-performing Dow stock in 2017, up 26%. Apple has fallen to third, up 23%, with McDonald's (MCD) now second.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.35% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.65%.Stocks also were gaining overseas. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.6% and China's Shanghai composite 0.7%. In Europe, the major averages rose as Brexit talks were set to begin and after new French President Macron's centrist party decisively won parliamentary elections. The U.K.'s FTSE climbed 0.55%, Germany's Dax 0.85% and France's CAC-40 0.9%.X The Pentagon said Sunday that a U.S.-flown Boeing F/A-18E brought down a Syrian regime SU-22 bomber jet that was attacking anti-regime, American-allied fighters. It's the first time the U.S. has shot down a Syrian jet during its civil war.That comes a day ahead of the start of the Paris Air Show, where Boeing, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other makers of civilian and military aircraft will show off their wares and announce big orders. Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter is expected to display high-G maneuvers and fancy flying to wow that crowd.IBD'S TAKE: For more chart analysis of Facebook, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet, check out IBD's latest Stocks To Watch column.It's an important time for defense spending. European leaders are stepping up defense spending amid pressure from President Trump to live up to NATO commitments. Meanwhile, Trump has hinted at giving a new contract for more F/A-18 fighters, which are cheaper than the cutting-edge F-35.Boeing's Paris Air Show is likely to focus on orders for its new 737 Max 10 stretch passenger jet as well as any buzz about a new, midrange airliner to compete with Airbus (EADSY) and its A321neo jet.Boeing announced a SpiceJet order early Monday for 40 new 737 Max 10 planes, including 20 new orders and 20 converted from 737 Max 8 orders.Boeing shares are at record levels, now slightly extended from an 185.81 flat base entry after spending several weeks in buying zone. Boeing shares edged higher in premarket trading on the stock market today.Lockheed Martin is in buy range from 270 entry initially cleared on March 17 but only decisively cleared a month ago. Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are all in buy zones as well.Apple has now flashed several sell signals over the past several sessions. Apple shares fell 4.5% last week in the heaviest weekly volume in two months and the heaviest weekly volume in a down week in 13 months. Apple is now 9% below its mid-March record high and is starting to lose sight of its 50-day moving average.Apple was up about 1% in premarket trade.Meanwhile, Alphabet, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet have all found support at the 50-day moving average. Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock briefly undercut that level on June 9, but has held above that level since then and never closed below that level. Facebook dropped below the 50-day several times over the prior six sessions, but always closed higher. Alphabet tested but never dropped below that key support line.The rebounds, which generally came on higher volume, offer a chance for follow-on buys or an initial positive. Keep in mind that the uptrend is under pressure, so investors should be cautious about many any purchase.As for Netflix (NFLX), the fourth member of the ""FANG"" internet group, that stock is hovering below its 50-day line, though it's showing a little better action than Apple.Whole Foods shot up 29% to 42.68 on Friday, above Amazon's 42-a-share offer. Some investors and analysts see a higher bid as possible, with pure-play grocers Kroger (KR) and private-equity backed Albertsons cited as possible suitors. But Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) also suggested. Wal-Mart is the No. 1 grocer seller in the U.S., with Target also a big player.No doubt many grocery sellers' top executives and boards were mulling their next moves over the weekend.Shares of Kroger and other grocery sellers were big losers last week, amid concerns about the impact of an Amazon-Whole Foods deal and Kroger's big profit warning.RELATED:Why Lockheed's F-35 Could Stun Crowds At The Paris Air ShowParis Air Show Preview: This Will Be 'The Big Thing'Paris Air Show 2017: Latest Defense And Aerospace News And DealsThat's No Moon: Boeing, Apple Could Build This Disrupter In Space

729,KR,"Supermarket giant Kroger (KR) said Thursday that an ongoing slump in grocery prices was largely responsible for its surprise drop in same-store sales, and the company said the market environment it's in now could persist through the first half of this year.Kroger said it expected conditions in the first half of this year to be ""similar"" to the back half of last year. At that time, lower food prices were a big topic of discussion during earnings calls in the grocery industry.The company added that its results in the second half of 2017 ""are expected to show improvement as the company cycles the previous year.""However, management also said it expected the market to become ""more competitive.""Wal-Mart (WMT), which draws much of its sales from groceries, began a price-cutting crusade last year. Target (TGT), which also sells groceries, said last month that it would lower prices and that retailers were navigating a ""seismic shift"" in their industry.Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant behind much of that seismic shift, Amazon (AMZN), is deepening its foray into grocery delivery and plans to open physical convenience stores.Kroger has been trying stave off the effects of lower food prices, which threaten to drag grocery stores into a discount war that could wear away at sales as chains rush to clear shelves.The company's fourth-quarter same-store sales fell 0.7%, worse than the Consensus Metrix forecast for a 0.1% gain.Earnings per share fell 7% to 53 cents, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 5.5% to $27.611 billion, edging past views for $27.308 billion.The company forecast full-year EPS of $2.21-$2.25, with the midpoint in line with consensus views for $2.23. Same-store sales over that time were seen as flat to up 1%.""We are lowering costs to invest those savings in our people, our business, and technology. This approach will enable us to deliver on our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate target of 8-11%, plus an increasing dividend, as it has in the past,"" CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement.""In 2016, Kroger grew market share, increased tonnage, and hired more than 12,000 new store associates. For 2017 and beyond, we will continue delivering for our customers while also setting the company up for our next phase of growth and customer-first innovation.""Shares sank 4.3% to 30.67 on the stock market today, falling further below their 50- and 200-day lines. SuperValu (SVU) edged up 0.3%, and natural foods grocery giant Whole Foods (WFM) dipped 0.5%.Wal-Mart rose 0.4% intraday while Target inched up 0.2%.As Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told IBD last year, beef prices were lower for cyclical reasons. Egg prices slid as more shoppers stuck with egg substitutes — and didn't return to buying eggs — after a 2015 bird flu outbreak came and went. Demand for milk weakened in Asia and Europe as the dollar strengthened.In December, during Kroger's third-quarter earnings call, McMullen said the current round of so-called ""food deflation"" was the company's third in 30 years. Previous deflationary periods were three to five quarters long, he said then.However, he added that Kroger had still been scooping up market share and that the lower prices had helped the company learn better ways to operate.RELATED:Kroger Cautious On 2016, 2017 Earnings As Food Price Deflation ContinuesKroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-Mart

734,KR,"U.S. stocks kept to a narrow range Wednesday as the Federal Reserve's latest minutes revealed increasing support for an interest-rake hike.The Nasdaq eased 0.1%, while staying near its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1% each. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow are stuck under their 50-day lines.Volume in the stock market today fell on both major exchanges. Recently, losses have come in rising volume, while gains have come in declining volume. That's the opposite of what bulls like to see.The Dow Jones utility average was a top performer Wednesday, rising 1%. Given the chatter about an interest rate hike, the gain in the utility average was unexpected. (Higher interest rates make dividend-paying utilities less attractive.) From a wider perspective, some kind of rebound was no surprise. The utility average has retreated about 11% since its July 6 high.Consolidated Edison (ED) has dropped 11% off its high. The stock rose almost 1%, after falling in 12 of the previous 13 sessions. PPL (PPL) also bounced 1% higher, but it remains 18% off its high. The electric utility has skidded in 10 of the previous 11 sessions.Banks, which are likely to benefit from higher rates, made no dramatic moves Wednesday. Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) were nearly flat. Citigroup (C) trimmed 0.5%. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a Phoenix-based midcap, advanced 0.6%.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, dairy products and gold and silver miners booked the best gains for the day, according to preliminary data. Biotechs took the hardest hit.Blue chips were almost even between winners and losers. Dow components Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) led with gains of about 1%.In the S&P 500, Kroger (KR) grabbed the pole position with a 3% pop. A recent Morgan Stanley report said Kroger's alternative formats have not been fully priced into the stock. Rumors also have swirled over a possible merger with Whole Foods Market (WFM).The Fed minutes from the September meeting showed three members favoring an immediate rate hike. They lost the argument, but may have set the tone for a rate hike in December.IBD'S TAKE: An uptrend under pressure makes buying stocks more risky than ideal, but some stocks could be setting up for breakouts.Railway CSX (CSX) reported quarterly results after the close. CSX fell 1% in regular trading Wednesday, its fourth daily loss in a row, and was slightly higher in extended trading.

736,KR,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

But the pioneer in natural and organics groceries shot up 5% on the stock market today.First, Wal-Mart (WMT), which is the largest U.S. groceries seller, said Thursday morning that it would curb new-store growth as it invests in e-commerce. That's good news for a slew of retailers, from specialty discounters such as Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG), as well as grocery chains such as Whole Foods and Kroger (KR).Grocery sellers have been struggling with falling food prices, in part due to renewed Wal-Mart price cuts. That's especially painful for Whole Foods, which has struggled to shake its ""whole paycheck"" reputation.

So it's unclear if Kroger would want to make such an acquisition.Kroger and Whole Foods didn't comment on the rumors.In any case, several grocery sellers — including dollar stores, fared well Thursday.Whole Foods Market rose 4.9% to 29.33, its best gain in four months, but found resistance at the 50-day line and still near the lowest levels since early 2011.Kroger stock rose 1.8%, but rebounded from its lowest close in nearly two years.Dollar Tree rose 4% while Dollar General climbed 3.1% -- also rebounding from recent lows. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), another natural foods grocer, rose 3.5%.As for Wal-Mart, its shares fell 3.2% to 69.36 as the retail giant gave earnings guidance that's below most analyst forecasts. The stock is at its lowest level in more than four months but did close above the 200-day support line.RELATED:Wal-Mart Earnings Forecast Trails Views On Investment SpendingGrocery Chains Reeling From Low Food Prices, Stiff CompetitionKroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-Mart

738,KR,"A future with slow-growing productivity — and by extension, slow-growing incomes — seems close to becoming conventional wisdom. But the strides that Wal-Mart (WMT) is making with technology that streamlines everything from tracking inventory to simplifying check-out suggest a brighter outlook.The retail giant was considered a prime force behind the last productivity boom (think bar codes, scanners and retailer-supplier data links) and the subsequent productivity bust (heavier reliance on temps and part-time workers come to mind).But facing competitive threats from Amazon (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST), and the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own wage scale, Wal-Mart is re-engineering virtually every aspect of its business. New technologies and strategies have been tested, sending drones flying through warehouses, equipping shoppers with their own scanners and putting apps in the hands of efficiency-seeking store managers. Now sales are on the upswing, though profits have yet to follow, as the pace of change at Wal-Mart is accelerating.The payoff for investors won't be immediate. On Oct. 6, Wal-Mart cut its profit outlook again as it invests heavily to improve operations in stores and online. The stock has a lousy 19 Composite Rating out of 99, which means the stock only outperforms 19% of all other stocks based on earnings, share price performance and other key criteria. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is No. 190 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart, like many retailers and companies in other modest-wage industries, have seen profit margins pressured amid intense competition and rising wage pressures. But some have thrived. On Thursday, Ulta Beauty predicted earnings growth above 20% through 2019. Read this Investor's Corner primer on profit margins.The good news for consumers is that the retail giant is sharing some of its efficiency gains via lower prices, which means you can expect its efficiency measures to spread to other companies. Amazon may be the most disruptive force in retail, but Wal-Mart's sheer scale still gives it an outsized influence on the economy. Kroger (KR), Target and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts, the companies have hinted at and analysts have signaled in recent weeks. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.Here's a look at some technology programs underway at Wal-Mart and how they could change the productivity paradigm for retailers and the broader economy.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is the best stock in its sector, but its Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked 190 out of 197 by IBD based on stock performance and Wal-Mart shares aren't near a buy point. For a primer on how to find stocks to buy at the right time, visit IBD University.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on the Aug. 16 earnings call that the company will roll out its new self-scan-and-pay technology at all Sam's Clubs this fall, letting members of the discount warehouses ""skip the checkout line.""Customers can use the ""Scan & Go"" app to ring up items as they put them in their shopping cart and see a running receipt total on their phones. The app also handles payment, so customers just show their receipts to greeters on the way out.The technology has been a long time in development. In 2014, the company pulled the plug on a year-old Scan & Go pilot program at 200 Wal-Marts using an app that was only compatible with Apple (AAPL) iPhones.But the company isn't reserving its latest innovations for Sam's Club customers. In June, Wal-Mart rolled out mobile payment technology at all of its 4,600 U.S. locations. It is testing out customer handheld scanning devices provided by the store in a number of Wal-Mart locations, but management has noted the logic of offering the same self-scan capability via smartphone that it's doing at Sam's Club.Scanning items as you put them in your cart relieves one of the frustrations of people who prefer the self-checkout lane. But like shoppers who check out with the help of a cashier, they still face another frustration: Finding bar codes slows everything down.Wal-Mart is experimenting with a technology called digital watermarking that, in the words of McMillon via Instagram in June 2015, ""could transform the way our customers check out.""Digimarc (DMRC), which subsequently confirmed that its bar code technology was the subject of McMillon's post, invisibly embeds bar code information repeatedly over retail packaging so there's no need to locate it or reorient the merchandise before scanning.Adoption of this next-generation bar code, if broad adoption is to occur, must proceed in steps. Bar code scanners must be designed to read the digital watermarking, and Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Datalogic are now equipping their scanners to do so.Regional grocer Wegmans has begun using digital watermarking on its private-label packaging in a logical first step before broader adoption by consumer packaging companies. Wegmans, which has 89 stores, expects $2 million in annual savings for every extra item scanned per minute vs. the usual 21, noted Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone in a recent research report.The next big breakthrough would be for major producers like Procter & Gamble (PG) to update their packaging. A push from Wal-Mart could certainly provide an impetus, but there's another important catalyst: By mid-2018, food labels of large manufacturers must meet new standards, making nutrition information easier to read, Stone notes.Eventually, Digimarc has said, shopping carts equipped with scanners could read its bar codes when customers put items in the cart.Wal-Mart said in June that it will start using drones to take inventory in its warehouses by late 2016 or early 2017, identifying when stocks are misplaced or running low. The drones will make a one-day job out of work that now takes employees a month to complete, while reducing the risk of accidents, Wal-Mart says.The drones are part of a larger push to manage inventories more efficiently. Wal-Mart, like other retailers including Home Depot (HD), Target and Kohl's (KSS), has been making a big push to keep inventories to a minimum and improve efficiency by rationalizing product selection (such as three sizes of salad dressing instead of six) and having more frequent supplier deliveries. Wal-Mart also is keeping more inventory in distribution centers to facilitate e-commerce shipping. One goal is simply limiting the number of times merchandise has to be moved by an employee from the time Wal-Mart receives a supplier shipment to final purchase.The latest U.S. economic data show that inventories at general merchandise stores fell 0.6% from a year earlier in July. In the short term, better inventory management may hold down economywide output and make productivity look awful, even if it's actually a partial result of retailers making efficiency gains. In the second quarter, leaner inventories subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP.Over time, though, inventory efficiencies reduce costs and permit lower prices and, possibly, better product selection. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.Now every member of Wal-Mart's in-store management team has a My Productivity smartphone app to request restocking of certain items and check sales trends while they roam the aisles and assist customers.""Prior to My Productivity, management associates were spending thousands of hours in the backrooms of our stores annually,"" wrote Mark Ibbotson, Wal-Mart executive vice president, in a June blog post introducing the new technology. ""That simply cannot be in today's world.""Wal-Mart's latest move to improve productivity, like many of its efficiency gains, involved using old technology in a new way. In early September, the company said it was cutting 7,000 cash accounting and invoicing jobs in its U.S. stores. Instead, the company will use cash recycler machines to count money and will handle invoicing at a central office.Wal-Mart also has been dreaming up new ideas for fixing the age-old problem of unused shopping carts left in the parking lot or cluttering the shopping aisles. This year, Wal-Mart filed a patent for a robot that collects unused shopping carts. A related idea would let customers hail a shopping cart via smartphone.While there's no telling how long it may take that burst of creativity to materialize in stores, the key point is that Wal-Mart is leaving no stone unturned or idea unconsidered to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. On Oct. 6, the company hosted a few dozen companies out of 250 original applicants in a ""Technology Innovation Open Call."" The winners got to pitch their technology solutions for retail, logistics, big data, security and social media.Wal-Mart's efficiency moves have swept through the economy before. An influential McKinsey & Co. study on productivity in the second half of the 1990s found that the retail sector accounted for nearly one-fourth of the U.S. rise, adding that ""more than half of the productivity acceleration in the retailing of general merchandise can be explained by only two syllables: Wal-Mart.""Big information technology breakthroughs, such as bar codes, wireless scanning guns and electronic data interchange with suppliers, came long before productivity took off. Wal-Mart's efficiency gains in that era were as much due to managerial efforts, McKinsey found. The key was that its tech and management changes were both geared toward achieving ""everyday low prices."" Wal-Mart reached a scale that compelled its business partners and rivals to follow suit or risk being left behind.U.S. output per work hour at general merchandise stores, excluding department stores, soared by nearly 150% from 1995 to 2007.But over the past eight years through the end of 2015, productivity in this sector has risen just 3%.What went wrong? A sluggish economic recovery, modest wage gains, and an overabundance of stores as Amazon gained market share. Wal-Mart, which opted to close 154 U.S. stores at the start of 2016, went through a six-quarter string of same-store sales declines through mid-2014 as its customer-satisfaction rankings tumbled.Retailers and other modest-wage employers such as fast-food chains took what might be viewed as profit shortcuts. Wal-Mart reportedly boosted its temp workforce and had understaffed stores. Other employers boosted their ranks of part-timers clocking fewer than 30 hours per week to dodge paying for health insurance or facing a fine under the ObamaCare employer mandate.Wal-Mart's penny pinching hurt sales and productivity, ultimately spurring lower profits and a change in strategy.As the economy nears full employment and employers recognize that cutting corners hasn't paid off, wage gains are picking up as companies try to raise their game. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront, raising its own base wage to $10 an hour, pushing other modest-wage employers to follow suit or suffer low morale and high turnover.Yet whatever productivity gains Wal-Mart is seeing from initiatives launched in the past year or two have yet to catch up to its extra spending on wages and on technology to improve customer satisfaction and narrow the gap with Amazon. While sales rose 3.1% from a year ago at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores in the second quarter, expenses rose 8.3% and operating income fell 6.2%.The company warned last week that it won't turn the corner on earnings growth until 2018, forecasting roughly flat per-share profits next year, prompting some analysts to reel in their price target for Wal-Mart shares. Wal-Mart also said it would scale back plans to grow its U.S. store base, adding just 55 stores in the next fiscal year, compared with 135 this year, while building more distribution centers for online orders.Ultimately, consumers will decide with their feet and their wallets how productive Wal-Mart investments turn out to be. On that score, Wal-Mart's 1.2% same-store increase in customer traffic last quarter looked like a good sign, even as fewer people were shopping at rivals Target and Dollar General.Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip Cashier Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

799,KR,"Leaders have to be honest above everything else or their ability to lead vanishes. If people find out you haven't been truthful, they'll lose trust in you. ""When that's broken, a leader's credibility and ability to lead are gone,"" said Betty Shotton, a Black Mountain, N.C.-based leadership speaker and author who is CEO of LiftOff Leadership.Here's how to make sure your group stays honest:• Check your reflection. David Dillon, the former CEO of supermarket giant Kroger (KR), saw that after his firm's top numbers of a decade ago, customer loyalty was dipping. ""We were believing our own press clippings,"" he said at an ethics panel in Kroger's hometown of Cincinnati. ""Once we were honest with ourselves, we could do something about it. The only way to be honest with yourself is to look in the mirror, and the mirror is other people. Develop the capacity for feedback.""• Judge yourself. Kroger's honest self-examination is driving it to improve product selection. It's pushing to carry more locally made or grown items, an area in which it felt it was falling short, Dillon says.""We're doing better, but still not well enough,"" he said. ""We're working on that. We're trying to apply our values to serving our customers. The results speak for themselves. Good ethics is good business."" Kroger's same-store sales growth has outpaced the industry, with 40 straight quarters of increases — fueling a stock gain of 250% since 2002.• Start at the top. Set a solid tone for the firm. That gets others acting that way as they realize that's how things are done here, Shotton says.• Think ahead. Have a plan if things go wrong. Be honest with yourself if a product you touted flops. ""You can't focus on your own feelings and emotions,"" Shotton, who started six companies, mainly in real estate and aviation, told IBD. ""What's important is to have the ability and humility to admit mistakes.""• Tune in. Pay attention to what customers say to see if you can improve. Dillon says 99.9% of the calls to Kroger's customer hotline lead to nothing — ""but the one time it is something, you better be listening.""• Discuss. Build honesty and ethics into your firm's culture by constantly bringing them up, whether in small groups, one-on-one meetings or at large gatherings.""You have to talk about it everywhere and all the time,"" Dillon said. ""I think it's as much about attitude as anything. It's where leaders spend their time.""• Set your principles. Define your core values by figuring out what your firm stands for, suggests Shotton. Then work them into job descriptions, hiring, orientation, training, performance reviews and promotions. ""Integrate the values with the structure of the company,"" she said.• Make the connection. Show people inside and outside the firm that your principles translate into results.""It helps if you can say because of your values your profits have doubled in the past year,"" Shotton said.• Take the long view. You'll do things the right way if you strive for long-term success rather than short-term gains, Dillon says. That's what helped Kroger make changes a decade ago to put the customer first in all decisions, even if it meant cutting prices and narrowing margins. ""We actually believed it was for survival,"" he said. ""Maybe not in the next year, but five or 10 years down the road.""• Be realistic. There are times when you can't be completely forthcoming with your staff. Maybe an acquisition is in the works or layoffs are coming. ""You can say, 'I can't answer that question now, but when I can, I will,'"" Shotton said.

These studies have been disputed, however.Dairy-milk alternatives come with different nutritional benefits. Almond milk has fewer calories than soy milk and no saturated fat, but little protein. It's high in vitamins E and D.Soy milk has more protein, B vitamins and potassium and magnesium. But it can cause bloating.OverseasWhiteWave's plant-based food and beverage group in Europe operates under the Alpro and Provamel brands. Alpro, which includes almond and soy beverages, has the No. 1 market share in its nine largest markets there.China could become a meaningful contributor to WhiteWave starting later this year through a joint venture with Mengniu Dairy, the largest dairy company in China. WhiteWave is in the process of commercializing the venture.""Soy milk in China is a $2 billion category and growing over 10% (annually),"" Baumgartner said.Meanwhile, line extensions in the U.S. are ramping up this year, including new almond and coconut milk blends under the Silk brand.Horizon has new snack crackers and cookies and macaroni and cheese. The Earthbound division is bringing out new meal bowls.

"
895,KR,"Business productivity rose at a 3.4% annual rate in the third quarter, tied for the second fastest growth in output per hour worked since the start of 2010, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.Business output rose at an annual rate of  3.5% in the quarter, while hours worked were up just 0.1%. That followed three straight quarters of declining productivity.While the productivity rise was boosted by inventory-building in the quarter, there's good reason to expect better productivity growth to continue after stagnating in recent years. That conclusion comes from a close look at how Wal-Mart (WMT), a prime force behind the last productivity boom, is re-engineering its business processes to meet competitive threats from Amazon.com (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and others, while facing the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own pay scale.The key is that Wal-Mart's efficiency gains tend to be contagious when it shares those gains with consumers via lower prices, as it's begun to do again recently. Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.The upshot is that productivity could surprise on the upside, even as economists — including Federal Reserve policymakers — are becoming increasingly sure about a future with low-productivity growth, low economic growth and unusually low interest rates. The latest Fed economic projections in September marked the long-term economic growth rate down to just 1.8% from 2.0% in June.IBD'S TAKE: IBD recently examined a host of ways Wal-Mart is working to streamline its business, from using drones to manage inventories to its new ""Scan & Go"" app. For a closer look, read How Wal-Mart May Revive U.S. Productivity — And Its Own Fortunes.Leaner stockpiles were a big reason productivity growth had been negative in recent quarters, but that was actually a positive sign for productivity growth going forward, because it's partly the result of better inventory management. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.RELATED:Forget The Amazon Effect; The Wal-Mart Effect Hits Dollar StoresFast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even CheaperWhole Foods Soars On Kroger Takeover Rumor, Wal-Mart Plans

957,KR,"Schultz taught her how to create a vision, how to build a brand and how to develop a product ""that is so good and combining it with a purpose so that it causes market disruption,"" she said while attending the Expo West natural products industry show this past March in Anaheim, Calif.
"
958,KR,"Smith gave Day lessons on how to turn a business model into delivering 20% growth in return on capital and 5% increases in same-store sales quarter after quarter.
"
959,KR,"He taught her how to run business units and maintain disciplined accounting at overseas units.
"
960,KR,"Behar brought Day on board with the concept of the servant leader.
"
961,KR,"Day said that along the way she grasped the importance of becoming an ""effective people coach"" and ""how to develop internal talent by creating mentoring programs.""
"
962,KR,"In 2008, Day made her most dramatic career move when she took over Lululemon. Fulfilling her dream of heading a high-growth company, she helped build the yoga-inspired firm, started by Chip Wilson in 1998 in Vancouver, British Columbia, into a multinational powerhouse in athletic apparel.
"
963,KR,"The company's results were as fit as its products.
"
964,KR,"From fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2014, ended in January, Lululemon's earnings per share jumped 730%. Sales rose 489% over the same time frame, from $270 million to $1.6 billion. Along the way, its stock soared from a 2009 low of 2.17 to as high as 82.50 in June 2013.
"
965,KR,"Born in Northern Ireland, Day moved to Western Canada in 1964 after her father, a former pro soccer player, changed course after a sports injury and pursued a career in mechanical engineering.
"
966,KR,"Going to America for college, Day got a business degree at Central Washington University in 1984 and quickly joined a firm in the Evergreen State that specialized in private placement investments.
"
967,KR,"While working in a state that would turn into America's coffee hub, she met Starbucks' Schultz on the job and joined his fledgling company, then known as Il Giornale, in 1986. A year later, Schultz acquired the Starbucks company.
"
968,KR,"At Lululemon, Day worked hard on brand-building campaigns that inspired professional yoga instructors and world-class athletes to work for the company as product ambassadors.
"
969,KR,"""They have an incredible sponsorship program that radiates their self-improvement culture out into the community and impacts the best athletes' lives in a huge way,"" Chandra Crawford, a Canadian gold medalist in women's cross-country skiing at the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics, told IBD.
"
970,KR,"Crawford met Day in the late 2000s, when the skier became one of what Lululemon calls their elite ambassadors. That tag gave Crawford and fellow athletes a chance to join Lululemon-hosted retreats and share ideas for product innovation.

"
972,KR,"""I learned two things (from Christine): One, we share practices like yoga to balance and sustain our drive. Two, the level of understanding people in order to be successful in business is equivalent to multiple Ph.D.s,"" said Crawford, who now runs Fast and Female, a nonprofit organization based in Alberta that promotes well-being through sport for girls 9 to 19.
"
973,KR,"Day grasps that good store managers have a huge impact on building brand loyalty among customers.
"
974,KR,"With Lululemon, she made sure a store-based community was more than where staff talked with customers or gave free yoga lessons.
"
975,KR,"She wanted managers to have unparalleled knowledge about the product — be it yoga pants featuring high-tech fibers, a tank top for exercise or a cold-weather running jacket — and customer needs.
"
976,KR,"Day resisted excessive shifting of store managers among locations, as it would undermine continuity at a store. So she created rules:
"
977,KR,"• 1. A store manager had to work at Lululemon at least six months before opening a new store on his own at a different location.
"
978,KR,"• 2. Assistant managers should be promoted in their store if the top gun moves to a new store.
"
979,KR,"Homey
"
980,KR,"""Your store is a community,"" Day said. ""When a manager moves too often, it breaks down the relationships with the community, the staff and the operating results of the store."" The firm's in-house studies showed that having the same manager for two years increased profitability by 20% on average.
"
981,KR,"Two weeks ago, on June 12, Lululemon shares dropped 16% in heavy volume after the company reported quarterly earnings and sales that reflected an ongoing slowdown in growth. Earnings beat the consensus estimate, but rose just 6% year over year.
"
982,KR,"The stock has rebounded in recent days, but analysts have shaved their full-year profit estimates.
"
983,KR,"When Day announced she would leave Lululemon in 2013, Stephen Sidwell, the founder of Luvo, pounced. He contacted Day and asked her to take the CEO post. His goal: Find the right person to take the young firm to the next level.
"
984,KR,"""She had had two phenomenal brand-building experiences,"" he said. ""At Starbucks, she really helped Howard (Schultz) build the organization to what it is today. What she did for beverages is what we're doing for food.""
"
985,KR,"Sidwell, a former investment banker, says it was easy to convince Day about his company's mission. The harder part: asking Day to give up plans to take a year off from the corporate grind. She signed up, taking the new CEO post on a full-time basis this past April 1.
"
986,KR,"""She is an incredibly collaborative leader and has a really wonderful demeanor when it comes to leadership,"" Sidwell said. ""She really gets the vision of what we're trying to do, and has been able to put that vision into plans and organize it in an efficient way. People can see it and understand it.""

989,KR,"In January 2013, the firm started distribution to 91 grocery stores owned by Safeway (SWY). That has swelled to 6,500 stores, including top retailers Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and Publix, plus the Home Shopping Network. Also, Luvo meals are featured on select Delta (DAL) flights.Top brand builder Christine Day has simple advice for corporate managers and executives:Once you've reached the top of your game, don't flaunt it while on the job. Never act like you've earned it.Instead, she says, become a ""servant leader,"" one who inspires employees toward the top while turning customers into repeat shoppers.That principle has helped Day shine at Starbucks (SBUX) — where she joined the coffeehouse giant in the mid-1980s as employee No. 3 — and at Lululemon Athletica (LULU), where she served as the company's first woman CEO from July 2008 to the end of 2013 and oversaw a stock rise of 3,700%.Now she's trying to cook up a winner as CEO of food maker Luvo.At Starbucks, Day knew a senior executive who took an expensive limousine car to the airport and meetings, rather than a simple taxi. When the exec went on business trips, he stayed only at five-star hotels.It was obvious to Day that her colleague felt the status of the hotel and other perks properly telegraphed his status within the company. But ""this mattered more than the quality of the work and the quality of the relationships he was generating,"" Day, 52, told IBD. ""He treated it as his due rather than understanding he served the organization and the people.""The Day WayShe tried to greet each workday with humility.Her first job: office manager of Howard Schultz's new five-store company. Over a 20-year stint through the mid-2000s, she rose all the way up to president of Starbucks' Asia-Pacific group.By 2007, the company operated several hundred stores across China, Thailand, Australia, Japan and Singapore.Throughout that journey, Day made a point of learning vital skills from mentors.At Starbucks, she had three major ones — current CEO Howard Schultz, former CEO Orin Smith and former Starbucks International head Howard Behar. Day took the first letter of each man's first name and called them her H-2-O.Schultz taught her how to create a vision, how to build a brand and how to develop a product ""that is so good and combining it with a purpose so that it causes market disruption,"" she said while attending the Expo West natural products industry show this past March in Anaheim, Calif.Smith gave Day lessons on how to turn a business model into delivering 20% growth in return on capital and 5% increases in same-store sales quarter after quarter.He taught her how to run business units and maintain disciplined accounting at overseas units.Behar brought Day on board with the concept of the servant leader.Day said that along the way she grasped the importance of becoming an ""effective people coach"" and ""how to develop internal talent by creating mentoring programs.""In 2008, Day made her most dramatic career move when she took over Lululemon.

1003,KR,"Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) are down 16.5% over the last year based mostly on Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) fears. There is no doubt that online selling and delivery have altered the retail world, but does that mean Walgreens can no longer compete? Let’s dive into some of WBA’s fundamentals to see what to do with the stock.Amazon ThreatAmazon is set to acquire online and delivery pharmacy startup PillPack for $1 billion in cash, in a deal that is expected to close in the second half of 2018. PillPack’s co-founder and CEO TJ Parker said last fall that the company had tens of thousands of customers and was set for more than $100 million in annual revenue.The late June announcement sent shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens tumbling. But the question is, how quickly can Amazon infiltrate the industry with a pharmacy firm that boasted just tens of thousands of customers? Walgreens alone claims 13,200 stores in 11 countries, with whole distribution centers delivering to more than 230,000 pharmacies—as of August 2017.Amazon does already sell its own private-brand, over-the-counter drugs, called Basic Care, selling 65 drugs at costs that were roughly 20% less than Walgreens and CVS. Yet, Amazon is far from overtaking the approximately $400 billion U.S. pharmaceutical industry.Investors should also note that fears the e-commerce giant would destroy the grocery industry have been largely overblown to this point as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have adapted to the times and pushed out their own online portals, delivery options, and meal-kits. The pharmaceutical and drug industry is much different than the grocery business, for an array of reasons, but Walgreens and others are just as capable of fighting back against Amazon’s pharmaceutical invasion.In fact, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said on a conference call that his company is “not particularly worried” about Amazon’s PillPack acquisition. “The pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or packages,” he continued. “I strongly believe that the role of the physical pharmacy will continue to be very, very important in the future.”Recent NewsWalgreens reported strong fiscal third-quarter results on June 28, topping Wall Street estimates and posting solid year-over-year gains. The company is also upbeat about its purchase of 1,932 Rite Aid stores.Furthermore, Walgreens is ramping up its delivery, and currently offers an array of shipping and delivery options. Meanwhile, just last week, it announced that its 40% acquisition of a leading retail Chinese pharmacy chain, Sinopharm Holding GuoDa Drugstores Co, was approved—which could prove to be a great investment. And the company recently introduced a new $10 billion share repurchase program that helps indicate its focus on driving long-term stockholder value, and that its stock price looks pretty cheap at the moment.Price Movement & ValuationShares of WBA are up 88% over the last 10 years, which falls below the S&P 500’s 128% climb. And over the last three years, Walgreens has seen its stock price tumble 31%, with a 14% decline in the last three months alone. With that said, shares of WBA sit roughly $20 below their 52-week high of $83.89. This means Walgreens stock is relatively inexpensive at face value.Diving a little deeper, investors will note that Walgreens presents rather strong value at the moment. WBA is currently trading at 9.9X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a substantial discount compared to its industry’s 16.2X average. Furthermore, Walgreens stock has traded as high as 23.3X over the last year, with a one-year median of 15.8X. Walgreens stock is also trading almost directly in line with its year-long low, which is its lowest earnings multiple over the last five years. Therefore investors should be able to say with some confidence that WBA appears rather cheap at its current level. Outlook Walgreens is also expected to continue to experience strong top and bottom line growth. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for its quarterly revenues to climb by over 11% to hit $33.51 billion. The company’s top line is expected to expand by 10.8% to touch $131.02 billion for its current fiscal year.Moving onto the other end of the income statement, Walgreens is projected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings pop by 10.7% to reach $1.45 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by 17% to reach $5.97.Bottom LineWalgreens is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth in our Style Scores system. With all that said, WBA looks like it might be worth considering at the moment based on its outstanding valuation picture and growth outlook.Lastly, investors should expect Walgreens to adapt in order to better compete going forward. And let’s not forget the company is a dividend payer, with a yield of 2.8%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1004,KR,"With the e-commerce market getting intensely competitive by the day, retailers are making constant efforts to stay ahead in the game. Apart from getting into strategic alliances, making prudent acquisitions or developing websites and mobile apps, providing seamless deliveries is the latest mantra of the e-commerce space.In this regard, Walmart Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) consistent efforts to counter Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) have been one of the most talked-about developments. The supermarket giant, which scooped up Jet.com in 2016, has left no stone unturned to take on Amazon. From speedy deliveries to payment systems and from selling grocery to offering meal-kits, the players have been going head to head for quite some time now.Will Jet.com’s Latest Move Up Walmart’s Game?Walmart raised its game through the announcement of plans to open a fulfillment center for Jet.com in New York, per sources. Evidently, rumors have been doing the rounds that the world’s largest retailer is planning to foray into New York, not through its own stores but by setting up a Jet.com fulfilment center in Bronx. This will help Walmart test same-day deliveries of Jet.com’s products in the largest city of the United States.  The facility, which is likely to open this fall, will support deliveries of products ranging from fresh groceries to even Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) electronics. Jet.com plans to carry out the delivery process, using services of last-mile delivery provider Parcel Inc., which was taken over by Walmart last year. Sources further revealed that for starters, this center in New York will remain exclusive to handling deliveries of Jet.com. Also, it will only store inventories.Notably, this move is in line with Jet.com’s focus on targeting urban millennials, unlike Walmart’s conventional rural or suburban customers. Clearly, this is likely to fortify Walmart’s presence in the deliveries and online grocery space.  Well, Walmart is doing every bit to exploit the opportunities in the booming online grocery space — from inking deals with Postmates and DoorDash to the acquisition of Parcel. The company has also introduced a line of kitchen products in collaboration with Buzzfeed’s Tasty.  In earlier developments, Walmart partnered with ride hailing services like Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries, while it also tested same-day delivery with Deliv, in a bid to enhance its services. We believe that these actions help Walmart offer multiple choices to online grocery shoppers amid pose stiff competition to Amazon. Also, it should help the company extend its online grocery delivery service to nearly 800 stores by the end of this year.WMT, TGT, KR – All in the RaceWalmart, which generates a chunk of revenues from food sales, has been taking perfervid initiatives in the delivery services realm to combat Amazon. Incidentally, Amazon has been trying to exploit every nook and cranny of the online grocery delivery space, largely owing to advantages associated with Whole Foods, which was taken over by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company last year. Ever since, the dot.com giant has been dedicatedly integrating Whole Foods into its Prime operations and exploiting it strategically to attract customers and enhance their experience.Consequently, Walmart and retail behemoths like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) are constantly revisiting their strategy to stay firm amid the competitive frenzy. Kroger, for instance, has been steadily creating a niche in the burgeoning online grocery space. The supermarket retailer’s recent deal with Nuro (the maker of driverless road vehicles) to deliver groceries at customers’ door steps is just another way to take on rivals. Also, the Cincinnati-based retailer’s agreement with Instacart for same-day deliveries, and ClickList order online and pick up in store services tell the tale of its efforts to stay abreast in the online grocery space.Moving to Target, the company is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities and expand same-day delivery options. Toward this end, the company has undertaken rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases for a flat fee along with technology and process improvements. Further, Target acquired Shipt to expand same-day delivery — an announcement that followed plans to initiate same-day delivery in New England, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Baltimore for more than 55,000 groceries, essentials, home, electronics, toys and other products. Apart from this, the company’s Target Restock program and Drive Up service deserve a mention when it comes to talking about its efforts in the online delivery space.Retail Space in the PinkBuoyed by such efforts, Walmart, Kroger and Target, each with a Zacks Rank #3 have seen their shares rally close to 21%, 29% and 60%, respectively, in the past year. We expect the trend to sustain and keep driving the Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector that has gained 29.1% in a year’s time, comfortably outdoing the S&P 500’s rise of 16.7%. Markedly, the sector is placed in the top 38% of the 16 Zacks sectors.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1005,KR,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced on Jul 3, that it will start its Prime Day this year on Jul 16. Starting at 3 P.M. (Eastern Time), Amazon’s Prime Day will last for 36 hours, more than last year’s 30 hours. This would be the longest Prime Day ever for Amazon since its start in 2015.The company is gearing up to offer at least one million deals including those on all the Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. Moreover, Amazon is also focused on exploring new markets beyond the United States. In this respect, it is wise to evaluate some of its competitors and they way they are preparing to counter Amazon’s assault.Walmart All Geared Up To Counter AmazonThe ""best Prime Day celebration,” is definitely good news for Amazon and a matter of worry for its competitors. However, one of Amazon’s major competitors, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is in no mood to sit back. In fact, new customers of Walmart will get a discount of $10 on about 3 different orders using the code, ""WALMART3"" on pickups of $50 or higher till Jul 31.Additionally, the company’s credit card holders will be subjected to cash back of 3% on any grocery pickup service from Walmart. Although, Amazon’s cash back offer is comparatively higher than Walmart’s, the latter does not bear a “Prime” membership charge of $119 per year. Both Amazon and Walmart have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amazon Prime Day is a major catalyst to bring back-to-school shopping season.

1007,KR,"“Shop anything, anytime and anywhere” is the new mantra that U.S. grocery players are fervently following to provide consumers a seamless experience. From speedy deliveries to payment systems and from selling grocery to offering meal-kits, supermarket chains have been in a constant race against each other for quite some time now. Industry experts believe that the competition in the U.S. grocery market is going to intensify further in the digital space and players will have to constantly revisit their strategy in order to counter the same.Clearly, either you “shape up or ship out”. The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) has taken the stock of the situation and has been steadily creating a niche in the burgeoning online grocery space. The latest deal with Nuro — the maker of driverless road vehicle — to deliver groceries at customers’ door steps using autonomous vehicles is just another game plan to take on rivals.Grocery Delivery GameThe grocery industry has been grappling with stiff competition, higher input costs, aggressive promotional environment and thin margins. The industry witnessed a major shake-up when the news of Whole Foods takeover by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surfaced. This amalgamation of online marketplace with physical stores caused a tectonic shift in the grocery landscape. Amazon can now leverage Whole Foods’ fresh foods procurements expertise with its own data mining techniques.Amazon has been trying to exploit nook and cranny of the online grocery delivery space, quite evident from its free two-hour delivery of Whole Foods products to Prime customers. It is going an extra mile by helping small businesses or entrepreneurs in establishing a delivery business under its Amazon Delivery Service Partner program and utilizing the same as a delivery tool.Experts believe that Amazon is leaving no stone unturned in its effort to counteract any threat stemming from Walmart, which holds a dominant position in the U.S. food market and has been gradually building up its e-commerce muscle.Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) has been proactive in expanding in the fast-growing online grocery space. The company extended alliance with last mile logistics entity, Deliv, to support same-day delivery for groceries. It also acquired delivery start-up company, Parcel Inc. to extend same-day deliveries. The company also partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. The company also teamed up with Postmates for grocery delivery.Another player, Target (TGT  -  Free Report) is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities and expanding same-day delivery options. To this end, the company has undertaken rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases for a flat fee along with technology and process improvements. Further, the company acquired Shipt to expand same-day delivery service. Apart from this, the company’s Target Restock program and Drive Up service deserve mention, when talking about its efforts to join the online delivery bandwagon.How Kroger Plans to Take on Amazon & Walmart?It’s quite apparent that competition among grocery retailers is far from subsiding, and Kroger understands that. The company’s partnership with Nuro will definitely prove to be game changer in the grocery delivery space. Customers via Kroger's ClickList ordering system and Nuro's app can place same-day delivery orders. Apart from this, the company’s deal with the Ocado, an online grocery delivery company, along with the acquisition of Home Chef, a meal kit provider, is definitely a good move to stay abreast in the race.Kroger’s partnership with Ocado is in the right direction to overcome competition. Both the companies are likely to develop three automated warehouse facilities this year and plans to take the count to 20 in the first three years. The alliance under discussion is part of the company’s “Restock Kroger” program which is gaining traction. Further, Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program to nearly 400 locations in 2018.Wrapping UpCertainly, Kroger is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. The company remains on track to boost market share by introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative.

1008,KR,"Shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) all plummeted on Thursday morning after Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced its purchase of online pharmacy delivery startup PillPack. The move clearly has some investors worried that Amazon’s push into the pharmaceutical industry will hurt the current powers. So let’s take a look at more of the details to find out what’s really going on.PillPackAmazon is reportedly set to acquire PillPack for $1 billion in cash, in a deal that is expected to close in the second half of 2018. PillPack launched in 2013 and ships pre-sorted medications by the dose to patients on a monthly basis. The company, which is a full-service pharmacy, works mostly with customers who take multiple daily prescriptions and coordinates refills and renewals with doctors and customers.The Manchester, New Hampshire-based pharmacy delivery startup said that it ships everywhere in the U.S. except Hawaii. PillPack has raised $118 million in venture capital funding, and its co-founder and CEO TJ Parker said last fall that the company had tens of thousands of customers and was set for more than $100 million in annual revenue.The deal should be hugely beneficial for Jeff Bezos’ behemoth, which now enters the quickly growing, $400 billion U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The news saw shares of CVS sink 9.36% through early morning trading, with Rite Aid down 11.17% and Walgreens down 8.59%.Meanwhile, shares of Amazon climbed over 1.1%. But pharmaceutical industry investors shouldn’t be too worried that Amazon will simply waltz in and take over.It’s Not Over, YetAmazon’s PillPack acquisition comes roughly a year after the company shook up the grocery industry with its Whole Foods purchase. Investors worried at the time that grocery heavyweights such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) would all take a big hit, and possibly crumble underneath Amazon’s quick delivery e-commerce model. This turned out not to be the case—at least not yet (also read: Should You Buy Grocery Stocks After Kroger's Strong Quarter?).All four of these grocery industry powers simply revamped their business models and dove right into everything from same-day delivery and easy to use e-commerce portals, through partnerships with startups as well as in-house initiatives. Today, the grocery industry and customers are likely better off than they were before Amazon bought Whole Foods for roughly $14 billion because it forced them all to offer more.Sometimes lost in the narrative that Amazon will one day dominate the world, is that the e-commerce giant’s multibillion-dollar competitors, many of which have been around much longer than Amazon, can adapt—and have every reason to fight back. In fact, Walgreens executives were in the middle of a call with analysts when Amazon announced its PillPack deal. CEO Stefano Pessina said his company is “not particularly worried” about the e-commerce giant’s newest acquisition.Pessina went on to say that his drugstore chain is “not complacent.” He also said that “the pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or packages. I strongly believe that the role of the physical pharmacy will continue to be very, very important in the future.”Investors should note that Walgreens is ramping up its delivery options and adding to its in-store health-related services. Meanwhile, CVS announced just last week that it will offer its customers prescription delivery options through a new deal with the U.S. Postal Service.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

With that said, June could end up being the busiest month for IPOs in a long time, and this week is packed once again.Recent IPOsSpotify stock closed its first day of trading in early April at a price that valued the company at $26.5 billion, which helped it land as the eighth-largest tech IPO after one day of trading, directly behind Google and (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report). Aside from Spotify and Dropbox, Docusign Inc DOCU and Smartsheet SMAR were a few other notable 2018 tech IPOs.Meanwhile, many investors have been looking forward to IPOs from Uber and Airbnb. But those industry-changing tech companies look poised to wait until at least 2019 to go public—although Uber rival Lyft could reportedly go public in late 2018.Since the start of June, 22 companies have gone public, with 12 more expected to IPO this week. In fact, if all the planned initial public offerings are completed this week, it would be the busiest IPO month since June 2015, according to Renaissance Capital. So let’s take a look at a few of the bigger IPOs expected this week and quickly break down what the companies do.BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) - Deal Size: $600 million Exchange: NYSEBJ’s Wholesale is a membership-based grocery chain that operates over 200 stores across the East Coast, competing against the likes of Costco (COST  -  Free Report). The company was taken private by Leonard Green & Partners LP and CVC Capital Partners Ltd in 2011 for roughly $2.8 billion.BJ’s Wholesale reported annual sales of $12.75 billion last year and turned in a profit of $50.3 million. The company is set to go public amid changing times for the grocery industry.

However, its valuation has plummeted 75% from its last funding round. Domo noted that the middle of its IPO pricing is expected to be $20.50 per share.Domo is a company that investors might want to pay close attention to over the first couple of months as its real-time business data analytics software competes against the likes IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report).

1014,KR,"The Supreme Court on Jun 21 ruled that states have the right to collect sales tax from online purchases even if a company doesn’t have any physical presence in that state. This certainly is a game-changing decision given that businesses, primarily online retailers, so long were not bound to collect sales tax in states where they do not operate physically.The Supreme Court ruling has been cheered by brick-and-mortar stores, which have been struggling to survive the e-commerce onslaught. That said, many online retailers are already collecting sales tax on their products in different states. Given this scenario, it needs to be seen, how big a pinch e-commerce companies would feel now.Online Retail Hits RoadblockThe Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that states can collect sales tax on online purchases, overturning a 1992 decision that traditional retailers so long complained was putting them at disadvantageous position compared with online competitors. Although retailers with a physical presence were required to collect sales tax, it wasn’t binding on online retailers and upstarts, which would often skip it, thus making their products look cheaper.The latest ruling definitely will bring relief for brick-and-mortar stores, which are striving to compete with e-commerce companies. The new ruling saw shares of traditional retailers jump immediately. Shares of Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) increased 0.7% each, while Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) jumped 1%.On the other hand and quite predictably, shares of online retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), eBay, Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Etsy, Inc. (ETSY  -  Free Report) slid 1.1%, 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amazon is Still SafeAmazon took advantage of the law for years and refrained from collecting sales tax on its book sales and then other products for years. This made the company’s products look cheaper and was one of the key factors behind turning the fortunes of the company, which is now an e-commerce behemoth.However, Amazon started collecting sales tax in all states since Apr 2017. Hence, it might not pinch the company much. That said, more than 50% of Amazon’s sales are from third party marketplace sellers, who often don’t collect sales tax. This is one area which might hurt Amazon, as with sales tax, the price of the products is likely to increase.Other Online Retailers to Feel the HeatAmazon may have started collecting sales tax but it’s the other small and medium-size online retailers that have been pushed to an uncomfortable corner with the new ruling. Companies like eBay, Etsy and Wayfair Inc. (W  -  Free Report) will now need to collect sales tax on the products they sell, which they so long had been avoiding.Online furniture company, Wayfair, saw its shares fall 1.6% immediately after the ruling was passed. Online home furnishing and products retailer Overstock, Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) saw its shares plummeting as much as 7.2%, while Shopify Inc. (SHOP  -  Free Report) declined 4.5%. Understandably, the new ruling is likely to affect small and medium sized online retailers more, particularly those with no physical presence at all, as they had so long been giving stiff competition to brick-and-mortar stores by charging less for their products.Level-Playing Ground for Traditional Retailers  Brick-and-mortar stores have been long ruing that an absence of sales tax on online sales put them at a disadvantage. However, the new ruling will definitely give them a level playing ground. Moreover, traditional retailers like Walmart, Target and The Kroger Company (KR  -  Free Report) that are increasingly shifting focus toward online, collect sales tax for products sold online.However, much like Amazon, they too don’t collect sales tax on goods sold by third parties on their platform. That said, online sales still make for a very small portion of the revenues for most traditional retailers. Walmart gets generates only 3% of its revenues online in the United States.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

1017,KR,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) surged over 10% on Thursday to inch near their 52-week high after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results. Investors were also likely pleased to see that the grocery chain’s e-commerce initiatives started to pay off. The question is should investors think about buying grocery stocks as Amazon-based (AMZN  -  Free Report) fears seem to have been overblown.Kroger Kroger posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share, which came in well above our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.63 per share and marked a nearly 26% climb from the year-ago quarter. The company’s Q1 revenues climbed over 3% to $37.53 billion, topping our estimate.The company also raised its earnings guidance, but what really stood out were Kroger’s online sales. Kroger saw its digital sales skyrocket 66%. Meanwhile, Kroger announced that it upped its investment in online British supermarket delivery company Ocado to help improve its online ordering, automated fulfillment, and home delivery capabilities. Furthermore, Kroger announced a merger with private meal kit powerhouse Home Chef in a move to compete against the likes of Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report), HelloFresh, and Plated—which supermarket chain Albertsons bought last year. Kroger also expanded its partnership with grocery delivery startup powerhouse Instacart, which works with companies from CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) to Aldi.Kroger stock is currently a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold), and might not experience Thursday’s gains for a while now. With that said, the rest of the grocery industry has also made some significant changes in order to compete in the age of online shopping and delivery.Industry OverviewNielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) and the Food Marketing Institute released their second-ever ""Digitally Engaged Food Shopper"" study earlier this year, which stated that within the next five to seven years 70% of consumers will do at least some grocery shopping online. FMI and Nielsen also estimated that people will spend $100 billion a year in this budding industry. Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report)Walmart in March announced its plan to expand its online grocery delivery option to more than 100 metro areas by the end of the year, up from just six. The big-box giant also offers an order online and curbside pickup up service called “Grocery Hero” at 1,200 stores, with the company expected to add the service at 1,000 more locations by end of the year.Investors should note that Walmart’s first-quarter e-commerce sales surged by 33% in the U.S. Looking ahead, the company is projected to see it quarterly earnings climb by 12%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s revenues are expected to pop 1.8% to $125.53 billion.

The big-box giant, like its competitors, has also made a new-age push that includes its launch of CostcoGrocery last fall, which offers two-day delivery for non-perishable food and household supplies nationwide. The company also expanded its same-day delivery service to “most metropolitan” areas through an updated partnership with Instacart.The wholesale retailer’s quarterly revenues popped by 12% to $32.36 billion, with e-commerce comp sales up 36.8%. Looking ahead, Costco’s full-year earnings are projected to surge nearly 18%, while its full-year revenues are expected to reach $139.98 billion, representing an 8.5% jump. COST is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but sports an overall “A” VGM score based on its strong Value, Growth, and Moment grades.Target (TGT  -  Free Report)Target introduced its online ordering and curbside pickup service called “Drive-Up” in more than 250 stores last quarter and expanded its “Restock” program nationwide, which allows customers throughout the U.S. to shop from thousands of popular items for next day delivery.  The Minneapolis-based retailer saw its digital sales surge 28% in Q1, on top of a 21% climb in the year-ago period.

1018,KR,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jun 27. The big question facing investors is whether this drug store retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the last reported quarter, the company reported a positive surprise, with loss of 1 cent per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 2 cents. Further, the company has topped estimates in two of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate suggests that the company is likely to post break-even results for the quarter under review, against loss of 5 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.35 billion, down 31.2% from the prior-year quarter.Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteHowever, Rite Aid’s shares have surged 11.8% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s increase of 1.7%. This could be attributed to the optimism arising from the completion of store sales to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) and the pending merger deal with Albertsons. Clearly, there is positive momentum for the stock, ahead of the fiscal first-quarter earnings release. Factors at PlayRite Aid stock is witnessing an increase due to positive developments such as its recent merger deal with grocer Albertsons Companies. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of the calendar year 2018. Moreover, Rite Aid’s efforts to boost market share through wellness remodeling and other strategic initiatives bode well. The company remodeled 38 outlets and relocated six stores in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. As of Mar 3, 2017, it had 1,805 wellness stores.Furthermore, in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call, Rite Aid outlined a robust initial view for fiscal 2019. The company anticipates benefiting from generic drug purchasing efficiencies, a stable reimbursement rate environment compared with fiscal 2018, and TSA fees related to the Walgreens deal along with other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies.The company estimates sales of $21.7-$22.1 billion in fiscal 2019 with comps anticipated to be flat to up 1%. Further, the company expects adjusted net income per share of 2-6 cents compared with loss of 2 cents per share reported in fiscal 2018.However, the company’s dismal past performances, particularly the top line, remain concerns. Though its bottom-line results surpassed estimates in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, sales lagged for the third straight quarter. Moreover, both earnings and sales dropped year over year. While the bottom-line beat was attributed to the improvement in reimbursement rates, it declined year over year due to the fall in adjusted EBITDA, higher Walgreens deal-related costs along with increased lease termination and impairment charges. Further, sales dipped on account of soft comps as well as the decline in revenues at Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments.Though the company’s future prospects look bright, owing to the pending acquisition, solid fiscal 2019 outlook and other strategies, we remain a little skeptical about the near-term performance due to the company’s dismal past trends.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rite Aid is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Rite Aid has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

1019,KR,"Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) strategic investment in China’s JD.com (JD  -  Free Report) and its Carrefour partnership boost its Google Shopping service while the completion of Waymo’s year-long experiment with riders take it a step closer to launching the self-driving taxi service. Here are the details-Investing In JD.comGoogle is investing $550 million for 27.1 million newly issued Class A ordinary shares in JD.com, constituting less than 1% of the company.The strategic investment is likely the beginning of a long-term relationship between the two, to strengthen Google Shopping on the one hand, and expanding JD.com’s global reach on the other.The two are bringing what they do best to the table, which is Google’s market reach, analytics and technological prowess and JD’s logistics and inventory management to build retail infrastructure solutions across Southeast Asia, Europe and the U.S.Google needs to take back some of the product search it has lost to Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and tapping the growth potential in China and Southeast Asia also won’t hurt. JD needs to do something fast to hold its own in China and Southeast Asia as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) has doubled down on logistics (with Cianio and Lazada). Growth in other international markets will be a bonus.Amazon and Alibaba are giants, so it will take a lot to wrest share from them.  Carrefour Partnership Carrefour, one of the leading food retailers in France has signed an agreement with Google to digitize its operations. So it is doing three things-Adopting G Suite (including Gmail, calendar, drive, Hangouts, Docs) to be used by its more than 160,000 employees while training a thousand employees within six months in a program that started at the beginning of the year to incorporate a culture of quick decision-making;Opening an innovation lab in Paris this summer in partnership with Google Cloud where Carrefour engineers will work alongside Google Cloud AI experts to collaborate on new consumer experiences;And most importantly, facilitating a new buying experience from Carrefour across Google platforms (Assistant, Google Home and on the Google Shopping website in France). The companies expect that by early 2019, French shoppers will be able to shop from Carrefour with Google Home devices, with Assistant on their smartphones and through Google Shopping on the web for home delivery or pickup in-store.So Carrefour is betting that its product knowledge and expertise in logistics and sales, when coupled with Google’s technology, will enable the company fend off competition from Amazon and other traditional retailers.Amazon’s product breadth and global scale have shaken things for traditional retailers and food retailers are no different. So when Amazon bought Whole Foods Market last year, food retailers across the world sat up and took notice. That’s what drove companies like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and others to build relationships with Google. Now food retailers in other markets are doing likewise. One of the leading French grocers, Casino recently started selling products from its upmarket Monoprix chain on Amazon.For Google, it’s just what the company needs to regain product search market share from Amazon (whether it will be successful in the effort is an open question).Waymo Car in CrashIt is at times scary to see headlines about self-driving cars in crashes, but it’s also worth noting that the self-driving car is not always at fault. As it turns out, according to eye witnesses, another car jumped a red light to crash into the Waymo car, which wasn’t in autonomous mode (according to the driver). The Waymo car then crashed into three other vehicles.400 Riders Using WaymoWaymo selected 400 riders of varying categories and age groups (between 9 and 49) to ride its self-driving cars for free within a 100-square-mile area. In exchange, the riders were asked to provide feedback on what could be done better. After testing for a year, the feedback indicated that it needed to make certain changes on store front pickups, narrow-street pickups, waking up sleeping commuters and how to accommodate service animals.     Helping College AdmissionsGoogle says that a Google Search to find a four-year U.S. college will now automatically pull up additional information about admissions, graduation rates, tuition costs, notable alumni, and student life. Google is also offering a feature that includes financing cost and total debt level when the student passes out.Google is getting the information from government sources like the College Scorecard and the Integrated Postsecondary Education System.As college education gets more and more expensive, students and their families increasingly want to evaluate just how good a college is in terms of results. This becomes difficult/confusing for many because of the amount of marketing materials available online that invariably get mixed up with actual information.So the effectiveness of Google’s program depends on its ability to keep college ads away from pages that display information about colleges. Otherwise, we could end up with the same problem packaged differently.RecommendationsGoogle shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1020,KR,"The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 21. In the trailing four quarters, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of roughly 2.3%. In the preceding quarter, the company reported in line earnings. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping for a positive earnings surprise from Kroger in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 63 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of roughly 9%. We observe that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased by a penny in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $37,012 million, up approximately 2% from the year-ago quarter.Which Factors Hold Key to Kroger’s Performance?The grocery industry has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. Kroger has taken the stock of the situation and is in the process of giving itself a complete makeover. The company is expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is also gaining traction. These endeavors are likely to fuel top-line growth.Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations.The grocery industry is no longer shielded from the e-commerce war. Given this scenario, the Ocado deal along with the acquisition of Home Chef is definitely a good move by Kroger to stay abreast in the race.Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy that enriches the consumers shopping experience and convinces them of returning to the store is also benefiting the company. We believe that its operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales, alleviate gross margin pressure, improve operating margin and enhance return on invested capital.The Kroger Co.

1021,KR,"Markets opened lower on Friday after President Donald Trump and his administration announced that it will impose $50 billion worth of tariffs on goods from China. With trade war fears between the world’s two largest economies heightened once again, investors will want to pay close attention to companies reporting their quarterly earnings results next week.The official White House statement said it would implement a 25% tariff on $50 billion of Chinese goods “that contain industrially significant technologies.” China then responded in kind, noting that the country will roll out its own tariffs on American goods in “equal scale and equal strength.”The latest trade war concerns will likely put even more pressure on companies and stocks, which means investors need to know what to expect.

1022,KR,"The grocery war is heating up with tech giants fast trying to invade the space. Reportedly, Microsoft, Inc. (MSFT  -  Free Report) is working on a technology that will eliminate the role of a cashier in a store. And if reports are to be believed, the tech giant is already in talks with retailers, including Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report). Understandably, the technology is being developed in a move to compete with Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Go, the e-commerce giant’s cashier-less store.That said, an increasing number of retailers and grocers are focusing on customer convenience. From speeding up delivery to introducing digital shopping scanners and coming up with cashier-less stores, retailers are aggressively pumping in more money to develop new technologies and adding muscle to their delivery arm to stay ahead in the race.Microsoft Challenges AmazonMicrosoft is reportedly developing a technology wherein a cashier would no longer be required in a brick-and-mortar store. The tech giant is working on a system, which will be able to track what a customer puts in his or her cart in a brick-and mortar store. In fact, Microsoft reportedly has already demonstrated the sample to select retailers.Interestingly, the new technology could revamp the company’s previous failed attempt of check-out free shopping. Moreover, Microsoft plans not to introduce this technology in its stores first. Instead, it is reportedly in talks with Walmart. Understandably, the new technology is in a move to challenge Amazon Go, the e-commerce giant’s cashier-less store. Amazon, over the last few years, has changed the entire retail ballgame that has made brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) shift focus to online.However, Microsoft’s aim is to develop a cost-effective retail tech system that will not only eliminate the role of a cashier but also will help in cutting down the cost of thousands of cameras installed on the ceilings of brick-and-mortar store.Others Join the RaceIn January 2018, Amazon opened the first Amazon Go store in Seattle. The 1,800-square-foot automated store has replaced cashiers with a smartphone app and hundreds of small cameras that tracks customers’ purchases. This certainly was a revolutionary move by Amazon and a direct challenge to brick-and-mortar giants.However, brick-and-mortar giants too have been increasingly focusing on online sales and using technology to stay abreast in the race. Walmart, Amazon’s biggest rival, already has its Scan and Go technology that allows customers to shop at its stores without interacting with a cashier.In fact, earlier this year, Walmart announced that it will be expanding its Scan and Go technology to an additional 100 stores. Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Moreover, immediately after the launch of Amazon Go, Kroger announced that it will expand its Scan, Bag, Go technology to new divisions. The technology helps customers to visit a store self-checkout area for payment. Apart from expanding its Scan, Bag, Go technology to 400 stores by the end of this year, Kroger is also working on a new technology wherein customers can skip checkout and directly pay through an app.Understandably, everyone is trying to build a loyal clientele by playing on the customer- convenience quotient. Amazon too is planning to open more Amazon Go stores by the end of this year, thus heating up the retail race.Bottom LineTechnology undoubtedly has changed the entire retail game in the last few years, with the gap between online and offline fast disappearing. Microsoft’s new technology certainly will make things easier for retailers and intensify competition.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1023,KR,"Moving ahead with its strategic transformation plan, SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) unveiled a proposal (the “Holding Company Proposal”) to rearrange its corporate structure into a holding company setup. This move, which is likely to support SUPERVALU’s strategic transformation, is also aimed at enhancing long-term shareholders’ value.SUPERVALU took this initiative to organize and make further distinctions between its wholesale and retail operations, in a planned and more efficient way. The company also plans to segregate its liabilities into the respective wholesale and retail segments. Further, the move is aimed at supporting SUPERVALU’s previously announced transformation plan to divest various retail assets to third parties.Additionally, the Holding Company Proposal is aimed at expanding the company’s business, alongside improving its financial flexibility. Finally, through this plan, management intends to help SUPERVALU execute its strategic transformation plan in a tax efficient way. This may help the company generate cash tax gains of nearly $300 million over the next 15 years, roughly.SUPERVALU has been working on its transformation for approximately two years now, to emerge as a wholesale supplier for U.S. grocery retailers. Incidentally, SUPERVALU’s retail segment has been an aspect of worry for a while, thanks to stiff competition and intense promotions that have been plaguing the unit’s performance. These issues have compelled the company to adhere to store closures and streamline retail operations significantly.To this end, management recently revealed plans to sell its Shop ‘n Save and Shop ‘n Save East retail businesses. In earlier developments, SUPERVALU entered into definitive agreements with Mid-Atlantic Division of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) as well as Harris Teeter and Food Lion, to sell 21 of its Farm Fresh Food & Pharmacy stores in a transaction of about $43 million. The company is expected to undertake more Farm Fresh store closures in the future. In fiscal 2016, the company sold nearly 1,350 Save-A-Lot stores. Considering the fact that the retail segment has been falling in shambles, the company’s move to strengthen its wholesale business seems quite rational.  Also, the company has been focused on undertaking efforts to generate long-term value for shareholders.These factors have also boosted investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock that has rallied 28.1% in the past three months, as against the industry’s decline of 4.75.That said, we expect the aforementioned proposal to provide further impetus to the company’s ongoing plan, which may drive its stock further.Looking for More Promising Food Stocks?

1024,KR,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is fast catching up with the likes of Amamzon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) to stay in the delivery race. The retail giant is more than halfway through its rollout of same-day delivery with Shipt and the launch of curbside pickup service Drive Up. Target is on track to meet its goal of making available these services in majority of the stores it operates by the holiday season.The retail war is heating up with an increasing number of players shifting focus toward minimum delivery time. Almost all retail giants are pumping in more money and are either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race.Target Intensifies Delivery RaceTarget has set a goal of making available the Shift service in majority of its stores in more than 40 states before Christmas 2018. And the company is more than halfway through its rollout of same-day delivery with Shipt and the launch of curbside pickup service Drive Up. According to Target, Chicago will become the first major urban area to get access to all four of Target’s coveted fast-delivery services — Shift, Drive Up, Target Restock and from-the-store delivery. Drive Up will be available in 1,000 stores by the end of the year. Moreover, Target also decided last month to cut its next-day delivery fee by nearly half.In December 2017, Target announced plans of acquiring grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 billion and using its technology platform to expand same-day delivery at Target Stores. In March, Target and Shipt started same-day delivery of more than 55,000 groceries and home goods, toys, electronics and other products in Baltimore and Washington. It seems that the company is well on track to meet its goal and is fast expanding Shipt same-day delivery service and curbside pickup service Drive Up.Retailers Shift Focus  Amazon set the ball rolling by playing to its strength — a strong delivery wing — when it started offering free-two-hour delivery service from Whole Food stores to its Prime members in February. The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods that stocks a wide range of fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items (read: Will Amazon's 2-Hour Whole Foods Delivery Skew Retail Pitch?)Price Performance (Year to Date)It goes without saying that Amazon has been a pioneer in minimizing the gap between online and offline retail space. Brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Kroger and Target, which so long, in order to compete with Amazon, were stressing on increased investments in e-commerce, have perhaps realized that bridging the online and offline gap is the ideal way to compete. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In February, Walmart announced that it will be expanding its delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of 2018 with orders fulfilled at more than 800 stores across the country and delivered to shoppers contracted through Deliv, Uber and other delivery contractors.The Kroger Company (KR  -  Free Report) too is increasingly focusing on the delivery aspect. The company is into a partnership with same-day grocery delivery service Instacart and delivers groceries for Kroger stores in 45 U.S. markets.Summing UpIt goes without saying that the retail war is more focused on the delivery race now. The idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient and most retailers are busy reallocating their investments to add muscle to their delivery service wing. Needless to say, the gap between online and offline retail is fast disappearing and it’s only a matter of time when others jump the bandwagon.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

Amazon is expecting to achieve the target by this summer.Additionally, the Prime members can avail the offer while using Whole Foods app for transaction and getting it delivered via Amazon Prime.We believe Amazon’s strong endeavors toward rewarding the customers will continue to benefit its market position.Further, the company introduced two-hour delivery services from Whole Foods stores to Prime members via Prime Now this year. The services were first offered in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach. Recently, the company has expanded the service to Denver, Sacramento, San Diego, Los Angeles, Atlanta and San Francisco.This will help the company in gaining competitive edge against the likes of — Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which are the major players in the U.S. grocery market.Walmart acquired Parcel and extended partnership with Deliv last year to support its same day delivery initiative.

Meanwhile, management has been expanding assortments in the furniture category by including lawn and garden items.In order to tap the opportunities in the furniture and soft home categories, the company has added brands and revamped the food department by giving it a fresh look for the convenience of customers. Further, the company has rolled out a cooler/freezer facility in stores in an attempt to expand its merchandise of food-related items to target food stamp recipients.

1029,KR,"Retail stocks have been the best market performers so far in 2018, handily outpacing the S&P 500.  The industry is up 20% year to date versus 6% for the S&P and some of the best performers, like Amazon (AMZN), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) are up even more.In a blockbuster Q1 earnings season, one retail stock after another reported better-than expected revenues in an environment of low unemployment and Consumer Confidence at an 18-month high.Most of those increased sales have one thing in common – electronic payment. Approximately 67% of in-person sales and virtually 100% of online transactions are made with a credit or debit card. Consumers increasingly prefer the convenience and security of electronic transactions for large purchases all the way down to a cup of coffee.In the shift toward an essentially cashless economy, one big winner is the company who process electronic payments and transfers.Priceless GrowthMastercard (MA  -  Free Report) has been offering credit card processing services for issuing banks since 1966 – way back when credit card transactions happened on those sliding carbon-copy machines.  Originally organized as a cooperative of issuing banks, Mastercard went public in 2006 as an independent transaction processor.Mastercard now has gross sales of $15 billion a year and reported record results in Q1 with gross sales of $3.6B and earnings of $1.50/share, increases of 31% and 49% respectively over the same quarter in 2017.

WEX partners with both the customers who utilize the company’s innovative virtual payment solutions and the vendors who provide the goods and services being purchased, using economies of scale to reduce transaction costs.WEX provides detailed information, insights and control over spending, allowing customers to manage costs and reduce paperwork.WEX has also invested in distributed ledger technology especially as it relates to crypto-currencies. Though Bitcoin and other cryptos are not yet widely used for everyday transactions, if they gain favor in the future, WEX will be ready to process payments - and likey one of the leaders in the iindustry.Thanks to steadily growing revenues and earnings, WEX shares have risen 36% in 2018. WEX is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Cash is not DeadAlthough an increasing amount of payments are performed electronically, cash is not dead yet, as many consumers and merchants continue to prefer currency for transactions.

Their customers include large financial institutions like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), TD (TD) and Santander (SOV.C) as well as merchants including Target, Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report).With a history of positive earnings surprises, CATM posted a big earnings beat in Q1, reporting $0.46/share versus estimates of $0.26/share.Cardtronics is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Although new technologies are a lot more interesting to talk about, sometimes the biggest and best company is finding the opportunities for big earnings in the “old” space.

1032,KR,"The fight for e-commerce retail supremacy is heating up with The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report) acquiring meal-kit company Home Chef. The latest development comes within a week of the company striking a deal with British online grocer Ocado to use its robotic technology to fill up orders at its warehouses. The retail landscape is fast changing with almost all major brick-and-mortar stores increasingly focusing on their e-commerce segment.It goes without saying that Amazon.com, Inc.

The initial price is $200 million and could go up to $700 million over the next five years in earnout payments to Home Chef if it meets certain sales and performance targets.Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain by stores and sales, has been testing the market of its own meal kits at its own stores for quite some time now. Understandably, the Home Chef buyout is in a move to stay in the e-commerce race that follows Amazon’s takeover of the Whole Foods Market.Much like a number of other brick-and-mortar stores, Kroger too has been making efforts to survive the e-commerce onslaught. The Home Chef acquisition is definitely give Kroger a shot in the arm, as Home Chef saw its sales jump 150% to $250 million in 2017.Moreover, the tie-up with Ocado last week will help Kroger will help the company run automated warehouses and deliver food with the help of Ocado’s robots. Kroger certainly is taking the challenge to face both Amazon and Walmart, Inc.

Moreover, the e-commerce giant announced two-hour same-day grocery delivery service in February, which set the alarm bells ringing for brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) that so long rested assured of business safety. Target has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Walmart, undoubtedly, is Amazon’s biggest rival and has been making inroads into the e-commerce space. The brick-and-mortar giant’s recent $16 billion acquisition of India’s e-commerce company Flipkart is been viewed as a bold step toward the online shift.Target too has been increasingly focusing on the e-commerce and delivery front. The company has made e-commerce an important part of its $7 billion turnaround plan. Keeping this mind, Target will be introducing voice-activated shopping with the help of Alphabet, Inc’s (GOOGL) Google assistant. Also, earlier this month the company slashed the next-day delivery feel to almost half to attract more customers.Meanwhile, Dollar Tree has been taking up the challenge by opening more stores. The company will be introducing 650 more stores in 2018 in order to lure more customers. Given that all products at Dollar Tree stores are priced at $1 or below (pricing is its biggest strength) the company is being able to keep itself afloat amid the e-commerce onslaught. Similarly, Dollar General too plans to open 900 stores in 2018.Summing UpThe retail landscape has certainly changed with e-commerce running the show. This definitely has made brick-and-mortar stores sit up and think. However, the race for supremacy seems to be heating up with more players adding muscle to their e-commerce and delivery arm with more acquisitions and technological assistance.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1033,KR,"As far as our corporate earnings calendars are concerned, this is the week each quarter that stands as an outlier — in between two big earnings season clusters, this is the week that brings alternative fiscal calendars from major companies like Oracle and FedEx, among others. Yesterday after the bell we saw results from growth chip-maker Micron (MU  -  Free Report), and ahead of today’s open we also have earnings from Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-based Micron, with a Zacks Style Score of A, topped expectations on both top and bottom lines, with earnings of $3.15 per share beating by a penny and quarterly sales of $7.80 billion, above the $7.75 billion anticipated. These marginal beats may seem unimpressive at first — indeed, shares traded down initially upon the the report’s release after the closing bell yesterday — but keep in mind revenues are up 40% year over year, and gross margins have blossomed to 60.6% from 46.9% a year ago.Key for the turnaround in sentiment for Micron — the stock is now up 4.5% in Thursday’s pre-market, and an astonishing 43% year-to-date — was in the analysis of the company’s forecast on sales for memory chips, which proved very promising. Concerns about memory chip demand continuing their current robust trajectory had been on the minds of analysts of late. Yesterday’s conference call seems to have put most of them at ease. For more on MU’s earnings, click here.Supermarket giant The Kroger Company outpaced bottom line estimates by a full ten cents, to 73 cents per share. Revenues of $37.5 billion surpassed the $37.2 billion estimate in the Zacks consensus, and the company upped the lower end of fiscal 2018 earnings guidance. This has helped KR shares boost 10.5% in today’s pre-market, bring the stock effectively back up to the trading plateau the company hasn’t seen since early March. For more on KR’s earnings, click here.Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse proprietor Darden Restaurants posted fiscal Q4 earnings of $1.39 per share, a beat of four cents, while eking out a beat on the top line as well, to $2.13 billion. Blended comps of its legacy brands amounted to 2.2% growth year over year. Pre-market trading is also very favorable for Darden at this hour — up 13% ahead of the opening bell. For more on DRI’s earnings, click here.Jobless Claims Continue to AmazeKeeping within the almost unconscionably good rates on Initial Jobless Claims — within 200K-225K, the lowest we’ve seen since the Rolling Stones were all young men — this morning the headline reached 218K claims, down from the upwardly revised 221K of the previous week. Continuing claims ticked up a bit to 1.723 million (they had dipped below 1.7 million in last week’s initial read) but are still at historically low measures. These results are consistent with a truly amazing U.S. labor market — at or near full employment but without sparking major inflation concerns.Philly Fed DisappointsAnything to feed the bears with today? Not really, unless you’d care to continue hand-wringing over a possible global trade war. Otherwise, you’ll need to look toward Philly Fed numbers which, at 19.9, came in far lower than the 28.5 analysts were looking for. Today’s figure is the lowest since November of 2016, but these numbers are often quite volatile, as they track dealings in just one major metropolitan area of the U.S. The highest read we’ve seen thus far in 2018 is February’s 35.3.

1034,KR,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23. In the trailing four quarters, this designer, manufacturer and retailer of jewelry and other items has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.5%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.5%.Investors are counting on another estimate beat by Tiffany in the to-be-reported quarter. Let’s delve deep and take a look at the factors that will be influencing the results.Here Are the Deciding FactorsTiffany is well positioned to augment its top and bottom-lines performance in the long run by leveraging capital investments made over the past several years in distribution, manufacturing and diamond sourcing processes. The company is also looking at other revenue generating avenues. It also intends to expand distribution network by adding stores in both new and existing markets. The company is focused on opening smaller stores that offer selected collections of lower priced higher-margin product, which in turn boosts store productivity.The company is gradually coming up with new jewelry designs, range of watches and fragrance. It has also introduced “build-your-own program” on its website under which customers are allowed to personalize their charm bracelets. Also, Tiffany is allowing customers to customize rings. Apart from this, the company renewed its licensing agreement with Luxottica Group — slated to expire on Dec 31, 2027 — for the development, production and global distribution of sunglasses and prescription frames.However, despite the company’s efforts to boost the top line, rising SG&A expenses are likely to dent the operating margin. In this regard, we note that management expects fiscal 2018 SG&A expenses to increase at a rate higher than sales on account of increased spending on technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations. We noted that in the first, second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, SG&A expenses had increased 0.2%, 3.7%, 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively.Tiffany & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tiffany & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tiffany & Co. QuoteHow Are Top & Bottom Line Estimates Faring?After registering a bottom-line increase of 15% in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, Tiffany is likely to record year-over-year growth of more than 13% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 84 cents compared with 74 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks now project revenues of $960.7 million, up from $899.6 million in the year-ago quarter.If all goes well, this will be the fourth straight quarter that the company will surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom lines.What Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tiffany is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

1035,KR,"SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) has been progressing well with wholesale business on the back of well-chalked endeavors to enhance customer base and undertake buyouts. However, management is concerned with persistent weakness in the retail unit, which has led to store closures.Wholesale Arena Looks StrongSUPERVALU’s wholesale business has been gaining on the back of customer additions, retaining and developing business with existing customers as well as acquisitions. Buoyed by such factors, the company’s wholesale business has evolved into as one of its prime revenue sources. In fact, during fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the segment accounted for as much as 80% of the company’s total revenues and surging 60% surge year over year.Among others, buyouts have been one of the prime strategies of the company to augment wholesale operations. Notable mentions in this regard include the acquisitions of Associated Grocers of Florida and Unified Grocers. Notably, during the fourth quarter, sales in this segment gained approximately $840 million from Unified Grocers, whereas AG Florida contributed $130 million. Additionally, the company is on track to generate targeted synergies from these buyouts. Apart from this, the company also has supply agreements with retailers like Fresh Market Inc and America’s Food Basket, which are expected to fuel sales growth in this segment. Also, management is committed toward enhancing the segment’s operating efficiency and optimizing distribution channels, information technology as well as logistics. All said, the company is dedicated toward making investments in the wholesale business to boost future growth. Hurdles Yet to be CrossedSUPERVALU’s retail segment has been an aspect of worry for the company for a while, thanks to stiff competition and intense promotions that have been plaguing the unit’s performance. These have compelled the company to adhere to store closures and streamline retail operations significantly. Notably, during fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, net sales in retail dropped 0.6% to $690 million on account of store closures.Further, management has revealed plans to sell its Shop ‘n Save and Shop ‘n Save East retail businesses. In earlier developments, SUPERVALU entered into definitive agreements with Mid-Atlantic Division of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) as well as Harris Teeter and Food Lion to sell 21 of its Farm Fresh Food & Pharmacy stores in a transaction of about $43 million. The company is expected to undertake more Farm Fresh store closures in the future. In fiscal 2016, the company sold nearly 1,350 Save-A-Lot stores. While such moves are expected to optimize SUPERVALU’s operations by shifting away from less profitable to other prospective business areas, it is also most likely to dent the retail segment’s performance further.Well, persistent softness in the retail arena has also weighed on investors’ sentiment. Evidently, SUPERVALU’s shares have plunged 42.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of almost 19%. Considering the fact that the retail segment has been falling in shambles, the company’s move to strengthen its wholesale business seems quite rational and is expected to uplift performance in the forthcoming periods.Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

1036,KR,"The Kroger Co.’s (KR  -  Free Report) “Restock Kroger” program gave a solid start to fiscal 2018. After reporting in line earnings in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, this grocery retailer posted better-than-expected first-quarter results prompting management to raise the lower end of fiscal 2018 earnings view. As a result, the stock is up roughly 9% during pre-market trading hours.The company delivered adjusted earnings of 73 cents a share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents and increased 25.9% from the prior-year quarter. This Cincinnati, OH-based company now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $2.00-$2.15 per share compared with the prior forecast of $1.95-$2.15. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 stands at $2.06.Total sales grew 3.4% to $37,530 million from the prior-year quarter and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37,212 million, marking the seventh straight quarter of revenue beat. Excluding fuel center sales, total sales rose 2.3%. Excluding fuel and the recently-sold convenience store business unit, total sales jumped 2.8%. Digital sales surged 66% during the quarter under review.The grocery industry has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. Kroger, which faces stiff competition from bellwethers such as Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), has taken the stock of the situation and is in the process of giving itself a complete makeover.The company is expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is also gaining traction. These endeavors are likely to fuel top-line growth. The grocery industry is no longer shielded from the e-commerce war. Given this scenario, the Ocado deal along with the acquisition of Home Chef is definitely a good move by Kroger to stay abreast in the race.These endeavors have helped the shares of Kroger to surge 12% in the past three months compared with the industry that declined 2%. We believe that the company's operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales and enhance return on invested capital.The company’s identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel center sales, grew 1.4%. Including Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and ship-to-home solutions – Kroger's identical sales, without fuel, rose 1.9% in the quarter. Kroger now projects fiscal 2018 identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to be in the range of 2-2.5%.The Kroger Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Kroger Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Kroger Co. QuoteOther Financial AspectsKroger ended the quarter with cash of $315 million, total debt of $14,301 million, and shareholders’ equity of $6,941 million. Total debt increased $857 million from the prior-year period. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio jumped to 2.43 compared with 2.33 in the year-ago period. In the trailing four quarters, the company bought back $2.7 billion of shares and paid $442 million in dividends.Management continues to project capital expenditures — excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities — to be approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2018.Bottom LineWe believe that Kroger’s dominant position enables it to expand store base and boost market share. The company’s customer-centric business model provides a strong value proposition to consumers. However, intensifying price war among grocery stores to lure budget-constrained consumers poses concern.Kroger carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1038,KR,"Target (TGT  -  Free Report) released its latest earnings report this morning, and with rival Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) reporting last week, investors now have a complete update on the big box retail behemoths. Both companies had mixed results, so now it is time to dig into each report to find the key takeaways and prepare for what is next.WalmartWalmart posted a double beat for Q1, with earnings of $1.14 per share and revenue of $122.7 billion. Despite outperforming expectations, the stock is down 4.8% since the report release. This is most likely a result of lowered guidance by the company due to the company investing in Flipkart, an Indian electronic commerce company.The company reported especially strong international performance. Net sales for Walmex (consolidated results of Mexico and Central America) increased 9.1%, Canada gained 2.6%, China moved 4% higher, and the United Kingdom added 3.4%.Walmart has been expanding its ecommerce business as well, competing with companies such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Whole Foods, but slightly cutting into profitability. Net income dropped $0.28 per share due to ecommerce and website investments, discounts, and transportation costs. But the investment seems to be paying off, with a 33% increase in e-commerce business growth.It is also worth noting that some of the shortcomings in Walmart’s report were caused by unseasonable weather.“We did have some headwinds we faced at the end of the quarter in April with some seasonally cool weather that impacted some of our general merchandise weather sensitive categories as well as some traffic in those categories,” said Kary Brunner, director of investor relations for Walmart, in the company’s earnings call.TargetTarget posted an earnings miss and revenue beat for Q1, reporting adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share and revenue of $16.8 billion. The earnings miss has driven share prices down 5.5% during regular trading hours today.The company reported a strong ecommerce transition as well, with online sales increasing 28% year over year. Although this is the case, it too is losing profitability at the cost of advancing its online business, with gross margins decreasing slightly year over year. Along with this, if the company hopes to produce a truly strong ecommerce platform, it will have to produce more than the current 5% of overall revenue that its digital sales are accounting for.On the upside, the company saw a strong 3% increase in comparable store sales. Running behind this, the company has stayed true to its previous full-year earnings outlook.Target’s purchase of Shipt, a same-day delivery company, shows its own delve into delivery, competing with the likes of Walmart, Whole Foods, and Kroger. Although profitability has been challenged, the company is confident that the uptick in consumer traffic in stores is a result of their efforts across the board.“We’re growing market share in a strong consumer environment across all major categories” said CEO Brian Cornell.Bottom LineWalmart and Target are two big box retailers pushing in the same direction. With both companies aggressively investing in their own brands, increase market share, and expand ecommerce, earnings and guidance likely took a dent. Walmart’s investments caused a substantial hit to its full year outlook, while Target’s investment decisions negatively impacted its Q1 EPS results.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1039,KR,"In an effort to focus on core operations, The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) recently concluded the sale of its convenience store business to EG Group for $2.15 billion. As part of the ""Restock Kroger"" program initiated last October, Kroger has been looking to weigh strategic alternatives for its convenience stores.Notably, Blackburn, England-based EG Group is an operator of convenience stores in Europe.Going into details of the deal, Kroger vended 762 stores (including 66 franchise operations in 18 states, employing 11,000 associates) under the Turkey Hill, Loaf 'N Jug, Kwik Shop, Tom Thumb and Quik Stop brands. However, management highlighted that supermarket fuel centers and Turkey Hill Dairy are not part of the deal.Planned in February, the sale is expected to yield $1.7 billion after taxes, out of which $1.2 billion will be used for an accelerated share repurchase program. The rest of the proceeds will be used to lower its net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. The sale seems like a fitting move by Kroger, which has been grappling with stiff competition in the grocery industry, volatile food prices, an aggressive promotional environment and declining store count. Kroger, which shares space with the likes of Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), is leaving no stone unturned to draw consumers and gain incremental revenues. The company is expanding its store base and introducing items and digital coupons along with other attractions like online ordering and pick-up at store.Apart from such bold moves, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been ramping up its shareholder-friendly activities. It has entered an agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to buy back shares, close on the heels of a $1-billion repurchase program announced on Mar 15. Per the agreement, the Cincinnati-based company will pay $1.2 billion to Goldman Sachs on Apr 24. In turn, Goldman Sachs will initially deliver around 36.1 million common shares of Kroger.

In the past six months, shares of the company have risen 13.5%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 0.9%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1040,KR,"Amid the ongoing debate followed by the strongest push in years for gun control, comes the news of another shootout at a Waffle House restaurant in Nashville on Sunday that killed four people and left another four injured. Since the mass shootout at a high school in Florida on Feb 17, which killed 17 people, financial institutions have been taking serious steps by reviewing and making changes in their business relationship with gun manufacturers and retailers.Gun stocks have been on a decline ever since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. And despite the mounting concerns, it’s quite unlikely that the Trump administration will initiate stricter actions on the firearms industry given that Republicans are endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA). Given this scenario, Corporate America’s voluntary actions to disassociate itself from the gun industry are particularly noteworthy.Financial institutions as well as a number of retailers, which have come up with new restrictions on sale of guns, have created significant pressure on the gun industry. But have gun stocks gained, as they usually do, in the wake of these shootings and corporate action?Corporate America Pushes for Gun Control The gun industry has been witnessing a sharp decline in both sales and profits since the election of Trump in 2016. So much so, that even Trump hinted at tightening background checks for guns in response to Florida massacre. Incidentally, more than half a dozen gunmakers such as Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc.’s (RGR  -  Free Report), Vista Outdoors Inc. (VSTO  -  Free Report) and American Outdoor Brands Corporation (AOBC  -  Free Report) produce assault-style rifles.Since then, there has been growing concern over gun control that has been supported by financial firms that have been reviewing their ties with the firearms industry and the NRA. And this has already made some financial companies act seriously toward the gun lobby. Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) became the first major Wall Street bank to announce changes relating to how it will conduct business with gun retailers and introduced restrictions on the sale of firearms for new retail-sector clients.Moreover, BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of new funds and index-tracking products that exclude gun manufacturers and retailers. This means that retailers like Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report), which sells guns along with a wide range of sports gear, and Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) will no longer be part of its newly launched funds. Dick’s Sporting has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Understandably, Corporate America is taking its most aggressive measures toward gun control in years. Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) is the latest to join forces with other financial institutions. The company recently announced that it would stop financing makers of military-style firearms for civilian use.Retailers, Financial Institutes Raise Gunmakers’ Worry It’s not only the financial institutions but gun retailers also have been voicing their concerns over responsible production and selling of guns. Dick’s Sporting in March came up with a new policy against selling guns to people under 21 years and against selling assault-style guns. This was followed by The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report), which announced that it would be exiting the firearms business.This certainly has made gunmakers in the United States wary. Although the Florida shooting immediately saw Corporate America taking aggressive measures to review its ties with gun manufacturers and the NRA, shares of gun manufacturers continued to decline.Increased measures are being taken by financial companies and retailers have put gun manufacturers under pressure. Moreover, Remington Resources Inc. has filed for bankruptcy, while Slide Fire Solutions, the company that created the bump stock, is shutting down its site on May 20. Understandably, the aggressive measures taken by retailers and financial institutes have increased tension among gun manufacturers.Summing UpThe general trend is that gun stocks rise on the assumption of stricter gun control measures. However, that didn’t happen this time around. This is because people tend to buy more firearms on fears of restrictions. However, this time, concerns for gun control didn’t come from the government, which is more likely, given that the Republicans are endorsed by the NRA, but from financial institutes, retailers and individuals. The recent shooting in Nashville is only likely to escalate the worries of gun manufacturers and increased pressure for gun control might make them feel the heat in the days to come.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1041,KR,"Investors in The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 22, 2018 $26 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Kroger shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Kroger is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Supermarkets industry that ranks in the Bottom 9% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 64 cents per shareto 63 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Kroger right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1042,KR,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) might have forever changed the grocery industry exactly one year ago when the e-commerce giant bought Whole Foods for roughly $14 billion on June 16, 2017. Today, grocery delivery is commonplace across the entire industry.OverviewNielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) and the Food Marketing Institute released their second-ever ""Digitally Engaged Food Shopper"" study earlier this year, which stated that within the next five to seven years 70% of consumers will do at least some grocery shopping online. Furthermore, FMI and Nielsen estimated that people will spend $100 billion year in this budding industry.Amazon’s e-commerce dominance sparked this growth and forced Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and many other grocery players to dive headfirst into e-commerce, delivery, and curbside pick-up.Before we jump into what the individual companies are doing on these vital fronts, let’s take a quick look at their price performances since Amazon bought Whole Foods last year.  Investors will note that Target stock has outperformed some of its peers over the last year, by a pretty wide margin. With that said, Amazon stock has soared nearly 78%, but it operates a much bigger and more diversified business than these grocery and big-box retailers. WalmartIn March, Walmart announced its plan to expand its online grocery delivery option to more than100 metro areas by the end of the year. At the time, the service was only available in six markets.The big-box giant also offers an order online, curbside pickup up service called “Grocery Hero” at 1,000 stores, with the company expected to add that service at 1,000 more locations by end of 2017. Investors should note that Walmart’s first-quarter e-commerce sales surged by 33% in the U.S.TargetTarget also introduced its online ordering, curbside pickup service called “Drive-Up” at more than 250 stores last quarter. The company also expanded its “Restock” program nationwide, allowing customers throughout the U.S. to shop from thousands of popular items for next day delivery.  The Minneapolis-based retailer saw its digital sales surge 28% in Q1, on top of a 21% climb in the year-ago period. Target also introduced same-day delivery at over 700 locations, which was made possible by its $550 million December 2017 purchase of grocery delivery startup Shipt.CostcoBig-box powerhouse Costco (COST  -  Free Report) launched CostcoGrocery last fall. The service offers two-day delivery for non-perishable food and household supplies to Costco customers nationwide. Meanwhile, the company expanded its same-day delivery service to “most metropolitan” areas through an updated partnership with grocery delivery startup giant Instacart.The company’s most recent quarterly financial results helped demonstrate how well Costco’s online ordering and delivery business has performed. The wholesale retailer’s quarterly revenues popped by 12% to $32.36 billion, with e-commerce comp sales up 36.8%.KrogerGrocery chain Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) recently started its “Restock Kroger” initiative, aimed to accelerate its digital and e-commerce offerings. The company currently offers online ordering and curbside pickup through its ClickList service.Like Costco and many others, including CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Aldi, and Jewel-Osco, Kroger works with Instacart for same-day delivery. It’s unclear exactly how effective Kroger’s new e-commerce and delivery initiatives have been, but its upcoming first quarter might give investors a better idea. The company is expected to report its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday, June 21 (also read: Upcoming Earnings to Watch: FDX, KR, DRI).Bottom LineAmazon changed the retail grocery business forever before it even bought Whole Foods. Today, consumers have online delivery and curbside pickup options at nearly every major U.S. chain, with most of the company’s rapidly expanding their same-day delivery offerings on their own or through partnerships.Going forward, don’t be surprised if a company like Costco, which is projected to pull in nearly $140 billion this year, buys grocery delivery superstar Instacart before the company decides to go public. There is no clear winner at the moment, aside from customers around the U.S. who have exponentially more online and grocery delivery options than they did one year ago.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1043,KR,"It might be time for the U.S. retail sector to rejoice after March sales registered an increase since November. But we believe consumer staples will emerge as the real beneficiary. Agreed, vehicle sales hogged attention in the March retail sales report, but sales rose at grocery stores, restaurants and bars, and drug stores on a wider scale.Staples Sales Stand Out in MarchOverall, retail sales rose 0.6% sequentially in March 2018, rebounding from a 0.1% decline in February and beating market expectations of a 0.4% gain. Food & beverage stores (0.2%, the same clip as in February) and health & personal care stores (1.4% versus -1.1%) were some of the categories that drove the staples sector. Food services & drinking places also registered an increase of 0.4%, the same pace noticed last month.Huge Room for Growth in Online GroceryPer a study by the Food Marketing Institute conducted by Nielsen, online grocery sales are estimated to make up about 20% of total grocery retail by 2025 to reach $100 billion in consumer sales. Wal Mart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) both are betting on this evolution. Walmart and logistics firm Postmates are joining hands to expand the retailer’s online grocery delivery option to more than 40% of U.S. households.Amazon is also striving to strengthen its presence in that category. With about 18% market share in the online grocery, Amazon is leading the space. Within only four months of the acquisition, Whole Foods' 365 Everyday Value brand became Amazon’s second best-selling private-label brand after AmazonBasics, per One Click Retail. Whole Foods delivery via Amazon Prime is now accessible in seven cities and continued expansion across the United States is planned throughout the rest of the year (read: E-Commerce Face-Off: Wal-Mart Vs. Amazon ETFs).Consumers Still Value Conscious? Economists predict that healthy consumer confidence, a solid job market and the tax reform tailwind will boost consumer spending growth in the months ahead. But according to Wall Street Journal, the wider trend in consumer spending hints at moderate growth despite an uptick in worker paychecks. If this is the situation of consumers’ spending pattern, they would probably buy more staples than discretionary items.Geopolitical TensionRecent geopolitical tensions related to U.S.-led airstrikes on Syria may not be given much importance but souring relations of the United States with Russia (slapped with sanctions for supporting Syria government) and China (the latter may involve in a trade war with the United States) are causes for concerns and can disrupt market movement any time.If this happens, investors will invariably flee to a safe sector like consumer staples. Moreover, safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasury gains in market volatility and yield falls. Staples stocks perform better in a low-rate environment (read: Winning ETF Areas of March).Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few staples ETFs & stocks that could offer you good gains ahead (read: Staples ETFs: What Investors Need to Know).ETFs in Focus  PowerShares Dynamic Food & Beverage Portfolio (PBJ  -  Free Report)– Up 1.23% on Apr 16The fund is dedicated to food and beverage companies with top allocations going to Constellation Brands Inc, Sysco Corp and McDonald's Corp.PowerShares DWA Consumer Staples Momentum ETF(PSL  -  Free Report) – Up 1.14% on Apr 16The underlying index looks to track companies that are showing relative strength (momentum).

1044,KR,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is making headlines yet again with its latest move to redesign its website, which will be more personalized to fit consumers’ needs, per media sources. The company is clearly an eager-beaver when it comes to strengthening its e-commerce as evident from its constant strides in this realm. In fact, retailers are rapidly revolutionizing the concept of online shopping through various services as well as features and Walmart seems to be amongst the forerunners in this respect.Fresh Face For Walmart’s WebsiteWell, the latest initiative of Walmart to provide a whole new look to its website incorporates the addition of a number of informal photographs, extensive range of fronts and colors as well as increased levels of personalization. The personalization features will involve syncing the homepage with consumer’s location and providing products trending in their location. The website will also highlight products based on previous orders.Management also stated that the redesigned website will have different layouts based on product categories. As a result, consumers will be able to purchase groceries in a separate manner than the way in which they shop for apparel or other items.  These changes, which are likely to be effective from May, are expected to give popular and specific consumer preferred brands more space.Management states that enhanced levels of personalization will aid the company to better understand and respond to consumers’ preferences.  Constant Efforts to Bolster Online BusinessIndeed, Walmart has been actively pursuing expansion of its online platform. Recently, the supermarket giant inked a deal with Postmates to extend its online grocery delivery service to cover more than 40% of the families in the United States. In earlier developments, Walmart’s Sam’s Club stores partnered with Instacart to provide same-day delivery services and improve sales of food products as well as everyday essentials. Also, the company acquired a delivery startup — Parcel, Inc. — which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Other than this, the company tested same day deliveries with Deliv and also partnered with ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Apart from Walmart, Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have also been rapidly upgrading their delivery services to enrich consumers’ experience.With a range of bold moves in the online space taken in the recent past, Walmart is making its presence felt in a market that is dominated by online giant, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Such well-spun strategies have aided this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gain 17.5% in the past year, while the industry rose 13%. With relentless efforts to strengthen footing in online shopping, Walmart seems well on track to meet its anticipated e-commerce sales jump of nearly 40% in fiscal 2019.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1045,KR,"While Walmart Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) progress in the e-commerce realm has been talked about for some time, the company has not neglected its brick-and-mortar business. This is evident from its latest announcement to open and remodel 43 stores in Florida. These new and upgraded stores will be equipped with advanced in-store and digital innovations.Many retailers consider the modern tech-savvy era as bad omen for brick-and-mortar stores. On the flip side, few players like Walmart, perceive this as an opportunity to drive omnichannel sales. Physical stores have become a key link to drive online shopping, courtesy of strategies like in-store pickups. Such hi-tech augmentation efforts will empower traditional stores and strengthen their position in the retail space.Well, Walmart’s latest move to expand its store base in Florida, indicates the company’s dedication toward evolving traditional stores as a vital part of omnichannel sales, helping consumers to shop with ease. That said, lets delve into the latest plans the company has spun for its Florida stores.Plans to Fortify StoresWalmart plans to spend around $200 million in Florida to augment its stores, as part of the company’s budgeted investments of $11.0 billion for business development in fiscal 2019. It plans to open six stores in Central Florida, Jacksonville and Miami-Fort Lauderdale. Also, it plans to remodel 37 stores in several regions of Florida. Apart from these, the company intends to open a new distribution center in the City of Cocoa.Further, Walmart’s store development plans in the state include rolling out its Grocery Pickup services to another 80 stores. Such services currently exist in close to 100 stores in the region. Further, the company’s Mobile Express Scan & Go facility was recently launched across 10 Walmart stores in Florida. Additionally, this service is available at 49 Sam’s Club stores in the region.Moving further on these lines, Walmart’s Pickup Towers have been gaining traction lately, as it makes online delivery system smarter by saving time and costs for the company as well as consumers. The facility is available in 15 stores across Florida. Walmart plans to continue to explore opportunities in the region to expand the same.Seamless Deliveries is the Latest MantraClearly, Walmart has been quite receptive to consumers’ preference for online shopping. In fact, the company’s Florida store augmentation efforts bear testimony to the fact that it is actively undertaking efforts to incorporate stores with digitalization trends and create diverse shopping experiences. By integrating physical stores with online shopping, Walmart has been able to improve its delivery services.Earlier this week itself, the supermarket giant inked a deal with Postmates to extend its online grocery delivery service to cover more than 40% of the families in the United States. In earlier developments, Walmart’s Sam’s Club stores partnered with Instacart for providing same-day delivery services and improve sales of food products and everyday essentials. Also, the company acquired a delivery startup — Parcel, Inc. — which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Other than this, the company tested same day deliveries with Deliv, while it also partnered with ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. .Notably, such well-chalked endeavors to enhance store and e-commerce traffic have been aiding comparable store sales (comps) growth. Incidentally, the company’s U.S. comps (excluding fuel) rose 2.6% during fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, which marked its 14th consecutive quarter of growth. We believe that such store augmentation efforts in Florida will contribute to the company’s robust comps trend.Wrapping it up, we believe Walmart’s efforts will fortify its presence in the rapidly evolving retail space and compete better with industry behemoth Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Like Walmart, companies such as Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), have been undertaking several initiatives to improve delivery services. This indicates that companies are rapidly transforming their operating models to suit the needs of consumers’ tech-driven lifestyle.Coming back to Walmart, this Zacks Rank #3 (Buy) company’s strategies to continue augmenting its business and operations have been raising investor’s optimism. Shares of the company have soared almost 16.8% over the past year, compared with the industry’s rally of 12.8%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1046,KR,"Guess What? Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might just win the next level in its game against Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Incidentally, both these players have long been at loggerheads, and eyeing India’s leading e-commerce player – Flipkart for quite some time now. Markedly, chances that Walmart will win this round are higher, as reported by some sources.While both companies are trying to scoop up a major stake in India’s number one online player, currently valued at roughly $20 billion, it looks like Flipkart is more inclined toward teaming up with Walmart. Incidentally, there were rounds that this supermarket giant is already in advanced talks to buy about a 51% stake in Flipkart for $10-$12 billion and has already concluded a due diligence on the latter.Walmart or Amazon: Who Will Win the Flipkart Deal?Though there hasn’t been any official confirmation from Walmart, Amazon or Flipkart, sources revealed that Flipkart is bent toward Walmart. This is because that a deal with the latter would encounter fewer regulatory hurdles, in comparison to Amazon, as Walmart doesn’t have any online retail existence in India.On the contrary, Amazon is India’s second largest online player, which also makes it Flipkart’s direct and biggest competitor. Thus, Flipkart and Amazon together would create a monopoly in the Indian online retail space, making it tough for them to clear regulatory hurdles. Apart from this, giving the stake to Walmart will also help Flipkart’s founders to continue helping in leading the business.However, it is still too early to be confident about a Walmart-Flipkart deal, as Flipkart’s biggest stakeholder — SoftBank Group — appears to be more in favor of collaborating with Amazon, given the latter’s commendable feat in the e-commerce space. Also, Amazon is likely to try all means to win the deal, as Walmart’s investment in Flipkart would intensify competition and make things tough for Amazon.Well, this e-commerce king is firing on all cylinders to get the top position in Indian online retail – after its failed efforts to dominate the e-commerce market in China. Apparently, Amazon India has been planning to slash prices and ramping up investments to grab a bigger slice of the market share in the Asian country. Also, rounds were made that this online biggie offered a breakup fee of nearly $1-$2 billion as part of its bid to buy considerable stake in Flipkart.Can Stake in Flipkart be a Game Changer?Clearly, both Amazon and Walmart are vouching to strike a deal with the Bengaluru-based online retailer. If Walmart wins it, it will help the big-box retailer expand its international reach, after bolstering position in China, Mexico Canada and the UK. While Walmart already operates in India under 21 wholesale stores, its ability to establish its own brick-and-mortar stores gets restricted by the huge costs associated with setting up stores in a nation like India, alongside certain limitations on foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers.Thus, if this deal materializes, it is likely to strengthen Walmart’s position against Amazon, by helping it leverage the large market Flipkart caters to. On the flip side, investment from the world’s largest retailer will benefit Flipkart by helping it boost its grocery business. Flipkart, which sells almost everything ranging from cosmetics to electronics, has been concentrating on the food and grocery space. At such a juncture, investment from Walmart is likely to be a perfect choice, given its vast experience in the space.Notably, Walmart has explored every nook and cranny to combat the growing dominance of Amazon, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These endeavors have Walmart, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to rally 20.3% in a year, surpassing the industry’s 16% gain. In fact, Walmart is not the only retailer which is taking incessant strides to stay firm in the Amazon-dominated retail world. Retail behemoths like Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s among many others are also undertaking several efforts to stay firm in the race. (Read More: Walmart Heats Up War With Amazon: How Are Others Placed?)In fact, owing to this heated competition, price wars, aggressive promotions and waning store traffic have become major hurdles for companies in the Retail-Wholesale sector, that is currently ranked among the bottom 6% of all Zacks sectors. Nevertheless, retailers’ dedicated efforts to evolve with the changing trends and drive top line has helped the sector surge 24.6% in a year’s time, easily surpassing the S&P 500’s gain of 16%.

1047,KR,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Kroger has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.4. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Kroger’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Kroger has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.6, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Kroger stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Kroger has a P/S ratio of about 0.2. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, KR is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Kroger currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Kroger a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 5.2, which is better than the industry average of 9.8. Clearly, KR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Kroger might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F. This gives KR a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current fiscal quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen two upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:The Kroger Co. Price and Consensus  The Kroger Co. Price and Consensus | The Kroger Co. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineKroger is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among the bottom 32%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1048,KR,"The Michaels Companies Inc. (MIK  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 14. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this operator of arts and crafts specialty retail stores will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.The company delivered negative earnings surprise of 1.7% in the last reported quarter. However, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 4.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 38 cents, indicating flat earnings from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $1.15 billion, down 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.The Michaels Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Michaels Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Michaels Companies, Inc. QuoteNonetheless, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past month, reflecting positive sentiment on the stock ahead of first-quarter earnings. The company’s shares have increased 11.7% while stocks in the broader industry recorded growth of 8.8%.Factors at PlayMichaels Companies has a mixed surprise trend, with earnings beat in three of the last six quarters, while sales lagged estimates in four of the last six quarters. However, earnings and sales improved year over year in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, due to solid holiday period sales. Comparable store sales (comps) also improved, driven by higher average transaction value and increased foot traffic to Michaels' stores.Nonetheless, the results for fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 were followed by a modest view for fiscal 2018 and the fiscal first quarter. The company anticipates sales of $1,139-$1,150 million, with comps growth of flat to up 1%. Adjusted earnings per share are estimated to be 36-38 cents per share. The company expects fiscal 2018 to be a year to rebuild and remodel, positioning it for robust growth in 2019 and beyond. The company will continue to remodel stores to standard formats, link e-commerce with store networks by bringing in-house fulfillment of online orders and invest in enhanced data analysis to support retail operations.Following the progress made on these initiatives in fiscal 2017, the company expects to reinvest benefits from the tax reform into its business to drive sales and earnings growth. However, these efforts are likely to result in elevated operating expenses for fiscal 2018.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model conclusively shows that Michaels Companies is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Michaels Companies has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #3. This increases the predictive power of ESP, thus, making us confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Kroger Co.

Nonetheless, the company outpaced the consensus mark by a penny in the last reported quarter, resulting in a positive earnings surprise of 0.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has increased by a cent in the past seven days and is currently pegged at $1.25.Let’s analyze the factors influencing the company’s performance.Factors at PlayFoot Locker is trying to improve performance through operational and financial initiatives.

Further, it is exploring off-mall retail formats opportunities and executing shop-in-shop spaces in collaboration with vendors.Despite these endeavors, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenue to come in at $1,974 million, down marginally by 1.4% year over year. This follows an increase of 4.6% witnessed in the final quarter of fiscal 2017.Management had earlier guided that comparable-store sales (comps) during the first quarter are likely to decline in line with or more than actually registered in the second half of fiscal 2017.

Comps had declined 3.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Foot Locker had previously projected gross margin to decline in the range of 150-175 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on account of high promotional activity and deleverage of occupancy expenses. Gross margin had contracted 230, 290, 340 and 100 basis points in the fourth, third, second and first quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively.As a result, the bottom line is likely to decline in the quarter.

1050,KR,"Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24. In the trailing four quarters, this Goleta, CA-based footwear and apparel retailer has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 96.4%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 29.4%.Investors are counting on another beat by Deckers in the to-be-reported quarter. Let’s delve deeper and take a look at the factors that will be influencing the results.Here Are the Deciding FactorsDeckers is targeting profitable markets and remains focused on product innovations as well as store augmentation plan. Also, the company’s focus on expanding brand assortments, bringing more innovative line of products, targeting consumers through marketing and optimizing omni-channel distribution bode well. In keeping with the changing trends, Deckers has made substantial investments to strengthen online presence and opening smaller concept omni-channel outlets.Additionally, the company has undertaken strategic initiatives in an effort to drive long-term growth. Its store-fleet optimization plan focuses on striking the right balance between digital and physical stores. Deckers also expects cost savings of about $150 million backed by improvement in cost of goods sold and SG&A savings, which includes consolidation of retail outlets and process improvement efficiencies. This in turn should help it realize $100-million operating profit improvement by fiscal 2020.Management had earlier guided fourth quarter net sales in the range of $370-$375 million compared with $369.5 million reported in the year-ago period. The company had forecasted earnings in the range of approximately 15-20 cents compared with 11 cents a share delivered in the prior-year quarter.However, industry experts remain concerned about Deckers' over-reliance on the UGG brand. In the event of stagnation or decline of UGG sales growth, the company's overall results will be adversely affected. This is because the percentage of contribution from the company’s other brands are too minimal to offset any slowdown in UGG sales.Deckers Outdoor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Deckers Outdoor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Deckers Outdoor Corporation QuoteHow Are Top & Bottom Line Estimates Faring?After registering a bottom-line increase of 21% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Deckers is likely to record year-over-year growth of more than 60% in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 18 cents compared with 11 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks now project revenues of $377.3 million, up approximately 2% from the year-ago quarter.If all goes well, this will be the fifth straight quarter that the company will surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom lines.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Deckers is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review stands at $1.09, reflecting year-over-year growth of 49.3%. The consensus estimate is at the high end of the company’s guided range of $1.05-$1.09. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has risen by a penny in the last 30 days.Let’s delve deeper to determine the factors that are likely to have a bearing on the company’s first-quarter results.Burlington Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Burlington Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Burlington Stores, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlaySound Fundamentals Drive MarginsBurlington Stores has implemented multiple changes on its business model to resonate well with the changes in the industry. Impressively, the company’s current model is helping customers to get nationally branded, fashionable, high quality and fair priced products. Furthermore, it has increased vendor count, made technological advancements, initiated a better marketing approach and focused on localized assortments. Apart from this, in order to drive the top line, Burlington Stores has been concentrating on store expansion.These factors along with effective inventory management and cost containment have helped drive the gross margin, which has shown consistent improvement in the last few years. Additionally, gross margin expanded 80, 110, 100 and 20 basis points to 40.9%, 40.7%, 42.2% and 42%, respectively, in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.Top Line Gains on Sturdy CompsApart from having a robust earnings history, Burlington Stores has been doing well on the revenue front. Evidently, the company’s top line has outpaced the consensus mark in four of the trailing six quarters and has also shown constant improvement over the past few quarters. Management had earlier projected sales within 9.5% to 10.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. For the first quarter, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.50 billion, up from $1.35 billion a year ago.Additionally, amid a competitive retail backdrop, Burlington Stores’ comparable-store sales (comps) have improved consistently over the past few years. In fact, the momentum continued in fiscal 2017 as well, with the first, second, third and fourth quarters witnessing growth of 0.5%, 3.5%, 3.1% and 5.9%, respectively. For the first quarter, comps are expected to grow in the 2-3% range. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect comps growth of 3.3%.What the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model shows that Burlington Stores is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1052,KR,"Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on May 24. In the last reported quarter, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18%. Notably, it has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 19.1%. Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.How Are Top & Bottom-Line Estimates Faring?After registering a bottom-line increase of 18.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Best Buy is likely to record year-over-year growth of 25% in first-quarter fiscal 2019. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 75 cents compared with 60 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by a penny in the last 30 days. Analysts now project $8.77 billion revenues, up from $8.53 billion in the year-ago quarter.If the estimates are taken into consideration, this is going to be the second straight quarter of an earnings and revenue beat for the company.Best Buy Co., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Best Buy Co., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Best Buy Co., Inc. Quote Deciding FactorsRobust domestic and international sales are likely to drive the company’s results in the first quarter. Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect domestic revenues of $8,091 million, up 2.7% year over year while international revenues are also anticipated to increase nearly 3.6% to $638 million.Best Buy is making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel capabilities and strengthening partnership with vendors. In recent quarters, the company reported a massive gain in domestic comparable online sales on the back of conversion rates and higher average order values.Following the successful completion of “Renew Blue” program, the company launched a fresh strategy called “Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue” to explore and pursue growth opportunities, cost optimization and investing in people as well as systems to drive growth. In addition, management earlier projected first-quarter fiscal 2019 Enterprise revenues of $8.65-$8.75 billion and comparable sales increase of 1.5-2.5%. Management also anticipated adjusted earnings of 68-73 cents a share.In the fiscal first quarter, the company expects domestic comparable sales to rise 1.5-2.5% while international comparable sales are estimated flat to up 3%.However, analysts believe that an increase in investment to boost e-commerce operations and supply chains to counter competition might strain margins. Moreover, challenging retail landscape and waning store traffic may weigh on the company’s performance.We also note that SG&A expenses have increased 18.6%, 2.2% and 3.2% in the fourth, third and second quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively.Additionally, management hinted earlier that higher investments in supply chain and increased transportation costs are likely to weigh upon gross profit of the Domestic business by approximately 25 basis points in each quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Best Buy is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Best Buy has an Earnings ESP of +2.01%, which, when combined with the company’s Zacks Rank #2, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat.Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +23.37% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1053,KR,"Shares of Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) opened higher on Monday just a few trading days after the company reported solid first-quarter earnings results. With that said, Walmart’s stock price had sunk over the last few months, which means now might be a great time to consider buying the retail giant at a relatively cheap price.Walmart’s overall revenues climbed roughly 4.4% from the year-ago period to hit $122.7 billion in the first quarter, with comp sales up 2.1%. Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted earnings surged by 14% to reach $1.14 per share, which also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 per share.Investors should also have been pleased to see that Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales popped by 33%, despite increased competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers. Now, let’s take a look at Walmart’s price movement before we dive into why the company’s current valuation looks rather enticing.Recent Price MovementWalmart stock was up roughly 8% over the last year before Monday’s gains. However, shares of Walmart had sunk 9.8% during the last 12 weeks and 4.8% over the last four weeks as investors reacted negatively to the company’s slower fourth-quarter e-commerce growth.   Furthermore, shares of Walmart sat at their 52-week high of $109 per share in late January. Walmart stock opened Monday at $84.14 per share, which means shares of Walmart are much cheaper than they were to start the year just based on price alone.Still, investors need to know a little more before they can say that Walmart stock is currently offering a ton of value.ValuationComing into Monday, Walmart stock was trading at 16.9X forward 12-months earnings estimates. Walmart stock has traded as high as 23.8X over the past year, with its median resting at 17.9X. The company is also currently trading just slightly above its year-long low of 16.4X, which it rested at briefly in early July of last year.Walmart stock is also trading directly in line with the S&P 500’s average of 16.9X. Furthermore, the company compares favorably to the “Retail – Supermarkets” industry’s current average forward P/E ratio of 16.3. This industry includes the likes of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) other large U.S. grocery chains. Based on the last year alone, investors should be able to say with some conviction that Walmart stock is rather attractive at its current valuation, and pretty cheap compared to where it has traded recently.Growth OutlookLastly, it is worth considering Walmart’s current growth prospects. The company is projected to see its second-quarter earnings climb by 12.9% to touch $1.22 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the full-year, Walmart is expected to hit $4.86 per share, which would mark a nearly 10% surge from a year ago.Meanwhile, Walmart’s revenues are only projected to pop by 1.8% in Q2, while full-year revenues are projected to climb by 2.08% to reach $510.74 billion. Investors might be a bit less pleased to see these top-line projections, but it is worth considering just how hard it is to post massive top-line growth when the company is expected to pull in over $510 billion.Our 2% full-year growth estimate would mean Walmart expanded its top line by $10 billion.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1054,KR,"The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) has been trying all methods to overcome competition, which has intensified with the foray of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). The company’s latest initiative is the hiring drive for its family of stores in the supermarket division to better serve customers. The company will hire 11,000 employees, including 2000 for managerial roles. In the past two years, the company has created 22,000 new jobs.The hiring spree reflects on the company’s expansion strategy and its focus to adapt to the challenging retail scenario by improving customer satisfaction. Of late, the company has undertaken several initiatives to boost its top-line in the current scenario of volatility in food prices and tough promotional environment.The companyis expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons and ‘order online, pick up in store’ initiative. The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is gaining traction.As a part of this program, Kroger will invest an additional $500 million toward associate wages, training and development over the next three years. Moreover, Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Meanwhile, Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy, which enriches consumers’ shopping experience, is benefiting the company. We believe that such operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales, alleviate margin pressure and enhance return on invested capital. Management projects fiscal 2018 identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, in the range of 1.5-2%.Wrapping UpKroger, which shares space with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report)), is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and boost revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and drive the stock further.

1055,KR,"Walmart Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) latest contract with Postmates is likely to intensify the online grocery delivery competition among retailers — which was largely triggered by Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) takeover of Whole Foods Market last year. Ever since the e-commerce biggie’s intrusion into the grocery space, retailers, particularly Walmart, have been making constant attempts to stay firm in the game.From speedy deliveries to payment systems, from selling grocery to offering meal-kits online, both Walmart and Amazon have been in a constant contest against each other for quite some time now. Well, Walmart improved its flair in the race yesterday, when it inked a deal with Postmates to extend its online grocery delivery service, with an intent to cover more than 40% of the families in the United States.Walmart Playing New Card Every DayWalmart initiated the aforementioned online grocery delivery service in Charlotte, NC, and now intends to expand it further in the coming months. This service will enable Walmart to provide same day delivery to customers, who can place orders on the grocery section of the company’s website or use the Walmart Grocery app. Thereafter, any Postmates member will procure the order and carry out the delivery process seamlessly. With an order fee of about $9.95 on a minimum order of $30, this service appears to be much viable than others like Shipt which mandates a membership program.Without a doubt, the service will enhance customers’ experience, as they can now order products including fresh produce, bakery items, meat, seafood and pantry staples among others more conveniently. However, the move is not completely unexpected. Last month itself, this big box retailer announced plans to expand online grocery delivery services to more than 100 metros in the United Sates, in a drive to reach nearly 40% of the nation’s household this year. While Walmart has been resorting to partnerships and buyouts to offer grocery deliveries, the company has its own Online Grocery Pickup service which is also popular as “Grocery Hero” among customers. Walmart’s Pickup service enables customers to order online and pick up orders from stores – a service that can be currently availed across 1,200 Walmart stores with plans of spreading to 1,000 more stores this year.In fact, there were rounds a day ago about Walmart’s stride to expand pickup tower facilities to additional brick-and-mortar stores. The company plans to install giant pick-up kiosks in 500 additional stores by the end of 2018, which will lead to the availability of such services in 700 stores. The new towers will be equipped with extra features such as pickup lockers. Also, to ease payment, Walmart announced plans to launch “Walmart2World” money transfer service in collaboration with MoneyGram International (MGI  -  Free Report) earlier in the month.Talking of the past alliances and buyouts mentioned above, the company tested same day deliveries with Deliv, while it also partnered with ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Moreover, the company acquired delivery startup Parcel, Inc., which specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products.Amazon Incites Stiff CompetitionGranted, Walmart, which generates a chunk of revenues from food sales, has been taking perfervid initiatives in the delivery services realm to counter Amazon’s growing dominance. And it ought to, given the online king’s quest to dominate any sphere it touches. Though Amazon has its eyes on Walmart’s other areas of interests too (like expanding in the healthcare space) let’s maintain focus on online grocery.Incidentally, Amazon has been trying to exploit nook and cranny of the online grocery delivery space, easily evident from its recently initiated free two-hour delivery of Whole Foods products to Prime customers in Los Angeles. Apart from this, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company also lures customers with Amazon Lockers, which is a parcel delivery service, wherein customers can select locker locations as their delivery address and pick up orders.Well, Amazon could only do this by leveraging stores of Whole Foods, which was scooped up last year. Ever since, the dot.com giant has been dedicatedly integrating Whole Foods into its Prime operations and exploiting it strategically to attract customers and enrich their experience. Consequently, other players like Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have also been pulling up their socks to stay in the game.Target, for instance, is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities and expanding same-day delivery options. To this end, the company has undertaken rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases for a flat fee along with technology and process improvements. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company acquired Shipt to expand same-day delivery — an announcement that followed plans to initiate same-day delivery in New England, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Baltimore for more than 55,000 groceries, essentials, home, electronics, toys and other products. Apart from this, the company’s Target Restock program and Drive Up service deserve mention, when talking about its efforts to join the online delivery bandwagon.Moving to Kroger, the company’s the company’s “Restock Kroger” program is gaining traction. Also, the Cincinnati-based retailer’s agreement with Instacart for same day deliveries, and ClickList order online and pick up in store services tell the tale of its efforts to stay afloat in the online grocery space. Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3  company tried Uber’s services to facilitate deliveries — a card also played by Walmart.Can Walmart Stay Firm in the Game?That said, it looks like competition among these grocery retailers is far from subsiding. Owing to the mounting competition, price wars, aggressive promotions and falling store traffic have been some major concerns plaguing companies in the Retail-Wholesale sector, that is currently ranked among the bottom 31% of all Zacks sectors. Nevertheless, retailers’ relentless efforts to evolve with the changing trends and attract customers to drive top line has helped the sector surge 23.9% in a year’s time, comfortable outdoing the S&P 500’s rise of 15.5%.Though most grocery players are strongly focused on going a step ahead of the other, we remain hopeful about Walmart’s ability to withstand this competitive frenzy. This can be solely attributable to its steadfast focus on solidifying its game against Amazon, which is most evident from its recent emergence as an omni-channel retailer officially. In fact, these endeavors have also helped this Zacks Rank #3 stock rally 20.6% in a year, surpassing the industry’s 15.7% gain.

1056,KR,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is whether this operator of general merchandise stores will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.7%. However, it reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.4% in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, estimates have been stable ahead of the first-quarter earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $1.38 up from $1.21 reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16,432 million, up from $16,017 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Here Are the Deciding FactorsOmni-channel & Restock Program to Lift SalesTarget has chalked out strategies to adapt to the fast-changing retail landscape. The company is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities, coming up with new brands, remodeling or refurbishing stores, and expanding same-day delivery options. Target has undertaken rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases for a flat fee along with technology and process improvements.Retailers are ensuring a speedy delivery to customers. They are either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race. In this respect, Target acquired Shipt to expand same-day delivery of more than 55,000 groceries, essentials, home, electronics, toys and other products.The company has rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Drive Up, an app-based service, is another initiative to expedite the shopping process. The service allows customers to place orders using the Target app and have them delivered to their cars.All these strategic endeavors are likely to favorably impact the quarterly results. Management had earlier guided first-quarter fiscal 2018 comparable sales to be up low-single digit and projected earnings in the band of $1.25-$1.45.Will Margins Remain Under Pressure?Margin, an important financial metric that gives an indication about the company’s health, has been declining.

1058,KR,"“Shop anything, anytime and anywhere” is the new mantra U.S. supermarket chains are passionately following to provide consumers a seamless experience. The latest instance of the same is The Kroger Co.’s (KR  -  Free Report) deal with British online grocery delivery company Ocado that reinforces its position in the online ordering, automated fulfillment and home delivery space.Industry experts believe that the competition in the U.S. grocery market is going to intensify further in the digital space and supermarket chains will have to constantly revisit their strategy in order to endure the same. This means either you “shape up or ship out”. Kroger has taken the stock of the situation, as it agreed to increase its stake in Ocado by 5% that will help it to create a niche in the burgeoning online grocery space.SynopsisThe grocery industry has been grappling with stiff competition, volatility in food prices, aggressive promotional environment and thin margins. The industry witnessed a major shake-up when the news of Whole Foods takeover by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surfaced. This amalgamation of online marketplace with physical stores caused a tectonic shift in the grocery landscape.Amazon can now leverage Whole Foods’ fresh foods procurements expertise with its own data mining techniques. Experts see this acquisition as a major step by Amazon to thwart any threat coming from Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), which holds a dominant position in the $700-$800 billion U.S. food market and has been gradually building up its e-commerce strength.Walmart has been proactive in expanding in the fast-growing online grocery space. The company extended alliance with last mile logistics entity, Deliv, to support same-day delivery for groceries. Walmart also acquired delivery start-up company, Parcel Inc. to extend same-day deliveries. The company also partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Latest to add in the list of same is Postmates.Target (TGT  -  Free Report) has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by recently acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service, Shipt. Previously, the company had acquired Grand Junction in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities.Kroger Upping the AnteKroger’s partnership with Ocado is in the right direction to overcome competition, which has intensified with the foray of Amazon. Both the companies are likely to develop three automated warehouse facilities this year and plans to take the count to 20 in the first three years.The alliance under discussion is a part of the company’s “Restock Kroger” program, which is gaining traction. Kroger commenced “We Are Local” campaign; launched and opened a new restaurant concept, Kitchen 1883; and added two new product lines under “Our Brands”. As a part of the program management offloaded convenience stores to focus on its core operations and expects to generate $400 million in incremental operating margin by 2020.Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations in Southern California. Kroger remains optimistic about the buyouts of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products and Harris Teeter, a grocery chain. The company also expanded ClickList to more than 1,000 locations.Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy that enriches the consumers shopping experience and convinces them of returning to the store is also benefiting the company. We believe that its operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales, alleviate gross margin pressure, improve operating margin and enhance return on invested capital.Certainly, Kroger is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. Kroger remains well on track to boost market share by expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and drive the stock further.In the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have increased 9% comfortably outperforming the industry that declined 11%.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise L Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | L Brands, Inc. Quote Shrinking gross margin also remains a concern. The company had earlier forecast gross margin to contract in the first quarter. Gross margin, an important financial metric, has shown constant deceleration in the past few quarters. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, adjusted gross margin contracted 320, 120, 190 and 100 basis points to 37.1%, 37.3%, 37.8% and 42.3%, respectivelyNevertheless, L Brands’ efforts to streamline Victoria’s Secret business, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business bode well. First-quarter fiscal 2018 net sales jumped 8% year over year to $2.63 billion, while comps improved 3% — reflecting an increase of 1% and 8% at Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works brands, respectively. Comps for the four-week ended May 5 were flat following an advancement of 4% in March and 3% in February.Furthermore, total Victoria’s Secret revenues increased 3.7% and Bath & Body Works brands revenues rose 12.2% on a year-over-year basis.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that L Brands is not likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

1060,KR,"Bargain hunters continue with their shopping spree, as U.S. retail sales tick up again in the month of April, after rebounding sharply in March. Although the rate of sales growth moderated from the prior month, it still clearly indicates that the economy remains well on track after a muted start to the year. Evidently, consumers are splurging on clothing, grocery and furniture.In spite of recent hiccups in the stock market, Americans look much more confident now buoyed by strengthening labor market, tax reform and rising incomes. Certainly, consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy — is likely to remain strong in the months ahead, unless arrested by a spike in gasoline prices that might lower their propensity to consume.Retail Sales Continue to Pop UpThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in April advanced 0.3% to $497.6 billion, following an upwardly revised reading of 0.8% gain in March. Analysts pointed that retail sales remained soft in the months of February and January, as consumers cut back on their spending due to delay in tax refunds. As a result, consumer spending increased 1.1% in the first quarter, marking the lowest growth rate in a span of roughly five years.Notably, retail sales improved 4.7% from April 2017. The report suggests that sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers inched up 0.1%, while sales at furniture & home furnishing stores rose 0.8%. Meanwhile, sales at both food & beverage stores and building material dealers grew 0.4%. Receipts at gasoline stations rose 0.8%, while sales at clothing & clothing accessories stores improved 1.4%. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 0.6% and surged 9.6% from the prior-year period.However, sales at sporting goods, hobby, book & music stores dipped 0.1%, while at food services & drinking places the same fell 0.3%. Sales at electronics & appliance stores edged down 0.1%.Retail Stocks to Continue MomentumPick up in retail sales is welcome news for retailers, whose fortunes depend upon consumers’ willingness to spend. A robust job market with unemployment rate at 3.9%, massive tax cuts and sound economic fundamentals are likely to boost consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending. Certainly, favorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector.For obvious reasons, retailers are the end gainers. With digital transformation in shopping, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. Moreover, National Retail Federation’s projection of an uptick in U.S. retail sales of 3.8-4.4% this year raises optimism. Additionally, the recent cut in corporate tax rate will allow retailers to channelize the surplus money toward best possible alternatives.Notably, the Retail-Wholesale sector has advanced roughly 10% in the past six months and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of approximately 5%. The sector’s progress card this reporting cycle also looks quite impressive.Markedly, total earnings of the S&P 500 retailers that have already reported results increased 24.8% on the back of 13.6% jump in revenues, per the latest Earnings Outlook. Well, about half of the retailers in the S&P 500 index released their quarterly outcomes, with 70% topping bottom-line estimates and 60% delivering positive revenue surprise.Wrapping UpWith several retail behemoths queued up to report their quarterly numbers, the sector is likely to remain in the limelight. So, picking up stocks that are likely to trump estimates will be a prudent move. This is because a stock generally picks up steam on an earnings beat.These are stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

In the previous quarter, the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Also, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters.An Insight in to Current EstimatesIn order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company’s earnings release, let’s take a look at the earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter bottom line, which has been stable over the past 60 days, is pegged at a loss of 22 cents, comparing unfavorably with the year-ago earnings of 6 cents. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.60 billion, reflecting a decline of 3.8% year over year.J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Quote Despite several measures, we expect the retail landscape to remain tough for J. C. Penney. Also, the company’s store closures are likely to weigh on its performance. Due to change in consumer spending patterns, retailers are making investments on digitalization that might keep margins under pressure in the short term.We note that for first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company had earlier highlighted that the cost of goods sold is likely to increase by 40 to 60 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter. Accordingly, the gross margin is likely to decline in the first quarter from the year-ago-quarter.Are Strategies Potent Enough to Fight Headwinds?J. C. Penney has taken up several strategic initiatives to drive traffic. The company, in order to enhance customer shopping experience, has been focusing on remodeling, renovating and refurbishing its stores with special focus on improving high-margin center core department that houses handbags, fashion accessories, sunglasses and fashion jewelry. The company stated that it is planning to rebrand and modernize 100 salons to Salon by InStyle.J. C. Penney continues to work on improving its omni-channel reach. As online shopping traffic is higher than average, improving their shopping experience is the key to build a strong online portal.To drive traffic online, the company is providing convenient shipping and pickup options like pick up in store same day facility, ship to any J. C. Penney store and faster home delivery. The company has invested substantially to boost supply chain efficiency.Meanwhile, the company’s Sephora stores, which have done exceptionally well in the past and are regarded as one of the best performing categories, are likely to maintain the uptrend in the first quarter. In fact, these shops are part of J. C. Penney’s strategy to gain a competitive edge over other beauty product retailers and drugstores that have significantly enhanced their cosmetics businesses in the recent years.Given the aforementioned strategic initiatives, management expects comp sales in the first quarter to be at the high end of the annual guidance which is in the range of flat to up 2%.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that J. C. Penney is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

In the last reported quarter, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%. However, we note that in the trailing four quarters, this Issaquah, WA-based company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.1%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping for a positive earnings surprise from Costco in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.68, reflecting a year-over-year increase of roughly 20%. We observe that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by a penny in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $31.74 billion, up approximately 10% from the year-ago quarter.Which Factors Hold Key to Costco’s Performance?We believe that the company’s growth strategies, sturdy comparable-store sales (comps) performance, strong membership trends and higher penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program are the pillars that reinforce its position. While major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping, the company seems somewhat resilient to the challenging retail backdrop.Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. In fact, the company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track. The company remains committed toward opening new clubs in domestic and international markets.Additionally, a differentiated product range enables Costco to provide an upscale shopping experience for its members, consequently resulting in market share gains and higher sales per square foot. It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. Consequently, comparable e-commerce sales surged 43.1% in April, 33.2% in March and 38.1% in February.Costco continued with positive comps performance driven by improved store traffic and average transaction size. Comps for April increased 10.9%, following an advance of 8.6% in March and 10.5% in February.

1063,KR,"The earnings season, which is nearing its end, has been quite impressive this time around. However, the show is not over yet. With several retail behemoths including Walmart, Macy’s and Target, queued up to report their quarterly numbers, investors are likely to keep their eyes on the Retail-Wholesale sector's progress card.We note that the sector has gained 4.7% in a month, outdoing the S&P 500’s 2.1% growth. This can be attributable to a number of micro and macro factors, which have been viewed as positive signals for retailers’ upcoming results.Retail on Growth Trajectory: Here’s WhyThe recent uptick in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, bodes well. Incidentally, consumer spending inched up 0.4% in March, following 0.2% growth in January while remaining flat in February. This renewed momentum in March emerged from continued rise in income, indicating that consumers may drive economic growth in 2018. In fact, March retail sales advanced 0.6%, bearing testimony to this.  Apart from this, the sector is poised to gain from massive tax cuts and a robust labor market. Notably, the unemployment level that remained stable at 4.1% for six months till March, declined even further to 3.9% in April.Turning to micro factors, companies in this space are also expected to gain from aggressive omni-channel efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer shopping patterns. To this end, retail players’ solid e-commerce endeavors, compelling pricing strategy, promotional activities, and efforts to strengthen portfolio and enhancing stores experience remain major drivers.Surely, these strategic investments are eating a portion of margins but retailers are playing smart by undertaking stringent cost-cutting and restructuring activities.Notably, total earnings of the S&P 500 retailers that have already reported results increased 26.1%, on the back of 14.9% jump in revenues, per the latest Earnings Preview. Well, about half of the retailers in the S&P 500 index released their quarterly outcomes, with 68.4% topping bottom-line estimates and 63.2% delivering positive revenue surprise.Given the favorable backdrop, the sector is likely to catch investors’ attention. So, picking stocks that are likely to trump estimates can fetch handsome returns. This is because a stock generally picks up steam on earnings beat.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonThat said, let’s take a look at some gems in this space that look promising on the earnings front. These stocks carry a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.  Well, our research shows that chances of a positive earnings surprise of stocks with this combination is as high as 70%.

1070,KR,"SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) released fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with the top and bottom line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, sales improved year on year, buoyed by the sturdy advancement of the company’s wholesale business.However, the retail segment continued to be dismal in the fourth quarter. In fact, this has been weighing on investors’ sentiment for a while. Evidently, shares of this grocery dealer have tumbled 49.7% in the past year, compared with the industry’s decline of 17.2%.Well, the company has been trying to rationalize its retail operations by exiting certain banners. In this regard, alongside fourth-quarter results, management unveiled plans to sell its Shop ‘n Save and Shop ‘n Save East retail businesses.

The top line gained approximately $840 million from Unified Grocers (acquired in June 2017), whereas AG Florida contributed $130 million. While contributions from these businesses drove results in the wholesale unit, the company’s retail and corporate segment continued to struggle.SUPERVALU INC.

QuoteGross profit amounted to $356 million that depicted a 5.3% upside from the prior-year quarter.

Further, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations amounted to $117 million.Segment DetailsWholesale: Net sales at Wholesale business surged 60% year over year to $2,872 million, mainly driven by the sales contributions from Unified Grocers and AG Florida, sales to new customers and greater sales to new stores run by existing customers. These were partially offset by reduced military sales and stores that no longer receive supplies from SUPERVALU.The segment’s adjusted operating income totaled $67 million, up from $60 million in the year-ago quarter. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 110 bps to 2.3% due to lower margins from Unified Grocers.Retail: Net sales in Retail dropped 0.6% to $690 million, on account of store closures — partially offset by a 0.1% gain in identical store sales.

1071,KR,"When it comes to ramping up pick-up services, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) leaves no stone unturned to travel that extra mile. This is evident from the company’s recent stride to expand pickup tower facilities to additional brick-and-mortar stores. The company plans to install giant pick-up kiosks in 500 additional stores by the end of 2018, which will lead to the availability of such services in 700 stores. The new towers will be equipped with extra features such as pickup lockers.With Walmart’s pickup towers, consumers can collect their online orders from stores in less than a minute. This will allow them to save cost of shipping and time. Management states that consumers’ response toward pickup towers was quite overwhelming since its introduction in 2016, which led the company to expand such facilities to more stores. Moreover, adhering to popular demand, this recent expansion will include the added feature of pickup lockers, where consumers can collect bigger-sized merchandise as well.Well, such efforts offer better competing grounds for Walmart against online behemoth Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has been expanding rapidly in the online delivery space. Since Walmart has a strong brick-and-mortar presence, its pickup towers are likely to strengthen its position in the Amazon-dominated retail space. Further, Walmart plans to install pickup towers equipped with refrigeration systems for delivering grocery and perishable items. Like Walmart, companies such as Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), have also been undertaking several initiatives to improve delivery services. This indicates that companies are rapidly transforming their operating models to suit the needs of consumers’ tech-driven lifestyle.In addition to providing seamless deliveries to consumers, cost savings are also a vital incentive, driving Walmart to strengthen pickup in-store services. Well, the company incurs lower charges when it ships items to its stores compared with transporting them to consumers’ residences. Such savings enable the company to provide additional discounts to consumers. Walmart’s zealous initiatives in the delivery services realm has been quite a treat for consumers seeking fast and easy shopping facilities. Earlier efforts in this respect include acquisition of Parcel, Inc., which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Other than this, the company’s Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. In earlier developments, Walmart partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Moreover, Walmart’s online ordering process are backed by efficient payment systems like Walmart2World.Indeed, such laudable efforts have placed this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in investors’ good books.

1072,KR,"If rumors are to be believed, SUPERVALU INC (SVU  -  Free Report) is exploring possible options to divest its business. However, management has not issued any official statement on this matter. Per sources, SUPERVALU is working with renowned investment bankers, Lazard Ltd (LAZ  -  Free Report) and Barclays Plc, to analyze a divesture. It is believed that pressures from activist investors led the company to consider such a strategic move.While this latest buzz keeps the future of this supermarket chain under veils, investors look quite excited. Evidently, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company gained almost 9.3% on April 6. This is considered a respite for investors, who have been worried for long about SUPERVALU’s sluggish retail segment. Thanks to such concerns, the stock has lost 1.1% in the past three months, though it fared better than the industry’s decline of 10.3%.Well, if such rumors can drive positive sentiments among investors, it is to be seen how the stock will eventually react if the plans are put into action. On that note, let’s now take a closer look at how this decision might impact the company, if held true.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Relief From Ailing Retail UnitThe company’s supposed plans to divest its business is likely to provide the much-needed turnaround in the sluggish retail segment. SUPERVALU’s retail stores have been bearing the brunt of brick-and-mortar sale disruption, accountable to consumers’ ever-growing enthusiasm for digital transactions, largely fueled by the online giant, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).Due to such headwinds, SUPERVALU has been resorting to store closures. Consequently, the company’s identical store sales in the retail segment have declined over the past 11 quarters. During fiscal 2016, the company sold nearly 1,350 Save-A-Lot stores. In other recent developments, the company announced plans to sell 21 of its Farm Fresh Food & Pharmacy stores. In this regard, the company has entered into definite agreements with companies like Harris Teeter, Food Lion and the Mid-Atlantic Division of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report). SUPERVALU is expected to undertake more Farm Fresh store closures in the near future.Will Divesture Add Further Boost to Wholesale?While SUPERVALU has been shuttering its retail stores, it has also been undertaking endeavors to fortify foothold in the wholesale arena, primarily through acquisitions. In this regard, the company concluded the buyout of Associated Grocers of Florida in the beginning of the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, while it bought Unified Grocers in June 2017. Notably, Unified Grocers contributed sales worth about $860 million to SUPERVALU’s Wholesale business during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and the company is on track to generate targeted synergies from this buyout.Apart from this, the company has supply agreements with retailers like America’s Food Basket, which is expected to fuel sales growth in the segment. Also, management is committed toward enhancing operating efficiency, reducing costs as well as optimizing distribution channels, information technology and logistics to support the growth of the wholesale business. That said, let’s wait and see in which direction the company moves in the forthcoming periods and whether the aforementioned rounds will continue boosting investors optimism on the stock.  Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other. He believes in its short-term profit potential and also in its prospects to more than double by 2019. Today he reveals and explains his surprising move in a new Special Report.Download it free >>

1073,KR,"Industry experts are of the opinion that competition in the U.S. grocery industry is going to intensify and supermarket chains will have to constantly revisit their strategy in order to withstand the same. This means, either you “shape up or ship out."" It seems that The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) has taken stock of the situation and is on its way to give itself a complete makeover. This Cincinnati-based company recently entered into an agreement to sell its convenience stores to focus on its core operations.Per the deal valued $2.15 billion, Kroger will sell more than 700 stores —  operating under the banners of Turkey Hill, Loaf 'N Jug, Kwik Shop, Tom Thumb and Quik Stop — to EG Group, a Blackburn, England-based operator of convenience stores in Europe. Since last October, Kroger has been looking for strategic alternatives for its convenience store operations, including a potential sale.No wonder, Kroger plans to utilize net sale proceeds to buy back shares and lower the debt load. However, management highlighted that supermarket fuel centers and Turkey Hill Dairy are not part of the deal. The transaction is expected to be concluded during the first quarter of Kroger's fiscal year.The decision looks inevitable in a scenario, where the grocery industry has been grappling with stiff competition, volatility in food prices, aggressive promotional environment and declining store count. The industry witnessed a major shake-up when the news of Whole Foods' takeover by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surfaced.Kroger, which shares space with Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. The company is expanding store base, and introducing new items, digital coupons and the order online, pick up in store initiative.The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is also gaining traction. Kroger commenced the “We Are Local” campaign; launched and opened a new restaurant concept, Kitchen 1883; and added two new product-lines under “Our Brands” — an apparel brand and a floral line, BLOOM HAUS. The sale of the convenience store business is part of this program only. Kroger is also looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations this year.We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster Kroger’s performance and drive the stock. In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have surged 33.6%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18.3%.

1074,KR,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) hogs the limelight again. The company seems to have set fire to the world of online retail, with its rigorous steps to counter Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance.  Well, rounds were made yesterday that the world’s largest retailer is in advanced talks to buy a considerable minority stake in India’s leading e-commerce destination, Flipkart — Amazon’s biggest rival in India.Incidentally, sources revealed that Wal-Mart could acquire about 15-20% stake in Flipkart, targeting an investment of about $750 million-$1 billion. While both Wal-Mart and Flipkart didn’t confirm the news, we believe that the news itself is an alarm for Amazon, which has long been trying to match up to Flipkart’s market share in India.Can Stake in Flipkart be a Game Changer?While Wal-Mart already operates in India under 21 wholesale stores, its ability to establish its own brick-and-mortar stores gets restricted by the huge costs associated with setting up stores in a nation like India, alongside certain limitations on foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers. Thus, if this deal materializes, it is likely to strengthen Wal-Mart’s position against Amazon, by helping it leverage the large market Flipkart caters to.On the flip side, investment from Wal-Mart will benefit Bengaluru-based Flipkart by helping it boost its grocery business. Flipkart, which sells almost everything ranging from cosmetics to electronics, has been concentrating on the food and grocery space — another venture already exploited by Amazon. At such a juncture, investment from Wal-Mart is likely to be a perfect choice, given its growing experience in the space.That said, it looks like Wal-Mart and Flipkart are joining forces against the e-commerce king Amazon.As for Wal-Mart, this retail biggie has explored every nook and cranny to combat Amazon’s growing dominance. In fact, it hasn’t even been a week since this big-box retailer announced plans to foray the e-book market and expand its online grocery services to Japan, though a strategic partnership with Japanese e-commerce firm, Rakuten Inc.Prior to this, rounds were made in December 2017  that this supermarket giant started selling meal-kits online — a card already played by Amazon previously. Further, the big-box retailer has taken several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. Out of all its e-commerce initiatives to stand strong against Amazon, Wal-Mart’s speedy expansion in the booming online grocery space steals the show.These splendid endeavors have helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company put up a robust past record, driving its shares 62.7% in a year, faring even better than the industry’s rise of 51.7%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. In fact, Wal-Mart is not the only retail which is taking incessant strides to stay firm in the Amazon-dominated retail world. Retail behemoths like Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s among many others are also undertaking several efforts to make the most of the evolving shopping trends. Coming back to Wal-Mart, investment in Flipkart will likely be one of its most tactful moves to take on Amazon and aptly justify its plan of emerging from Wal-Mart Stores to Walmart.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1075,KR,"Consumer analytics firm Nielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) just released its second-ever online food shopping study, which found that the industry Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and meal-kit delivery companies such as Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report) helped popularize is set to grow into a $100 billion market soon.On Monday, Nielsen, in partnership with the Food Marketing Institute, released its “Digitally Engaged Food Shopper” study. The joint venture found that within as few as five to seven years, 70% of all U.S. consumers are expected to buy at least a portion of their groceries online.Previously, Nielsen and FMI projected it would take the U.S. online grocery business until 2025 to reach the $100 billion milestone. “The grocery industry is currently in the age of digital experimentation, where the roadmap on how to navigate and achieve real and profitable growth continues to evolve,” Nielsen executive Chris Morley said in a statement.The Digitally Engaged Food Shopper study found that the online grocery industry is set to expand rapidly, but investors should know that it is already widely popular in the U.S. CNBC noted that 49% of all U.S. shoppers bought a packaged good online within the last three months.Looking at the generational breakdown, 61% of Millennials purchased at least some type of grocery item online, while 44% of Baby Boomers also joined the new online shopping trend.This growth hardly comes as a shock to many investors and certainly won’t surprise many retailers. In fact, over the last year, big-box giants Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have attempted to bolster their online grocery businesses in order to better compete with Amazon.Looking ahead, grocery companies such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) will likely invest more money in online ordering technologies and infrastructure.On top of investments from industry giants, grocery delivery startups such as Instacart have become popular in cities around the country. Now, as Instacart partners with everyone from Petco to CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), investors might see more shake-ups and mergers akin to Amazon’s Whole Foods purchase sooner than later.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1076,KR,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), which will be known as Walmart in less than a week’s time, has been exploring all avenues for growth. The world’s largest retailer, which has a robust foothold in the domestic market, has also been gaining traction internationally — particularly in Mexico and China.Meanwhile, sources revealed that the company is struggling with some of its Brazilian operations. Incidentally, there were rounds that Walmart is planning to divest part of its operations in the country, and is on the lookout for buyers. Though the news has not been confirmed by Wal-Mart, we believe that the step will likely improve the company’s business, by helping it focus on more profitable areas.Talking of profitable areas, let’s delve deeper into Wal-Mart’s other international operations, which are likely to help Wal-Mart keep its growth cycle running.International Strength to Spur GrowthWith operations spread in China, Mexico, Canada and UK, international forms Wal-Mart’s second-largest segment, in terms of revenues. Evidently, international sales constituted about 24% of the company’s total sales in fiscal 2017, following the U.S. segment which accounted for 64%. In the international segment, the big-box retailer has been recording year-over-year currency-neutral sales for more than a year now. Evidently, sales grew 2.5% on a currency-neutral basis each, in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2018 while it was up 0.8% and 3% in first-quarter fiscal 2018 and fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, respectively.In the third quarter, Wal-Mart’s international sales gained from 10 out of 11 markets recording positive comparable store sales (comps). Notably, Mexico and China performed exceptionally well, while results in UK also improved in the quarter. Wal-Mart de Mexico, or Walmex has been leading the company’s international growth for quite some time now. In the third quarter, Walmex sales jumped 9.2%, driven by strength across both stores and online. The company has been enriching consumers’ experience in the region through strategies like online grocery, while it also launched an e-commerce marketplace there recently that fueled merchandise assortment by 20%.Moving to China, sales advanced 4% in the third quarter, backed by improvements across core categories like fresh and consumables. Notably, e-commerce sales in China have been growing at an impressive rate. Consequently, the company’s constant e-commerce initiatives, particularly its alliance with JD.com has been driving its performance in China. Incidentally, during the third quarter, Wal-Mart increased its stores count (that provide speedy grocery deliveries via JD Daojia) to 140.Further, results in Canada were aided by efficient price investments, which led to market-share gains of major categories. Also, the company’s solid online initiatives like enhancing assortments, launch of e-commerce marketplace and expansion of outlets that provide online grocery pickup fueled the 1.9% rise in Canadian sales in the quarter. Wal-Mart’s UK sales also grew 3.6% on the back of efforts to enhance in-store experience and pricing.The departmental biggie remains committed toward achieving growth across all its markets, on the back of fresh products; expansion of online grocery and private brands. That said, we remain encouraged about Wal-Mart’s International segment performance.Other Growth InitiativesApart from focusing on the international segment, Wal-Mart is undertaking several other strategies to fuel overall growth — with e-commerce topping the list. This retail bellwether is trying every means to evolve with the changing consumer environment and fight e-commerce king Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance. Apart from Wal-Mart, many other major retailers like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) among others are adopting the online mantra to keep pace with the evolving trends. Coming back to Wal-Mart, the company has been taking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems.Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company’s Walmart Pay mobile payment system, and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business and making shopping easier and faster. Apart from this, Walmart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which was a major contributor to its e-commerce sales in the third quarter.While strained gross margin and competition remain hurdles, the aforementioned factors rekindle optimism about Wal-Mart’s strong chances of keeping its spectacular momentum alive.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

1077,KR,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is KR due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Kroger Meets Q4 Earnings, Beats Sales, Guides FY18After delivering positive earnings surprise in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, The Kroger Co. reported in line earnings in the fourth quarter. The grocery retailer posted adjusted earnings of 63 cents a share that came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 18.9% from the prior-year quarter.Adjusted earnings for fiscal 2017 came in at $2.04 per share, down 3.8% from the year-ago period. Management now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings in the band of $1.95-$2.15 per share.Total sales grew 12.4% to $31,031 million from the prior-year quarter and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30,830 million, marking the sixth straight quarter of revenue beat. Excluding fuel center sales and the 53rd week, total sales rose 2.7%. Total sales rose 6.4% to $122.7 billion during the fiscal year, wherein digital sales surged more than 90%. The company expanded ClickList to more than 1,000 locations.Kroger has been trying all means to overcome stiff competition from bellwethers such as Walmart and Amazon. The company remains well on track to boost market share by expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is gaining traction. The company hinted that the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” would allow it to channelize the surplus money to best possible options such as lowering of prices and improving customer services.Kroger also entered into an agreement to sell its convenience stores to focus on its core operations. Per the deal valued $2.15 billion, Kroger will sell more than 700 stores —  operating under the banners of Turkey Hill, Loaf 'N Jug, Kwik Shop, Tom Thumb and Quik Stop — to EG Group, a Blackburn, England-based operator of convenience stores in Europe. No wonder, Kroger plans to utilize net sale proceeds to buy back shares and lower the debt load.The company’s identical supermarket sales (stores that are open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters), excluding fuel center sales, grew 1.5% to $24,681 million, whereas including fuel center sales, identical supermarket sales jumped 2.7% to $27,833 million. Kroger now projects fiscal 2018 identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, to be in the range of 1.5.Gross margin contracted 31 basis points in the fourth quarter, while only 19 basis points for the fiscal year.Other Financial AspectsKroger ended the quarter with cash of $339 million, total debt of $15,589 million, and shareholders’ equity of $6,905 million. Total debt increased $1,512 million from the prior-year period. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio jumped to 2.65 compared with 2.31 in the year-ago period. In the trailing four quarters, the company bought back $1.6 billion of shares and paid $444 million in dividends. The company had approximately $270 million remaining under its share buyback program.Management projects capital expenditures — excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities — to be approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2018. Capital investments totaled $3 billion for fiscal 2017.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.The Kroger Co. Price and Consensus  The Kroger Co. Price and Consensus | The Kroger Co.

1078,KR,"Investors in The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 20, 2018 $12 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for The Kroger shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, The Kroger is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Supermarkets industry that ranks in the Top 25% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 62 cents per share to 63 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about The Kroger right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1079,KR,"The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 8. In the trailing four quarters, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of roughly 2.3%. In the preceding quarter, the company delivered positive earnings surprise of 10%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping for a positive earnings surprise from Kroger in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 63 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of roughly 19%. We observe that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by a penny in the past seven days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $30,830 million, up approximately 12% from the year-ago quarter.If Kroger posts better-than-expected results, this will be the company’s sixth straight quarter of revenue beat and second successive quarter of positive earnings surprise. Moreover, going by aforementioned estimates it is quite evident that the rate of growth of top and bottom lines is likely to accelerate from 4.5% and 7.3%, respectively, registered in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.Which Factors Hold Key to Kroger’s Performance?The grocery industry has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. Kroger has taken the stock of the situation and is in the process of giving itself a complete makeover. The company is expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is also gaining traction. These endeavors are likely to fuel top-line growth. The company in collaboration with Chase Pay is offering mobile payments in select markets.Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations. The company also remains optimistic about the acquisitions of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products; Harris Teeter, a grocery chain, and the merger of Modern HC Holdings with Axium Pharmacy Holdings Inc., a specialty pharmacy. Kroger also acquired Roundy's, the grocery store operator.Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy that enriches the consumers shopping experience and convinces them of returning to the store is also benefiting the company. We believe that the company's operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales, alleviate gross margin pressure, improve operating margin and enhance return on invested capital. The company envisions fourth-quarter identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, to surpass 1.1%.Kroger Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kroger Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kroger Company (The) QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively shows that Kroger is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

1080,KR,"Retail is no more constrained to the four walls of its brick-&-mortar existence. Instead it is rapidly accepting the concepts of an increasingly digitized world as advancing technology and digital transformation are playing key roles in evolving consumer shopping patterns. Consumers now prefer to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than hopping from one store to another.Indeed, technology is reshaping retailers’ today and tomorrow. Retailers are fast embracing the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether in stores or online or through smartphones via apps. They are allocating capital toward developing a multi-channel growth strategy, IT infrastructure, fulfillment centers and enterprise-wide inventory management system.But will technology alone help retailers survive Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance in the ultra-competitive environment or will they combine forces to bolster their position.Is Consolidation the Path?Be it department stores, discount retailers, supermarket chains or grocery players, all are in the race of survival of the fittest. So is consolidation the next path retailers may prefer to tread to thwart Amazon’s omnipresence? Market pundits believe that with a whopping market cap of more than $700 billion, technological prowess and outstanding consumer reach Amazon looks invincible in the near term. But left with no choice retailers may prefer to walk the tightrope hand in hand.Last Friday (Mar 23), market was abuzz with news of possible merger talks between Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report). Per Fast Company report, both the companies are discussing a probable partnership and are taking forward the talks initiated last summer. Shares of both these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies went up during Friday’s pre-marketing trading session. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, there was no official comment from both the parties on the subject. Instead, later a CNBC report surfaced that denied any merger discussion but suggested Kroger may be in talks to partner with Target’s online grocery platform, Shipt. Nevertheless, analysts believe that if they choose to combine, Kroger could benefit from Target's e-commerce capabilities and merchandise assortments, while the latter could further strengthen its grocery business.Target and Kroger generated $71.9 billion and $122.7 billion in sales, respectively, during fiscal 2017.Notably, Target is leaving no stone unturned to gain a prominent position in the dynamic retail landscape. The company’s recent app-based service, Drive Up, allows customers to place orders using the Target app and have them delivered to the comfort of their cars. Further, its Target Restock program is also gaining traction.Meanwhile, Kroger is strengthening its relationship with customers via both digital and mobile channels. The company is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations. Kroger remains optimistic about the acquisitions of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products.Wrapping UpFor sure, Amazon is aggressively making headway into retail space be it grocery, books, clothes and accessories or electronics, you name it and you have it. With its compelling pricing strategy and the buyout of Whole Foods — that shook the entire grocery industry of roughly $800 billion where Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) holds a prominent position — the e-commerce juggernaut has caused a tectonic shift in the retail landscape.Analysts viewed this $13.7 billion mammoth acquisition as an amalgamation between online marketplace and physical stores that could bring a massive change in the retail industry. Industry experts believe that rather than perishing, retailers with more or less same business line would prefer joining hands.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1081,KR,"Of late, grocery chains have been going through a rough patch. Analysts believe that the industry-wide weakness is hurting the margins of supermarket chains. Stiff competition, food price deflation, an aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic are the primary headwinds plaguing these providers of daily need items. This is quite evident from the industry’s decline of 0.4% in the past three months. In the same time frame, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector has gained 3.9%.Let’s take a closer look as to how Whole Foods Market, Inc. , which recently accepted the buyout offer of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), is expected to contribute to the sector’s performance. Whole Foodsis slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 26. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable in the last 30 days, and is currently pegged at 34 cents down from 37 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,721 million compared with $3,703 million in the prior-year period. Well the obvious question that comes to mind, will Whole Foods be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Whole Foods Market, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Whole Foods Market, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whole Foods Market, Inc. QuoteStrategic Initiatives Raise Optimism Whole Foods has been revamping pricing strategy and concentrating on value offerings in view of heightened competition as more companies are entering and expanding their presence in the Organic & Natural food business. These players include The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report).We note that this Austin, TX-based company is leaving no stone unturned to reach its target customers, whether through national marketing and branding campaigns, home delivery services, store expansion or the adoption of a digital route such as the launch of digital coupon within its Whole Foods Market mobile app. Moreover, it introduced a new “uniquely-branded store concept”, ""365 by Whole Foods Market"". The new chain is equipped with innovative technology, compelling products at value prices and a modern look to target millennials as well as stave off competition.Further, we believe that the deal with Amazon would provide Whole Foods a competitive edge. At one end it will allow the company to reach a wider customer base that prefer shopping online, while on the other end it will help lower procurement costs, given Amazon’s huge bargaining power. Not to forget, Amazon’s technological prowess could be of significant advantage to Whole Foods against its peers – who are aggressively expanding their online presence – and could help lower operating costs.ConcernsWhole Foods has been grappling with waning comparable-store sales performance since the last seven quarters. The company witnessed a 2.8% dip in comparable-store sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, following a 2.4% decline in the preceding quarter. Comparable-store sales had fallen 2.6%, 2.6%, 3% and 1.8% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively, and 0.2% in the final quarter of fiscal 2015. Management expects comps to decline as much as 2.5% during fiscal 2017.Further, the company reported in-line earnings during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 but it failed to contain the decline in the bottom line. We observed that after declining 14% and 6.7% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, earnings per share plunged 15.2% and 16% in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Well our proven model does not conclusively show that Whole Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Whole Foods has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 34 cents. Whole Foods’ Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Kroger is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for KR in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for KR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.33% heading into earnings season.Tiffany & Co.

1083,KR,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has been a favored pick for investors in 2017. The food giant, specializing in fresh, frozen and processed meat and chicken products, has witnessed shares soar almost 32.6% this year, compared with its industry’s rally of 26.6%.Tyson Foods’ strategies have been paying off and driving business growth. Let us take a look at some of the initiatives undertaken by the company and see how it is placed for the upcoming periods.Protein Packed Brands: An Important Growth DriverTyson Foods actively responds to consumers increasing preference for protein-packed meat and chicken products. Notably, sales volume in the chicken segment inched up 1.6% and 4.1% during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Encouraged by such growth, the company has undertaken several efforts to expand poultry production capacity, especially in Tennessee. Along with the chicken segment, the company’s beef unit grew 0.4% and 3.3% in the past two quarters. Robust domestic demand for beef products, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports have been the primary drivers in this segment. Further, Tyson Foods has been focusing on acquisitions to strengthen protein-packed portfolio. In this regard, the company’s AdvancePierre buyout favorably impacted the Prepared Foods segment’s performance in the last two quarters. To enrich Prepared Foods category, the company also announced the buyout of Original Philly Holdings in November 2017. Management continues to expect positive synergies from these acquisitions.Latest Venture Into Meat Substitute MarketGrowing demand for protein-rich products has led to intensive animal farming, causing significant environmental and animal welfare concerns. Moreover, plant-sourced protein products are considered healthy and a viable substitute of meat by a growing demography of protein-savvy consumers.  Driven by such trends, Tyson Foods has been tapping into alternative sources of protein. The company recently raised its stake in the California-based company, Beyond Meat, which specializes in plant-based burger patties, non-GMO soy, heat-and-eat meals and pea protein frozen foods. Owned by the leading cereal producer Kellogg (K  -  Free Report), Beyond Meat has a wide market reach in the meat substitute market. Such initiatives strengthen Tyson Foods competitive position against firms which have substantial presence in the meat substitutes markets, such as Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report).Lingering Concerns for Tyson FoodsTyson Foods has been consistently hiking wages to ensure greater employee retention. However, such endeavors increase the company’s expense burden. Moreover, Tyson Foods’ capacity expansion initiatives require the recruitment of more workers. This may further augment the company’s cost burden. Additionally, the company is exposed to the risks of volatility in the prices of raw materials, which may lead to unfavorable volume/mix. Such headwinds are expected to pose viable challenges for Tyson Foods, if not aptly offset.  Final ThoughtsTyson Foods expects its performance in fiscal 2018 to gain from business integration synergies and other cost-optimization efforts, such as the recently-introduced Financial Fitness Program. In fact, management expects net saving of nearly $200 million in fiscal 2018 along with synergies worth $400 million and $600 million estimated for fiscal 2019 and 2020, respectively. Such efforts are expected to offset the negative impacts of the expense burden and price volatility.Moreover, Tyson Foods’ robust portfolio of brands makes it a strong contender in the food industry.  Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s expansion efforts are expected to drive growth in the forthcoming periods and boost investor’s optimism.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1084,KR,"The Retail – Supermarkets industry has depicted a marvelous bull run this year, as evident from its year-to-date surge of 36.6%, in comparison to the S&P 500’s 22.8% upside. Notably, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is a bellwether that flawlessly crushed this robust trend too, with its rally of 46.5% this year. On the contrary, this supermarket giant’s industry peer Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) plunged 19.4%, whereas Tesco (TSCDY  -  Free Report) grew 9.4% in the same time frame. So, let’s look at the factors that helped this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company march ahead of the industry, and see if it can sustain this trend in 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What’s Driving Walmart’s Superb Performance?Walmart has been gaining from its incessant efforts to expand in the e-commerce space and counter Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) rising dominance. Wal-Mart’s focus on becoming an omni-channel retailer is well evident from plans to become “Walmart” from “Wal-Mart Stores”, effective Feb 1, 2018. Well, the company has been taking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems.Evidently, Wal-Mart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company’s Walmart Pay mobile payment system, and Mobile Express Returns program also highlight its focus on accelerating online business.Apart from this, Wal-Mart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which was a major contributor to its e-commerce sales in the third quarter. Most recently, sources revealed that the company started offering meal-kits online, a card that Amazon had played this July. Further, Walmart’s efforts to enhance its delivery services (like buyout of Parcel and deal with Deliv) also resonates quite well with its strategy of growing its online grocery sales.Backed by all aforementioned endeavors, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales soared 50%, courtesy of Walmart.com’s performance. Notably, this includes significant contributions from Walmart’s online grocery service, which has now expanded to over 1,100 locations and is expected to have 1,000 additions next year.Apart from having a dominant presence in the United States, Wal-Mart is also gaining from its solid international operations. With operations spread in China, Mexico, Canada and UK, international forms Wal-Mart’s second-largest segment, in terms of revenues. Evidently, international sales constituted about 24% of the company’s total sales in fiscal 2017, with 10 out of 11 markets recording positive comparable store sales. The company remains committed toward achieving growth across all its markets, on the back of its fresh products; expansion of online grocery and private brands.The aforementioned drivers helped the world’s largest retailer to post its ninth and 13th consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise and U.S. comps growth, respectively, in the third quarter. Also, management stated that its food categories performed exceptionally well and recorded the highest comps in about six years. These factors keep the company encouraged about its ongoing performance, as reflected in its raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2018.The company now envisions fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.38-$4.46 per share, as compared with the prior expectation of $4.30-$4.40. Clearly, the big-box retailer’s efforts to exploit each nook and cranny of the e-commerce space is likely to help it keep its spectacular show going in 2018.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

In the preceding quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 24.2%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayRobust performance at the company’s Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie Group and Free People during the holiday season is likely to drive results in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 63 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of nearly 14.6%.Recently, this Philadelphia, PA-based company posted fourth-quarter net sales of $1,089.1 million that improved 5.7% on a year-over-year basis.

In addition, management is making all possible efforts to enhance the performance of brands, through store refurbishment and by bringing in more compelling assortments.However, investors are concerned about management’s remark over gross margin that is expected to decline year over year in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 on account of de-leverage in delivery as well as logistic expenditures.

Fears about rising inflation and an impending trade war have caused many investors to panic over the last few days, but continued earnings strength could very well be enough to inspire more bullishness.Earnings reports from Q4 were impressive across the board.

Investors should also keep an eye on the company’s e-commerce growth, as well as any updates on its store rehab initiatives. 2. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report)Following Target, fellow big-box retailer Costco is slated to announce its most recent quarterly results after the closing bell on March 7.

1089,KR,"Industry experts believe that the competition in the U.S. grocery market is going to intensify further in 2018, and supermarket chains will have to constantly revisit their strategy in order to withstand it. This means either you “shape up or ship out.” It seems that The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) has taken the stock of the situation and is on its way to give itself a complete makeover.The BackgroundThe grocery industry has been grappling with stiff competition, volatility in food prices, aggressive promotional environment and declining store count. The industry witnessed a major shake-up when the news of Whole Foods takeover by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surfaced. This amalgamation of online marketplace with physical stores caused a tectonic shift in the grocery landscape.Amazon can now leverage Whole Foods’ fresh foods procurements expertise with its own data mining techniques. Experts see this acquisition as a major step by Amazon to thwart any threat coming from Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), which holds a dominant position in the $700-$800 billion U.S. food market and has been gradually building up its e-commerce strength.Wal-Mart has been proactive in expanding in the fast-growing online grocery space. The company, which competes with Amazon Fresh, extended alliance with last mile logistics entity, Deliv, to support same-day delivery for groceries. Walmart also acquired delivery start-up company, Parcel Inc. to extend same-day deliveries.Target (TGT  -  Free Report) has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by recently acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service, Shipt. Previously, the company had acquired Grand Junction in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities.What’s Kroger’s Strategy?Kroger has been trying all means to overcome competition, which has intensified with the entrance of Amazon. The company remains well on track to boost market share by expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. The company introduced an entirely new brand, HemisFares that give customers access to best foods from all around the globe and is expanding Prep+Pared Meal Kits.The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is gaining traction. Kroger commenced “We Are Local” campaign; launched and opened a new restaurant concept, Kitchen 1883; and added two new product lines under “Our Brands” — an apparel brand to be launched in 2018 and a floral line, BLOOM HAUS, which is available in stores.As part of the program management is considering the sale of convenience store business, and expects to generate $400 million in incremental operating margin by 2020 and over $4 billion of free cash flow in the next three years. The company in collaboration with Chase Pay will offer mobile payments in select markets beginning next year.Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations in Southern California. Kroger remains optimistic about the acquisitions of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products; Harris Teeter, a grocery chain, and the merger of Modern HC Holdings with Axium Pharmacy Holdings Inc., a specialty pharmacy. Kroger also acquired Roundy's, the grocery store operator.Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy that enriches the consumers shopping experience and convinces them of returning to the store is also benefiting the company. We believe that the company's operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales, alleviate gross margin pressure, improve operating margin and enhance return on invested capital.Certainly, Kroger is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and drive the stock further.

1090,KR,"By now, nearly every investor knows that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has shaken up the grocery industry, along with almost every other sector of the retail business. Grocery chains and big-box giants have, however, fought back.Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) added new trendy offerings, committed more to remodels than new locations, and focused on improving their online sales and delivery capabilities. Grocery power Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which boasts 2,793 retail food stores under a variety of banners, has also set out to revamp its business model to better compete going forward.The company recently started its “Restock Kroger” initiative. Kroger hopes to accelerate its digital and ecommerce offerings as part of this new push. Kroger has already made a few noteworthy moves, one of the biggest being the grocer’s partnership with grocery delivery startup Instacart.But investors likely want to know if these moves are set to pay off in the company’s upcoming fourth quarter earnings report.Kroger’s Q4 sales are projected to surge by 11.7% to hit $30.84 billion. Meanwhile, Kroger’s earnings are expected to reach $0.62 per share, which would mark a nearly 17% climb from the year-ago period.   Furthermore, the Cincinnati-based grocery firm topped EPS estimates by 10% last quarter. Still, investors need to gauge if Kroger is expected to beat earnings estimates in Q4.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Kroger is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and boasts an overall “B” VGM score. Coupled with the company’s current Earnings ESP of 1.40%, which signals that earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of Kroger’s upcoming fourth-quarter results, investors should consider the stock as one that seems poised to beat earnings estimates.Kroger is set to report its fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings results before the market opens on Thursday, March 8.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1091,KR,"On Friday, shares of fuel cell maker Plug Power (PLUG  -  Free Report) are soaring, up over 10% to $2.34 per share in morning trading after the company announced a new expanded deal with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report). Shares of the brick-and-mortar retailer are down a slight 0.37% in same time frame.As part of the partnership, Plug Power will provide its GenKey hydrogen fuel station and fuel cells to up to 30 additional Walmart store locations in North America over the next three years. The company was operating 22 Walmart sites at the end of last year, and deployed a new site every six weeks since 2014.Another aspect of the deal expansion includes the issuing of warrants to Walmart for the purchase of up to 55.3 million common shares of PLUG, with the first 5.8 million bought after the transaction is completed. The shares’ total value is worth roughly $600 million, and Walmart plans on paying Plug Power in $50 million installments.Plug Power’s GenKey technology offers customers ""a complete range of turnkey services to streamline the entire hydrogen and fuel cell-adoption process,” including a GenDrive or GenSure hydrogen fuel-cell system; GenFuel hydrogen infrastructure and fuel; and GenCare aftermarket customer service and support.There aren’t many companies offering turnkey solutions like Plug Power, so its recognition throughout the industry is widespread. And, Walmart isn’t the only partnering with Plug Power; Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have all deployed GenDrive units throughout their business.Currently, PLUG is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.

1092,KR,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6.3% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Kroger Q1 Earnings Beat but Decline Y/Y, Outlook Cut After reporting in line earnings in the final quarter of fiscal 2016, The Kroger Co. commenced fiscal 2017 with a positive earnings surprise. The grocery retailer posted first quarter earnings of $0.58 per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but declined 18.3% from the prior-year quarter. Subsequently, management trimmed its earnings projection.Management now projects fiscal 2017 earnings in the band of $2.00–$2.05 per share down from earlier estimate of $2.21–$2.25. Cincinnati-based company kept its long term earnings per share growth rate target of 8–11% intact.Total sales grew 4.9% to $36,285 million from the prior-year quarter and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35,507 million, marking the third straight quarter of revenue beat. Excluding fuel center sales, total sales rose 2.9%. Management stated that recent buyout of ModernHEALTH added to growth.The company’s identical supermarket sales (stores that are open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters), excluding fuel center sales, fell marginally by 0.2% to $28,627 million, whereas including fuel center sales, identical supermarket sales grew 1.6% to $32,252 million. Kroger continues to envision identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to be flat to up 1% in fiscal 2017.Lately, this supermarket chain has been going through a rough patch. Stiff competition, volatility in food prices, an aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic are the primary headwinds plaguing the provider of daily need items.Operating income declined 48.2% year over year to $622 million, whereas operating margin contracted 180 basis points to 1.7%.Other Financial AspectsKroger ended the quarter with cash of $335 million, total debt of $13,444 million, and shareholders’ equity of $6,135 million. Total debt increased $1,058 million from the prior-year period. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio jumped to 2.33 compared with 2.12 in the year-ago period. In the trailing four quarters, the company bought back $1.5 billion of shares and paid $438 million in dividends.Management continues to project capital expenditures – excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities – for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $3.2–$3.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been eight revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted down by 15.3% due to these changes.Kroger Company (The) Price and Consensus  Kroger Company (The) Price and Consensus | Kroger Company (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a strong Growth Score of 'A', though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an 'F'. However, the stock was allocated a grade of 'A' on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'A'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We are expecting a below average return from the stock in the next few months.
"
1093,KR,"SUPERVALU INC.’s (SVU  -  Free Report) retail segment performance has long been eclipsed by adverse industry conditions, leading to store closures and decline in identical store sales. Moreover, in an effort to offload underperforming stores from the retail segment, the company recently announced selling off several of its Farm Fresh stores. That said, the company has lately been focused on strengthening its wholesale business and has undertaken several initiatives to this end.Retail Segment Crumbling DownWhile consumer inclination toward online shopping has been revolutionizing the e-commerce realm, the changing retail landscape has hit traditional stores hard. Additionally, in an effort to attract more shoppers to the stores, retailers have been engaging in intense promotional activities and price wars, further aggravating the competitive scenario and making survival a remote possibility for the weak.Notably, retail stores of SUPERVALU have also fallen victim to such downturns and have been gravely underperforming, causing the company to resort to store closures. Owing to these hurdles, the company’s identical store sales in the retail segment have declined over the past 11 quarters. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, identical store sales dropped 3.5%, which, along with store closures, dragged down net sales at the Retail unit by 4.1%. Also, the segment incurred adjusted operating loss of $3 million, while retail gross margin also contracted due to soft sales and high promotions. Unfortunately, management expects the retail segment to continue bearing the brunt of these headwinds in fiscal 2018 as well.Continuing with the company’s endeavors to cut down retail stores, SUPERVALU has entered into definitive agreements with Mid-Atlantic Division of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report); Harris Teeter and Food Lion to sell 21 of its Farm Fresh Food & Pharmacy stores, in a transaction worth nearly $43 million. The deal is expected to close in May 2018, subject to certain closing conditions. Looking back, during fiscal 2016, the company sold nearly 1,350 Save-A-Lot stores. The company is expected to undertake more Farm Fresh store closures in the near future, which is likely to pull down the retail segment’s performance even further.Moreover, such challenges have taken a toll on investors’ sentiments upon the stock. Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have plunged 36.9% in the past year, considerably wider than the industry’s decline of 13.2%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Focus on Wholesale BusinessWhile on one side SUPERVALU has been shuttering its retail stores, the company has also been undertaking endeavors to fortify its foothold in the wholesale arena. This move is backed by the motive of transforming the company’s business into a wholesale operational model. Thus, it is on track to develop wholesale operations, primarily through acquisitions. In this regard, the company concluded the buyout of Associated Grocers of Florida in the beginning of the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, while it acquired Unified Grocers in June 2017. Notably, Unified Grocers contributed sales worth about $860 million to SUPERVALU’s Wholesale business during the fiscal third quarter and the company remains on track to generate targeted synergies from this buyout. Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry, such as Campbell Soups (CPB  -  Free Report) and Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report), have been resorting to strategic buyouts and widening their growth prospects.  Apart from this, the company also has supply agreements with retailers like America’s Food Basket, which is expected to fuel sales growth at this segment. Also, management remains committed toward enhancing operating efficiency, reducing costs and optimizing distribution channels, information technology and logistics, which will lift margins.Backed by such dedicated growth efforts, sales from this segment grew 52% year over year to $2,888 million in the fiscal third quarter, representing roughly 73% of the company’s total revenues. All said, the company remains dedicated toward making investments in its Wholesale business to boost future growth.Wrapping it UpBy exiting from Farm Fresh and other retail banners, SUPERVALU has been able to allocate more resources toward the strategic expansion of its wholesale business. Given the fact that the retail segment has been going down in shambles, thanks to industry-wide headwinds, the company’s move to strengthen its wholesale business seems quite rational and is expected to uplift its performance in the forthcoming periods.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1094,KR,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in KR.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen eight estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $2.22 a share a month ago to its current level of $2.00 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Kroger has seen eight downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 41 cents a share from 48 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 24.7% in the past month.Kroger Company (The) Price and Consensus Kroger Company (The) Price and Consensus | Kroger Company (The) QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Retail - Supermarkets industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JRONY  -  Free Report).

1095,KR,"We expect the designer and marketer of branded apparel, footwear and other accessories, PVH Corporation (PVH  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 29. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.4%.In fact, the company surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.6%.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether PVH Corp. will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $2.92 per share, reflecting growth of 12.1% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $2.33 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.PVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise PVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | PVH Corp. QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 13.4%, while the industry grew 4.5%.Factors at PlayPVH Corp.’s solid show even in the face of an uncertain macro environment mainly reflects the strength of its premium brands — Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. The Zacks Consensus Revenue Estimate for Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger are pegged at $861 million and $924 million, respectively, reflecting significant growth from the prior-year quarter.Apart from its diversified brand portfolio, the company has been gaining from the impressive trends at its international business. Management believes that the company’s superb execution, continued investments in brands and international platforms remain growth drivers. Also, keeping pace with the evolving trends and undertaking necessary initiatives to stay afloat in the current business scenario is likely to help the company sustain its solid momentum.Driven by the solid quarterly results, improvement in foreign currency rates and continued strength across its brands, management expects to deliver a robust second-half performance. Consequently, the company raised earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. It now envisions earnings in the range of $7.60-$7.70 per share compared with $7.40-$7.50 expected earlier.Further, revenues are projected to increase 6% for the fiscal year while currency neutral revenues are expected to grow 5%. Earlier, the company forecasted revenue growth of 3%.However, concerns regarding the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remain. While currency rates improved in second quarter, currency headwinds are expected to hurt fiscal 2017 earnings by 20 cents per share. Apart from this, a volatile retail scenario and greater marketing costs may hurt performance.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that PVH Corp. is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Earnings ESP of +0.06% and the company’s Zacks Rank #3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

1096,KR,"While the dotcom era was all about small exciting tech startups, 2017 was possibly the year when getting bigger became truly better. It was also a year when competitors decided that imitation was the best form of offence. So Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) adopted some of Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) Snapchat’s best features. Also, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) entered Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) arena and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) ventured into creating its own line of products.But a single deal stands out amongst all of this year’s apparently unrelated diversification moves. Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) $13.7 billion buyout of Whole Foods is a development that has changed the retail landscape for good. And looking at its fallout, it’s safe to say that it is likely to transform vast swathes of the entire economy.  Transformational Move or Hidden Acknowledgement?Immediately after taking over Whole Foods, Amazon triggered a price war by cutting prices. Smaller competitors like The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) had to follow suit in the wake of falling share prices. Amazon has also indicated that its Prime Members may receive further discounts, a move which is likely to set off an intense price war. And it didn’t stop there. The likes of Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are hurrying to enter into agreements which will allow their customers to shop using Google’s Express platform, a move aimed at countering Amazon’s Echo line of products. Moreover, grocery delivery startups are now suddenly in vogue with Target snagging Shipt for $550 million. (Read: Grocery Gunfight: Can Incumbents Fend Off Amazon?)But was the Whole Foods deal simply Amazon’s way of conceding that it needs to become more and more of a large format retailer like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report)? Surely Amazon’s efforts to develop an online-offline model mimic the Wal-Mart success story in more way than one. Incidentally, both Amazon and Wal-Mart have had a banner year at the bourses, surging by 58.3% and 42.9% year to date.Online-Offline Approach Holds the EdgeThe Whole Foods buy has given Amazon access to 450 stores across the United States, effectively giving it enough offline muscle. However, there’s still a long way to go for Amazon in this area. For example, it offers grocery pickups from only two locations in Seattle. Also, it is yet to perfect the grocery logistics process, which is exactly why the Whole Foods purchase happened in the first place.In fact, Amazon had little choice but to add a chain like Whole Foods to its arsenal. Most of its technology driven food sales initiatives have been ridden with flaws. Even its much vaunted Amazon Go launch has met with little success.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart has intensely focused on its online initiatives this year. Starting 2017, it is offering free two day shipping for all purchases above $35. This is clearly a move designed to counter Amazon Prime’s two-day free shipping feature. Also, it has almost tripled its range of products available offline, which have jumped from eight million to 23 million as of now.All of these initiatives have helped Wal-Mart expand its e-commerce sales by more than 60%. And its offline presence remains as formidable as ever. For instance, it offers grocery pickups from more than 1,100 locations as against only two for Amazon.Could Wal-Mart be a Better Bet Than Amazon?In fact Wal-Mart has been sharpening its grocery delivery chops through a service it launched in China. Its acquisition of Jet.com seems have to made all the difference in this area with Marc Lore, Jet’s erstwhile boss heading its e-commerce initiatives. Further, the big-box retailer will be known as “Walmart Inc."" effective Feb 1, 2018.Management stated that the company’s current name is used only in few legal places as it is more popular as just “Walmart”, given its seamless operations across stores, online as well as its app. Thus, this name change will bring uniformity and reveal Walmart’s unified and omni-channel existence universally. (Read: Wal-Mart Stores to Walmart: What's Behind the Name Change?) The only snag for Wal-Mart could its surging valuations, which at a PEG value of 3.46 is significantly greater than the S&P 500’s figure of 2.01. But with a PEG ratio of 7.11, Amazon is clearly even pricier. The ongoing bull market has dispelled such concerns over valuation time and time again.Tech majors have delivered ever stronger earnings performances, as was in evidence during Wal-Mart’s third quarter results, to justify such exorbitant valuations. Wal-Mart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Last WordAmazon’s buyout has signaled a tectonic shift in the retail sector and has set many traditional retailers scurrying for cover. But this is not a universal truth, since the likes of Wal-Mart could put up more than a stiff fight. In fact, with its strong offline-online model, Wal-Mart might just give Amazon a run for its money.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1097,KR,"It looks like Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is unraveling a new card every day to sharpen its competitive flair against Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). The officially omni-channel retailer, which has become overtly popular for undertaking constant e-commerce strategies, is also trying all means to give consumers new reasons to visit its stores. Evidently, sources revealed that the company inked a deal with FedEx’s (FDX  -  Free Report) subsidiary, FedEx Office – which will add about 500 new FedEx Office locations inside certain Walmart stores over the next two years.The agreement, which was unveiled at yesterday’s ShopTalk conference, followed the successful conclusion of a pilot program undertaken by both companies. Incidentally, Walmart and FedEx Office already tested this setup across six states that covered 47 locations such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Colorado, among others.Per media reports, the pilot program was quite impressive, as many customers visiting FedEx Offices within Walmart also ended up shopping from the latter – thus boosting the big box retailer’s store sales. Hence, we believe that this deal is likely to augment Walmart’s business by easing consumers’ shopping even further. By adding services like packaging, printing and shipping to its already wide range of products and services, Walmart is likely to emerge even stronger as a one-stop-shop for customers.Notably, the inclusion of FedEx Office stores within Walmart will also allow customers to process returns in a convenient way. Customers can send their packages to be kept at any Walmart-based FedEx Office store for up to five working days – either directly or through FedEx Delivery Manager. While Walmart and FedEx were already allies for shipping, this store within store expansion is likely to mitigate certain pressures associated with last mile deliveries, which has become a raging issue among retailers. Walmart Well Placed in the Retail GameIncidentally, major bellwethers like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), among others are also making incessant efforts in the delivery space, to stay firm in an Amazon-dominated world. This is partly clear from Target’s buyout of Shipt and Kroger’s contract with Instacart, to support seamless deliveries. Moving back to Walmart, the company is leaving no stone unturned to expand in the delivery and e-commerce space.In order to facilitate delivery, Walmart acquired a delivery startup Parcel, Inc., which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Other than this, the company’s Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. In other developments, Walmart also partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Further, the company continues to test same-day and next-day delivery to enhance its services further.While these factors and Walmart’s numerous acquisitions and alliances tell the tale of its e-commerce development, the company is also committed toward its stores business. In fact, earlier this week itself, there was a lot of buzz about the expansion of Walmart’s alliance with household services provider – Handy. Well, sources revealed that Walmart is extending its agreement with Handy, which will let customers hire helpers at about 2,000 Walmart stores to install or assemble their purchases of television and furniture.   Such strategies have been driving this supermarket giant, which has surged nearly 28.2% in a year, surpassing the industry’s rise of 21.2%. We believe that with such robust endeavors rolled up in its sleeve, Walmart is likely to keep its stellar record intact. Also, with strength across both stores and e-commerce, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is likely to remain well-placed against Amazon.

1098,KR,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), which has long been taking sturdy e-commerce initiatives to counter Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance, is also focused on enhancing store services to customers. This is evident from the expansion of its alliance with household services provider – Handy. Well, sources revealed that Walmart is extending its agreement with Handy, which will let customers hire helpers at about 2,000 Walmart stores to install or assemble their purchases of television and furniture.Per the sources, Walmart has already rolled out Handy’s services at 25 stores in Atlanta, and plans to increase it to nearly 2,000 stores across the United States by April. With this, customers will not only buy TV’s and furniture, but can also enjoy seamless installation and assembling services, by simply scheduling an appointment (between 7 am to 11 pm) during checkout.This deal is aimed at solving issues related to installation and assembling, which in turn is expected to enrich consumers overall shopping experience. With online shopping and services having become the order of the day, retailers are bound to undertake measures to buck up and offer something different in stores in order to attract traffic and stay strong amid a competitive retail landscape.In fact, companies like Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) have also taken similar steps to improve customers’ services at home. As for Walmart – while the company has been trying all means to bolster its e-commerce business, this move highlights the big box retailer’s focus on stores. The company is trying every means to evolve with the changing consumer environment to compete with brick-and-mortar rivals as well as the e-commerce king Amazon.This is evident from its transition from Wal-Mart Stores to Walmart — in a bid to officially emerge an omni-channel retailer. In this regard, the company has been taking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems.Most recently, the company inked a deal with Rakuten to sell online groceries in Japan as well as e-books and audiobooks in the United States. Apart from this, Walmart’s buyouts of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Bonobos, ModCloth and Jet.com, and deal with Lord and Taylor underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio.The company’s Walmart Pay mobile payment system, Mobile Express Returns program and efforts to enhance checkout process further highlight its focus on accelerating online business and making shopping easier and faster. Apart from this, Walmart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, as part of which it is making constant moves to improve delivery services.Apart from Walmart, major retail bellwethers such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) are also taking incessant strides to improve online grocery services and stay firm in an Amazon-dominated retail world. Moving back to Walmart, we believe that its growth strategies like the aforementioned pact with Handy clearly highlight its efforts to exploit nook and cranny of the retail space and reinforce its competitive flair against Amazon. Notably, these splendid endeavors have helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company surge 25.1% in a year, surpassing the industry’s rise of 19.1%.

1099,KR,"Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21. In the trailing four quarters, this home improvement retailer underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.6%. In the second and first quarter, it missed the consensus estimate by 3.1% and 3.7%, respectively.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable in the last 30 days and is pegged at $1.02. This reflects a sharp improvement of roughly 16% from 88 cents in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16,568 million, up 5.3% year over year.From aforementioned estimates, it is quite evident that Lowe’s is likely to continue with its top- and bottom-lines growth streak in the third quarter as well. Earnings per share have increased 14.6% and 18.4%, while net sales rose 6.8% and 10.7% in the second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Factors at PlayAn improving job scenario, housing market recovery, merchandising initiatives and post hurricane construction activities along with efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities bode well for Lowe’s. It also remains well-positioned to reap the benefits of strategic acquisitions done earlier such as that of RONA. In an effort to strengthen relationship with pro customers, the company has concluded the acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters, the distributor of maintenance, repair and operations products.The reflection of these endeavors is evident from 4.5% rise in second-quarter comparable sales (comps), up from 1.9% recorded in the first quarter. This improvement can be attributable to 0.9% growth in transaction and a 3.6% increase in average ticket. Comps for the U.S. business rose 4.6%, following an increase of 2% in the first quarter. The company registered 43% comp growth on lowes.com in the second quarter.Undoubtedly, the above discussion makes us optimistic about Lowe’s performance in the soon-to-be reported quarter. However, threats emerging from cannibalization and stiff competition cannot be ignored. Also, we observed that the company’s margin have been under pressure for quite some time now. In the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2016, Lowe’s gross margin had contracted 25, 40, 10 and 43 basis points (bps), respectively. In the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, the same declined a respective 64 and 23 bps to 34.4% and 34.2%.Lowe's Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Lowe's Companies, Inc.

1100,KR,"Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 20. In the preceding quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.9%. Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether Urban Outfitters will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pegged at 33 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of nearly 18%. Notably, the consensus mark has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $857 million in comparison to $862 million, reported in the prior-year period.Factors at PlaySignificantly, this Philadelphia, PA-based company is likely to benefit from new store openings, increase in direct penetration, growing wholesale operations, technology advancements and merchandising improvements. We also believe that better product execution and an effective inventory management will help augment the company’s performance. Management is revamping stores and bringing in more compelling assortments. The company is also strategically investing in shop-in-shops.However, decline in comparable retail segment net sales in fiscal 2018 has been a concern for investors and is likely to persist in the third quarter too. Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect comparable store sales at Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group to decrease by 5% and 2.5%, respectively. However, comps at Free People are expected to increase by 2.8%. It is important to note that last quarter, comparable retail segment net sales fell 7.9% at Urban Outfitters and 4% at Anthropologie Group, respectively, but increased 2.9 % at the Free People.Investors are also concerned about management’s remark over gross margin, which is expected to decline year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2018 on account of rise in delivery as well as deleveraging in store occupancy expenditures. In the second quarter, gross margin contracted 440 basis points (bps) to approximately 34.1%, following a decline of 284 bps to roughly 31.5% in the first quarter, primarily due to deleveraging in customer delivery and logistics expense rates.Urban Outfitters, Inc.

1101,KR,"TreeHouse Foods, Inc (THS  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, before the market opens.The company’s performance is expected to be negatively impacted by divestitures, stiff competition and rising commodity costs. However, its cost saving and business-restructuring initiatives, with enhanced focus on organic food products are expected to yield positive results.The company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, leading to an average negative surprise of 1.4%.Let’s now look into the factors likely to impact the upcoming quarterly results.What to Expect This Quarter?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the third quarter has remained stable in the past thirty days at 76 cents per share, which is at the lower end of management’s guidance of 75-83 cents. Nonetheless, the estimate depicts a year-on-year increase of 8.5%.However, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,525 million for the said quarter, depicting a 3.9% decline from the prior-year sales.Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Treehouse Foods, Inc. QuoteFactors Impacting the Quarter Commodity cost inflation is expected to continue affecting TreeHouse Foods’ bottom line. The costs of selected commodities like oils, nuts and coffee has been increasing lately. While the company expects pricing actions to offset the increasing costs of commodities, the process is expected to take a slow trajectory.Moreover, a tough retail environment combined with operating inefficiencies has led TreeHouse Foods to resort to divestitures, which is expected to negatively impact the company’s sales volumes in the forthcoming periods. Further, the company’s performance remains exposed to headwinds such as changing consumer tastes and shift toward healthier food products.Also, Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) expansion into the grocery space and it initiatives to lower prices, creates stiff competition for TreeHouse Foods. Big-wigs like The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (WMT  -  Free Report) are also bearing the brunt of Amazon’s growing dominance.Owing to such unfavorable market conditions, shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the past year. Treehouse Foods’ shares have plunged 24% compared with the industry’s decline 10.9%.Nevertheless, we remain hopeful regarding TreeHouse Foods’ 2020 Initiative, designed to restructure and realign the business. Alongside cost savings, the initiative is expected to improve the company’s supply chain. TreeHouse Foods is also expected to gain from its enhanced focus on organic food items. Lately, the company has been witnessing a positive sales trend in its food-away-from-home outlets, which mainly focuses on clean ingredients. We believe that this should help drive the company’s top line.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model shows that TreeHouse Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1102,KR,"On Thursday, shares of meal-kit company Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report) are falling after the company announced it would be laying off 6% of its employees, or about 300 people. The stock is down about 1.3% to $5.24 per share in morning trading.CEO Matt Salzberg described the decision as a “company-wide realignment” in an email to employees. According to CNBC, the layoffs affected salaried employees the most, and the company let go of a slew of workers within its marketing, software development, operations, and business development divisions at its New York headquarters.“Our leadership and Board did not take this decision lightly, and I want to assure you that we believe it was necessary as we focus the company on future growth and achieving profitability,” wrote Salzberg.“We have accomplished so much together over the past five years, and no words can adequately describe my appreciation for the work you do each day. I’m confident that the changes we made today will make our organization stronger and help us continue to improve the lives of our customers across the country,” he continued.While job cuts are never the best news for a young company, it’s not entirely surprising for Blue Apron. The company has had a tough time ever since its IPO this past June--shares of APRN are down over 47%--an IPO that was completely overshadowed by Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) decision to purchase Whole Foods. That acquisition announcement caused even more intense investor caution and scrutiny, and Blue Apron ended up slashing its intended price range.Even though Blue Apron is still the biggest and most well-known meal-kit company out there, the competition is more aggressive than ever. From Amazon and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) jumping into the meal-kit and meal-prep game to rival HelloFresh planning to go public, it’s more important than ever that Blue Apron show investors and analysts that it can both retain customers and expand its base.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1103,KR,"On Dec 13, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) made significant headway in the same-day delivery race by acquiring grocery delivery company Shipt for $550 million. The landmark deal was a must do for Target given the rapidly changing retailer landscape. In the current scenario, failure to offer same-day store to home delivery could mean curtains for nearly every retailer.Already, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is beginning to offer grocery pickups at more of its outlets and is looking to launch same-day delivery services. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is also making concerted efforts on this front, with more such initiatives likely following its much vaunted Whole Foods acquisition.This is why Target had no choice but to snag a delivery specialist like Shipt. Moreover, Target is looking to protect its online sales kitty, which swelled to 24% during last quarter.Why Did Amazon’s Whole Foods Buy Change the Game?But it was Amazon that fired first in what is developing into a grocery gunfight of sorts. In June, the online retail behemoth announced it was buying premium supermarket chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. This was Amazon’s largest ever acquisition, easily exceeding the $1.2 billion for which it picked up Zappos eight years ago.Amazon had little choice but to add a chain like Whole Foods to its arsenal. Most of its technology driven food sales initiatives have been ridden with flaws. Even its much vaunted Amazon Go launch has met with little success. This is why it has failed to challenge the dominance of Wal-Mart in the grocery space despite its tremendous success with books, electronics and streaming services. Wal-Mart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In this situation, picking up Whole Foods was a smart move. Amazon can now combine Whole Foods’ fresh foods procurements expertise with its own data mining techniques. Now, Whole Foods can utilize the online behemoth’s experience to develop a better profile of its customers’ behavior. This will ensure that it offers the correct product at the right price with near immaculate timing.How Can Traditional Retailers Respond?For several years now, groceries were an insular market, safe from the e-commerce assault laying waste to other retail segments. In fact, only around 2% of the $800 billion U.S. groceries market has gone online till now, per data from RBC Capital Markets.But the Whole Foods takeover has caused a tectonic shift in the grocery landscape. Analysts are now betting that Amazon will soon make major forays into the grocery space because of its logistics and data mining expertise. This could cause nearly 10% of grocery purchases to move online.This means that the legacy supermarket business needs to learn how to deal with such a large volume of online purchases. One option to satisfy these orders would be to develop an in-house delivery structure. But this would likely be an exhaustive and costly process. This is why most of them are depending on e-delivery experts.Both Shipt and Instacart follow a similar business model. These companies have entered into partnerships with retailers whose products at a specific store are offered online. When a customer places an order with say Shipt, a shopper visits the store in question, picks up the groceries and completes the delivery. Grocery delivery companies like Shipt usually charge customers a yearly fee for their services.How Target Plans to Leverage the Shipt BuyoutEarlier this year, Target acquired software company Grand Junction which is also part of the same-day delivery space. With Target already offering same-delivery in New York City, the Shipt purchase will only add to Target’s delivery muscle. Target is now looking to offer same-day delivery services from half of its stores in six months and from all stores by the end of 2018.Target will also add selections from electronics and other retail categories to the delivery baskets of Shipt. The ultimate target is to offer same-day delivery from Target’s website and mobile app. Meanwhile, Shipt will continue to work with Target’s competitors since a critical volume of business is required to make operations viable.  No Brainer Gainers: Delivery StartupsEven before its Shipt acquisition, Target was working with its competitor Instacart across several markets. The United States’ largest grocery chain The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) works with both these grocery delivery companies. Meanwhile, privately held Albertsons will utilize Instacart’s services to provide home delivery.As for Shipt itself, since it will continue to operate as an independent entity, it will serve Target competitors like Kroger and Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report). Such a scheme of things implies that Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods has come as boon for grocery delivery startups instead of the body blow it was initially perceived to be.In fact, the Whole Foods acquisition has improved the profile of the grocery delivery segment. They are now the natural allies of traditional retailers in their war against Amazon. Since June, Shipt’s orders have jumped 60% and it has forayed into 22 new geographical areas. By next year, Shipt predicts that its revenues will hit $1 billion.The Last WordThe Whole Foods takeover came as a rude awakening for traditional retailers. But they have learnt to survive and even thrive in a new environment, leveraging the strengths of relatively unknown grocery startups. This emerging segment has gained in the process, which means that Amazon may find that mastering the grocery business may be a much tougher challenge than it appeared at first glance.  Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1104,KR,"Shares of U.S.-based gunmakers Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR  -  Free Report) and American Outdoor Brands (AOBC  -  Free Report) surged in morning trading Thursday, despite grocery giant Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) adding its name to the growing list of retailers changing their own gun sales rules in the wake of recent mass shootings.Kroger announced Thursday that it will no longer sell guns to to customers under age 21 at its Fred Meyer stores. Big-box behemoth Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) made a similar announcement on Wednesday, while Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) raised its age minimum for firearms and discontinued the sale of assault-style rifles at its Field & Stream stores.“Recent events demonstrate the need for additional action on the part of responsible gun retailers,” Kroger said in a statement. “We believe these are common sense steps we can take immediately that are in line with our values and our vision.”Dick's CEO Edward Stack went even further in his statement, urging U.S. regulators to follow suit with a nationwide ban on assault-style rifles and a higher minimum age for gun ownership.“Some will say these steps can't guarantee tragedies like Parkland will never happen again,” said Stack. “They may be correct—but if common sense reform is enacted and even one life is saved, it will have been worth it.”Gunmaker stocks dipped in the wake of Wednesday's announcements from Walmart and Dick's, but the aforementioned firearm manufacturers recovered yesterday's losses in early morning trading today. Shares of American Outdoor Brands—formerly Smith & Wesson—gained nearly 6.6%, while Sturm, Ruger & Co. surged about 6.7%.American Outdoor Brands is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on Thursday. The company faced challenging year-over-year comparisons in its prior quarter, as pre-election jitters caused a spike in gun sales in 2016.

1105,KR,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has been in the green for a while, courtesy of efforts to keep up with the shift in consumer preference toward protein-packed products. Backed by these initiatives, this leading chicken, meat and prepared foods producer has delivered sturdy year-on-year top-line growth in the trailing four quarters. Notably, strong volumes and solid performance across all segments, primarily Beef and Chicken benefitted the company in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Driven by such upsides, shares of the company have gained 32.4% in the past six months compared with the industry’s rally of 25.7%.In fact, Tyson Foods has also been focusing on tapping into alternative sources of protein, other than meat and chicken products.  Per media sources, the company recently raised its stake in the California-based company, Beyond Meat. The investment is part of Beyond Meat’s latest fundraising round. We note that Tyson Foods already owns a 5% stake in this plant-based protein manufacturing company.  Let’s take a look into how Tyson Foods can reap benefits from this latest deal as well as other factors that have been driving the company’s performance.Beyond Meat to Drive Growth in Meat Substitute MarketAlongside the widening demography of protein-savvy consumers, traditional meat sales face intense pressure due to increasing environmental concerns about intensive animal farming and animal welfare. Moreover, rising health consciousness amongst consumers have led to a general perception that plant-based products are healthier than meat and chicken.Such market trends have urged companies like Beyond Meat and MorningStar Farms, owned by the leading cereal producer Kellogg (K  -  Free Report), to foray into the animal-free market and develop substitutes for meat and chicken products. Beyond Meat manufactures plant-based burger patties, non-GMO soy, heat-and-eat meals and pea protein frozen foods. The company sells products through grocery chains such as Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Whole Foods and Albertsons. The products are also served at leading restaurant chains and hotels.Beyond Meat’s wide-spread market reach in the meat substitute market is undoubtedly a significant value-addition for Tyson Foods. Further, sources revealed that annual sales of meat substitute products, including frozen and shelf-stable products, are expected to reach $863 million in the United States by 2021. Considering the rapid growth of the meat substitutes market, Tyson Foods’ strategy to strengthen presence of this segment bodes well.Strength in the Meat & Chicken SegmentApart from expanding in the meat-substitutes space, Tyson Foods is also progressing well with traditional meat categories. Notably, Tyson Foods’ chicken and beef segments have been depicting strong volume growth since the past few quarters owing to surging consumer demand. Further, in order to expand protein-packed portfolio, the company has been focusing on acquisitions. In this regard, the company’s AdvancePierre buyout favorably impacted the Prepared Foods segment’s performance in the last two quarters. To further enrich the Prepared Foods category, the company announced the buyout of Original Philly Holdings in November 2017. Going forward, management continues to expect positive synergies from acquisitions.In addition to such efforts, Tyson Foods has been expanding poultry production capacity in Tennessee. The company has been proactively catering to consumer’s preference for natural and fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics.We believe that such efforts to strengthen foothold in the meat and meat substitute markets, is likely to spur further growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1108,KR,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) surged on Thursday after the company reported third-quarter earnings that helped show investors it might be ready to compete against the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report). Kroger’s performance helped lift almost the entire grocery industry, as shares of fellow grocers, including Costco (COST  -  Free Report), surged.Kroger posted Q3 earnings of $0.44 per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.40 per share. The company’s profit rose from $391 million to $397 million. On top of strong bottom line performance, revenues beat expectations and hit $27.7 billion, which marked a 4.5% year-over-year jump.The Cincinnati-based grocery chain’s established store sales grew by 1.1%. What’s more, Kroger noted that its digital sales more than doubled from the year-ago period. The company reiterated its fourth-quarter profit guidance and now projects its identical store sales will climb 1.1%, excluding fuel.Shares of Kroger soared over 10% premarket and flew as high as 12% in morning trading. Before today’s gains, Kroger stock had plummeted nearly 30% since the start of the year. However, shares of the struggling grocer have started to climb over the last four weeks.Today’s encouraging third-quarter results came even after Kroger began to lower its prices in an effort to fend off competition from online sellers, as well as Whole Foods and Walmart. Along with lowering prices, which is not necessarily sustainable long-term, Kroger expanded its offerings and broke into new revenue streams.""We continue to accelerate our digital and e-commerce offerings, to grow Our Brands, to lower prices for customers, and to invest in our associates,” CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement. ""This quarter shows that by investing for the future, our business continues to improve and gain momentum.”Kroger’s moves include plans to expand its natural food offerings and grow its digital presence, with a focus on increasing online orders. The company also opened a new restaurant concept, as well as a new floral line called Bloom Haus.Furthermore, the company announced it will launch an apparel line in 2018. These new offerings are aimed to help Kroger compete more directly against the likes of Walmart and Costco, who are viewed as more one-stop shops. Barclays (BCS  -  Free Report) noted recently that over 80% of Kroger’s locations are within five miles of a Walmart.Kroger’s strong showing helped the company regain some investor confidence, at least for now. The chain’s positive Q3 and ability to revamp its business model on the fly also lifted stocks throughout the grocery industry.Grocery Industry Shares of Costco popped over 3% on Thursday to hit a new 52-week high, helped by its solid November sales.

1109,KR,"Tempting fate — it never fails to disappoint. Yesterday’s regular trading day, after I proclaimed nothing could get in the way of this latest leg of a bullish trading wave, things did. Market participants who’d been riding an enormous wave of technology looked at their year-to-date gains in companies like nVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), which had topped up 113%, and sold them off 10% yesterday. As for Bitcoin, I said nothing could stop it. Then one of its exchanges lost power, and the value of one Bitcoin fell more than $2000.Well, Bitcoin has since recovered a bit and nVIDIA is trading up in today’s pre-market. In fact, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all up ahead of today’s opening bell. This is because, profit-taking and machine malfunctions aside, the overall bullish narrative is intact: equities continue strengthening on solid economic metrics like the labor market, consumer confidence, etc. Oil prices are well above $50 per barrel today (with a newly minted OPEC deal just hitting the newswires this morning), and geopolitical strife — rhetoric between President Trump and Kim Jong-Un notwithstanding — is at a minimum.Ahead of today’s open, new Initial Jobless Claims came down even further: 238K claims last week is down 2000 from the upwardly revised previous week. This is solidly in the very healthy range of 225-250K we’ve enjoyed the past few years, temporary hurricane-related issues aside. Continuing claims, however, are creeping up even further: from beneath 1.9 million just weeks ago, this latest read of 1.957 million is the closest we’ve been to 2 million continuing claims we’ve seen in quite some time.Personal Income and Spending numbers also came in this morning, with the October headline of +0.4% one-tenth ahead of expectations. Spending reached +0.3%, in-line with analysts’ consensus. These figures show that growing consumer confidence in other metrics is indeed strengthening, which is paramount to a strong holiday shopping season. So we remain hopeful a strong Q4 in both earnings and GDP will be in the offing as of early next year.The markets can be expected to rally further should news from Capitol Hill regarding progress on tax reform/cuts be forthcoming today. Just the simple event of an actual vote on the Senate’s bill today could be interpreted as a good sign; if the GOP-led body knew they didn’t have the votes to pass it, they probably would not call the vote til next week. This would give leaders of the bill time to massage senators still in need of convincing. As of now it looks like a bit of a toss-up, with sentiment coming down on the pro-passage side.Finally, supermarket giant Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) reported fiscal Q3 2018 results during today’s pre-market: earnings of 44 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus by 4 cents, and revenues of $27.75 billion easily outpaced the $27.31 billion expected. The parent company of Mariano’s, Pick ’n Save, Ralph’s and others also upped its full-year guidance to $2.00-2.05, ahead of our expected $1.97. Shares of Kroger are up 12% in today’s pre-market. Clearly someone is putting their nVIDIA profits to work elsewhere.

1110,KR,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) were up more than 3.5% in morning trading Wednesday after the grocery chain reaffirmed its 2017 forecast and said that it was considering the sale of its convenience store business.For fiscal 2017, Kroger projects adjusted earnings to fall in the range of $2 per share to $2.05 per share. The company expects identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to improve by 0.5% to 1%.In a prepared statement, Kroger management also confirmed that the company is working with Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) to explore strategic alternatives, one of which would be to offload its 780-store, 18-state convenience store portfolio.“Considering the current premium multiples for convenience stores, we feel it is our obligation as a management team to undertake a review,” CFO Mike Schlotman said.On top of its core supermarkets and convenience stores, Kroger operates several retail health clinics, jewelry stores, and pharmacies.Kroger is also detailing its three-year goals at this week’s annual investor meeting. Dubbed the “Restock” plan, Kroger is looking to couple cost savings in certain business segments with roughly $9 billion in capital investments. The company hopes that the plan will generate over $4 billion in free cash flow over the next three years.“We have the scale, the data, the physical assets and human connection to win,” said CEO Rodney McMullen. “Restock Kroger builds on our strengths and strategically repositions Kroger to accelerate our customer-centered efforts in order to create shareholder value.”One of Kroger’s primary goals for Restock is to improve its in-store experience. As brick-and-mortar retailers continue to adapt to e-commerce, especially recently in the grocery space, a key strategy has been to focus on bettering the traditional shopping environment.So far, it looks like Kroger has some interesting ideas on this front. The company intends on expanding its “Scan, Bag, Go” program, which is being piloted at 20 stores, to nearly 400 locations next year. “Scan, Bag, Go” allows shoppers to check out items with a handheld scanner as they walk around the store, a concept that is eerily reminiscent of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Go experiment. Kroger also plans to invest nearly $500 million in better pay and training for its store employees.Today’s gain comes on the back of the news that fellow supermarket chain Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) was reaffirming its own guidance for fiscal 2018 and updating its sales goals for fiscal 2019. Despite a brutal pricing war involving Amazon’s Whole Foods, big box retailers like Walmart and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and discount chains like Aldi, some grocery giants are clearly finding success.Currently, Kroger is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. The company’s P/E ratio of 10.30 and P/S ratio of 0.15 present a discount to the industry and market averages.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1111,KR,"Thanks to the overall rise of meal delivery services and an aggressive digital marketing strategy, Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the most popular brands in the growing recipe kit delivery market. However, since its shares debuted in late June, Blue Apron has tumbled more than 50% and is struggling to generate any positive momentum.Blue Apron is a noticeable name in a trendy industry, but the company must still answer the same fundamental questions faced by many young stocks: What is the expansion plan, and how will growing pains be handled? Where are customers coming from, and what will be done to beat out competition? When can investors expect to see profitability?Unfortunately, Blue Apron has failed to satisfactorily address these issues, and the stock has been punished. The company’s shares have been nearly slashed in half from their IPO price, sending Blue Apron’s market cap towards the $950 million mark.  To put that in context, the meal kit service’s latest round of private funding valued the brand at over $2.2 billion.Things aren’t looking great for Blue Apron, and a closer inspection of the company’s key metrics further strengthens the bear case. On top of slumping share prices, here’s three more reasons why Blue Apron investors ought to be worried right now:1.       Stagnating Customer GrowthIn the most recent quarter, Blue Apron said that it had 943,000 customers, which was down about 9% from the first quarter. Management said that a planned $26.1 million reduction in marketing between the first and second quarters was to blame for the slump.As opposed to a slump without a clear cause, it is certainly better to have a quantifiable reason for customer growth stagnation. This means the company understands the pros and cons of its customer acquisition strategy. However, this is not a trend that Blue Apron can sustain for very long. Controlling marketing costs will be necessary to reach profitability, and if the service loses that many users due to one cost cut, there could be serious problems in the long-term. 2.       Slumping Revenue Per CustomerBlue Apron’s report also revealed that average revenue per customer was down to $251 in the second quarter. This represents a nearly 5% dip from the $264 seen in the second quarter of 2016. The company also reported small dips in both average order value and orders per customer.We know Blue Apron dishes out plenty of free trials, so it’s important that the service capitalizes on its paid customers once they’ve been secured. If falling revenue per customer becomes a trend, we can assume that the product is simply not resonating with users—and that’s definitely something investors will be concerned about. 3.       Out-Cashed By CompetitorsAt the end of the second quarter, Blue Apron said that it had about $62 million in cash and cash equivalents. That was less than half of the $141 million it had in the prior-year quarter and partially a result of the company spending roughly $20 million during the quarter. As competition heats up throughout the meal-kit delivery market, having cash on hand is essential for expansion efforts, so Blue Apron’s weak cash position is concerning.By comparison, grocery chain Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which just expanded its “Prep+Pared” meal kits, had about $319 million in cash at the end of its most recent quarter. Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has a staggering $15.4 billion in cash right now and could effectively squeeze out all of its competition.Even other meal kit-only companies are positioned with more cash right now. For example, HelloFresh has the advantage of being a majority holding of German incubator Rocket Internet, which had about $2.2 billion in pro-forma cash at the end of the most recent quarter. And interestingly enough, HelloFresh just announced that it was also pursing an IPO (also read: 5 Things To Know As Meal-Kit Startup HelloFresh Preps For IPO). Bottom LineBlue Apron has a solid product and great brand recognition. However, in an incredibly crowded market with bigger competitors entering en masse, these advantages don’t necessarily translate to consistent growth. Sure, the company is working on its logistics and attempting to reel in costs, but we’ve already seen several indications that Blue Apron is a small fish at risk of being swallowed up by the industry’s sharks.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1112,KR,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) unveiled a program wherein it will allow food stamp receivers to order food and groceries online. However, they will have to pick up the items from any of the five specific stores in the United States. Nevertheless, the company plans to expand the service to more markets in the coming months.Per sources, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides food stamps to about 44 million people who earn wages below a certain range and use electronic benefits transfer (EBT) to pay for their purchases. Since EBT is non-transferable, the food stamp receiver needs to pick up the ordered grocery from the stores.The move has opened doors for other grocers to experiment with EBT cards and allow shoppers to use EBT to shop grocery online and then later pick up from stores. FreshDirect, a grocery delivery service, has tested a pilot program in New York's Bronx neighborhood for EBT-dependent shoppers. North Carolina-based Lowes Foods and Harris Teeter, owned by The Kroger Company (KR  -  Free Report) are planning to offer similar online grocery shopping services for EBT users.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. QuoteWalmart’s Other Online Grocery Services Walmart has been pushing itself constantly to match up with the e-commerce biggie Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). Walmart hasaggressively adopted a number of initiatives in this regard. Recently, it has teamed up with Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google to enter the budding voice-shopping market and opened 1,000th Online Grocery Pickup location, which enables customers to order groceries online and pick them up at their local Walmart store.Also, with Easy Reorder on walmart.com, customers can repurchase items by looking into their previous in-store and online purchases records. The company also has a dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com which enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than 1 million classrooms across the country.The company also offers free two-day shipping service to U.S. shoppers on a minimum order of $35. In April, Walmart introduced a program wherein it offered discounts on online items, only if shoppers picked their orders from a nearby store. This acted as an added feature to Walmart’s Walmart Pickup delivery service, which enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up from a store for free.Walmart has also partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. In order to lower its costs of fulfilling online orders, Walmart has recently applied for a U.S. patent for a floating warehouse that can make deliveries via drones, and will bring products from the aircraft down to shoppers’ homes.Walmart has also undertaken many acquisitions to grow its e-commerce business. Since Jet.com acquisition in September 2016, the company has acquired four e-commerce businesses — Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth. Recently, the company plans to invest in online cosmetics startup Birchbox.Recently, Walmart announced plans to consolidate its U.S. operations in February 2017 to compete with Amazon. The retailer has also reshuffled its food leadership teams in July. These initiatives have helped in improving operations.If we look into the last six months’ performance, we note that Wal-Mart’s shares have rallied 14.7%, higher than the industry, which grew 9.6%. The broader Retail-Wholesale sector has increased 11.7% in the said time frame.Bottom LineAs we can see, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is making huge investments in e-commerce activities to compete with Amazon. It is also focusing on online grocery shopping and delivery as it is a booming industry worth $12 billion in the United States. Therefore, the initiative to allow customers to use their EBT cards to order food online will aid the company’s sales significantly. We believe the company will continue to make efforts toward this initiative to make it easier for food stamp receivers to shop online.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1113,KR,"Markets closed mostly lower on Thursday after Core CPI data came in above expectations, increasing the overall rate of inflation to just below the Fed’s target rate. This raised speculations regarding a possible rate hike in the near future and weighed on the markets. Meanwhile, Dow gained for the third successive session and registered its 38th record close on Thursday. The S&P 500 declined after the retail shares tanked. In a series of latest threat, North Korea threatened to raze both Japan and the United States with nuclear weapons after the U.N. issued fresh sanctions against the country.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,203.48, gaining 0.2%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.1% to close at 2,495.62. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,454.28, declining 0.1%. A total of 6 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.09-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.20-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 1.3% to close at 92.09.Dow Hits Another Record, Broader Markets End LowerThe Dow gained 45.30 points on Thursday to register its 38th record close for 2017. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) contributed to most of the gains for the blue-chip index, rising 1.4% and 2.6% respectively. Shares of Boeing gained after the company announced plans to expand production of its 787 Dreamliner jets to 14 units in a month by 2019. Boeing possesses a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy), whereas United Technologies possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped almost 3 points to end lower after the consumer discretionary shares tanked. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, five ended in the red, with consumer discretionary shares leading the decliners. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY) was down 0.54%. Such losses were incurred due to a slump in the shares of retail stocks. Shares of Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) and Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) declined 4.8% and 2.2% respectively, weighing heavily on the S&P 500.An Uptick in Inflation Raises Expectations of a Rate Hike by FedThe Core CPI surged 0.4% for the month of August as compared to the consensus estimate of 0.3% increase for the same period. High rents and surging gas prices increased the cost of living in the United States in August. Gasoline prices surged last month as an aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and the economists do not expect the prices to go down anytime soon.Moreover, the shelter index –– an index for measuring the cost of shelter –– swelled 0.5% in August, posting its biggest monthly increase since 2005. Economists commented that such an increase was the result of surging housing costs in the United States. Moreover, the core index rose 0.2% for the same period, logging its highest increase in six months.Such high increase in the cost of living bolstered the rate of inflation to 1.9%, up from 1.7%. This resulted in speculations regarding a possible rate hike by the Fed as the figures for inflation came in just below the desired 2%. Such speculations caused broad based losses for the market.Meanwhile, the cost of medical care decreased in August. The cost of medical care gained a paltry 1.8% in the last 12 months, also marking its smallest gain since 1965. Economists believe such a low rate of growth can be owed to declining payouts to doctors. Moreover, the uncertainty about the future of Obamacare also contributed toward the retarding growth rate of medical care costs.Fresh Threats Surface from North KoreaIn the latest rhetoric, North Korea issued fresh threats to both Japan and the United States on Thursday in the wake of new sanctions by the UN on the Asian country. In a clear-cut statement, North Korea vowed to raze both Japan and United States with nuclear weapons. Geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington have escalated in the past after the Asian country tested a series of its nuclear missiles, one of them flying over Japan’s Hokkaido.Trump Agrees With the Democrats Once AgainOn Wednesday night, top leaders from the Democratic Party stated that they had reached an agreement with President Trump to protect the children of illegal immigrant in the United States. This comes in exchange of improved security at the border; however, it does not include funding for the physical wall along the U.S. - Mexico border. However, Trump tweeted on Thursday that no such deal had been reached with the Democrats.Stocks That Made HeadlinesBrown-Forman Boosts Investment in Cooperage, Cuts JobsBrown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) has decided to invest $45 million in its cooperage located at MacLean Avenue in Louisville, KY, in order to manufacture high-quality barrels.

1114,KR,"The retail war is intensifying with the focus gradually shifting toward minimum delivery time of your groceries. In February, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) started offering two-hour Whole Foods delivery to its Prime members. And now Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) are following suit with same-day delivery services.Almost all retail giants are pumping in more money and either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race. With changing shopping habits, retailers are bent on minimizing the time between the actual placement of an order and its delivery. Needless to say, the gap between online and offline retail is fast disappearing and it’s only a matter of time when others jump the bandwagon.Amazon Shows the Way for Same-Day Delivery Amazon set the ball rolling by playing to its strength — a strong delivery wing — when it started offering free-two-hour delivery service from Whole Food stores to its Prime members in February. The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods that stocks a wide range of fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items (read: Will Amazon's 2-Hour Whole Foods Delivery Skew Retail Pitch?).It goes without saying that Amazon has been a pioneer in minimizing the gap between online and offline retail space. The company is pulling items from Whole Foods stores, packing them and getting the goods delivered by its own drivers. Moreover, it is all free and within two hours. This move is in a bid to explore and add novelty to the untapped online groceries market, and the Whole Foods acquisition was a giant leap toward this direction.Naturally, the idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient and the two-hour delivery service has certainly given Amazon enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target, Kroger, Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report). Understandably, same-day delivery is the need of the hour and Amazon’s recent initiative has not only made its rivals sit up and think, but also gear up for an ensuing battle.Walmart Fights BackBrick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Kroger and Target, which so long, in order to compete with Amazon, were stressing on increased investments in e-commerce, have perhaps realized that bridging the online and offline gap is the ideal way to compete. So, most of these companies are busy reallocating their investments to add muscle to their delivery service wing. Walmart recently announced that it will be expanding its delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of 2018, with orders fulfilled at more than 800 stores across the country and delivered to shoppers contracted through Deliv, Uber and other delivery contractors. Moreover, customers who order a minimum of $30 and pay a delivery fee of $9.95 will get their purchases delivered in four hours provided they order by 1 p.m. This definitely is a challenge to Amazon.Interestingly, Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth in the United States slowed to 23% in the fourth quarter, marking a sharp decline from 50% in the prior quarter. This is being viewed as a setback for investors. However, Walmart is hopeful of registering 40% growth in online sales this year, as it has plans of investing extensively in e-commerce, which is expected to drive organic sales by 40% in fiscal 2019. Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Kroger, Target Expand Same-Day DeliveryTarget too isn’t lagging. In December 2017, the company announced plans of acquiring grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 billion and using its technology platform to expand same-day delivery at Target Stores. And come Mar 29, Target and Shipt will start same-day delivery of more than 55,000 groceries and home goods, toys, electronics and other products in Baltimore and Washington. The company also expects to make same-day delivery available from most Target stores before 2018 end and for products in all of its major categories by the end of 2019.Much like Walmart and Target, Kroger too will be expanding its partnership with same-day grocery delivery service Instacart to offer home delivery from 55 central Ohio Kroger locations. The company currently offers home delivery in 45 markets, with Instacart partnering in 27 of those markets. Also, Kroger has plans of offering delivery in 100 markets by the end of 2018.In ConclusionNo doubt, Amazon has taken the retail landscape to a different level altogether with minimum delivery time and others following suit. According to NPD Group, about 7% of U.S. households bought groceries online last year. Among them, most prefer their orders delivered to their doors, while the rest pick up from the store. This certainly emerged as an area of prime importance for most retailers and major players are going all out to tap this same-day delivery service space.Moreover, according to Nielsen and the Food Marketing Institute, although only 23% of consumers in the United States buy groceries online, the next five-seven years is expected to see a whopping 70% preferring the same. So it may well be assumed that the same-day delivery space will heat up pretty soon.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1115,KR,"With Walmart Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) latest move to expand online grocery delivery services to more than 100 metro regions in the United Sates, there seems to be no stopping for this retail giant from bolstering grocery sales. The announcement follows the recent launches of various kitchen products and meal kits. Walmart is undoubtedly cashing in on every possible opportunity to strengthen foothold in the grocery space and ramp up delivery services.Boosting Grocery Delivery ServicesThe expansion strategy will enable Walmart to reach nearly 40% of the nation’s household, by the end of this year. Currently, this service is available in six markets. The initiative is expected to provide consumers with more accessibility to Walmart’s flourishing online grocery delivery services.Speaking of delivery services, Walmart’s efforts to enrich consumers’ experiences by providing easy shopping methods and seamless deliveries are quite praiseworthy. In fact Walmart’s warehouse unit — Sam’s Club — partnered with Instacart for providing same-day delivery services and improve sales of food products and everyday essentials. In earlier developments, the company acquired a delivery startup — Parcel, Inc. — which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Also, the company has been testing same-day deliveries with Deliv for quite some time.Further, Walmart’s grocery pickup services have been highly appreciated by customers, giving them the flexibility to order products on the go. With plans of adding close to 1000 stores by this year for providing such facilities, the company’s pickup services are expected to receive quite a boost. Moreover, the recent kitchen product launches, including a wide variety of meal-kits, are expected to benefit from improved delivery services.With such strong endeavors to bolster its position in the delivery services arena, Walmart seems to be striking the right chords when it comes to competing with big box retailers and more particularly with Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). In fact, similar ventures were also undertaken by Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which indicates widespread popularity for grocery delivery services.More Growth in Store?Notably, Walmart’s consistent efforts to accelerate online business resonate well with consumers’ fast-paced lifestyle. Apart from bolstering delivery services, the company has been taking several other e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances and improved payment systems to strengthen online operations. Additionally, the company is expanding its apparel offerings and has launched an online platform for furniture and home décor products. In fact, such relentless endeavors have aided Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales to soar 23% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Encouragingly, management expects U.S. e-commerce sales to soar nearly 40% year over year in fiscal 2019.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s strategies to continue augmenting its business size and operations have been raising investor’s optimism. Shares of the company have surged almost 25.1% over the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 19.4%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wrapping it up, the company’s ongoing strategies of expanding online services and achieving all-around growth strengthens its presence in the retail space. On that note, we expect Walmart to continue attracting more shoppers, deliver impressive performance, and sustain in investors’ good books.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1116,KR,"Stocks opened higher on Friday after the February jobs report came in ahead of expectations and cooled concerns about rising inflation. But as the latest employment numbers seemingly confirm the overall health of the U.S. economy, recent earnings results in the retail sector have started to raise questions about the state of consumer spending.For the most part, fourth-quarter earnings season was relatively strong. However, results in the retail space were somewhat mixed. Total earnings growth from the sector’s S&P 500 members broke 9% on the back of 9.6% higher revenues, which is an impressive trend.But of the 195 companies in our “Retail and Wholesale” that have reported so far, only 56% have managed to surpass earnings estimates—and over the past few days, we have seen disappointing reports from Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report), and more (also read: Kroger Extends Disappointing Week for Retail Sector Earnings Reports).The traditional earnings season is effectively over, but a few marquee reports—especially in the retail sector—remain to be released.

The pressure will be on the company after fellow “dollar store” retailer Dollar Tree failed to impress this week. DG is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share and revenues of $6.22 billion. This earnings results would be basically flat year over year, while the revenue projection would mark a 3.5% improvement.

Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report)Beauty retailer Ulta is expected to report its latest quarterly financial results after the market closes on March 15.

In retaliation, the European Union officially announced a three-way approach to hit back against such tariffs. The three major benchmarks ended in the green. Finally, initial jobless claims surged to their highest levels in the last six weeks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.4% to close at 24,895.21. The S&P 500 gained 0.5% to close at 2,738.97. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,427.95, increasing 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 6.9% to close at 16.54.

Per this law, fresh levies have been imposed on steel and aluminum. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the two countries. Also, the United States wants to discuss national security issues with both these countries.Further, referring to Australia as United States’ “long-term trading partner”, Trump stated that tariffs might be modified for the country along with a few others. Moreover, such tariffs have been imposed under a law which clearly allows any “action” in favor of U.S. national security. Officials from the Trump administration have stated that both steel and aluminum are important for the defense industry of the United States.European Union’s Retaliation to Trump’s TariffsIn a not so surprising move on Wednesday, EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström announced at a press conference that EU was ‘discussing’ about which U.S. products it would impose tariffs on if Trump levies hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.Ultimately, the EU officially announced a three-way plan of action to hit back against the latest tariff plan. First, the EU plans to move a case against the United States to the WTO, in cooperation with other trading members of the bloc. This would be done in order to protect industries within the EU from Trump’s tariffs. Further, Malmström stated that EU being an ally of the US in NATO forces cannot pose a national threat to America — which is principles on which the new tariff plan is based on.Secondly, the bloc would use WTO-allowed measures to fight tariffs it believes are unjust. Malmström made it very clear that any action would be taken in compliance with the rules and regulations established by the WTO and also stated that a trade war would not benefit any country.Finally, the EU also plans to impose duties and tariffs on goods imported from the United States. The body has come up with a provisional list of products that would be met with hefty tariffs once imported into the EU. If imposed, such tariffs would amount to an additional $3.5 billion for producers in the US.Economic DataOn the economic data front, initial jobless claims surged by 21,000 to 231,000 claims in the last week. The consensus estimate for the period was 221,000. This marks its highest level in six weeks.Stocks That Made HeadlinesKroger Meets Q4 Earnings, Beats Sales, Guides FY18After delivering positive earnings surprise in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) reported in line earnings in the fourth quarter.

1119,KR,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 28. While the company posted in-line earnings in the last quarter, the off-price retailer has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2% in the trailing four quarters. The company has been gaining from its robust efforts to attract traffic and drive sales, which have also helped it overcome hurdles related to escalated wage costs.TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Let’s see what’s in store this time.Factors Driving the QuarterTJX Companies has been witnessing year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines for over a year now. Notably, the top-line growth can be largely attributed to solid customer traffic, which is backed by the company’s impressive merchandise mix, along with the other sales-driving efforts. Further, strong merchandise margins reflect the company’s disciplined inventory management and strength of its off-price business model.Among the company’s sales driving efforts, we commend its focus on store expansion, e-commerce as well as marketing initiatives. During the third quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking its total count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017. Also, management remains encouraged by the initial response to its recently opened 3 HomeSense outlets in the United States and its first TK Maxx outlet in Australia. TJX Companies has also undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales by recruiting an experienced internet management team. The company’s e-commerce business Sierra Trading Post is also working toward growing its business. Moreover, TJX’s official website tjmaxx.com, accessible from tablets and smartphones, appeals to the young generation — the company’s main target consumers. TJX Companies plans to add more categories to the online shopping site and invest categorically in it to differentiate it from brick-and-mortar stores.Further, TJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) have been boosting traffic at stores. Its gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) also help the company to improve customer engagement. Further, in order to encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping of brands, the company is expanding its loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada. Together, these factors are likely to drive the company in the fourth quarter. Incidentally, during its third-quarter conference call, management stated that it began the fourth quarter on a strong note, with a solid inventory position and other sales-driving efforts keeping it well placed for the holiday season.Increased Costs Pose ConcernsHigh wage costs have been a hurdle for TJX Companies for a while now. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, higher wages dented the company’s bottom line growth by 1%, with its pre-tax margin going down by 10 basis points. Further, wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2% in fiscal 2018, which also remains a threat to the upcoming results.Final Thoughts & Q4 ExpectationsNevertheless, TJX Companies’ robust sales-boosting initiatives are likely to help the company overcome these hurdles and fuel growth. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings (excluding a nearly 11 cents benefit from an additional week in the quarter) in the range of $1.14-$1.16 per share, reflecting 11-13% increase from the year-ago period earnings. Wage increases are expected to hurt bottom-line growth by 1%, while currency is likely to positively impact earnings growth by 1%. The company expects consolidated comps growth of 1-2% in the fourth quarter.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.28, which shows a 24.3% surge from $1.03 recorded in the year-ago period. In fact, the company’s earnings estimate was revised upward in the last seven days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $10,821 million, up 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that TJX Companies is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

1120,KR,"Markets finished in the red on Monday following a decline in the shares of Walmart. A spike in yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note also increased fears related to a spike in inflation and weighed heavily on the broader markets. Consequently, the Dow and the S&P 500 snapped their six-day streak of gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1%, to close at 24,964.75. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.6% to close at 2,716.26. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,234.31, losing about 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 7.7% to close at 20.95.A total of around 6.79 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.48 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.98-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.05-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Walmart Weighs on the DowShares of Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) declined 10.2% on Monday after posting fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and revenues improved year over year and the latter also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, Walmart crushed its nine-quarter long trend of posting positive earnings surprise in the quarter. Also, rate of e-commerce sales growth declined sequentially in the quarter. This was Walmart’s biggest percentage decline in a single day since January 1988.Such an event weighed on the broader market and Dow in particular shed 254 points to finish in the red, ending its six-day streak of gains. Moreover, the blue-chip index also fell below its 50-day moving average.How Did other Major Benchmarks Perform?Walmart was also the biggest drag on the S&P 500.The S&P 500 declined 16 points to also snap six-day streak of gains. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, only one ended in positive territory. While the laggards were led by theconsumer staples sector, tech sector managed only meager gains. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) declined 2.3%, whereas the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) notched up only 0.1% on Monday.This marked the S&P 500’s first close in negative territory in the last seven sessions. Further, the broader index broke below its 50-day moving average. However, losses for Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) also weighed on the S&P 500. Shares of Target, Kroger and Kraft Heinz declined 3%, 4.2% and 3%, respectively.Meanwhile, Nasdaq 5.2 points to also finish in the red. Gains for the tech-laden index were rather broad-based. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Rise in Bond Yields Weigh on Equities After hitting its highest levels since 2014 last week, the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note surged to 2.9% on Monday. Further, the short-term two-year yield lingered around a nine-year high. Such a spike in interest rates stole the sheen off equity stocks and led to broad based losses for the equity markets.Moreover, a surge in interest rates also instilled fresh inflation-related worries among investors. A surge in interest rate is seen as an indication of a possible rate hike by the Fed as benchmark interest rate lead to a spike in inflation. Such an event dampened investors’ sentiments.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

1122,KR,"Benchmarks finished mixed on Wednesday as investors rotated out of tech stocks to financial stocks. Investors moved to financial stocks after both Yellen and Powell gave enough hint of a rate hike next month. Meanwhile, the second estimate of the U.S. GDP showed that the economy grew at its fastest pace in three years, which further boosted investors’ sentiment.  While the Dow posted an all-time record finish, the Nasdaq took a beating due to decline in tech stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 0.4%, to close at 23,940.68. The S&P 500 Index (INX) lost 0.04% to close at 2,626.07. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,824.39, decreasing 1.3%. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,467 to 1,340. On Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 1,478 to 1,270. The CBOE VIX increased 2.8% to close at 10.31.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Nasdaq tanked almost 88 points to end in the negative territory. The tech-laden index posted its worst single-day drop since Aug 17. Such losses were triggered after the investors rotated out of the tech stocks to financial stocks. Yellen’s comments that a burgeoning U.S. economy would pave way for the future of rate hikes encouraged the investors to move to financial stocks.Moreover, Powell had commented on Tuesday that he would continue to work toward raising interest rates at the same time as gradually unwinding the Fed’s humungous balance sheet. This also bolstered gains for the financial stocks.Shares of major tech players such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) all declined 4%, 2.7%, 2.1%, 2.4% and 5.5%, respectively.

Although, eight of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500 ended in the green, gains were negated by sharp losses for the tech stocks. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) declined 2.2%. Such losses for the tech stocks weighed heavily on the broader markets.Finally, the Dow amassed 103 points to close at a record high following better-than-expected GDP data in the third quarter. Such a stellar showing by the blue-chip index was also supported by gains for UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), shares of which increased 3.1% and 2.3%.U.S. GDP Exhibits Highest Rate of Growth Since 2014According to the second estimate, the gross domestic product of the United States expanded at an astounding 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017. This also marks it fastest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2014. Per the report from the Commerce Department, consumer spending, the biggest contributor to economic growth advanced 2.3% in the 3Q17. Further, spending on business equipment shot up 10.4% in the period, also notching up a three-year high. Meanwhile, corporate pre-tax profits have surged 5.4% year-over-year.However, some analysts stated that such figures are rather aggrandized and do not present a true picture of the health of the economy. They have reasoned that inventories accounted for as much as 25% of the GDP growth and if excluded from the calculation, the U.S. GDP stands at 2.5% annual rate of growth.In her final testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Janet Yellen commented that the economic growth is largely broad based “across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.” However, price data in the GDP report clearly indicated that inflation remained well below the targeted 2%.Economic DataThe Fed’s Beige Book report showed that the economy has expanded at a modest to moderate pace.

1123,KR,"Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 22. In third-quarter 2017, the company’s earnings met estimates. This provider of nutrition and weight management solutions has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 22.1% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.Herbalife LTD. Price and EPS Surprise  Herbalife LTD. Price and EPS Surprise | Herbalife LTD. Quote Soft Volumes Remains a ConcernHerbalife has been grappling with soft volumes for quite some time now, especially in its North American and Mexico operations. Unfortunately, the weak volume trend lingered in fourth-quarter 2017, as evident from the recently reported preliminary volume points data. Herbalife’s preliminary regional volume metrics reveal declines of 7.3%, 8.4% and 6.6% across North American, Mexico and South & Central American regions, respectively. Preliminary results for the upcoming quarter indicate sales volume point growth of 0.2%, 9.6% and 4.5% in its Asia Pacific, China and the EMEA regions respectively. However, the upsides were inadequate to offset the declines in the aforementioned regions. As a result, the company’s overall sales volume points went down 1.8%.As mentioned earlier, volumes have long been a concern for Herbalife. This was also witnessed in third-quarter 2017, wherein earnings and sales declined year over year due to soft volumes and adverse currency fluctuations. Volumes slid 5.6%, with North America suffering the maximum plunge of 16.1%. Volumes at Mexico tumbled 9%, while South & Central America and China witnessed volume declines of 6.8% and 3.5%, respectively. Mexico's volume was lower than expected in particular, owing to exposure to areas affected by earthquakes. Management stated that this natural disaster hurt Mexican volumes by 200 bps in the quarter and the impact also lingered in early fourth quarter.Final Thoughts & Q4 ExpectationsNevertheless, Herbalife continues to focus on implementing new technologies; shifting distributors’ inclination toward learning latest business methods, undertaking innovations and launching new products. Additionally, the company has been on track with its expense management efforts.Considering all factors, management projected adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter in the range of 84 cents - $1.04, during its third-quarter conference call. Excluding the currency impact, adjusted earnings are expected in a range of 80 cents-$1.00 per share. For 2017, Herbalife forecasted adjusted earnings in the range of $4.42-$4.62 per share.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 96 cents, which shows a 4% decline from $1.00 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. However, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,089 million, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model shows doesn’t conclude that Herbalife is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

1124,KR,"Thursday, November 30, 2017Tempting fate — it never fails to disappoint. Yesterday’s regular trading day, after I proclaimed nothing could get in the way of this latest leg of a bullish trading wave, things did. Market participants who’d been riding an enormous wave of technology looked at their year-to-date gains in companies like nVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), which had topped up 113%, and sold them off 10% yesterday. As for Bitcoin, I said nothing could stop it. Then one of its exchanges lost power, and the value of one Bitcoin fell more than $2000.Well, Bitcoin has since recovered a bit and nVIDIA is trading up in today’s pre-market. In fact, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all up ahead of today’s opening bell. This is because, profit-taking and machine malfunctions aside, the overall bullish narrative is intact: equities continue strengthening on solid economic metrics like the labor market, consumer confidence, etc. Oil prices are well above $50 per barrel today (with a newly minted OPEC deal just hitting the newswires this morning), and geopolitical strife — rhetoric between President Trump and Kim Jong-Un notwithstanding — is at a minimum.Ahead of today’s open, new Initial Jobless Claims came down even further: 238K claims last week is down 2000 from the upwardly revised previous week. This is solidly in the very healthy range of 225-250K we’ve enjoyed the past few years, temporary hurricane-related issues aside. Continuing claims, however, are creeping up even further: from beneath 1.9 million just weeks ago, this latest read of 1.957 million is the closest we’ve been to 2 million continuing claims we’ve seen in quite some time.Personal Income and Spending numbers also came in this morning, with the October headline of +0.4% one-tenth ahead of expectations. Spending reached +0.3%, in-line with analysts’ consensus. These figures show that growing consumer confidence in other metrics is indeed strengthening, which is paramount to a strong holiday shopping season. So we remain hopeful a strong Q4 in both earnings and GDP will be in the offing as of early next year.The markets can be expected to rally further should news from Capitol Hill regarding progress on tax reform/cuts be forthcoming today. Just the simple event of an actual vote on the Senate’s bill today could be interpreted as a good sign; if the GOP-led body knew they didn’t have the votes to pass it, they probably would not call the vote til next week. This would give leaders of the bill time to massage senators still in need of convincing. As of now it looks like a bit of a toss-up, with sentiment coming down on the pro-passage side.Finally, supermarket giant Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) reported fiscal Q3 2018 results during today’s pre-market: earnings of 44 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus by 4 cents, and revenues of $27.75 billion easily outpaced the $27.31 billion expected. The parent company of Mariano’s, Pick ’n Save, Ralph’s and others also upped its full-year guidance to $2.00-2.05, ahead of our expected $1.97. Shares of Kroger are up 12% in today’s pre-market.

1126,KR,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) were down nearly 10% in early morning trading Thursday after the grocery giant’s fourth-quarter earnings disappointed investors. As a result, Kroger added its name to the list of sluggish reports from the retail space this week, creating fresh volatility and caution in the evolving sector.Kroger’s Latest ResultsFor the fourth quarter, Kroger reported adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing nearly 19% on a year-over-year basis. Total quarterly revenues reached $31.03 billion, surpassing our consensus estimate of $30.83 billion and expanding more than 12% from the year-ago period.Kroger also said that same-supermarket sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.5%. The company now expects fiscal 2018 earnings per share in the range of $1.95 to $2.15 per share. Headed into the report, our Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for 2018 earnings of $2.11 per share (also read: Kroger Reports In Line Q4 Earnings, Sales Beat Estimates).Guidance on the low end of previous expectations and slightly-sluggish comps growth was enough to send investors into a panic on Thursday morning. Any concerns about the upcoming year will be exacerbated as competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers continues to heat up. Kroger is also facing margin pressure from rising commodity prices, increased freight costs, and higher wages.Recent Retail ReportsThis week’s reports mark the end of the traditional fourth-quarter report season, and overall, we have seen mixed results from the retail sector. Total earnings growth from the sector’s S&P 500 members broke 9% on the back of 9.6% higher revenues, which is an impressive trend.But of the 195 companies in our “Retail and Wholesale” that have reported so far, only 56% have managed to surpass earnings estimates. Meanwhile, the sector has witnessed 43 total negative estimate revisions recently, outpacing its 36 positive revisions.Interestingly, some of retail’s most-disappointing reports have come within the past few days. This week’s sluggishness started with big-box behemoth Target (TGT  -  Free Report), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on Tuesday. Target did manage to generate respectable comps growth of 3.6%, but investors ditched the stock. Shares of TGT are down almost 5% on the week.Wall Street also saw a concerning double miss from Costco (COST  -  Free Report) on Wednesday afternoon. The membership-based wholesale retailer reported adjusted earnings of $1.42 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by three cents. Quarterly revenues came in at $32.28 billion, lagging our consensus estimate of $32.72 billion.One of the week’s most-concerning earnings announcements came from Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report). Shares of the discount retail company crashed more than 15% shortly after the release of its Q4 report. Dollar Tree reported adjusted earnings of $1.89 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Meanwhile, same-store sales growth of 2.4% missed Street estimates.Dollar Tree was showing signs of strength over the previous six months, emerging as one of retail’s top picks over that time. Analysts pegged the company as an outperformer based on the presumed health of its core customer base: lower income families in suburban and rural areas. Investors will hope that Dollar Tree can shake of its weak quarter and rebound as its shoppers start to realize their new tax breaks.Bottom LineThe latest earnings reports from the retail sector underscore the multitude of challenges facing even its biggest names. Sure, tax reform will be a relief—but across the board, retailers are facing rising overhead costs and new competition.Want more market analysis from this author?

1128,KR,"A glimpse of The Kroger Company’s (KR  -  Free Report) share price movement reveals that it has plunged over 38% so far in the year compared with the industry’s gain of 7.9%. So what is behind the debacle? We have tried to ascertain major reasons that can be held responsible for the stock’s dismal show in the bourses. Definitely, management is not sitting idle and trying all means to pull the company out of the doldrums. Let’s analyze the stock.What’s Bothering the Stock?Margins at StakeStiff competition, volatility in food prices, aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic are making things tough for Kroger. The company’s shares came under immense pressure, after the news of Whole Foods Market buyout by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) spread through the market. The deal has helped positioned Whole Foods’ better against the likes of Kroger, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report).Analysts are looking at this mammoth acquisition as an amalgamation between online marketplace and physical stores that could bring a massive change in the retail industry going forward. In order to stay in the race, Kroger has to revisit strategies and prepare itself for more aggressive price war ahead at the cost of margins. Not surprisingly, Amazon has already initiated price cuts across various Whole Foods products.Waning Bottom LineThis is evident from second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line continued to decline year over year for the fourth straight quarter. After falling 4.7% and 7% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively, bottom line plunged 18.3% and 17% in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Nevertheless, the company continues to project fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $2.00-$2.05 per share down from $2.12 reported in the prior year. As a result, not much movement was noticed in the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98 and $1.99 for fiscal 2017 and 2018 has declined by 1 and 3 cents, respectively.Debt BurdenApart from the aforementioned reasons, Kroger’s debt level may also elevate investors’ concern. The company ended second-quarter fiscal 2017 with a total debt of $14,048 million compared with $12,420 million in the year-ago period. As a result, interest expense rose 19% year over year in the quarter under review, following an increase of 14.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and 11.5% and 16% in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively.We also noted that the company’s debt-to-equity ratio, which represents the proportion of debt and equity it is deploying to finance its assets, is displaying an increasing trend — 1.88, 2.09, 2.10, 2.19, 2.29 in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, and first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Higher debt level may adversely impact the company’s credit worthiness and make it more susceptible to the macro-economic factors and competitive pressures.Strategic Endeavors Nevertheless, Kroger remains well on track to boost market share by expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. We note that total sales grew 3.9% during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, following an increase of 4.9% in the preceding quarter and 5.5% in the final quarter of fiscal 2016.The second quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter of revenue beat. Top line continues to improve fueled by Customer 1st strategy, digital endeavors and recent buyouts. Excluding fuel center sales, total sales rose 3.8%. Digital revenue surged 126% on the back of ClickList. The company has over 813 ClickList and ExpressLane locations.Management continues to deploy capital to concentrate more on remodels, merchandising, and other viable projects. Kroger remains optimistic about the acquisitions of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products; Harris Teeter, a grocery chain, and the merger of Modern HC Holdings with Axium Pharmacy Holdings Inc., a specialty pharmacy. Kroger also acquired Roundy's, the grocery store operator.Given the pros and cons embedded stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1129,KR,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) plummeted after the company reported its second-quarter earnings on Friday morning. The grocery store giant’s big profit decline helped send much of the rest of the grocery industry down as well.Kroger’s second-quarter revenues jumped 3.8% to $27.6 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.4 billion. The company’s same-store sales, excluding Kroger's fuel centers, gained 0.7%. However, Kroger’s profits sunk nearly 8% to $0.39 a share, which missed our estimate of $0.40 a share.The biggest supermarket chain in the U.S. saw its margins shrink due to increased competition from other grocers, which forced Kroger to cut prices.On Friday, shares of Kroger dropped by nearly 10% to hit a new 52-week intraday trading low of $20.41. Kroger’s stock price was already down almost 30% over the last year. But the grocery chain remained positive, at least in the short-term, despite the increased pressure.""As our business continues to improve, we remain committed to delivering on our guidance in 2017 and believe we have the ability to grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018,” Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement.The bad news for Kroger is that it began slashing prices well before Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) acquisition of Whole Foods became official. And the e-commerce giant’s presence in the grocery industry might have contributed to Kroger’s decision to stop providing long-term guidance.“In this dynamic operating environment, we will continue to provide annual guidance as we have done for many years but will no longer provide longer-term guidance,” McMullen continued.Grocery Industry Amazon wasted little time lowering prices at Whole Foods, on everything from milk and cheese to meat, fish, and eggs.On top of cheaper groceries, Amazon’s move into the industry threatens to shake up how people shop in general. The undisputed online retail king’s purchase of Whole Foods has the potential to shift grocery shoppers to online ordering and delivery much sooner than if they had moved into the sector on their own.Kroger’s disappointing second-quarter results, along with the fear of increased competition from new players, helped send shares of Costco (COST  -  Free Report) down over 2% on Friday. Shares of Target (TGT  -  Free Report), which has a substantial grocery business, dipped by 3.68%.Shares of Casey's General Stores (CASY  -  Free Report) and Ingles Markets (IMKTA  -  Free Report) both fell by around 1.5%. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM  -  Free Report) saw its stock price dip 2.1%Weis Markets  stock sunk 4.77%, while shares of Smart & Final Stores (SFS  -  Free Report) and SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU  -  Free Report) plummeted 8.61% and 7.30%, respectively.Bottom LineNot all grocery store chains need to fear in the near-term, but if the industry does not begin to make changes to its business model soon, Amazon’s Whole Foods deal could make life a whole lot harder. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1131,KR,"In a time when the grocery shopping experience is undergoing a change, in audience, service, and merchandising, a name in the food retail industry is making quite the footprint: Aldi.Known for their limited assortment of products and discounted prices, Aldi opened their first store in 1954 in Essen-Schonnebeck, Germany by brothers Karl and Theo Albrecht. By 1960, the brothers had built the brand into a chain of 300 stores, and decided to split the business into two operations: ALDI Nord and ALDI Süd.Today, Aldi Nord operates 2,500 stores in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Poland, Spain, Denmark, and Portugal, as well as specialty grocery chain Trader Joe’s in the U.S.; ALDI Süd operates 1,600 stores throughout the U.S., Austria, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and Switzerland.While the company used to only provide a bare-bones shopping experience for the neediest customers, ALDI has evolved into a grocery store that combines contemporary design with on-trend merchandise, using its carefully crafted discount model to its advantage. Customers can buy almost everything they need at ALDI’s, from fresh produce and meat to wine and beer to even a selection of home goods.Now, shopping at Aldi is an experience, and its discounted selection is not just for the budget-conscious customer. It’s for anyone who likes paying less for their groceries.Expansive SelectionThe company has smartly expanded its product selection to include more specialty items under their Specialty Select house brand and merchandise catered to the health-conscious shopper, with private brands concentrating around gluten-free, better-for-you, and natural and organic products.Aldi has reconfigured its checkout selection, replacing sugary snacks with healthier items. For example, chocolates and candy bars will be swapped for single-serve packages of nuts, trail mixes, dried fruits, and granola bars.“By introducing healthier checklanes and through a number of other initiatives, we are doing our part to remove temptation at checkout and stocking stores with even more nutritious options,” said Jason Hart, CEO of Aldi.He continues, “At Aldi, we truly care about our customers, and we’re responding with guilt-free checkout zones and increased food options they can feel good about.”In addition to healthier checkout lanes, Aldi is increasing the amount of fresh food being offered, placing emphasis on produce, meats, and organic fare located on the perimeter inside of its stores over the packaged and processed foods located in their centers.The company is also ensuring that its dairy products are without artificial growth hormones, and its private-label offerings are free from synthetic colors, added MSG, and partially hydrogenated oils.This has allowed Aldi to increase its customer base to include those shoppers who would normally go to Whole Foods Market  or other specialty retailers.How Does Aldi Keep Their Prices So Low?By doing a number of things.One of the biggest reasons behind the company’s discount business model is that 90% of the products are Aldi-exclusive brands, letting the grocer provide high-quality product without the hidden costs of advertising and marketing usually associated with national name brands.Staffing levels are much lower than a typical grocery chain. Customers need to bring their own bags or can buy reusable bags at the store, and they must bag their own groceries as well. With the shopper doing tasks normally done by a store employee, Aldi saves a lot of money.There is a $0.25 deposit to use a shopping cart (you get it back at the end of your shopping trip), which allows the company to not have to hire anyone to police and round-up shopping carts.In a bold move, Aldi has product arrive at store locations in boxes that have one side missing, so that they can be put onto a shelf without having to be unpacked, thus saving the company the money of having to pay someone to stock shelves.Future ExpansionAldi is growing into an increasingly considerable threat to American grocery staples like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Whole Foods, and now Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), among other national and regional grocery store chains. Walmart even reportedly tested a “price-comparison test” in nearly 1,200 of its U.S. stores in the hopes of closing the pricing gap between itself and its competitors, including Aldi.Recently, Aldi announced it would invest $3.4 billion to expand its U.S. store count to 2,500 by 2022; the company currently operates about 1,600 stores in the country, and said it will add another 400 by the end of 2018. This will create 25,000 U.S. jobs. Aldi will also spend $1.6 billion to remodel 1,300 of its existing stores.The grocery chain also has plans to partner with Instacart, the popular online grocery delivery service. With the partnership, customers will be able to purchase their groceries online, including fresh fruit and vegetables, for delivery in as little as an hour. The service will be tested in Dallas, Atlanta, and parts of Los Angeles beginning August 31.And, the company’s top German competitor, Lidl, has plans to open its first stores in the U.S. this summer. Aldi and Lidl run very similar, no-frills, discount grocery shopping experiences, and together, they pose a serious threat to U.S. grocery stalwarts.Aldi’s discount model appears to be the way of the future. More and more customers across income levels are looking to pay less for grocery and household items, and with the demand for high quality and freshness on the rise, Aldi is creatively merging the two to create a cheap and unique shopping experience.5 Trades That Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today, Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

1132,KR,"After two straight quarters of in-line earnings, Whole Foods Market, Inc.  managed to post positive earnings surprise of 5.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The company posted adjusted earnings of 36 cents a share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents but came a penny below the year-ago quarter figure. Meanwhile, the top line improved 0.6% year over year to $3,725 million and also edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,721 million, marking the second successive quarter of revenue beat.However, the company witnessed a 1.9% dip in comparable-store sales (comps) during the quarter, following a 2.8% decline in the preceding quarter. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of comps decline. Analysts believe stiff competition, food price deflation, an aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic are the primary headwinds plaguing the sector.Nevertheless, Whole Foods, which accepted the $13.7 billion buyout offer of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), has been revamping pricing strategy, concentrating on value offerings and introduced a new store concept, ""365 by Whole Foods Market"", in view of heightened competition as more companies are expanding their presence in the Organic & Natural food business. These players include The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report), Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report).Whole Foods Market, Inc.

At one end it will allow the company to reach a wider customer base that prefer shopping online, while on the other end it will help lower procurement costs, given Amazon’s huge bargaining power. Not to forget, Amazon’s technological prowess could be of significant advantage to Whole Foods against peers – who are aggressively expanding their online presence – and could help lower operating costs.The buyout news propelled the shares of this Austin, TX-based company.

1133,KR,"On Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission finally approved Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) acquisition of organic grocer Whole Foods Market , ending an investigation to determine if the grocery deal would unfairly affect market competition.“Based on our investigation, we have decided not to pursue this matter further,” the Commission said in a statement late Wednesday. “Of course, the FTC always has the ability to investigate anticompetitive conduct should such action be warranted.”The FTC’s announcement came soon after Whole Foods’ shareholders approved the $13.7 billion deal in a meeting yesterday.With Whole Foods, Amazon will gain a much-needed footprint in the grocery business, securing a loyal customer base and a large number of stores (and future distribution centers); right now, the upscale supermarket chain as about 470 stores in North American and the United Kingdom.In particular, the U.S. grocery market has only grown more crowded over the years, though leaders like Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Publix , and even Costco (COST  -  Free Report) still dominate the space. But as European giants like Aldi and Lidl—and Aldi’s popular subsidiary Trader Joe’s—grow their stateside presence, the supermarket industry will only continue to get more packed (read more: Why Aldi is the Grocery Store of the Future).Though Amazon is undoubtedly the e-commerce king, it has a long way to go to take that title in the grocery business. Buying Whole Foods, however, is a good place to start.The merger is expected to close during the second half of this year. When customers will be able to utilize Alexa in their local Whole Foods store, that’s still to be determined.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1134,KR,"As another earnings season unfolds, it is time to reshuffle your portfolio but this time only to avoid adding stocks that have lower earnings beat predictability. Dodging these stocks will definitely minimize the risks to your portfolio. In today’s discussion, we are focusing on the Retail-Wholesale sector – one of the 16 Zacks categorized sectors –  in a bid to identify those stocks that do not fulfill our expected earnings beat criteria of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings Season So FarPer Earnings Preview, as of Jul 21, out of the 97 S&P 500 companies that have come up with their quarterly numbers, approximately 78.4% have delivered positive earnings surprises, while 72.2% beat top-line expectations. According to the report, earnings of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far are up 8.4% from the same-period last year, while revenues have increased 5.1%.Total earnings for the index are expected to improve 8.6% from the same period last year on 4.7% higher revenues. The report also indicates that the Retail-Wholesale sector is expected to record top-line growth of 3.9% but is likely to witness earnings decline of 0.2% this season.However, before zeroing in on the stocks, let’s have a look at all that is happening in the sector and how it is placed in the changing economic scenario.Changing Retail DynamicsThe retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. This shift in buying pattern has forced retailers to come up with innovative ways to market their products. Retailers who have responded quickly to it by staying ahead technologically stand in good stead.With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers including big-box ones are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels. They are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities.Sector’s Correlation with the EconomyThe Retail-Wholesale sector has not been an outstanding performer but it still holds some promise, given the favorable economic indicators. However, we understand that the space is not fully immune to global uncertainties, which could limit growth.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in raising buyers’ confidence. Consumer confidence, which ebbed some time back, took an unexpected “U” turn in June.However, the second straight month of slump in retail sales overshadowed steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration. U.S. retail and food services sales in June declined 0.2%, following a revised reading of 0.1% decrease registered in May.How to Identify the Laggards?Surely, not all retail stocks are going to beat or meet expectations. There will be some slow coaches. We can identify them before they report by combining our proprietary Zack Rank and Earnings ESP system. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) along with negative Earnings ESP have no or a very slim chance of outperforming estimates.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Portfolio Better Off Without These 5 StocksStay away from Urban Outfitters, Inc.

The company is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 15.Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) is another stock to shun. This provider of automotive replacement parts, accessories, batteries and maintenance items for cars, vans and sport utility vehicles holds a Zacks Rank #5 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.79%. The company is expected to come out with its second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 15.Don’t let your portfolio fall prey to The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of -2.44% and a Zacks Rank #5.

1135,KR,"lululemon athletica inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 6. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this yoga-inspired athletic apparel retailer will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.In the trailing four quarters, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.5%. Also, it has pulled off positive earnings surprise of 11.4% in the previous quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 52 cents, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 10.3%. However, the estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $611.4 million, up about 12.3% from the year-ago quarter.So far this year, lululemon’s share price has increased 3.6% compared with the Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 13.5%.Factors Influencing the Quarterlululemon is not immune to the challenges in the retail sector, which include stiff competition and volatile consumer spending patterns. In fact, the rise in competition has been a threat to the company’s margins lately. Management had earlier projected fiscal third-quarter gross margin to remain in line with the year-ago period level. While gross margin improved in second-quarter fiscal 2017, it was somewhat negated by higher markdowns stemming from the online warehouse sale.Further, the company anticipates SG&A expense to deleverage about 50 basis points in the fiscal third quarter, mainly related to the ongoing endeavors being undertaken to expand e-commerce business. However, third-quarter revenues are forecasted in the range of $605-$615 million, with constant dollar comps expected to improve in mid-single digits. Also, lululemon envisions normalized earnings (excluding the impact from iviva’s restructuring) for the quarter to lie in a band of 50-52 cents per share.We note that lululemon is well on track with its strategy for 2020. Through this plan the company aims to double its revenues to about $4 billion and more than double its earnings. Therefore, management had outlined four distinct growth strategies including product innovation, building store fleet in North America, expanding digital business and international expansion. Meanwhile, lululemon’s e-commerce growth initiatives and ivivva remodeling seem to bode well.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that lululemon is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

The company’s shares have increased 16.1%, while the industry grew 3.9%.Factors at PlayBrown-Forman’s strong performance can be attributed to its strong brand portfolio, efforts to expand globally, strategic initiatives and a robust outlook. Additionally, the company is poised to gain from industry growth trends.The company gains strength from its strong portfolio of premium American whiskey brands, along with its Jack Daniel's trademark. Brown-Forman anticipates growing on the back of strong demand for its authentic American whiskey brands worldwide, consumer interest in flavored whiskey and a growing trend in premium spirits. Its consistent focus on pricing, product innovation and expansion reinforce market position.Further, the company provided a robust outlook for fiscal 2018.     The company retained underlying net sales and operating income forecasts after posting solid first-quarter fiscal 2018. Also, the company raised earnings projections for fiscal 2018, reflecting reduced tax rate and diminished foreign currency headwinds.Additionally, Brown-Forman is confident of growth at its premium American whiskey and tequila brands.

1137,KR,"We expect American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 6. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.8%.In fact, this apparel retail chain surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.9%.American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether American Eagle will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 39 cents per share, reflecting a decline of 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $964.8 million, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 21.4%, while the industry grew 16%.Factors at PlayAmerican Eagle’s upsurge in recent months can be attributed to its much deserved triumph in second-quarter fiscal 2017. While the fiscal second-quarter marked the company's second straight quarter of sales beat, earnings topped estimates after a miss in the last quarter. The company also posted 10th straight quarter of positive comps on the back of strong online sales at both brands driven by efficient use of omni-channel capabilities to enhance customer experience.Further, the company is striving to develop omni-channel platform to reach customers in every possible way. Backed by these efforts and efficient digital marketing endeavors, American Eagle’s e-commerce sales contributed about 23% to total revenues in second-quarter fiscal 2017. Further, its new loyalty program, AEO Connect is likely to enhance customer experience.We commend American Eagle's focus on expansion, as evident from its plans to enter the Indian market. Moreover, the company remains committed toward enhancing store sales by rationalizing its brick-and-mortar store fleet that includes closing underperforming stores and expanding the profitable ones.Looking ahead, it remains optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2017, especially the fall season. American Eagle anticipates comps for the fiscal third quarter to range from flat to low-single digit increase.However, the company’s margins continue to be under pressure due to increased promotional activities to counter sluggish mall traffic, which is likely to persist in the quarter ahead. For the fiscal third quarter, the company projects soft merchandise margins due to intense promotional activities. Moreover, it anticipates SG&A expenses to increase in low-single digits.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that American Eagle is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1140,KR,"As the fresh food fad turned into a fully-fledged, multibillion dollar market, many began to call for the death of the fast-food industry. But while more people eat healthier than ever today, the fast-food market is still thriving.On the grocery side of things, nearly everyone knows that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) spurred further competition in the fresh food market with its purchase of Whole Foods. Meanwhile, grocery delivery upstarts like Instacart quickly secured deals with Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), and other large chains, leading to talks of a possible IPO.This competition has, in many cases, led to greater access to healthy eating options. Yet, for the most part, the cost is still far too high for a large percentage of the population to make healthy food a viable option.What’s more, fast-food chains remain a popular option for on-the-go eaters and low-income families. Restaurants and grocery stores are obviously not the same thing, but it has been interesting to watch fast-food giants continue to grow while access to healthier groceries became the norm.With that said, let’s take a look at three fast-food stocks investors might want to consider scooping up.1.       McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report)This historic fast-food burger chain can be found throughout the world, and it even tried to offer more healthy options along the way to expand its reach. Two weeks ago, McDonald’s reported that its full-year and Q4 2017 comparable store sales both climbed over 5.3%, which marked its best comps performance in six years. The company noted that this growth was driven, in part, by “tremendous progress” in its delivery and mobile order and pay business.McDonald’s is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is now projected to see its Q1 earnings surge by 14.29%, based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimate. McDonald’s is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of  9% over the next three to five years.2.       Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report)This pizza chain’s ability to constantly adapt to changing consumer habits, while also bolstering its online and mobile ordering, helped Domino's expand into one of the world’s biggest fast-food chains, now boasting 14,400 stores in over 85 international markets. Domino’s is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports “B” grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Investors should also note that Domino’s is expected to see its Q4 sales pop by over 10% to hit $903.2 million when it reports next Tuesday, Feb. 20. On top of that, the chain is projected to see its earnings soar 31.08% to reach $1.94 per share, based on our current estimates.Domino’s has met or topped earnings estimates in the trailing six quarters, and this streak seems poised to continue. The company’s current Earnings ESP is 1.06%, and paired with its high Zacks Rank, this means it is highly likely to beat Q4 estimates, as analysts seem to be more confident in Domino’s recently (also read: Earnings Season Ain't Over: 3 Stocks Likely to Beat Estimates This Week).3.       Sonic Corp. (SONC  -  Free Report)Sonic hardly holds a candle to the size of either McDonald’s or Domino’s, but this fast-food chain saw its first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings surge 25% last month. Sonic is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is now projected to see its earnings climb by 22.40% for the full year to reach $1.53 per share.Sonic is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 14.70% over the next three to five years.

1141,KR,"The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 30. In the trailing four quarters, it underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of roughly 0.8%. In the preceding quarter, the company reported negative earnings surprise of 2.5%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayA dominant position among the nation’s largest grocery retailers enables Kroger to boost market share by expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. We believe that the company's operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales and enhance return on invested capital. Per analysts surveyed by Zacks, identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel center sales, is likely to increase by 7.1% to $22,444 million during the third quarter.Kroger’s top-line has been also benefiting from Customer 1st strategy, digital efforts and recent buyouts. Third-quarter revenue is projected to come in at $27,307 million, up 2.8% year over year.However, stiff competition, volatility in food prices, an aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic remain the primary headwinds with which Kroger is grappling. Moreover, higher investments in new services and compelling pricing strategy may also hurt margins. We observed that the company’s bottom-line have been declining for quite some time now.After falling 4.7% and 7% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively, bottom line plunged 18.3% and 17% in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is currently pegged at 40 cents, a penny lower than the prior-year quarter figure.Kroger Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kroger Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kroger Company (The) QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Kroger is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

1142,KR,"Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) much-awaited acquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc.  has overcome two of its biggest hurdles.The pending deal has been granted an antitrust clearance by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Notably, FTC does not expect the deal to hurt competition in any way, and has thus given a nod to the deal. Also, the Whole Foods Market shareholders have approved the buyout.Importantly, these were the last approvals required to complete the merger. Subject to the remaining customary closing conditions, both the companies expect the transaction to close by the end of this year.Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. The company’s shares have gained only 27.8%, lower than the industry’s gain of 50.3%.DetailsIn June, Amazon inked a definitive merger to purchase a leading natural and organic foods supermarket, Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion. The all-cash transaction involves buying Whole Foods for $42 per share.The company recently announced a private offering of bonds aggregating $16 billion to fund its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc.On completion, Whole Foods will continue to operate with its current brand name and John Mackey will remain the CEO of the company. Amazon could likely become the fifth largest United States grocery retailer after Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Costco and Albertsons/Safeway.The deal gives Amazon an opportunity to leverage Whole Foods’ 460 stores across the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, 87,000 employees, and its solid reputation.Deal RationaleThe deal will open a window of opportunities for Amazon in the retail market. Online retail sales are expected to decelerate, while the overall retail market still holds a lot of potential. This might be because a large number of customers still prefer shopping offline and will continue to do so in the future. This is particularly true when it comes to grocery.Therefore, Amazon has been making moves to gradually merge online and offline retail. Amazon might add a few new offline and online features to Whole Foods’ stores in the future. The deal gives Amazon opportunities to leverage its resources and technological prowess to enhance shopping experience by cutting time and increasing convenience. This in turn could give it an edge over competing retailers.We believe that the acquisition will not only reshape the retail landscape but also help it counter competition, if it manages to get a first mover advantage.Bottom LineIn the face of slow e-commerce growth and mounting competition, Amazon is looking for ways to branch out to physical retail, a sizable brick-and-mortar footprint.So Amazon’s increasing transition from build-to-buy option is a clear indication of the company wanting to speed up its market penetration, expansion and competitive strategies.Although brick-and-mortar initiatives are relatively new, investors will see far more growth if Amazon could repeat its past success in this space. Everything that Amazon touches has been transformed to gold and its brick-and-mortar venture could well add another feather in its cap.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus  Amazon.com, Inc.

1143,KR,"The grocery industry has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. This transition in shopping pattern is compelling supermarket chains to rapidly adapt to changes in the ecosystem. These companies are left with no option but to keep pace with the changing retail scenario and focus more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities. It seems that The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) has taken the stock of the situation and is on its way to give itself a complete makeover.Kroger has been trying all means to overcome competition, which has intensified with the foray of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). The company is expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is also gaining traction. These endeavors are likely to fuel top-line growth. Analysts polled by Zacks expect fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 revenues to come in at $30.84 billion and $122.13 billion, reflecting an increase of roughly 11.7% and 6%, respectively.Kroger’s Strategy to Counter CompetitionThe company’s “Restock Kroger” program is gaining traction. Kroger commenced “We Are Local” campaign; launched and opened a new restaurant concept, Kitchen 1883; and added two new product lines under “Our Brands” — an apparel brand and a floral line, BLOOM HAUS. As part of the program, management is considering the sale of convenience store business, and expects to generate $400 million in incremental operating margin by 2020 and over $4 billion of free cash flow in the next three years. The company in collaboration with Chase Pay is offering mobile payments in select markets.Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations in Southern California. Kroger remains optimistic about the acquisitions of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products; Harris Teeter, a grocery chain, and the merger of Modern HC Holdings with Axium Pharmacy Holdings Inc., a specialty pharmacy. Kroger also acquired Roundy's, the grocery store operator.Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy that enriches the consumers shopping experience and convinces them of returning to the store is also benefiting the company. We believe that the company's operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales, alleviate gross margin pressure, improve operating margin and enhance return on invested capital.Per sources, Kroger is possibly mulling over purchasing America’s major online wholesaler — Boxed. The speculation is also rife about this Cincinnati-based company to acquire Overstock, an online retailer that offers home decor products and others.Wrapping UpKroger, which shares space with Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster performance and drive the stock further. In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have surged 38%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 20.7%.

1145,KR,"The Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector has depicted a marvelous bull run over the past year as evident from its surge of 33.4% compared with the S&P 500’s gain of 22%. Notably, Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao (CBD  -  Free Report) is a behemoth that has rallied 38.2% in a year’s time, outpacing the sector’s robust trend and performing nearly in line with the industry. On the contrary, this grocery retailer’s industry peers Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Carrefour SA (CRRFY  -  Free Report) lost 14.6% and 9.6%, respectively, whereas Tesco (TSCDY  -  Free Report) grew 15.5% in the same time frame.Coming back to Companhia Brasileira, the company remains vulnerable to macroeconomic uncertainties in the Brazilian market and stiff competition in the industry wherein it operates.  So, let’s look at the factors that drove Companhia Brasileira despite these hurdles and see if it can sustain this trend in 2018 as well.What’s Driving Companhia Brasileira?Companhia Brasileira has mainly been gaining from continued market share gains at its Assai and Multivarejo segments. Notably, Assai has been the company’s major growth driver for a long time and remained the highlight of its third-quarter 2017 performance as well. In fact, it marked Assai’s strongest quarter of combined volume and traffic growth in the recent times. The sturdy growth was driven by higher comps and contributions from new stores.Despite major food deflation in some key categories, Assai’s comps grew 7.7% on the back of improved customer traffic and sales volume. Further, this segment contributed about 43% to the company’s total food sales and witnessed market share gains of 330 bps year over year. Meanwhile, management remains committed toward converting Extra Hiper stores into Assai stores to optimize its portfolio. This clearly reflects robust prospects from the segment.  Additionally, the company has been gaining from improved volumes of Pao de Acucar and consistent recovery at Extra Hiper that have been boosting its Multivarejo segment. Evidently, Multivarejo same-store sales inched up by 0.6% in the third quarter, backed by volume recovery at the Pao de Acucar banner. Consistent growth of Extra Hiper (which retained the best banner performance) and continued market share gains also drove the quarter’s performance. Again, initiatives like My Discount program, Collect & Win promotional plan along with solidifying iconic products drove Pao de Acucar’s results.Together, these factors helped Companhia Brasileira’s third-quarter sales increase 8.1% (adjusted for calendar effect). Also, adjusted EBITDA improved 11.4% with the EBITDA margin expanding 20 bps to 5%, fueled by improvements at both Multivarejo and Assai. For 2017 too, management envisions the Food segment EBITDA margin of approximately 5.5% backed by greater profitability at both the divisions.Can Growth Sustain Amid Hurdles?Companhia Brasileira remains prone to the volatile retail landscape, which is consumer-driven and very sensitive to the health of the economy as well as constantly evolving trends. Macroeconomic challenges such as high household debt and unemployment levels may restrain consumer spending and impact the company’s business. Also, in the home appliances sector large multinational chains and other specialized Brazilian companies pose a threat to the company’s market share.Nonetheless, the company remains focused on enhancing its food business by making investments in Assai and Pao de Acucar that are yielding solid returns. All said, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company anticipates continued market share gains at both its segments.

1147,KR,"Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 14. Last quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the bottom line has missed the consensus mark in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 4.1%.Factors at PlaySignet Jewelers’ dismal holiday sales performance might weigh upon its performance in the fourth quarter. The company’s soft holiday sales results were primarily due to negative effect of the credit outsourcing transition and weakness at the UK Jewelry division. Furthermore, challenging retail landscape, aggressive promotional strategies and waning mall traffic were the other reasons behind lower-than-expected results. As a result, management issued a more conservative outlook for fiscal 2018. Signet Jewelers now expects earnings (excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform) in the range of $6.17-$6.22 compared with $6.10-$6.50 projected earlier. Earnings (including the impact of U.S. tax reform) are estimated to be in range of $6.45-$6.50. Meanwhile, the company continues to expect same store sales to decline by mid-single digits.Nevertheless, Signet Jewelers’ focus on effective cost management, digital marketing and higher e-commerce sales bode well. Total e-commerce sales in the holiday season surged 47.7% to $210.5 million from the year-ago period. Sharp increase in e-commerce sales were primarily driven by R2Net buyout. Additionally, in an effort to drive growth in the long run, the company has been implementing certain strategies including expansion in mid-market and the best in bridal segment. The company is also focusing on diversifying store base and opening more stores at off-mall locations.However, margins which have been declining since the past few quarters are likely to remain under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter due to rise in investment and promotional expenses.Signet Jewelers Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Signet Jewelers Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Signet Jewelers Limited QuoteZacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings BeatOur proven model does not show that Signet Jewelers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1148,KR,"International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) has taken another major step to strengthen its foothold in the blockchain market. The company recently announced a major blockchain collaboration with a consortium of food suppliers including Dole, Driscoll’s, Golden State Foods, Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), McCormick, McLane, Nestlé, Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report), Unilever and Wal-mart (WMT  -  Free Report).The setup is aimed at providing unaltered information to all members of the food supply ecosystem regarding the origin and the state of the food. This is anticipated to help members of the ecosystem quickly identify contaminated food products and their sources, thereby enabling the removal of products from store shelves faster and lowering the spread of illness due to food contamination.The consortium along with IBM will work together for the betterment of blockchain applications in the global food supply industry. Apart from consumer non-durables industry, blockchain technology is also finding takers in the finance, education, insurance and medical services industry.We believe IBM’s blockchain initiatives coupled with the rapid adoption of the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) platform Watson will help the stock perform better. IBM has lost 12.6% of its value year to date compared with 11.5% loss of its industry.Blockchain Technology and Its ApplicationsAlex Tapscott, co-author of the book Blockchain Revolution, compares it to the emergence of internet in 1993. He explains the entire system as “a vast, globally distributed ledger where anyone, anywhere can move, store and manage any kind of asset, from money and securities to intellectual property and votes”.Blockchain is a kind of a distributed database and works as an online ledger that cannot be altered or breached easily. Each block of information has its own timestamp and a link to an earlier block in the chain, which enables all the parties to have easy access to information via a secure network. Originally used for cryptocurrency transactions, the system is transparent and incorruptible.International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteWal-mart, which is also a member of the consortium, has been working with IBM since October for the purpose of tracking food movement. Per Reuters, in June, Wal-mart had stated that blockchain trials helped the company to cut down the tracing time of mango shipments from seven days to 2.2 seconds.We believe the emergence of this technology as an integrated enterprise level platform for the food supply chain will enhance the concept of food safety and traceability. This in turn will form a strong supply chain, with lower instances of monetary losses due to faster action in case of discrepancies.Zacks RankIBM currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1149,KR,"The grocery industry is going through a rough patch currently. The industry has grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotional environment. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, who are strengthening their franchises and are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Customers are also becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low-cost alternatives to national brands, which are hurting the food companies.The problems worsened when e-Commerce major Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced an all-cash $13.7 billion deal on Jun 16 to acquire the natural and organic foods supermarket chain Whole Foods Market Inc. . On Aug 28, Amazon closed the Whole Foods deal, following Federal Trade Commission’s approval last week.The deal’s impact can be clearly seen in lowered grocery prices of Whole Foods, creating apprehensions at several grocery store chains like Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report), Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report), Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report) of pricing pressure, squeezed margins and dwindling customers. It is also expected to further increase the competition in the industry.Given this backdrop, let’s try to ascertain which of these two key food players – Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) and McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report), is presently in good shape and can make for a better investment option. We note that both Sysco and McCormick carry the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), highlighting the fact that they are likely to perform in line with the broader market over the next one to three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sysco’s market capitalization is $27.4 billion, while that of McCormick is $11.8 billion. Going by its business size, Sysco is undoubtedly a winner. Though Sysco’s massive scale of operations better position it in the long term, short-term industry headwinds are likely to adversely impact both the companies.Business OperationsSysco’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters, which have been primarily attributed to its continued focus on acquisitions, volume growth, rewarding shareholders and margin improvement through cost savings. Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in Jul 2016 has benefited the company significantly.Sysco has also been impressively managing expenses since the past few years. The company is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain and as a result, the company achieved $417 million operating income growth since fiscal 2015 and remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of FY18.Though stiff competition and aggressive promotional environment remain a concern, Sysco’s efforts to boost sales and margins are paying up, as the company has delivered positive gross margins in the last nine consecutive quarters, after declining consistently for the last few quarters.Like Sysco, McCormick’s earnings have also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters, on the back of rising demand for spices, herbs and seasonings over the last few years. Product innovation, brand marketing support and expanded distribution, as well as pricing actions are also fueling sales growth. However, higher material costs remain its headwinds.Prices of raw materials such as vanilla, garlic, cinnamon, oregano and rice, as well as packaging costs have been steadily increasing, and thereby affecting McCormick’s margins. Though McCormick is working on its expense structure and remains hopeful to accelerate its margins in the remainder of fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.VGM ScoreWith the help of our new style score system, it is easy to pick the winning stocks. In order to screen out potential value stocks, we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A or B. However, if we consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #3, we should opt for a better grade.Sysco seems to outpace McCormick on VGM Score as well, as Sysco’s score of A is favorable than McCormick’s VGM Score of D. Hence, we should consider it a favorable investing option.Price PerformanceThe food industry has been struggling from quite some time now. However, the concerns aggravated after the Amazon-Whole Foods deal, which is well reflected in the share price performance of the companies as well as the industry. If we look into the last three months performance of these stocks, we note that while the industry declined 8.6% in the said time frame, shares of McCormick slipped 8.5% in the last six months. On the contrary, shares of Sysco declined 4.0% in the same time frame.Estimate RevisionsUpward estimate revisions are indicative of positive investor sentiment about a stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sysco has inched up 0.7% for fiscal 2018 and 1.4% for fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days, owing to its solid fourth quarter results. However, the same has gone down 0.3% for fiscal 2017 over the last 30 days for McCormick, reflecting negative outlook on the stock. Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up 2% for McCormick.Sysco’s earnings for the current fiscal year 2018 ending June 2018 are expected to grow 11.7%, while McCormick earnings per share are projected to grow at a lower rate of 7.7% in its current fiscal year 2017 ending November 2017.Valuation MultiplesNotably, Sysco has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 18.9, which compares favorably with industry’s average of 20.2 and S&P 500 average of 19.3. McCormick, on the other hand, has a higher forward PE of 23.4. So it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Sysco stock in the near term too, as you can see in the chart below:Valuation MultipleSYYMKCIndustryS&P 500P/E F118.923.420.219.3P/S0.52.71.93.1 If we look into another key metric Price/Sales ratio, we note that right now, Sysco has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is significantly lower than the industry average of 1.9 and S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.1 right now. On the contrary, McCormick has a P/S ratio of 2.7.The above arguments clearly states that Sysco is better pick investors.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

(KR  -  Free Report) and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report), dipped on Aug 28, after the deal officially came into effect. The deal was announced in mid-June. Losses spread across the food sector and shares of The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), Post Holdings Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and Treehouse Foods Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) tumbled as well.Traditional packaged food brands such as General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg and Conagra are already struggling, as consumers look for fresh foods and more natural brands over packaged and processed food.Kraft Heinz has been witnessing top-line weakness for the past several quarters. Its reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year in the first six months of 2017 due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. For Kellogg, net sales declined 3.3% year over year due to foreign currency headwind and weak volume (down 5.3%) as a result of unexpectedly soft consumption trends across most categories during the period. General Mills' sales too have declined 6.8% in fiscal 2017 and the company’s slowing organic volumes are overshadowing minor improvements in profit margins.That said, these major packaged food companies have been fighting the sales slump with consumer-focused innovation, marketing initiatives and robust restructuring savings.For General Mills, adjusted gross margin advanced 50 basis points or bps and adjusted operating margin increased 130 bps in fiscal 2017. Again, cost savings from its Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) have been supporting renovation, innovation, brand support and margins for Kellogg. Kraft Heinz realized cumulative savings of approximately $1.45 billion from its Integration Program as of second-quarter 2017.Amazon's foray into brick-and-mortar stores is now likely to step up fresh price wars for these companies’ products, both in stores and online. Amazon’s as much as 43% price cut on Whole Foods’ products on its first day as the owner of this organic grocer could be distressing for the entire food industry. Prices of a number of products, ranging from avocados to organic chicken, were cut.Bottom LineDespite traditional packaged food companies taking a number of initiatives to boost sales, the weakness in this area continues. Amid this uproar, how these food biggies deal with the latest Amazon-Whole Foods merger is a wait-and-see story.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.

1151,KR,"Shares of several grocery store chains, including Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market, dipped on Monday after Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) acquisition of Whole Foods  officially went into effect. The online retail giant’s $13.7 billion purchase of the organic grocer helped send rival grocery chains stocks plummeting last week after the FTC approval was finalized. One of the biggest causes of concern for fellow grocery stores, at least initially, was the fact that Amazon announced it would lower prices on many items at Whole Foods.“Everybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality – we will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market’s long-held commitment to the highest standards,” CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer Jeff Wilke said in a statement last week.“To get started, we’re going to lower prices beginning Monday on a selection of best-selling grocery staples, including Whole Trade organic bananas, responsibly-farmed salmon, organic large brown eggs, animal-welfare-rated 85% lean ground beef, and more.”Jeff Bezos’ company did precisely what it said it would. Amazon lowered a ton of prices at Whole Foods on Monday. The total price of a 15-item grocery purchase at a Brooklyn, New York-based Whole Foods fell by almost 23% on Monday, according to a Business Insider article.“Whole Foods + Amazon"" signs can now be seen throughout Whole Foods locations and new discounted tags labeled ""New Lower Price,"" are also widespread. Prices of items such as milk, cheese, meat, fish, eggs, and many more commonly purchased foods have also already been cut.Whole Foods is far from the biggest grocery store chain in the U.S., with only 470 locations. But the size and reach of Amazon has already enabled it to lower prices at the notoriously high-priced grocer over night. And investors continued to flee from grocery store stocks on Monday as the initial price cuts went into effect.Shares of Target (TGT  -  Free Report), with its large grocery business, dipped by 1.04%, while Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which owns multiple grocery subsidiaries, dipped marginally.Less well-known chain Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM  -  Free Report) saw its stock price crash 9.71%, while Ingles Markets (IMKTA  -  Free Report) sunk by 9.69%. SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU  -  Free Report) and Smart & Final Stores (SFS  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices fall by more than 2%, while Weis Markets  stock dipped by 1.60%.Bottom LineGrocery Store chains most likely don’t need to fear for their short-term stability or even viability. But, if the industry does not begin to make changes to their business models going forward, Amazon’s Whole Foods and its new lower prices could make life a lot harder—especially if investors continue to flee the allies.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1152,KR,"Today marks the closing of Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) $13.7 billionacquisition of Whole Foods Market , and the e-commerce giant has already implemented major changes in the upscale grocery chain.One of most noticeable changes customers will find is the arrival of Amazon’s Echo smart speakers, now available for sale in their local Whole Foods. The company, shown in the tweets below, has cleverly advertised the devices like one of Whole Foods’ “Pick of the Season,” and the Echo and Echo Dot are selling for the same price as what you’d find on Amazon.com. It's real, y'all. @WholeFoods @amazon pic.twitter.com/QiRBm2ulHe— Lauren Thomas (@laurenthomasx3) August 28, 2017 It's official pic.twitter.com/sJcCJNrt5b— Jason Del Rey (@DelRey) August 28, 2017Many have wondered how Amazon would integrate its Alexa-powered technology in Whole Foods stores, and selling Echo devices seems like a logical start.In addition to offering its Echo speakers in stores, Amazon has also been cutting prices on many of Whole Foods’ staples grocery items. These include everything from organic fuji apples, organic rotisserie chicken to bananas and organic avocados. Avocados, for example, fell to $1.99 each from $2.79, which falls in line with most other supermarket chains.According to Bloomberg, the marked down items were displayed with orange signs that said “Whole Foods + Amazon,” listing the old price and the new price, and the phrase “More to come…”.High prices have always held back Whole Foods in some way, earning the company the nickname “Whole Paycheck” and making it easier for other grocery chains like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), and Aldi to begin building their own successful organic and natural food reputations. But with Amazon now at the helm, Whole Foods can start bringing back those customers it may have lost over the years.""This is just the beginning – Amazon and Whole Foods Market plan to offer more in-store benefits and lower prices for customers over time as the two companies integrate logistics and point-of-sale and merchandising systems,"" Amazon and Whole Foods said in a press release last Thursday. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1153,KR,"SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 10, before market opens. This grocery dealer has a mixed record of bottom-line surprises in the trailing four quarters.Considering this, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents for the fiscal third quarter has been stable in the last 30 days and reflects an increase of about 37% from the year-ago reported figure.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,002 million for the impending quarter, up 33.3% from the year-ago quarter.SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SuperValu Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayAcquisitions & Partnerships: A Vital Growth DriverAcquisitions have been favoring SUPERVALU’s business growth for a while, particularly in the wholesale business segment. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the takeover of Unified Grocers in drove wholesale segment sales by 58% year over year. The company also holds supply agreements with retailers like Fresh Market Inc., America’s Food Basket and Marsh Supermarkets. Such agreements are expected to continue bolstering the company’s top line in the forthcoming quarters.Further, we note that SUPERVALU concluded the acquisition of Associated Grocers in December 2017. Going ahead, the company expects this Florida-based company to be a profitable inclusion to SUPERVALU’s wholesale business, given its strong customer and retailer base as well as presence in key international regions.Adapting With Evolving Consumer TrendsOrganic food products are becoming popular owing to rising health consciousness amongst consumers. Thus, the company has been evaluating prospects in the organic foods arena and has partnered with wholesale merchants to explore opportunities in this category.Apart from this, SUPERVALU also strives to improve omni-channel capabilities to resonate with the evolving consumer trends. In this respect, the company is on track with upgrading website and mobile applications to enhance consumer shopping experiences. Recently, the company signed a multiyear contract with Instacart to provide integrated store coupons and loyalty rewards at its e-commerce sites. Such efforts will augment SUPERVALU’s top line in the forthcoming quarters.Weak Retail Businesses: A Major HurdleDespite the above-mentioned upsides, SUPERVALU’s sluggish retail business is a concern. Competitive pressures and lower store traffic has been marring the segment’s performance, lately. Evidently, the retail segment has been facing identical store sales decline for the trailing 10 consecutive quarters.Unfortunately, management continues to anticipate retail business to reel under competitive pressures and price sensitivity. An aggressive promotional environment is also expected to dampen the company’s store sales in the retail segment. Companies such as ConAgra Foods (CAG  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) have also been facing stiff competition, thanks to the growing dominance of industry biggies such as Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).Though the company is undertaking robust efforts to improve retail segment’s performance, the aforementioned obstacles are likely to make the road bumpy. Additionally, the company is exposed to the risk of input price volatility.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that SUPERVALU is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although SUPERVALU’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -27.46% makes us less confident about an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1154,KR,"One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report). This is because this security in the Retail - Supermarkets space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Retail - Supermarkets space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 31 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.Meanwhile, Kroger is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm’s prospects in both the short and long term.Kroger Company (The) Price and Consensus Kroger Company (The) Price and Consensus | Kroger Company (The) QuoteIn fact, over the past month, while current quarter estimates have remained stable, current year estimates have risen from $2.01 per share to $2.03 per share. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is also a favorable signal. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Kroger. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1155,KR,"The grocery industry has been grappling with several challenges like stiff competition, and aggressive promotional environment of late. Traditional grocery rivals are strengthening their franchises and outside players are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples.Customers are becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low-cost alternatives to national brands. Food deflation had added to the woes over the last one year where oversupply in some types of food — particularly meat, poultry and dairy — dragged prices lower and forced grocery stores into more aggressive promotions. However, the scenario is now better with prices starting to increase.The biggest blow to the grocery industry came when e-Commerce biggie Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced an all-cash $13.7 billion deal on Jun 16 to acquire the natural and organic foods supermarket chain Whole Foods Market Inc. , citing pricing concerns. Shares of several grocery store chains tumbled on Aug 24 following Federal Trade Commission approval to Amazon to purchase Whole Foods.While shares of big box retailers like The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) declined 7.71% and nearly touched its 52-week low, Costco Wholesale Corporation fell more than 5%, Target Corporation dipped 3.99%. Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. shares declined 6.95%, while shares of SUPERVALU Inc. dropped 6.60%. On the other hand, Whole Foods’ stock inched up 0.72%.Amazon’s Deal and Its Impact on the Food IndustryAmazon will close the deal on Aug 28 and will acquire Whole Foods’ around 470 stores across the U.S., U.K. and Canada along with 87,000 employees and its solid reputation. Notably, the Texas-based Whole Foods deals in natural and organic offerings at a premium price, which is in contradiction with Amazon’s track record of keeping the prices low.So Amazon will lower the prices of Whole Foods’ as soon as the acquisition is completed, to lock in customer loyalty. Some of the items whose prices will be slashed include Whole Trade bananas, organic avocados, organic large brown eggs, and kale and other organic food. The company also announced certain Whole Foods products will be available through Amazon.com, AmazonFresh, Prime Pantry and Prime Now.With Amazon’s huge cash balance and expansion capabilities, we believe such acquisitions can change the retail landscape and ward off competitors. Amazon’s move to lower grocery prices has been met with apprehension at grocery stores and supermarkets as they may experience pricing pressure and lose customers. Some investors also worry that Amazon's deal would squeeze profit margins in an industry already known for stiff competition and tight margins.The entry of Amazon has caused a disruption in the grocery segment and has made investors skeptical of investing in the industry. However, not all food companies are underperforming. There are still quite a few food stocks which are poised to grow and investing in them will be a prudent move.How to Pick the Best Stocks?With the help of our new style score system, we have identified four food stocks that have excellent prospects and seem to be unaffected by this deal. Such stocks also boast a VGM score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Prominent ChoicesBased in Ridgefield, Connecticut, The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. (CHEF  -  Free Report) is a distributor of specialty food products in the United States. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B. The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 19.00%, which also makes it a viable investors’ choice.Investors can also count on Chicago-based Ingredion Inc. (INGR  -  Free Report), which is an ingredients solutions provider specializing in nature-based sweeteners, starches and nutrition ingredients. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.00%.Coming to the share price movement, Chef’s Warehouse has rallied 12.9% over the last six months, while Ingredion grew 1.5%. On the other hand, the industry declined 7.0% in the same time frame.We also suggest investing in Sanderson Farms, Inc. (SAFM  -  Free Report), which is engaged in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken products. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.Another chicken company which warrants a look is Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report). The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B.If we look into the share price movement, we note that while Sanderson Farms has rallied 45.5% in the last six months, Pilgrim’s Pride grew 38.9%. Both the stocks outperformed the industry, which gained only 5.9% over the said time frame.Bottom LineWe believe that investing in these companies should safeguard your portfolio in the short term and yield higher returns amid food industry concerns.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1156,KR,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) wasted no time after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved its acquisition of Whole Foods and initiated reorganization. Its first move in this regard was one that the company is famous for – price cuts.The retail highflyer announced on Thursday that the most awaited acquisition will close on Monday, Aug 28.Amazon shares weren’t much affected by the news and dropped 0.58% at the end of the day’s trading. The stock has gained a noteworthy 27% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 49.6%.Chain of Events On Jun 16, the company announced that it has inked a definitive merger agreement to purchase Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion or $42 per share in an all-cash transaction.On Aug 15, the company announced a private offering of bonds aggregating $16 billion to fund the acquisition.On Aug 23, the deal was granted approval by the FTC and Whole Foods’ shareholders.Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteWhat Next?Starting Monday, a selection of best-selling staples from Whole Foods will be sold at lower prices across all its stores, with more to be added going forward.After certain technical integration, Amazon will link its Prime loyalty program with Whole Foods, offering members with special savings and other in-store benefits.Amazon.com, AmazonFresh, Prime Now and Prime Pantry will sell Whole Foods’ private label products including Whole Foods Market, Whole Catch, Whole Paws and 365 Everyday Value.Select Whole Foods Market stores will have Amazon Lockers to allow customers to get products shipped from Amazon.com to local Whole Foods Market stores where they can pick up or return them to Amazon.This is just the beginning and we expect much more to come.Should Retailers Hit the Panic Button?The acquisition must have struck fear into the hearts of all retailers, the ones across the United States in particular. Grocery stores, operate under razor thin margins and thus are going to face extreme difficulty in coping with Amazon’s aggressive price cuts.Amazon, on the other hand, has never hesitated to sacrifice margins to pursue its long-term objectives - bringing more customers under its umbrella and giving them reasons to stay. Since it generates significant cash from operations and holds a huge cash balance, management has the flexibility to take risks.Amazon’s bold move will surely compel food and retail companies to revisit their strategies and prepare for more aggressive price wars. Shares of grocery giants Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), and Target (TGT) tumbled 8%, 6.6, 5% and 4%, respectively on Thursday.Lesser popular chains such as Ingles Markets (IMKTA), Smart & Final Stores (SFS), Weis Markets (WMK) and Casey's General Stores (CASY) fell 3.5%, 2.8%, 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively.Has Amazon Found a Way to Counter the Challenges?The deal stands to disrupt the retail landscape by significantly expanding Amazon’s customer base. It opens up opportunities for Amazon to innovate with retail.Amazon has been testing waters with innovations such as drive-in-grocery delivery service (AmazonFresh Pickup - order groceries online and collect them from a store nearby) and “cashier-less” stores (Amazon Go – the company’s first brick-and mortar grocery store). It has also added online and offline features to its bookstores.Amazon might add those features to Whole Foods’ stores in the future. It has started to mindshare in the grocery space.Notably, the deal opens up doors for Amazon to do a lot more with Prime. Prime saturation is apparent in the U.S. mainly because of its concentration in high-income households.But now, with prices at Whole Foods lowered, Amazon is in a position to lure entirely new demographic segments (lower and middle-income group) to its loyalty program and generate increased sales. Prime members spend much more than non-Prime members and help in repeat sales of not just general merchandise but also media.Currently. Amazon holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1157,KR,"Shares of several grocery store chains, including Kroger and Costco, tumbled on Thursday after Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods became official.DealThe Federal Trade Commission finally approved the online retail behemoth’s purchase of the organic grocer, which was first announced in mid-June. The FTC determined Amazon’s acquisition passed U.S. antitrust laws, shortly after Whole Foods’ shareholders formally approved the $13.7 billion deal.“Based on our investigation, we have decided not to pursue this matter further,” the Commission said in a statement late Wednesday. “Of course, the FTC always has the ability to investigate anticompetitive conduct should such action be warranted.”Initial PlansAside from adding roughly 470 organic grocery stores in North America and the United Kingdom to its ever-growing list of diversified assets, Amazon wasted little time in making its initial Whole Foods plans known.The Texas-based chain grew in popularity because of its wide selection of natural and organic offerings, but they often came with steep price tags. So naturally, one of Amazon’s first major steps, which will begin as soon as Monday, is to lower Whole Foods’ prices—and soon, it will make Amazon Prime the grocery store’s customer rewards program.“Everybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality – we will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market’s long-held commitment to the highest standards,” CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer Jeff Wilke said in a statement.Lost In The Super MarketWhole Foods is far from the biggest grocery store chain in the U.S., and its deal with Amazon will not change that—at least not in the foreseeable future. But the FTC approval sent investors fleeing from grocery store stocks as long-term disruption in the grocery sector seems possible, if not inevitable.Shares of Costco (COST  -  Free Report) fell by over 5% on Thursday, while Target, (TGT  -  Free Report) with its large grocery business, dipped by 3.99%. Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which also owns multiple grocery subsidiaries, share prices tanked by 7.71% and nearly touched its 52-week low.Less well-known chains such as Casey's General Stores (CASY  -  Free Report), Weis Markets (WMK), and Village Super Market  all saw their stock prices fall by over 1.60%. Shares of Ingles Markets (IMKTA  -  Free Report) fell by 3.54%, while Smart & Final Stores (SFS  -  Free Report) dipped by 2.76%.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM  -  Free Report) saw its stock price crash 6.95% and shares of SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU  -  Free Report) dropped by 6.60%.Whole Foods  stock gained 0.72%, but Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) stock price took a hit and closed down 0.58% on Thursday (also read: Here's The Reason For Amazon's Recent Stock Pullback).Bottom LineGrocery Store chains don’t likely need to fear for their short-term stability or even viability. But, if the industry does not begin to make changes to their business models going forward, Amazon’s Whole Foods and its new lower organic food prices could make life a lot harder—especially if investors continue to flee the allies.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.
