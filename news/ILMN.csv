35,ILMN,"One big challenge of swing trading is that when market turmoil hits, you generally have less cushion to ride out the storm. Shorter-term trading requires quicker action on the defensive side but also justifies being on offense by taking profits methodically on the way up.Take Illumina (ILMN), a stock originally under consideration on Nov. 22 (1). It broke out of a short consolidation that was part of a larger consolidation, with resistance just above 214. Volume came in at the highest level in 10 days (1), but since the resistance went back further we were looking for volume above its 50-day average. Being the day before the Thanksgiving holiday, light volume wasn't unusual, but still warranted waiting for heavier trade.On Nov. 27, after the holiday, the stock came out strongly on volume more than twice its average (2). That earned Illumina a spot on IBD's SwingTrader. By the day's close, the stock was already up nearly 2% from our entry. That type of early lead usually indicates a winning trade, if you can handle it right.Three days later, Illumina hit the 5% profit goal and we took half profits at 230.63. That's our offense. Booking the profits early protects your trade from potential sharp drops that could threaten your overall gain. As it turned out in this case, that profit-taking transpired less than 10 cents from the top (3).As is customary, we also raised our stop to a 1% profit level from our entry. Once we've seen solid gains, we don't want to let them wither away. That's our defense.A couple days later, markets got a scare. An erroneous report came out that Trump top national security advisor Michael Flynn's guilty plea to the FBI would also implicate the president concerning contacts with Russia during the campaign.  The market reaction threatened to take away profits in our trades, and we focused on defense by locking in those gains. We didn't wait for a breach of the raised stop but took profits on the remaining position while we still had a 1.7% gain (4).Markets and Illumina recovered ground by the end of the day, but turmoil continued the following day (5). For those that were still in the stock, rather than taking the early profit, a breach of the raised stop at 221.85 demanded attention. While profits were lost, it was certainly better than the day's close at 213.45. The lows of the day breached the original stop loss and there was no reason to let a good trade go bad. As it stood, our profit for the entire trade averaged out to a respectable 3.3% in five days.There was also no reason to waste time holding the stock and hoping for a comeback. A month later, Illumina is still below our final exit price and our original entry (6).More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:A Rule To Prevent Good Trades From Going BadTaking Profits Early Is A Key Tenet Of Swing TradesHow Much Trading Volume Is Enough In Swing Trades?Swing Trading Strategies And Lessons

Stock market futures were positive Tuesday and at least mixed on Wednesday before the open.Twenty-one stocks with Composite Ratings of 95 or above that trade at least $8 million in shares fell below their 50-days on Wednesday. That includes chip plays ASML Holding (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX) and NXP Semiconductor (NXPI). All-star winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their runs.These 21 stocks reflect the ongoing shift from top-rated, mostly tech names as a new stock market correction has taken hold. Splunk (SPLK), Workday (WDAY) and 58.com (WUBA) are among the top stocks dropping below their 50-day.That action also reflects why the S&P 500 and especially the Nasdaq were under more pressure Wednesday, while the more ""old economy"" Dow Jones just edged lower.The list in some ways downplays the damage that growth stocks have suffered. These 21 stocks don't include Amazon, which has a Composite Rating of 87. They don't include Square (SQ). Square round-tripped an early March breakout on Wednesday, but closed just above its 50-day. And they don't include Nvidia (NVDA). Nvidia was a catalyst to Tuesday's stock market sell-off that triggered the correction call. Nvidia crashed through its 50-day on Tuesday, tumbling nearly 8%. The chipmaker slid 1.85% on Wednesday.Let's take a look at ASML Holding, Lam Research and NXP Semiconductor. In addition to these names, Microchip Technology (MCHP), MKS Instruments (MKSI) and Analog Devices (ADI) also are among the 21 stocks. Chip plays led the stock market upswing but have been notable losers over the past several sessions.Chip-gear makers ASML Holding and Lam Research fell 3% on the stock market today, falling enough to invalidate recent buy points. Early Tuesday, Lam Research briefly retook a double-bottom buy point at the open, but soon reversed. ASML came within a whisker of moving back into a buy zone Tuesday before its own reversal. Those reversals, along with similar action from some other chip-gear names, were a bearish sign for leading stocks Tuesday before Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled and Facebook (FB) renewed its ongoing crash.NXP Semiconductor plunged 4.3% to 116.26, crashing through its 50-day line and approaching its 200-day for the first time since Qualcomm (QCOM) agreed to buy the automotive- and wireless-chip maker in late September. Qualcomm reportedly is having trouble getting China's approval for the NXP deal. Last month Qualcomm raised its takeover price to $127.50 a share from $110 to satisfy key NXP investors.Other stocks on the list include Green Dot (GDOT), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), Canada Goose (GOOS), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Ilumina (ILMN).YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Techs Drive Stocks Into Bear Territory?In Market Correction, Look For Stocks Like Lululemon With These 3 TraitsThese 5 Tech Standouts Are Making A Round Trip From Breakouts

42,ILMN,"U.S. stocks remained broadly lower at midday Tuesday in what appears to be a perfectly normal pullback after stunning gains earlier this month. Commodity plays helped pace the downside as agricultural chemical, oil and gas exploration, oil drilling, metal ores and steel shares fell hard.X Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell for the fourth time in five sessions. At 165.94, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap is now 4% below its 50-day moving average, which flattened out last week. Gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 have now been squeezed to 3.4%, and shares are down more than 5% from the 176.34 buy point.Apple's 1.2% slide weighed on all three major indexes, with the Nasdaq composite down 0.9%, the S&P 500 off 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average sinking 1.3%.At least eight of the 30 components within the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 points or more, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM) and McDonald's (MCD). Yet even with Tuesday's decline, at 26,198 the Dow stands 8.3% higher since Jan. 1.McDonald's posted a 19% jump in adjusted fourth-quarter profit to $1.71 a share. But sales dropped 11% to $5.34 billion, the biggest year-over-year drop since the first quarter of 2015.Nevertheless, shares of the fast-food icon have performed well since clearing a long saucer with handle at 130.10 in late March, rolling up more than 38% from that breakout point. As seen on a weekly chart, it continues to hug its slowly rising 10-week moving average (painted in red in all IBD and MarketSmith charts).On Monday, the Nasdaq notched its third distribution day, or instance of heavy professional selling, and its second in four sessions. Keep track of the distribution count for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 by reading The Big Picture column on a daily basis.

When a stock has gained 10% or more following a sound breakout, a good rule of thumb is to sell shares for a small profit to prevent a complete wipeout of gains. The stock can always be bought back when market conditions improve.From a longer-term point of view, however, Apple is still acting just fine.On Jan. 6, 2017, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. By Jan. 18 of this year, shares rose as much as 52.5%. Over the same period, the Nasdaq composite rallied 32%. The S&P 500 also trailed, rising 22.9%. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 14.5%.Over that ascent, Apple survived normal-looking sell-offs that sent shares temporarily below the 50-day moving average in June and September. Notice on a long-term weekly chart how Apple did not venture too far below the 10-week moving average, which moves in similar form with the 50-day on a daily chart.Elsewhere in the stock market, investors sought to accumulate shares in select names in business and medical software. Workday (WDAY) rose more than 3% to 120.75 in volume running nearly double its usual levels. The stock is now slightly extended after breaking out of an eight-week cup with handle at 114.98.Find the correct buy point in this pattern by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, which is 114.88.Paycom Software (PAYC), which also excels in the HR and payroll automation and outsourcing markets, erased mild early losses to edge slightly higher. At 92.69, the Oklahoma City-based firm has gained 7.5% after a Jan. 12 breakout past an 86.20 entry in a good flat base.Defensive industries including hospital, nonalcoholic beverages, soap and meat rallied.Back to the downside, Pulte Group (PHM) gapped down and dropped more than 3% to 32.18 in active turnover. The stock closed below its 50-day moving average on Monday for the first time since a breakout past a 24.53 buy point in a flat base in June 2017, marking a key sell signal.The homebuilder reported a 27% rise in Q4 profit to 85 cents a share, matching the consensus view. Revenue rose 12% to $2.79 billion, missing the Thomson Reuters estimate.A large number of Pulte's industry peers have also slid sharply below their 50-day lines, including NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH) and Toll Bros. (TOL). But a few reversed nicely off their lows, a good sign.After a healthy breakout and substantial price run, a sharp undercut below the 50-day line and failure to recover back to the support line is a key IBD defensive sell rule to help you preserve your profits.As a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rate policy began on Tuesday, bond traders did not seem to actively seek bargains even after the recent sell-off in Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond is currently at 2.71%.The 3-month Treasury paper has a yield of 1.42% and the 2-year note a yield of 2.12%; thus, the yield curve continues to maintain a positive slope.The Building sector ranks No. 3 among 33 sectors as ranked by mid- and long-term relative price performance as of the latest IBD Weekly print edition. However, the sector is also down more than 2% since Jan. 1, so it's actually severely lagging the broader market. See the entire sector rankings via the stock research tables inside IBD Weekly (beginning on page B5) as well as by going to IBD Data Tables in ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com, then clicking on IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.Key earnings reports after the close on Tuesday include Illumina (ILMN), Align Technology (ALGN) and Electronic Arts (EA).Illumina, the expert in genetic data analysis equipment, is expected to post a 44% jump in Q4 profit to $1.22 a share. That would mark the biggest year-over-year increase since a 72% gain in the first quarter of 2015.In the prior four quarters, Illumina showed a 5% EPS increase, declines of 11% and 5%, and a 14% gain.Illumina, down just 0.5% to 240.40 in light turnover, has rallied in steady stair-stepping fashion after breakouts past a 12-week flat base at 189.58 on Aug. 2, 2017, and from a base-on-base breakout past 214.44 on Nov. 22.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis of breakouts, growth stocks, and financial markets.)RELATED:Can You Really Spot Major Market Tops?

The buy zone in Illumina goes up to 269.58, 5% above the 256.74 entry.Illumina showed a rocky reaction after issuing first-quarter results April 24. Earnings leapt 127% to $1.45 a share as revenue rose 31% to $782 million. The big EPS jump was no doubt helped by an easy comparison as earnings sank 11% in the year-ago quarter. However, the results reaffirm a bullish trend. In the first two quarters of 2017, Illumina posted two straight quarters of falling profits. But profit then rose 14% and 69% in the third and fourth quarters of the year, respectively.The average EPS increase in the past three quarters: a healthy 70%.The Street sees second-quarter earnings going up 35% to $1.11 a share.Illumina is part of the research equipment and services industry group within IBD's medical sector. The group ranks a dismal 116th out of 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance, according to Friday's list. But the relatively small group of 27 names also holds four more companies that trade at least 10 a share and show a Relative Price Strength Rating of 85 or higher.The four other firms are Bio-Techne (TECH), Natera (NTRA), Medpace (MEDP) and Icon (ICLR).Mastercard, a leader in the credit card and debit card payment processing apace, edged up for a sixth straight session. Shares notched a new all-time high of 189.52 and are still within the proper buy zone after the large cap drove past a 183.83 buy point in a seven-week flat base.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on top growth stocks, chart action, and financial markets.)RELATED:Finding Top Growth Stocks, Fast: A Peek Inside IBD 50Stocks Near A Buy ZoneHow Does Illumina Compare With Its Industry Peers?

59,ILMN,"Amazon (AMZN) has a history of choppy profits, but late Thursday the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant delivered yet another quarter of accelerating earnings growth and revenue gains. IBD 50 stocks SVB Financial (SIVB), Twitter (TWTR), Mastercard (MA), SolarEdge Technolgies (SEDG) and Illumina (ILMN) also boast at least two quarters of faster sales and earnings growth.Amazon is not an IBD 50 stock but it already boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. The Composite Rating combines several proprietary IBD ratings into a single score. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their big runs. SVB Financial and SolarEdge Technologies also have 99 Composite Ratings. Twitter and Mastercard have 98 CRs while Illumina boasts a 97 CR.Accelerating earnings growth is an extremely bullish trait. Ultimately earnings drive stock gains. Faster profit gains show that a company has real momentum. The faster sales growth suggests real demand, not just cost-cutting or accounting games.Amazon reported earnings per share of $3.27, more than double analyst forecasts. Year-over-year, EPS rose 121%. That was the third straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth after 40% in Q4 2017, 0% in Q3 and -78% in Q2. Sales growth accelerated for a fifth straight quarter, sprinting 43% to $51.04 billion.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBeing able to ramp up growth rates despite massive size is especially impressive. And Amazon isn't done. Looking to Q2, analysts see a massive 485% EPS gain.Of course, Amazon could have had solid, consistent profit growth years ago, but CEO Jeff Bezos focused on efforts to boost sales and market share. That's paying off. After recently revealing that Prime memberships have topped 100 million worldwide, Amazon said Thursday that it will hike its Prime fee $119 a year.Amazon stock shot up to a record 1,638.10 Friday morning, but faded to 1,572.62. Intraday, Amazon cleared a 1,617.64 cup base buy point but closed below that level. It did settle above an alternate entry from a 1,568.62 flawed cup-with-handle pattern. But investors probably should wait for the stock to move back above Friday's high as a buying opportunity.Keep in mind that Amazon is in a very late-stage base, after several big moves in recent years. Late-stage breakouts are less likely to be big winners and more likely to fail outright.Amazon fell 0.4% to 1,566.13 on the stock market today.The social network early Wednesday reported adjusted earnings of 16 cents a share, up 129% vs. a year earlier. Twitter's earnings growth has accelerated for 5 straight quarters, from -31% to -22% to 0% to 11% to 73% to 129%.Revenue rose 21% vs. a year earlier to $655 million. It was the best sales gain in two years, and the fourth straight quarter of improving year-over-year changes.Twitter shares shot up before Wednesday's open, but the stock quickly fell sharply in the regular session after CEO Jack Dorsey warned that growth would likely slow later in the year.The stock fell 9% last week to 29, well below its 50-day line as it works on a consolidation.Twitter rose 4.5% to 30.31 on Monday on a new content and advertising deal with Walt Disney (DIS).SVB Financial, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, late Thursday reported 90% earnings growth as revenue leapt 34% to $575 million. The $3.63 EPS was 50 cents above estimates while revenue was $39 million over views.SVB Financial's earnings and revenue growth have accelerated for five straight quarters. Silicon Valley Bank's parent also raised full-year guidance, citing faster growth in loan and deposit balances and net interest income.Unlike Amazon or Twitter, SVB Financial did not pare or reverse its initial post-earnings gains. The stock shot up 19% to 305.61 on Friday, gapping beyond a seven-week cup base entry of 271.89, MarketSmith analysis shows.Because SVB Financial opened at 300, more than 5% past the standard entry, that's a breakaway gap. A breakaway gap opening price is an alternative entry point.SVB sank 2% to 299.61 Monday.The credit and debit card giant has reported two straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth and three quarters of faster sales growth, with year-over-year gains 33% and 20%, respectively.Mastercard's streak may be coming to an end. The card giant reports May 2. Analysts expect EPS to jump 25% to $1.26 on revenue up 18% to $3.25 billion, which would be strong but decelerating growth.Shares of Mastercard are trading within a flat base with a 183.83 buy point. The stock closed Friday 175.94.Mastercard rose 1.3% to 178.14, back above its 50-day line.Mastercard rival Visa (V,) also an IBD 50 stock, reported better-than-expected earnings last week, with EPS and revenue growth accelerating from the prior quarter.Visa cleared a 125.54 flat-base buy point on Thursday, closing Friday at 126.01. Visa rose 0.7% to 126.91 on Monday.For Visa and Mastercard, recent trading history suggests that pullbacks to the 50-day or 200-day lines are better entries than traditional buy points from breakouts.Illumina has enjoyed four straight quarters of improving year-over-year earnings growth, trending from -11% to a 127% gain reported last week. Revenue growth has sped up for four quarters as well, from 5% to 31%.Shares initially fell on Illumina's earnings, but rallied to close the week at 244.47, above their 50-day line. The genomic testing machine maker is in a flat base with a 256.74 buy point.Illumina fell 1.4% to 240.93 on Monday.SolarEdge Technologies has had three quarters of strong accelerating earnings growth, from -29% to 166%. Revenue growth has picked up momentum for the last four quarters, with a 70% gain in the last four periods.The Israel-based company distributes solar power-harvesting components, like power optimizers and inverters, to solar companies.The stock is well extended from a Feb. 15 breakout following the latest SolarEdge earnings report. Shares have consolidated for the past few weeks. The stock closed Friday at 53.10, finding support at its 50-day line in the past few sessions.SolarEdge dipped 0.85% to 52.65 on Monday, closing below its 50-day line for the first time since Feb. 13.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Squeeze: Why The Stock Market's Bull Run Faces Its Biggest Threat In YearsFutures Rise Amid 3 Big Mergers; Apple Hits This Dubious MilestoneLululemon Leads These 5 Retail Stocks You Should Be WatchingIBD 50: The Big Lesson For Investors In 2018Payment Giant Visa Breaks Out On Earnings As Peers Make Bullish MovesApple, Tesla, Alibaba Earnings; Facebook Holds F8: Investing Action Plan

60,ILMN,"With nearly four months' worth of stock market action in 2018 now in the rear view mirror, the major indexes' story has been this: We let nice gains slip away.The lesson for investors? Don't let your gains do the same.The S&P 500, a 19% gainer in 2017, is down only a touch since Jan. 1. But the large-cap benchmark lost a more than 7% advance during the first 4-1/2 weeks of trading this year.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund is also down mildly this year. The road has been bumpy for months. Just days ago, the ETF stabbed below its 200-day moving average for the third time since Feb. 9.So far, the ETF has managed to rebound after the two prior tests of the long-term support level. But many stocks in the IBD 50 and outside this list have failed to reach new highs.Earnings and sales have shown robust increases, as seen in first-quarter results hitting equity traders' computer screens these past few weeks. But the market always looks ahead, and it always has something to consider and evaluate. Lately, the sharp rise in yield for the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond appears to be a front-burner issue.A new bull market in crude oil prices and the possibility of accelerating inflation also deserve prominent space in the current market picture.As an IBD-style investor, you'll want to always adjust your holding and selling strategy when the overall market shifts. Right now, with the current outlook at ""uptrend under pressure,"" taking profits more quickly is a smart strategy. If your stock is up, say, 15% from a proper buy point but is showing signs of fatigue, you can at least sell half the shares and keep watching.The longer you've played the game of buying on breakouts in good markets and sitting patiently for the stock to hit the 20% to 25% profit goal, the more likely you've seen a stock come up so close, then retreat fast.In other cases, some IBD 50 names act as if the 20% profit level is merely a pit stop. Indeed, in recent years, scores of high-quality growth stocks have risen 30%, 40%, 50% or even more past a proper buy point before sinking into a real correction. When you have supreme conviction and the overall market is healthy, go ahead and sit longer on your winners.But Casa Systems (CASA), which has occupied a spot in the IBD 50 for months, illustrates the importance of not being too greedy.The specialist in software for the cable and telecom markets debuted on the Nasdaq at 13 a share on Dec. 15, formed a very narrow IPO base in February, then broke out past a 22.60 entry on Feb. 27. On that day, the market was in a confirmed uptrend, thanks to a follow-through rally. Less than four weeks later, Casa hit a high of 34.21, up a stout 51%.Taking at least some gains turned out to be sound portfolio management. Casa cooled off and tried to clear a faulty cup base that lasted just four weeks. On April 24, shares plunged nearly 12% and undercut the 50-day moving average for the first time on news of a share offering. Two days later, Casa priced 7 million shares at 25 each. The share float was 20 million.Casa is also likely getting knocked by news that Charter Communications (CHTR) reported worse than expected results in video subscriber losses.Here's a quick look at some other IBD 50 names' recent action.Abiomed (ABMD): It's holding up fine after fading after a breakout past 304.38 in a new flat base. The base is late stage, a key risk. Keep in mind that the gains from a March 2017 breakout at 120.99 have hit 150%.Smart Global (SGH): Made a round trip after rising past a buy point in March and catapulting over four weeks. The stock made a sharp retreat, even after earnings roared 652% higher to $1.73 a share in the quarter ended in February. Revenue rose 83% to $314 million.Illumina (ILMN): A base next to a base is forming. Clear resistance is seen near 250.Viper Energy Partners (VNOM): Is not giving much back after it cleared a base with a 26.29 buy point. Gains have so far hit 13% amid a new bull run for crude oil prices.You can trade the IBD 50 in one click with Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY), managed by Innovator Capital.

65,ILMN,"Many exchange traded funds pared their year-to-date gains as the stock market sold off during a highly volatile week. Top performers held names like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Illumina (ILMN).X What caused the rout? Brett Ewing, chief market strategist of First Franklin, cites three key causes that likely woke up the bears:As a result, the drubbing was bound to happen, he says.List Of Top Performing ETFsFirst Trust Launches New Blockchain ETF To Meet DemandTop ETF Picks For 2018""The sell-off was way overdue and a healthy occurrence for a market that just beat a 90-year-old record for trading days without a 5% sell-off — it's pretty hard to do too much complaining,"" he noted in a Thursday report. ""On bullish sentiment, we're looking at data point after data point telling us that the populace is no longer worried about the economy, making them as brave as they have been over a decade for risk appetite.""First Franklin has been increasingly shifting its portfolio into late cycle plays such as materials, commodity, industrial and infrastructure.Among ETFs, there has been some shuffling of leadership in the past month within the various categories.A new name, ERShares Entrepreneur 30 (ENTR), topped the U.S. diversified stock category. The three-month-old fund, which tracks the Entrepreneur 30 Index, has attracted $61 million in assets. The new offering from EntrepreneurShares uses a rules-based methodology to select publicly traded entrepreneurial companies.All 30 stocks in the index are large caps, mostly from the consumer discretionary, information technology and health care sectors. The complete holdings will be disclosed on a quarterly basis in its SEC filing. Its year-to-date return of 5.3% through Feb. 7, according to Morningstar Direct, is well ahead of the S&P 500's 0.4% gain. ENTR carries a 0.49% expense ratio.A familiar name came in second: iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM), with a 3.2% YTD gain. The $7 billion fund tracks the MSCI USA Momentum Index. Information technology led the sector weightings as of Feb. 7 at nearly 38% of assets, followed by 21% in financials, 16% health care and 15% industrials. Its top five holdings: JPMorgan (JPM), Microsoft (MSFT), Boeing (BA), Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC) accounted for roughly 24% of the portfolio.A pair of First Trust funds, First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 (FV) and First Trust Dorsey Wright Dynamic Focus 5 (FVC), took third and fourth with respective gains of 3.2% and 3.1%. FV, with $2.6 billion in assets, holds five First Trust sector and industry-based ETFs that Dorsey, Wright & Associates think could outperform others in the selection universe.

81,ILMN,"When looking at annual returns for the year, it would be a mistake to think they come at a steady rate. More often, the year is punctuated by fits and starts. The job of a swing trader is to capitalize on the upswings and sidestep the pullbacks.What's made the last year challenging is that defensive action on pullbacks often saw immediate rebounds to new highs. However, if you didn't take defensive action, you left yourself exposed to sector rotation. That could leave you with the wrong stocks as the indexes were making new highs.Taking a look at the action of IBD's SwingTrader over the last few months illustrates the point. Our current trades shrunk considerably as the Nasdaq composite spent time below its 5-day moving average and dipped below its 10-day line in mid-November. Skechers (SKX) was already on as a current trade, but the list expanded more aggressively starting on Nov. 16 (1). Scientific Games (SGMS), Illumina (ILMN), and United Rentals (URI) were good for some quick gains before the index started pulling back on Nov. 29 (2). Our defensive selling accelerated on Dec. 1 (3), a morning plagued by headlines that later proved to be false.On Dec. 7, the buying started again in earnest (4). Getting in early at these reversals, rather than waiting for new high ground, has been critical to staying in phase with the market. While some quick profits were booked in names like RingCentral (RNG) and Kennametal (KMT), there were some small losses as well, like Netflix (NFLX). But, as the market pulled back starting on Dec. 19 (5), two things occurred that were noteworthy. First, the pullback was very orderly and slow to give up its 10-day moving average. Second, several stocks set up, triggered buys and made progress during this time.Take Diamondback Energy (FANG). There were many constructive chart patterns forming among oil explorers and producers as the Nasdaq hit new highs. Diamondback Energy stood out because of its strong earnings record and relative strength. While the market pulled back slightly, it made significant progress.On Jan. 2 (6), the Nasdaq celebrated the New Year by starting a fantastic run of 8.4% the first few weeks. SwingTrader added names aggressively early on. The backdrop helped boost our confidence. Diamondback Energy was already up 7.8% from its entry by the start of the year. We also booked a few quick profits from stocks like Weight Watchers (WTW) and Mastec (MTZ) during the pullback. Whenever you start from a position of strength, you have the flexibility to push a little harder. We still employed profit-taking rules to nail down gains along the way up. The reversal on Jan. 16 (7), sparked some loss cutting and profit taking and on Jan 23. (8), another round of selling occurred, as the index seemed extended.The SwingTrader product has a list of every past trade. What is immediately recognizable is that strings of profits see intrusions of losses periodically in times of market weakness. Keeping that list overwhelmingly green requires more names in a favorable market and quick action when it isn't.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Recent swing trading articles on stocks noted above are available on Skechers, Illumina, RingCentral, and Diamondback Energy.Stock Market Follows Newton's Laws In Swing Trades Swing Trading Strategies And LessonsSwing Trading Webinar

97,ILMN,"OraSure Technologies (OSUR) stock was setting up a cup-with-handle formation Thursday after unveiling a hepatitis C contract with a foreign government likely to add $16.6 million in 2017 sales, Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro estimated.In late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, OraSure stock rose 1.5% to 8.55, defying a down day for tech stocks in general. Shares remain about 7% below a 9.14 entry point, but are up 31% over the past 11 months. IBD's 121-company Medical-Products industry group, up 15% this year, fell 1.5% Thursday, on a day most tech and drug groups fell.Massaro kept his buy rating on OraSure stock but boosted his price target to 11 from 10 following the company's analyst day on Wednesday. OraSure didn't identify the foreign government, but said three other governments are expected to order 100,000 hep C test kits. He upped his 2017 sales view to $137 million and his model for earnings per share ex items to 25 cents from 19 cents. The consensus of five analysts polled by Thomson Reuters currently models $126.8 million and 19 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and drug stocks initially rose on Donald Trump's election, helping pull up several related ETFs. ETFs are often a proxy for their broader markets. Visit the ETF Center for the best bets under a Trump presidency.""Basically, all of our raised 2017 revenue estimate is related to the announcement that OraSure officially completed its large $18 million HCV and HIV order with a large international government that seeks to eradicate hepatitis C in its country,"" Massaro wrote in a note.The contract is for $18 million in product for a testing and treatment program to eradicate hep C within the country by 2020. OraSure will provide $16 million of OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody tests and $2 million of OraQuick Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody tests.Outside the hep C/HIV win, OraSure announced personal genomics firm Helix will use saliva DNA-collection devices by OraSure subsidiary Genotek in an exclusive contract. Massaro classifies Helix's decision as a major platform win for OraSure.Helix was formed in 2015 by Illumina (ILMN) to provide individual sequencing at affordable prices. It's backed by Warburg Pincus, Kleiner Perkins and others. Over the next three years, Massaro expects the firm to add thousands of new customers and perform more than 1 million tests.""For OraSure, we think Helix could become a $10 million-plus revenue-per-year customer in around five years,"" he wrote.Besides Helix, OraSure announced it is also working with China-facing companies, including WuXiNextCode, WeGene and Genesis Healthcare.But OraSure didn't announce a replacement to AbbVie (ABBV), which is withdrawing from its hep C co-promotion agreement with OraSure at the end of this month.

The company is slated to release full Q3 results after the close Nov. 1.The preannounced miss a year ago sent shares falling 11% in the next day's regular trading session.A year ago, then-CEO Jay Flatley said in a statement that: ""Demand for sequencing consumables and the HiSeq family of instruments remained strong during the quarter, while instrument sales in the desktop family underperformed our expectations.""Illumina promoted Francis deSouza to CEO in July, with Flatley becoming executive chairman.Illumina stock had broken out of a cup base at a 182.77 buy point last Monday. Shares had risen more than 30% since July, helped by a reported $30 billion buyout offer from Thermo Fisher.IBD'S TAKE: Though Illumina's breakout a week ago will almost surely prove to be a failure, plenty of breakouts pan out. There were six stocks breaking out Monday, in fact, as you could learn at IBD's MarketSmith.RELATED:Analysts Unconvinced Thermo Fisher Will Look To Acquire Illumina

99,ILMN,"Illumina (ILMN) stock crashed 25% Tuesday after the company late Monday again preannounced a big Q3 revenue miss and forecast weak Q4 revenue.The gene-sequencing giant has preannounced disappointing financials before, including a year ago.In a research note Tuesday, Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro said ""we spoke to the company, who is still searching for answers to explain the miss, but does know the weakness was driven by a shortfall in the U.S. from its 2500/4000 line, followed by one fewer HiSeq X system deal (an X5 or an X10), likely from China, in our view."" The HiSeq genome sequencing systems can cost in the millions of dollars.The weak Q4 outlook is U.S.-related, Massaro wrote, which ""is troubling,"" and since Illumina was ""trading at the loftiest valuation among its peers in the space, a reset in its multiple is sensible,"" he said in cutting is price target on Illumina stock to 135 from 165. He maintained a hold rating.Illumina stock fell to 138.99 in the stock market today. Shares earlier touched a three-month low of 133.80, all this after a now-failed breakout at 182.77 on Oct. 3.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) ETF, which includes Illumina as a major holding though the company isn't a biotech, fell 3.8% Tuesday, dragged down by Illumina. IBB is the flagship biotech ETF.Late Tuesday, the company said it expects revenue of about $607 million, up 10% from the year-earlier quarter. Illumina had guided to sales of $625 million to $630 million, and analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $628.1 million, up 14%. The company said Q4 sales would be flat or up slightly from Q3.""The shortfall in quarterly revenue was driven by a larger-than-anticipated year-over-year decline in high throughput sequencing instruments,"" the company said in its press release.The company has relied too much on X10 sales to China, Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said in his research note Tuesday, but he maintained a hold rating and 152 price target on Illumina stock.Muken pointed out that he had cautioned about capital spending uncertainty and said the negative preannouncement ""should not come as a major surprise (albeit stock was clearly hoping 3Q would be less of a challenge given recent 20% run),"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: As Illumina illustrates, earnings time can be shaky time for stocks, as big misses or beats can send shares flying or plummeting. It's a good idea to get ahead on expectations by keeping on top of IBD's Earnings Preview.RELATED:Biotech ETFs Swoon, Hurt By IlluminaIllumina Again Preannounces Revenue Shortfall

100,ILMN,"Stocks were moderately lower early Tuesday as Alcoa (AA) kicked off the third-quarter earnings season with an earnings miss, but Apple (AAPL) was a beneficiary of more bad news from Samsung.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average showed losses of around 0.6% to 0.7%. Volume was tracking lower on the NYSE but higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Monday.Medical research equipment, steel and oil stocks led the downside in the stock market today, while solar, telecom and department stores outperformed.Alcoa gapped down and slumped 6% in heavy trade, falling back below its 50-day moving average and nearing its 200-day line.

101,ILMN,"Thanks to a Gilead-Kite merger, biotechs had a big week. They've also rallied this year and over the longer haul.XThree of the top four health sector ETFs ranked by year-to-date returns through Aug. 29 were biotech-focused, according to Morningstar Direct. The top performer, SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI), posted a 36.4% gain, well ahead of the S&P 500's 10.8% advance.The ETF, featured in Monday's ETF Leaders column, broke out past an 82.48 flat-base entry Thursday and remains in buy range. Shares ran up 13% from a June breakout from a flat base to the start of the just-cleared pattern. The fund, launched in January 2006, has $4.15 billion in assets and bears a 0.35% expense ratio.Coming in second is First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech (FBT), with a 31.4% YTD gain. The ETF is in a buy zone from a breakout past a 121.02 flat-base entry. The 11-year-old fund, which tracks the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index, has attracted $1.14 billion in assets. It carries a 0.56% expense ratio.It counted among its top holdings as of Aug. 30 Kite Pharma (KITE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Illumina (ILMN). Kite gapped up and soared 28% on Aug. 28 after Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced that it's buying Kite for $11.9 billion. XBI, mentioned above, also got a boost from Kite.IShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI) took third place with a 22.6% YTD return. The ETF recently regained its 50-day moving average line as it shapes a flat base with a potential 169.90 buy point. The $1.40 billion fund, which marked its 11th anniversary in May, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead Sciences has been in the news lately due to its Kite Pharma acquisitions.

102,ILMN,"Stocks extended their losses Tuesday afternoon amid heightened North Korea-related geopolitical tensions.XSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) tumbled 1% each, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gave up 0.7% in the stock market today.Emerging markets led the downside as iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) sank 1.4%.

SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) lost nearly 3% each.The recent stock market pullback continues to create new opportunities for investors to buy equities.First Trust U.S. Equity Opportunities (FPX) was featured in the Aug. 3 ETF column as it moved closer to its 50-day moving average line. A solid rebound off the support line could have set up a chance to buy. But it fell below the 50-day a few times over the next two weeks.Since then, it not only made up all the lost ground but has come back to score an all-time high as the market has rebounded. That shaped the right side of a flat base, which FPX cleared Friday. It slipped below a 61.55 entry during Tuesday's market sell-off. The ETF gained 6% from a late-April flat-base breakout to the start of the most recent pattern.The $867.3 million fund, which tracks the IPOX-100 U.S. Index, was launched in April 2006. The IPOX-100 is a market-cap-weighted index of the 100 largest and most liquid U.S. initial public offerings. It puts a 10% weighting cap on all component stocks and is reconstituted on a quarterly basis.The biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 30 were: technology, 21%; health care, 19%; consumer cyclical, 15%; and financial services, 13%, according to Morningstar Direct. Top holdings included AbbVie (ABBV), Kraft Heinz (KHC) and PayPal (PYPL).FPX has outperformed the broader market with a YTD gain of 14.1% through Aug. 31 vs. the S&P 500's 11.9% return.

The ETF bears a 0.60% expense ratio.IShares Russell Midcap Growth (IWP) climbed past a 110.76 flat-base buy point intraday Friday, before closing just below the entry. The fund was highlighted in this July 18 ETF column as it neared a flat-base buy point. It cleared the entry the next session but turned south along with the broader market in late July.The 16-year-old fund has amassed $7.6 billion. Technology accounted for 23.5% of assets as of Aug. 30, industrials 20%, consumer cyclical 19% and health care 14%. Among its top holdings: drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS), chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) and gene-sequencing systems maker Illumina (ILMN).IWP's YTD and 15-year average annual returns of 13.8% and 11%, respectively, are ahead of the S&P 500 for those periods. The fund's expense ratio is 0.25%.Thursday's picks, Vanguard Growth (VUG) and iShares Russell 1000 Growth (IWF), both managed slight gains ahead of the Labor Day holiday. VUG is at the cusp of a 123.01 flat-base buy point; IWF is still in buy range from a breakout past a 123.42 flat-base entry.To learn more about how to invest, check out this page.RELATED:Biotechs Extend Gains; 2 Breakouts Put Apple, Amazon In FocusThese 2 Sectors Lead Upside; 2 Market-Beaters Close To Buy PointGold Rallies As Stocks Fall; Is It Too Late To Buy Gold?

103,ILMN,"Apple (AAPL) spearheaded some gains among big- and mega-cap names and helped the Dow Jones industrial average edge slightly higher in afternoon trading Wednesday. However, other indexes reflected some heavy selling in some tech leaders.XApple gapped up on improving growth in quarterly revenue and earnings, and a rising outlook for the current fiscal fourth quarter. The stock's 4.6% jump to 156.97 sent it above a new flat-base entry at 156.75.As a component of the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, Apple helped the blue-chip index edge 0.2% higher, on top of last week's 1.2% rally.The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, erased earlier losses of as much as 0.5% and are fractionally higher.  The Nasdaq 100 reversed from a loss of nearly 0.3% to rise 0.3%.The S&P 500 also edged back into the black, reversing early small losses.The Dow utility average rose nearly 0.3%. Volume was running sharply higher on the Nasdaq and a tad lower on the NYSE vs. the same time on Tuesday.Laser expert Coherent (COHR) (down 21%, undercutting the 50-day line) and Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) (down 24%), a member of IBD's semiconductor manufacturing group, were among the small- and midcap techs that fell hard, weighing on the tech-heavy Nasdaq.Coherent posted a 214% jump in fiscal Q3 earnings to $3.36 a share on a 112% jump in revenue to $464.1 million. That top-line jump matched the rise in the second quarter ended in March. However, keep in mind that Coherent has already made a monster run since it cleared a first-stage huge saucer with handle at 68.49 way back in late 2015. Shares had run up more than 305% since then.Given Coherent's sharp undercut of the 10-week moving average in heavy turnover, a key sell signal, one could expect the stock to possibly test institutional buying support at the 200-day moving average.Coherent makes lasers and critical components for the semiconductor, solar and scientific markets.On the upside, biotech and genetics analysis play Illumina (ILMN), a member of IBD's medical research equipment and services group, soared more than 13% to 196.40 and surpassed a new-base buy point at 189.58.Illumina reported a 5% drop in second-quarter earnings to 82 cents a share, a smaller decline than the March-ended first quarter (down 11%), as revenue jumped 10% to $662 million.  Wall Street sees the company's revenue accelerating to 13% growth in Q3 and 18% in Q4.Illumina may also get back on an earnings growth track, rising 10% to $1.07 a share in Q3 and 45% in Q4, according to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate.Returning to Apple, as noted in prior Stock Market Today columns, the iPhone and iPad giant had already surpassed several buy points earlier this year. One, Apple cleared a 118.12 cup-with-handle entry on Jan. 6-9. Two, it ran past a 141.12 follow-on buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.And finally, two weeks ago Apple reclaimed its 50-day moving average, near 148, after suffering a fast sell-off in June that sent shares sliding beneath the key medium-term support line.Apple can be bought again, but also watch to see if it has the strength to hold the bullish price gap that has just formed. The proper buy zone in the latest breakout goes up to 164.59, or 5% above the latest flat-base entry of 156.75.At Wednesday's intraday low of 156.16, it's well above the prior session's high, thus producing the gap up in price.Notice, too, on a daily IBD Chart, how Apple's relative strength line (painted in blue) is rocketing higher. A move by the relative strength line into new high ground would indicate that Apple is continuing to outrun the S&P 500.RELATED:When Did Apple Initially Break Out In Late 2016?Which Leaders Are Selling Off Hard Today?

104,ILMN,"Apple (AAPL) had its price target raised Wednesday, while Under Armour's (UAA) price target was lowered, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) was downgraded and Illumina (ILMN) was upgraded after announcing earnings Tuesday.XApple's price target was raised to 190 from 158 at Piper Jaffray, which maintained an overweight rating on the stock.""The outlook implies that fears of an iPhone X launch delay, and/or limited availability of the device, may have been overblown,"" analyst Michael Olson said. ""We recommend owning Apple due to growing anticipation around iPhone X and a favorable trajectory for services revenue.""Late Tuesday, the iPhone and iPad maker announced results that beat Wall Street's estimates for fiscal third-quarter sales and earnings and guided sales higher for the current quarter.Apple shares climbed 4.7% to 157.14 on the stock market today, clearing a flat base with a buy point of 156.75. But Apple ended near session lows after hitting a record 159.75 intraday.Illumina was upgraded to equal-weight from underweight at First Analysis Sec after the genetic testing tools company reported Q2 earnings and revenue above analyst expectations.Shares jumped 14.8% to 197.85, topping a 189.58 buy point.Under Armour's price target was lowered to 18 from 21 at Telsey Advisory Group.On Tuesday, Under Armour reported a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss and its growth beat analyst views, but it lowered guidance and announced a restructuring plan.The new restructuring program comes as Nike (NKE) announced in June that it would sell clothing and shoes directly on Amazon (AMZN).Under Armour shares climbed 1.4% to 18.56 after crashing 6.8% on Tuesday to a four-year low. Nike fell 0.2% to 59.73, but still holding above a 59.10 buy point retaken on Tuesday.Pioneer was downgraded to to market perform at Wells Fargo. Analyst Gordon Douthat wrote that he was concerned over the shale exploration and production company's drilling delays and lowered production guidance.Late Tuesday, Pioneer reported Q2 earnings and revenue above Wall Street views, but it said that costs for Permian wells increase.Pioneer shares tumbled 10.7% to 145.68.RELATED: American Upgraded, Regeneron Downgraded, Rockwell Collins PT RaisedThe Risk To Facebook You Overlooked; Why American Air Is 'Compelling'

105,ILMN,"Strong earnings from Apple (AAPL) late Tuesday had many thinking that Wednesday was going to be a strong day for the stock market, but it didn't quite turn out that way. It wasn't exactly a bad day for the stock market, but the IBD 50 had a rough go of it, with well over half the names in the index down 1% or more.XThe Nasdaq composite rose 0.5% early, then turned lower — but then edged higher in afternoon trading. The Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 22,000 level, rising 0.2% while the S&P 500 eased less than 0.1%. Volume on the Nasdaq was tracking about 25% higher than Tuesday's level. NYSE volume was on pace to be close to Tuesday's level.Breadth was weak with decliners outnumbering advancers on the Nasdaq by just over 2-1. NYSE decliners topped advancers by 8-5.China-based IBD 50 names under pressure included NetEase (NTES), Momo (MOMO) and Autohome (ATHM) with losses of 2%-3%.Laser expert Coherent (COHR), a maker of commercial laser systems, and chipmaker Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), were among the small- and midcap techs that fell hard, weighing on the tech-heavy Nasdaq.In the stock market today, Apple garnered most of the attention after reporting strong earnings and sales late Tuesday. It also offered up sales guidance that quelled concerns about a delay in the launch of the iPhone 8. Shares gapped up and rose more than 5% to 157.90, just above a conventional flat-base entry of 156.75.Illumina (ILMN) also had a good day, soaring more than 14% to 197.79. Volume is running more than five times its normal pace. The maker of equipment for genetic analysis reported earnings and is still in buy range from a 189.58 buy point.After the close, watch for earnings reports from Ansys (ANSS), Bioverativ (BIVV), Stamps.com (STMP), Symantec (SYMC) and Tesla (TSLA).RELATED:Macom Earnings Miss Sends Fiber-Optic Stocks Down On China WorriesNew iPhone Fears 'Overblown'; Illumina Upgraded, Stock Breaks OutHow These 2 Biotechs Defied The Downtrend To Hit Fresh Highs

106,ILMN,"The main indexes closed narrowly mixed Wednesday afternoon after details of the Fed's September meeting left few doubts that a rate increase is looming.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.1%. But the Nasdaq dipped 0.1%. Volume was lower across the board, suggesting a lack of appetite among institutional buyers.Minutes fr0m the Fed's Sept. 20-21 meeting left more signs that policymakers are inclined to raise interest rates by year's end. In fact, a rate hike last month was termed a ""close call"" by participants, who judged the economy strong enough to make a ""reasonable argument"" to raise the fed funds rate.Some officials voiced concern that a delay in a rate increase could hurt the Fed's credibility. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee saw Brexit risks receding and that the labor market has improved appreciably in past year. Those are ingredients for an increase in borrowing costs.Mining, retail and some building stocks led today's trading, while the health care sector continued to show broad weakness. Managed-care stocks made up a cluster of stocks down in unusually heavy volume.Humana (HUM) plunged 5% in heavy volume. The HMO had been forming a shallow base, but the sell-off has soiled the pattern. Humana announced preliminary Q3 EPS of $3.15 a share, above views. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the company's share of members in four-star or higher-quality plans fell to around 37%, from 78% the prior year. The drop threatens to hurt bonuses that Humana earns.Aetna (AET), which is fighting antitrust issues to acquire Humana, fell 1.5% to the lowest level since May.Cigna (CI) was down more than 2% as its four-star-or-higher enrollments dived to 19% from 67%, according to a Wells Fargo research note. Anthem (ANTM), which is trying to merge with Cigna, was off nearly 1%. That deal also faces objections from the U.S. Justice Department.In other parts of the medical sector, Illumina (ILMN) continued to weaken following Tuesday's 25% crash on a lowered sales outlook.

But gains were short-lived. Shares fell as much as 8.8% later Tuesday, and finshed trading down 6.8% to close at 23 on Tuesday. Supernus stock hit a buy point of 24.10, out of a flat base, on Sept. 15.Among larger biotechs falling Tuesday, Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) were all down around 5.5% or 6%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) ETF was down 4% Tuesday afternoon, hurt by the 20%-plus decline by gene-sequencer Illumina (ILMN), after the company preannounced a big revenue miss.IBD'S TAKE: Supernus ranks No. 1 in IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group with a Composite Rating of 99, meaning it has performed in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

109,ILMN,"Stock ETFs wilted at the opening bell Tuesday as investors eyed an revenue miss from Alcoa (AA), the release of minutes from the Fed's September meeting on Wednesday and lower oil prices.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) slid 0.6% in morning trade on the stock market today.This exchange traded fund serves as a proxy for the broad U.S. market and has struggled to climb back above the 50-day moving average for more than a month. The 50-day trend line serves as a gauge of a stock or ETF's strength or weakness in the shorter term.Early on Tuesday, all S&P sectors were lower, with biotech stocks contributing to a 1.2% decline in the health care sector. The financial sector also jabbed lower ahead of key bank earnings Friday, but ETFs offering pure-play exposure to banks eked out gains.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) slid more than 2% lower with Illumina (ILMN) among the biggest decliners in its portfolio. The maker of gene-sequencing tools slashed its Q3 and Q4 revenue guidance. The stock cratered more than 25%.IBB, the flagship biotech ETF, is mired 18% below its highest level in the past year, set in December.Meanwhile, Alcoa slumped 9% after its third-quarter earnings met expectations, but revenue missed views. The aluminum producer is widely seen as kicking off each quarterly reporting season, though some experts question whether it is really a leading indicator of how the wider U.S. economy and the stock market are doing.IBD'S TAKE: Gold and rate-sensitive equity sectors came under pressure last week as investors mull the next Federal Reserve rate-hike move.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) slipped modestly following Monday's surge but held above $51 a barrel in early trading.Meanwhile, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) edged lower as bets that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by December continue to increase.The ETF tracks the spot price of gold and now sits below its 200-day line and 8% below its July high.

The stock has been in a gradual uptrend since July, working to climb out of a 10-month consolidation.Apple (AAPL) rose 2% at the open, after advancing nearly 2% in above-average volume Monday. The stock appears to be receiving a boost from Samsung's decision to halt sales and production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to overheating batteries. Apple shares ended Monday extended just beyond buy range above a 110.33 buy point in a cup with handle base.Illumina (ILMN) crashed 25% at the open.

The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 were off around 1.1%.Small caps sold off even harder, with the Russell 2000 down more than 1.8%, on pace for its biggest loss since its 1.9% drubbing on Sept. 13.

114,ILMN,"A mixed finish Wednesday marked what was in many ways a single-handed victory for Apple (AAPL), as it lugged the Dow above the 22,000 mark, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 ended mostly unchanged.XThe iPhone maker thundered ahead 5% in massive trade, paring its initial 6% advance only slightly, and ending the session 1% above a 156.65 buy point in a flat base.The result left the Dow Jones industrial average with a 0.2% gain, and remaining ever-so-slightly above the 22,000 level after seizing that new high-water mark in opening trade. More than half of the Dow's 30 stocks traded lower for the day. Walt Disney (DIS) chalked up the index's worst performance, down nearly 2%, dealing a minor setback to the House of Mouse's effort to scale the right side of three-month cup base ahead of its fiscal third-quarter report scheduled for Aug. 8.The Nasdaq composite surrendered its gains early in the session as undertow from tech names led by Facebook (FB)(down 0.4%), Microsoft (MSFT) (down 0.4%) and Netflix (NFLX) (off 0.9%) outstripped gains from Apple, Illumina (ILMN) and Groupon (GRPN).The S&P 500 added less than 0.1% as it came under pressure from oil-related names led by Range Resources (RRC) (down 12%), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) (down 11%) and Newfield Exploration (NFX) (off 5%). Drug distribution giant Cardinal Health (CAH) also had some say, dropping 8% after topping fiscal fourth-quarter expectations, but guiding Q1 earnings below expectations.Aside from Apple, the day's big earnings winners were Illumina, Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) and Boot Barn Holdings (BOOT).Illumina soared 15% after reporting late Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings slipped much less than expected and revenue growth ratcheted up to 10%. Shares took out a 189.58 buy point in flat base and ended at the top of their buy range.Boot Barn kicked up a 17% gain after reporting late Tuesday that its fiscal first-quarter EPS soared 50% in a second quarter of acceleration.

116,ILMN,"Since equity ETFs are essentially a basket of stocks, they tend to trade like individual stocks but can be less volatile since there are many other holdings.Today's two picks are at the top of their respective flat bases. For those who prefer to buy when an ETF bounces off its 50-day moving average, both funds are also within striking distance from a recent rebound.XVanguard Growth (VUG) closed Monday just shy of a 129.87 flat-base buy point. It found support near the 50-day line last week and is up about 2% from the support line. Shares advanced nearly 8% from their prior touch of the 50-day line to the June 2 intraday high.The fund, which tracks the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index, has attracted north of $27 billion in assets. Technology was for the biggest chunk of assets, at almost 28% as of June 30, followed by 18% in consumer cyclical and 15% in health care, according to Morningstar Inc. Consumer defensive and industrials made up about 9% each.The tech-heavy stance is evident in the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's class A (GOOGL) and class C (GOOG) shares. Those five names accounted for nearly one-fifth of total assets; each of the stocks have rallied more than 20% this year.VUG has outperformed the S&P 500 year to date by 17.3% to 11.1% through July 14. It's slightly outpaced the benchmark index based on three- and five-year average annual returns. For the 10-year period, the ETF returned an average annual 8.6% vs. 7% for the S&P 500. VUG carries a 0.06% expense ratio.Also closing in on a flat-base entry, at 109.85, and within 2% of its recent bounce off the 50-day line is iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth (IWP). The fund advanced nearly 5% from a late-April breakout from a flat base to the start of its current pattern.The $7.7 billion fund, which celebrated its 16th anniversary Monday, provides exposure to domestic midsize companies that are expected to grow their earnings at an above-average pace vs. the market. Top holdings as of July 13 included drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS), chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) and Illumina (ILMN), a maker of gene-sequencing systems.Technology was also the biggest sector weighting for the fund, at 23% of assets. IWP, whose 15-year average annual return of 10.8% is ahead of the S&P 500's 9% gain, has a 0.25% expense ratio.Monday's emerging markets picks were little changed: iShares Emerging Markets Dividend (DVYE) remains just below a 41.40 flat-base buy point, while SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) is still in buy range from a 30.88 flat-base entry.RELATED:For Outsize Dividends, Check Out These 2 Hot Emerging Markets PlaysLook Outside The U.S. For Top Dividend Funds So Far This YearCan The Bull Keep Running In The Second Half?

117,ILMN,"After a ho-hum 2016, $12.1 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is having a hi-ho 2017. The fund's 2.62% setback last year badly lagged the S&P 500's 11.96% gain. It trailed 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. But its 21.24% gain this year going into Thursday more than doubled the big-cap bogey's 10.32% return and trumped 89% of its direct rivals.XThe fund's rally reflects the market's shift away from defensive, low-growth staples-providers and higher-dividend stocks, which dominated for much of last year, to the sort of higher growth stocks that the fund favors. Fund co-manager Patrick Burton — on this job since early 2013 — says leading technology stocks in particular have been buoyed by market-share gains and strong earnings. Burton and lead manager Justin Kelly are with subadvisor Winslow Capital.Reflecting that market tilt, the fund has been boosted this year by such holdings as Alibaba Group (BABA), which is up 66%. The fund also holds graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which is up 46% this year. Digital-media and marketing-software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) is up 39%. Biomed Celgene (CELG), which is up 14%, is a fast grower in health care.""Alibaba is the No. 1 player in e-commerce in China,"" Burton said. It is benefiting from the shift to mobile devices. Gross sales are still growing rapidly despite its size. And Alibaba Cloud, like Amazon Web Services, is growing very fast, he says.Nvidia is benefiting from a shift toward the use of graphics processing units (GPU), away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, Burton says.Adobe is shifting from selling software licenses to annual subscriptions. ""Customers churn less and buy more"" under that model, Burton says.Celgene stock is up due to a combination of decent earnings and attractive valuation ""since biotech has been under pressure for a couple of years,"" Burton said.Over the past 10 years, the fund's 8.18% average annual gain topped 72% of its rivals. Winslow's Kelly has been at the helm since late 2005.The fund aims to navigate through various market phases by adjusting its allocations among three types of growth stocks.One bucket holds stocks that the managers see as long-term, sustainable earnings growers. The second bucket holds quality cyclical growers, which may be more volatile. And the third holds stocks in newer industries with rapid growth.Visa (V) is a sustainable grower. Its takeover of Visa Europe boosts economies of scale and leads to better coordination of global marketing campaigns, Burton says, adding, ""It's a really steady Eddie, consistent grower.""Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is one of the fund's cyclicals. They supply radio frequency filters for Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Chinese cellphones. ""What's changing is that they are moving into other products that need wireless applications like Tesla (TSLA) (cars),"" Burton said. ""They are pushing to get involved in the internet of things.""ServiceNow (NOW) is a new-industry stock, which is expanding from IT management for clients into new areas like cybersecurity and human resources.Celgene, whose cancer drug Revlimid is its flagship, is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. The group is ranked No. 8 among 197.Wall Street expects earnings per share to climb 23% this year. Pretax margin last year of 50.4% was its highest in at least nine years.IBD'S TAKE: You can check out more of Celgene's fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Illumina (ILMN) and Netflix (NFLX) were new additions to the fund's portfolio in the second quarter.Illumina is a leader in low-cost gene-sequencing equipment. Burton said, ""We believe Illumina will demonstrate an accelerating growth profile over the course of this year and next, driven by the launch of its new gene-sequencing instrument, Novaseq. We believe this acceleration will drive upside to (analysts') consensus (earnings) estimates.""Netflix returned to the portfolio after being sold. Its EPS rose 50%, 71%, 114% and 567% in the past four quarters.Netflix is facing increasing competition from Hulu and stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN) and YouTube-owner Google (GOOGL) — both also owned by MainStay Large Cap Growth. Netflix's drivers are its original programming and global expansion, Burton says.RELATED:MainStay Large Cap Growth Sees Market Tilting Toward Its Favorite Types Of Growth Stocks

121,ILMN,"Growth stocks provided a rich seam of gains for domestic stock ETFs in the past month, as shares of tech leaders Facebook (FB), Adobe (ADBE) and Apple (AAPL) rekindled after noticeably lagging the postelection rally.Investors in exchange traded funds were in a perhaps exuberant mood as stock market volatility hit its lowest level in years and the venerable Dow Jones industrial average crossed the psychologically key 20,000 mark, Matthew Bartolini and David Mazza of State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) wrote in a recent note.A risk-on mood seems to prevail among ETF investors as ""the current U.S. equity bull market is less than 30 trading days away from its eighth birthday,"" they added.However, there are some yellow flags.""Valuations are elevated and earnings growth is positive, but not overwhelming so,"" said Bartolini and Mazza. ""Confounding the exuberance is the fact that bond market volatility remains decidedly elevated, nearly 6% higher than prior to the election, while equity volatility has fallen by over 36%.""SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) climbed 0.9% in the month ended Feb. 8, padding gains of 2.6% year to date and 12% in 2016.International stock ETFs did even better in the past month.Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO) advanced 4.4% and iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), investing in foreign developed markets, added 1.2%.Equity ETFs listed in the U.S. notched just under $30 billion in net inflow in January — the third month in a row since the Nov. 8 election that investors poured more than $25 billion into equity ETFs, according to SSGA. Fixed income ETFs saw $13.41 billion in net inflow last month, following the record $90 billion of fresh assets they gathered in 2016.Bartolini and Mazza suggest that truly exuberant ETF investors should consider allocating to ETFs which are tracking sectors that may benefit from President Trump's policies, such as real assets, oil and gas producers and regional banks.Other ETF investors may want to position for downside risk in the stock market and consider investing in gold, they added.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017These are among the year's best-performing ETFs in some key asset classes, screened for trading volume:First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted (QQEW) gives every stock in its underlying tech-focused, nonfinancial index an equal share of assets.

Lael Brainard said the central bank should be in no hurry to raise rates, further reducing odds of a policy move at next week's meeting.Apple (AAPL) and Wal-Mart (WMT) were top gainers in the Dow. Nasdaq 100 winners included NetEase (NTES), Illumina (ILMN) and Tesla Motors (TSLA).After piercing its 50-day moving average on Friday, the Nasdaq composite jumped back above the line, rising 1.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.2% and the S&P 500 1.3%. Small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 up 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Friday's levels.""The case to tighten policy preemptively is less compelling,"" Brainard said Monday. Brainard is seen as a policy dove, so any hawkish hints might have spurred bigger bets on a September rate hike. Stocks sold off Friday after Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, until recently a policy dove, argued in favor of tightening  sooner rather than later.Germany's DAX gave up 1.3%, while London's FTSE 100 and Paris CAC 40 lost 1.1% each.

124,ILMN,"Gene-sequencing giant Illumina (ILMN) touched an eight-month high intraday Thursday on reports that it received a buyout offer from rival Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), but Wall Street was skeptical.The website Street Insider cited an unnamed source saying that Thermo Fisher had made an all-stock offer for Illumina worth about $30 billion, which would be about 20% above its current market cap.Cowen analyst Doug Schenkel said that there was ""close to a 0% probability"" that this was actually true. The premium would be too low to appeal to Illumina, he argued, and too expensive for Thermo Fisher.""This would require Thermo Fisher to issue 200 million shares (assuming Thermo Fisher shares continue to not be pressured in spite of these 'reports'),"" Schenkel wrote in a research note. ""These assumptions would render the deal 20% dilutive to Thermo Fisher on a 2018 EPS basis.""Illumina stock opened slightly higher and then jumped 7.5% after the news broke mid-morning, with the shares hitting an eight-month high of 182.67. When the market closed, it was up 1.9% at 172.34. Thermo Fisher stock dipped 0.85% to 153.35.IBD'S TAKE: Illumina was once a top-rated stock, but it has fallen on hard times. Investors who saw the sell signals were able get out in time and keep their money, as we explained last fall in Investor's Corner.Wells Fargo analyst Tim Evans was also dubious.""We think the deal would encounter significant regulatory hurdles, given that Illumina holds a near monopoly in high-throughput sequencing, and Thermo Fisher Scientific is the only current competitor with material scale in desktop sequencing,"" Evans wrote in his note.He added that the overlap between the two businesses could lead to revenue ""dys-synergies,"" suggesting they may have to cut back on overlapping products.

125,ILMN,"Illumina (ILMN) rose as much as 8% to its highest level since January after a report that Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) made a $30 billion offer for the maker of gene-sequencing equipment.The all-stock offer doesn't include a cash component, StreetInsider.com reported, citing an unnamed person with knowledge of the matter. San Diego-based Illumina rose 4% to 176 at 11:51 a.m. ET. Waltham, Mass.-based Thermo Fisher fell less than 1% to 153.73.In 2012, Illumina rejected acquisition attempts by Roche Holding (RHHBY), including one valued at $6.7 billion. Illumina's annual revenue has more than doubled since 2011, reaching $2.2 billion in 2015.Representatives for Illumina and Thermo Fisher couldn't be reached for comment.
"
126,ILMN,"Gene-sequencing giant Illumina (ILMN) was sliding on the stock market Tuesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded it based on negative trends in key markets.Analyst Steve Beuchaw cut his rating to underweight and lowered his price target to 110 from 130 on Illumina stock. He also lowered his valuation of the cancer franchise to $3.8 billion from $4.9 billion, citing reimbursement pressure from Medicare and Medicaid, as well of the rise of immunotherapies for cancer that don't require genetic testing.Beuchaw also described a trend in the academic research channel to outsource genome sequencing to centralized labs, reducing the need for locally installed machines. He added, however, that this wasn't a negative call on the entire genomics space.""We remain positive on share gainers in emerging categories in genomics, notably Natera (NTRA) and NanoString (NSTG) where markets are in their earlier stages of development,"" he wrote in his downgrade note. ""Qiagen (QGEN) is an emerging player in sequencing hardware, and expectations are likely too low for the GeneReader.""Beuchaw added that recovery in the genomics market seemed to be tied to microarrays, which is positive for Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and Agilent (A).Illumina stock fell to a five-month low of 132.65 in early trading on the stock market today; but closed down 1.5% at 138.67. Despite Beuchaw's positive remarks, the rivals were also sinking: Qiagen stock fell 2.2%, Natera lost 1.1%, Thermo Fisher retreated 1.3%, and Agilent fell 1.9%. But NanoString rose 1.6%.

JD.com is in a consolidation with a 29.33 buy point. NetEase (NTES), meanwhile, added 2.2% to 239.88.

Allegiant Travel (ALGT) bounced off its 10-week moving average, rising 5.7%. Alaska Air (ALK) is also getting support at its 10-week line. Shares gained 5.2%.Elsewhere, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) held up well despite a downgrade by Citi to sell based on valuation. Goldman pared a 1.6% loss to just 0.1%.A trio of financial companies report earnings on Friday, including JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC).In the stock market today, shares of Chipotle (CMG) jumped 4.9% to 414.35. The company's fourth-quarter outlook wasn't great, but investors seemed to focus instead on a 14.7% rise in December same-store sales.In the medical sector, NuVasive (NUVA) broke out of a base in active trading. Shares were up 2.1% to 69.96. It's still in buy range from a 69.04 cup-with-handle buy point. Late Monday, the company preannounced preliminary Q4 and full-year results.Leaderboard name HealthEquity (HQY) extended gains after Monday's strong move. Shares vaulted 9.5% to 47.04. It's still in buy range from a 45.10 flat-base entry. The 5% buy zone goes up to 47.35.IBD'S TAKE: HealthEquity is the second-ranked stock in the financial services-specialty industry group based on its Composite Rating of 97.

128,ILMN,"Tuesday marked a shiny rally for small-cap equities while big- and megacap firms sat in the back seat. Meanwhile, money continued to flow in certain tech and commodity sectors of the market.While the largest tech firm trading in the market, Apple (AAPL), showed decent but not outstanding action following Monday's breakout from a base-on-base pattern, other companies showed more oomph.The company with a $635 billion market cap — just shy of Switzerland's estimated nominal GDP in 2016 — edged up for a fourth day in a row, up 0.1% to 119.11 and 1% past a new 118.12 entry point. Volume fell. On Monday's breakout, turnover edged up 7% above its 50-day average of 31.3 million shares.The S&P 500 wasted a small intraday gain of roughly 0.4% to end practically flat on Tuesday, and the Dow Jones industrials sank nearly 0.2%, the Russell 2000 thrust ahead 1% and finished almost at session highs.The Nasdaq composite found happy ground in the middle, rising nearly 0.4%. Reflecting a dominance among the bunch of stocks in the $300 million to $3 billion market-cap range, the Nasdaq 100 trailed the Nasdaq composite by rising just 0.2%.Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE vs. Monday's levels, thus handing the S&P 500 a rare stalling day, or bout of heavy institutional selling. However, Tuesday's volume on the NYSE was likely below average. Read more about the major indexes' action in today's The Big Picture column.Returning to individual equities,  Incyte (INCY), beaming from its new plans with Big Pharma business partner Merck (MRK) to advance clinical trials for new cancer treatments, rose nearly 0.7% to 119.30, getting extended further from a 110.05 entry.As noted in IBD's Stock Market Today coverage on Monday, Incyte's huge gap up that day means investors with real conviction in the small-molecule development expert could have bought at Monday's opening price of 113.55, which would have been within the 5% chase zone from the 110.05 precise buy point.Illumina (ILMN), after rising nearly 17% to 165.04 in the heaviest volume in three months, may be poised to develop a bottoming-base pattern. The San Diego-based maker of human genome analysis systems, a former big winner from its April 2013 breakout to its summer 2015 peak, grew revenue by 19% in 2015, but the top-line increases decelerated in 2016.The Street also sees full-year earnings flattening for 2016, but then picking up 10% to $3.66 a share in 2017.Illumina sports a solid 91 EPS Rating for now, according to IBD Stock Checkup. However, Q4 profit is expected to fall 1% to 80 cents a share, and that would most likely depress the EPS Rating.Illumina's 52 RS Rating is typical for stocks in bottoming bases.Chinese web companies flourished, led by big gains by Alibaba (BABA) (up 2% to 96.75) and NetEase (NTES) (up 2.2% to 239.98). Both large-cap plays have risen back above their key 50-day moving averages, one key step to completing new bases.Watch Alibaba closely, as the e-commerce titan has unveiled an interesting new plan to link small businesses in the U.S. with China's gigantic and still growing middle consumer class. Alibaba has also now joined Leaderboard as a new name to watch.Baidu (BIDU), the No. 1 search engine in China, jumped nearly 2% to 180.31 and is basing.Returning to Apple, the iPhone juggernaut is still in buy range after rising past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. The 5% chase zone extends up to 124.03. As noted in this Sept. 14, 2016, Stock Market Today column, Apple rallied nearly 8% after clearing a cup with handle at 110.33; that cup was part of a long, deep bottoming base pattern.At 119.11, Apple still lies 11% below an all-time peak of 134.54. The latest weekly cup shows two down weeks in heavy volume vs. two up weeks in above-average volume. However, one of those weeks saw a minimal decline and thus bespeaks strong institutional support.An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B (track it via IBD Stock Checkup) and improved RS Rating of 63 also point to net accumulation by funds.Apple's RS line continues to drift mildly higher, signifying that it's still outperforming the S&P 500 for now.Metals firms advanced sharply.

The small-cap Russell 2000 rose about 0.2%.The Nasdaq has been taking new highs and shedding distribution days as it powered through a six-day rally.  The recent weakness in small caps and the mixed performance of breakouts among leaders cue investors to remain alert for changes in the market's direction.Illumina (ILMN) powered up more than 15%.

"
134,ILMN,"Leading genetic-analysis companies Illumina (ILMN) and Myriad Genetics (MYGN) both suffered on Wall Street Wednesday -- temporarily, in the case of the former -- after they issued disappointing guidance late Tuesday.Illumina had already prepared investors for pain last month when it pre-announced Q1 sales and cut its revenue guidance, citing weakness in its lower-end systems and in Europe. On Tuesday its bottom line disappointed as well, dropping 22% from the year-earlier quarter to 74 cents, which was 3 cents shy of analysts' consensus. It also guided Q2 revenue below consensus, at $590 million to $595 million, and whacked 20 cents of its full-year EPS guidance, now $3.35 to $3.45.Illumina's management said on the conference call with analysts that demand is still strong and it has a good order backlog, but operational issues have been plaguing financials. A number of Q1 orders failed to translate into revenue due to deferrals and there were problems with European operations which Illumina says it's addressing. The GRAIL project announced in January, aimed at creating a blood test for all cancers, also turned out to be more dilutive to 2016 earnings than expected.Several analysts cut their price targets on the stock.""While we acknowledge that the myriad of issues Illumina management recited are all valid and understandable, history teaches us that fast turnarounds are rare and in the case of a growth company are normally accompanied by a new product launch or major new application,"" Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote in a research note, cutting the price target to 142 from 165 while maintaining a hold rating.Leerink analyst Dan Leonard expressed similar concerns.""Our market perform rating on Illumina’s stock reflects a view that the company needs to meaningfully exceed revenue expectations for the stock to work, and we don’t see a driver for these types of revenue beats,"" wrote Leerink's Dan Leonard as he cut his target to 145 from 165 and kept his market perform rating. ""Second half (forecast) assumes a meaningful acceleration to full-year guide, and we have less visibility on this acceleration than we’d like.""What are the funds doing with Illumina's stock? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup!Mizuho analyst Eric Criscuolo cut his price target to 138 from 150 while maintaining a hold rating. Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro cut his target to 140 from 160, after downgrading the stock to hold in February.""Our concerns on the stock remain its premium valuation, slowing top line and accelerating rate of spend to sustain growth,"" Massaro wrote in his research note.Illumina stock dropped 5% in early trading on the stock market today, but in midday trading it was up a fraction, near 133.Myriad Genetics, meanwhile, beat estimates in its most recent quarter, but the guidance caused consternation. Myriad's fiscal Q3 earnings rose 2% over the year-earlier quarter to 41 cents a share, beating consensus by 3 cents. Revenue climbed 6% to $190.5 million, almost $6 million above analysts' estimate.Myriad's revenue guidance for the current quarter, at $186 million to $188 million, missed Wall Street's expectation of a slight increase over the year-ago number of $189.9 million. EPS guidance of 36 to 38 cents was on the low side of analysts' 38-cent average and below last year's 41 cents.Leerink's Leonard wrote that the Q3 beat was driven by nonrecurring items: ""(1) an one-time $2 million retrospective payment from Medicare for Prolaris, and (2) large contracts received in the Pharmaceutical and Clinical Services business ($3 million incremental revenue),"" he wrote in his note cutting the price target to 41 from 44. ""Adjusted EPS of $0.41 beat our consensuslike estimate of $0.38 mainly due to a lower tax rate.""At the same time, Leonard doubted the sustainability of the prices of Myriad's tests for genes related to cancer, which account for 85% of its business.Myriad's stock took a hit on April 19 on news that the Medicare administrative contractor responsible for Myriad's and Invitae's (NVTA) cancer tests had priced a hereditary breast-cancer panel code at $622.23, less than a third of what Myriad charges for its BRCA code.Myriad stock was down more than 6% midday Wednesday, touching an eight-month low of 35.76.

135,ILMN,"Illumina (ILMN) plummeted in after-hours trading Monday when the genomics giant announced weak preliminary Q1 revenue and cut its full-year outlook.Illumina said that sales during the quarter rose 6% over the year-earlier quarter to $572 million, about $14 million less than Wall Street expected, according to Thomson Reuters. It would end a 14-quarter string of double-digit growth.Shares dived 19% to 145 in late trading after closing up 2.6% to 178.13, a three-month high moving above its 200-day moving average for the first time this year.The preliminary results missed company expectations as well, according to CEO Jay Flatley.""Our first-quarter results fell short of expectations largely due to lower than expected sales of HiSeq 2500, 3000 and 4000 instruments,"" Flatley said in a statement. ""Despite this slow start in Q1, we anticipate that our Americas and Asia Pacific regions will meet our expectations for the full year but that Europe will underperform. As a result, we now project approximately 12% revenue growth for fiscal 2016.""Previously, Illumina had guided 16% sales growth for the year. Flatley added that the company is reshuffling European operations to try to address the shortfall, though the statement didn't provide specifics.Illumina said that it will report full Q1 results after the close on May 3.This was the latest in a series of disappointments from Illumina. Its stock has fallen after every quarterly report since January of last year; it fell again on March 8 after the company said that Flatley will leave his post on July 5, to be succeeded by current President Francis deSouza. The stock had been recovering since then.""The instrument softness was not a complete surprise, given that sequencing instrument growth had slowed down over the past six quarters,"" Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote in an email to clients. ""That being said, the magnitude of the revenue guidance change ... will be a point of debate for investors.""

163,ILMN,"SAN FRANCISCO — Big biotechs Celgene and Vertex Pharmaceuticals disappointed investors with their 2016 guidance, while gene-sequencing giant Illumina previewed a variety of futuristic products, at a major investor conference Monday.
"
164,ILMN,"The news at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, sent Celgene (CELG) and Vertex (VRTX) stocks falling Monday, while Illumina (ILMN) shares rose a fraction.
"
165,ILMN,"Celgene said Q4 EPS totaled $1.18 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter but missing by 9 cents the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Product sales (which cover not quite all of revenue) were $2.54 billion, in line with Wall Street's revenue estimate.
"
166,ILMN,"Celgene is scheduled to report final Q4 earnings on Jan. 28.
"
167,ILMN,"For 2016, Celgene guided EPS of $5.50 to $5.70, up 19% from the expected final 2015 number but on the low side of analysts' $5.68 projection. Product sales were guided at $10.5 billion to $11 billion, while analysts forecast revenue of $11.1 billion.
"
168,ILMN,"Nonetheless, Celgene added 5 cents to its 2020 EPS guidance, which it had already raised last summer, to $13 from $12.50.
"
169,ILMN,"Celgene also said that in March, Bob Hugin, who's led the company for 17 years, will become executive chairman and hand the CEO job over to Mark Alles, currently the president and COO. Alles, in turn, will hand his position to Jacqualyn Fouse, now the president of Celgene's hematology and oncology franchise, which makes up the majority of its business.
"
170,ILMN,"Scott Smith, who heads the inflammation and immunology business, will add the role of chair of the Global Management Committee.
"
171,ILMN,"Regarding Q4, Celgene said it included a 7-cent charge due to a $70 million milestone payment to OncoMed (OMED) stemming from positive data of demcizumab, a cancer drug that Celgene has licensed. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a research note that it was ""unclear"" whether the consensus forecast had factored that in, but he wrote that both the other numbers were basically in-line.
"
172,ILMN,"Speaking at the conference, Hugin said that in Q4, Celgene had to absorb a 17-cent hit from closing its $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos, which brought potential blockbuster immunology drug ozanimod. He was highly optimistic about Celgene's budding immunology franchise in general; psoriasis drug Otezla launched in 2014 and brought $472 million in 2015, which Hugin called ""the most successful launch of any therapeutic in the history of this therapeutic area in terms of its progress in this first full year of launch.""
"
173,ILMN,"Analysts were divided about the management changes. Schoenebaum wrote that the changes had generally been expected, but RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote that the CEO transition seemed early.
"
174,ILMN,"""We believe investors will debate the changes and what could result or what Alles may do going forward,"" Yee said in a research note.

"
178,ILMN,"On Monday, it announced the MiniSeq System, the simplest, cheapest gene sequencer that it has yet produced. The MiniSeq, expected launch this quarter, is priced at $49,500, with each sample costing about $200 to $300 to process, CEO Jay Flatley said at the conference.
"
179,ILMN,"Also Monday, Illumina unveiled a new partnership with Bio-Rad (BIO) to develop a next-generation sequencing solution to analyze a single cell. Single-cell analyses are useful in understanding cell variations in cancer and other diseases, Flatley said, but normally they are analyzed only from a small batch. Illumina and Bio-Rad aim for a high-throughput solution combining their technologies, which they expect to launch late this year or early next year.
"
180,ILMN,"Flatley also previewed a handheld sequencing device Illumina is working on called Firefly, based on CMOS technology the company acquired a couple years ago. That will be a ways down the road, however.

183,ILMN,"Vertex stock fell 6.1% to 103.95 after its preliminary Q4 results and 2016 guidance Sunday disappointed investors. But Vertex said its flagship cystic fibrosis (CF) drug Kalydeco sold about $180 million, beating consensus of $165 million, according to Evercore.

185,ILMN,"For this year, the company forecast $670 million to $690 million in Kalydeco sales and $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion in operating expenses but didn't forecast Orkambi sales.

187,ILMN,"He says Vertex is waiting on additional information from its launch before giving Orkambi guidance. Analysts expect Orkambi to sell $1.5 billion this year.SAN FRANCISCO — Big biotechs Celgene and Vertex Pharmaceuticals disappointed investors with their 2016 guidance, while gene-sequencing giant Illumina previewed a variety of futuristic products, at a major investor conference Monday.The news at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, sent Celgene (CELG) and Vertex (VRTX) stocks falling Monday, while Illumina (ILMN) shares rose a fraction.Celgene said Q4 EPS totaled $1.18 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter but missing by 9 cents the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Product sales (which cover not quite all of revenue) were $2.54 billion, in line with Wall Street's revenue estimate.Celgene is scheduled to report final Q4 earnings on Jan. 28.For 2016, Celgene guided EPS of $5.50 to $5.70, up 19% from the expected final 2015 number but on the low side of analysts' $5.68 projection. Product sales were guided at $10.5 billion to $11 billion, while analysts forecast revenue of $11.1 billion.Nonetheless, Celgene added 5 cents to its 2020 EPS guidance, which it had already raised last summer, to $13 from $12.50.Celgene also said that in March, Bob Hugin, who's led the company for 17 years, will become executive chairman and hand the CEO job over to Mark Alles, currently the president and COO. Alles, in turn, will hand his position to Jacqualyn Fouse, now the president of Celgene's hematology and oncology franchise, which makes up the majority of its business.Scott Smith, who heads the inflammation and immunology business, will add the role of chair of the Global Management Committee.Regarding Q4, Celgene said it included a 7-cent charge due to a $70 million milestone payment to OncoMed (OMED) stemming from positive data of demcizumab, a cancer drug that Celgene has licensed. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a research note that it was ""unclear"" whether the consensus forecast had factored that in, but he wrote that both the other numbers were basically in-line.Speaking at the conference, Hugin said that in Q4, Celgene had to absorb a 17-cent hit from closing its $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos, which brought potential blockbuster immunology drug ozanimod. He was highly optimistic about Celgene's budding immunology franchise in general; psoriasis drug Otezla launched in 2014 and brought $472 million in 2015, which Hugin called ""the most successful launch of any therapeutic in the history of this therapeutic area in terms of its progress in this first full year of launch.""Analysts were divided about the management changes. Schoenebaum wrote that the changes had generally been expected, but RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote that the CEO transition seemed early.""We believe investors will debate the changes and what could result or what Alles may do going forward,"" Yee said in a research note.Celgene stock slid 5.5% Monday, to 103.03.Illumina Teams With Bill GatesIllumina stock, meanwhile, seesawed Monday before closing up a fraction at 165.71, after a battery of announcements from the company. On Sunday, it said that it was launching a new business called Grail, with several partners including Microsof t (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Bezos Expeditions, the family foundation of Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. The aim of the company is to develop a new genetic test for early-stage cancers that can be derived from a simple blood sample.On Monday, it announced the MiniSeq System, the simplest, cheapest gene sequencer that it has yet produced. The MiniSeq, expected launch this quarter, is priced at $49,500, with each sample costing about $200 to $300 to process, CEO Jay Flatley said at the conference.Also Monday, Illumina unveiled a new partnership with Bio-Rad (BIO) to develop a next-generation sequencing solution to analyze a single cell. Single-cell analyses are useful in understanding cell variations in cancer and other diseases, Flatley said, but normally they are analyzed only from a small batch. Illumina and Bio-Rad aim for a high-throughput solution combining their technologies, which they expect to launch late this year or early next year.Flatley also previewed a handheld sequencing device Illumina is working on called Firefly, based on CMOS technology the company acquired a couple years ago. That will be a ways down the road, however.Flatley also said he expects revenue to grow 16% this year, in line with consensus, while EPS guidance of $3.55 to $3.65 a share was below the Street's $3.72 estimate.Vertex Key Drug BeatsVertex stock fell 6.1% to 103.95 after its preliminary Q4 results and 2016 guidance Sunday disappointed investors.

202,ILMN,"In order to succeed in investing, you can't just shoot from the hip. Instead, some key rules must be followed. When a breakout that had been working well suddenly starts to fizzle, don't be a deer in the headlights. You need to take action or else watch those hard-earned gains disappear.While IBD preaches to take profits once they amount to 20% to 25%, not every stock that breaks out from a base will go on to produce gains in this ideal range. Some of them will lose steam before rising 20% to 25%. Sometimes, they will fizzle much sooner.Also, depending on market conditions, you might end up with a stock that rises 10% to 15% before heading back down. Other stocks will get your hopes up by rising just shy of 20% from a buy point and then break down.If you catch a stock that rises at least 10% after breaking out from a base but then erases those gains, you should close out your position. This action is called a round trip, and it is a sell signal.Watching a stock that gives up what was a healthy gain is bad enough already. But letting it go into negative territory is even worse. So if a stock wipes out a double-digit gain, investors don't have to wait until the stock falls 7%-8% below a buy point before selling. It's still better to get out even rather than take a loss.Illumina (ILMN) briefly cleared a 210.55 buy point from a handle June 5 this year in soft volume. Big volume arrived in the next trading session (1). Shares of the gene-sequencing firm didn't move much initially, but they picked up the pace in July. The stock climbed 15% by July 20 (2).But on July 22, the stock gapped down, tumbling nearly 13% intraday on mixed second-quarter results (3). The firm posted earnings that climbed 40% to 80 cents a share, beating views, but sales grew 21% to $539.4 million, about $3 million short of consensus. That was also the third straight quarter of mildly decelerating sales growth.The big drop erased the entire 15% gain from the 210.55 entry, marking a sell signal. While some stocks do bounce back after pulling a round trip, Illumina didn't. The stock tried to stabilize near its 50-day line, but that soon gave way. By early October, the stock dropped as much as 46% from its July peak (4).

205,ILMN,"Gene-sequencing giant Illumina (ILMN) pre-announced Q3 revenue and full-year guidance that missed estimates Monday, sending its stock tumbling after hours.Illumina said Q3 revenue totaled $550 million, up 14% from the year-earlier quarter but $19 million short of analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. The company also said it expects Q4 revenue of $570 million, up 11% from last year but $32 million shy of Wall Street's estimate.That adds up to 18% sales growth for the year, vs. analysts' expectations of 21% growth. The company will report final Q3 results on Oct. 20.""Demand for sequencing consumables and the HiSeq family of instruments remained strong during the quarter, while instrument sales in the desktop family underperformed our expectations,"" Illumina CEO Jay Flatley said in a statement. ""Geographically, we were disappointed with instrument sales in Europe and continued weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite this 3% shortfall to expectations, our competitive position and product development pipeline are as strong as ever.""The announcement continued a recent stretch of bad news for Illumina, starting with its surprise Q2 revenue miss after a long record of beating estimates. Last week, the stock also suffered after Leerink analyst Dan Leonard downgraded it, writing that he saw the current product cycle as being lighter on upgrades and replacements than previous cycles. The unexpectedly early launch of a competing gene-sequencing product from Pacific Biosciences (PACB) also has weighed on shares.""We had been cautioning for some time that 3Q/4Q estimates looked aggressive and thus today's negative pre-announcement does not come as a massive surprise,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken in an email to clients. ""The key question for us remains what helps to re-accelerate instrument growth (key driver of multiple) and what will the company offer at JPM (the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference) in a few months of time to swing sentiment. With modest competition also entering the market we expect the uncertainty to keep shares range bound at depressed levels and we await further clarity prior to revisiting our thesis.""Illumina's stock was thus already down 32% from its July 20 high when it closed down a fraction at 163.50 in regular trade Monday. An hour after the close, it was down 13% to about 142. Pacific Biosciences was down about 5% after hours, perhaps on the assumption of overall weakness in the sequencing market.Illumina still holds an excellent EPS Rank of 98, but a Relative Strength Rating of only 35.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

281,ILMN,"BioMed Realty Trust (BMR) jumped more than 12% Wednesday after Bloomberg reported that the company is exploring a sale. Bloomberg said Blackstone Group (BX) is interested in buying it.BioMed Realty is a real estate investment trust that specializes in providing homes and laboratories for the life science industry.It focuses its efforts in seven core markets : Boston, San Francisco, San Diego, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Seattle.The companies it serves want to be part of research hubs near universities.BioMed was founded in 2004 with the realization that traditional REITs weren't able to satisfy the unique needs of research companies. It says it owns 18 million square feet of office and laboratory space it leases to companies and research institutions.Among the big universities it houses are Harvard, Yale and the University of California, San Diego.In April 2013, the company announced a new build-to-suit transaction for Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) for two new buildings totaling 297,000 square feet and a parking structure at the Landmark at Eastview in Tarrytown, N.Y. That expands Regeneron's campus to 1.4 million square feet. BioMed Realty says the laboratory and office space is pre-leased for a 15-year term.In June of this year, it announced that Illumina (ILMN) signed a 20-year lease for a 155,000-square-foot research building in Cambridge, England.The stock has been underperforming for the last several years, basically moving sideways.

285,ILMN,"Sector rotation is pretty much a done deal, if the Big Cap 20 is any guide. Last spring and summer, the medical sector was providing a third to a half of the names in the Big Cap 20.The summer leaders' charts now look sad. Biogen (BIIB) is 40% off its high. Illumina (ILMN) is 33% off its high. (It plunged after hours on preannounced Q3 revenue and full-year guidance that missed views.) Regeneron (REGN) is 23% off its high.In Tuesday's Big Cap 20, only one medical stock made the list.Heart-valve maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is on the list, despite a couple of breakouts that offered meager gains. A breakout on March 16 yielded a 9% gain in five sessions, then the stock consolidated. A breakout in July yielded an 8% gain in about three weeks before the stock consolidated.Small gains do not give individual investors much of a chance to make money.Edwards is now forming a new consolidation, but is it good news? In Monday's IBD, the medical sector was No. 19 of 33 sectors after being in the top four most of the year through September.If the medical sector is finished as a leader, what has replaced the medical stocks? An investor might just as well ask what hasn't replaced the medical stocks.The Big Cap 20's leadership is now more diverse than it has been all year.Its stocks are from many sectors, including retail, software, tobacco and leisure.Many are in early-stage patterns, thanks to resets or breakouts that didn't advance 20% or more.A reset occurs when a stock's low undercuts the low of its previous base, which resets the count at one. A first- or second-stage base has a better shot at success than a later-stage base.The following Big Cap 20 stocks feature first-stage bases:Software sector play Salesforce.com (CRM) is working on a first-stage consolidation. The stock has regained its 200-day and 50-day lines, and is only 4% off a new high.Breakouts this year led to gains of 9% and 10%. The stock hasn't posted a gain of 20% from a breakout since August-November 2013.Retail sector stock Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is working on a first-stage pattern. The stock is 4% off its high and is battling to retake its 50-day line.Breakouts this year led to gains of 15%, 4% and most recently 4%.Tobacco sector stock Reynolds American (RAI) cleared a 44.24 buy point Monday, but strong volume was missing. A valid breakout usually delivers a volume spike of at least 40% above average. Strong volume is the mark of institutional activity.Food and meat stock Hormel (HRL) rushed past a 64.23 buy point Monday. Volume was 130% above average. The stock is defensive and seldom delivers big gains out of breakouts. Hormel's last big gain was a 44% pop out of a November 2012 breakout.

Also, most have climbed since their earnings press releases came out during the past couple of weeks.The medical sector, which has the largest share of the Big Cap 20, accounted for several earnings winners.Gilead Sciences (GILD) gapped up after it reported sales and profit that exceeded expectations for Q2. It also raised full-year guidance. The $3.15 a share beat analysts' consensus by 44 cents — one of the largest margins of victory in the earnings race.The stock has risen almost every day since the July 28 report and is forming the right side of a base.Better-than-expected sales and earnings also helped Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) break out of a base on July 23.Illumina (ILMN), however, was one medical leader that tumbled.The gene-sequencing company on July 21 beat earnings estimates but missed revenue expectations. Shares sold off 8% the day after its report, sinking back around a prior buy point at 213.46. Illumina dropped out of the Big Cap 20 after that.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) beat Q2 estimates Thursday, but its guidance fell short of expectations because of some costs. The stock has fallen modestly since the report but remains above a 191.10 entry.The market also had a cool reception for Edwards Lifesciences' (EW) results, even though sales and earnings were higher than analysts expected. The stock has been down each day since the numbers were released a week ago.Outside health care,eBay (EBAY)topped profit estimates on July 16 and charged to a new high following the news. Shares have receded a bit, but have held near highs.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) barely beat second-quarter views, as EPS rose 27% to $4.45 a share. Sales climbed 14% to $1.2 billion, below estimates.Yet Chipotle had the best post-earnings performance of the Big Cap 20. Shares soared 8% the day after the earnings report, as investors turned optimistic on third-quarter sales and traffic trends . Chipotle remains near new highs.Reynolds American (RAI) also has done well since its quarterly report. The tobacco company is up about 10% since its second-quarter earnings topped expectations and the company raised its full-year outlook.

329,ILMN,"Genomics firm Illumina (ILMN) dipped Monday on news of a competing high-end gene sequencer, while lower-end rival Bio-Reference Laboratories (BRLI) rose despite missing quarterly expectations.At the European Human Genetics Conference over the weekend, Complete Genomics, a unit of BGI (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute), previewed its Revolocity sequencing system, a ""supersequencer"" designed to deliver as many as 30,000 whole genome sequences per year. This high volume, Leerink analyst Dan Leonard said in a research note Monday, will enable sequencing at a cost of about $1,000 per genome, a landmark that Illumina first hit with its HiSeq X system rolled out last year.Leonard noted that while Illumina has several competitors in small-scale, targeted sequencing, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Qiagen (QGEN) and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO), Revolocity will be the first high-throughput rival.""We believe the biggest promised differentiating feature of the Complete Genomics system is the sample-to-answer capability of the workflow,"" Leonard wrote. ""BGI promises to enable users to input genomic DNA, blood or saliva, and walk away; the instrument proposes to automate the sequencing process from sample prep to basic data analysis/variant calls.""Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote in a note, however, that Illumina is a tough competitor.""To Illumina's credit, they have thwarted most if not all challengers efficiently and are certain to have anticipated this launch, given their constant paranoia,"" Muken wrote in a research report Monday. ""Thus for now we view these updates with a skeptical eye, although we do acknowledge that this launch has the potential to modestly impact near-term ordering patterns (manufacturing not yet up to commercial scale, and thus Complete likely hoped to delay purchases via early reveal) and possibly shift a small amount of share (2 customers already announced).""Illumina stock recorded a new high close of 210.21 Friday; but in late-morning trading on the stock market today, it was down a fraction, near 209.Meanwhile, Bio-Reference Labs stock was up more than 7%, even though its fiscal Q2 report was soft. The company's revenue climbed 11% over the year-earlier quarter to $224 million, about $4 million short of analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Profit rose 3% to 38 cents a share, missing estimates by 5 cents.Nonetheless, in a statement, Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman highlighted the growth in his firm's sequencing business, which was a key selling point in its $1.47 billion sale to Opko Health (OPK), announced last week. Opko stock was up more than 5% in late-morning trading Monday.""Over 23,000 patients for sequencing tests were referred to us under (Bio-Reference genetics lab) GeneDx requisitions, not including those from other Bio-Reference business units in Women's Health and Oncology,"" Grodman said. ""This is an increase of 54%. This increase could have been higher if there had not been the impact of higher deductible plans, an impact we expect to lessen as we continue through the calendar year.""Opko and Bio-Reference said that they'll hold a conference call to discuss their merger Thursday morning, in lieu of an earnings call Monday.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

Volume was tracking higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq in the stock market today vs. the same time Monday.Nearly all of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD were down.

The auto-parts store operator reported fiscal Q4 results before the open that topped views.Mobile home and recreational vehicle makers, biotechs and drugmakers were among the biggest losers.

336,ILMN,"Gene-sequencing giant Illumina beat analysts' Q2 earnings estimates Tuesday but missed on revenue for the first time in six years, sending shares down 9.5% in after-hours trading.Illumina (ILMN) said income excluding one-time items amounted to 80 cents a share, up 41% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 21% to $539 million, about $3 million short of consensus. That was the third straight quarter of decelerating sales growth.On a constant-currency basis, sales rose 25%, the company said.Illumina affirmed its full-year guidance for 20% sales growth, including a 3% impact from foreign-exchange rates. The firm raised its full-year EPS range by 3 cents to $3.39 to $3.45, but that was still on the low side of analysts' $3.44 consensus estimate.Expectations seemed to be high going in, as the stock hit a new high of 242.37 on Monday. On Tuesday it grew wobbly, however, closing down just shy of 1% in the regular session, at 237.54.Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken noted that this is the first time Illumina missed Wall Street's revenue expectations since 2009, and that management has raised its revenue guidance 80% of the time in past Q2 reports. The Street had been widely anticipating a beat-and-raise, Muken wrote in an email to clients Tuesday.""Despite the top-line shortfall, strong operating-margin pull-through allowed for a modest EPS beat and enabled a slight upward tweak to guidance,"" he added.Instrument Sales Down Vs. Q1It was also the first time in more than two years that instrument revenue declined sequentially, Muken pointed out. On a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Illumina President Francis deSouza said instrument sales overall rose 13% year over year, but shipments of the high-end HiSeq X gene sequencer had fallen compared with last year, when the product had just been rolled out with much fanfare. On the other hand, the lower-end NextSeq and MySeq were continuing to grow nicely, he said. Overall, sequencing revenue grew 28%.CEO Jay Flatley said that another growth area was reproductive health, a field Illumina entered by acquisition a few years ago.""Sales to IVF (in vitro fertilization) laboratories increased 25% in Q2, with approximately 20% of sales coming from VeriSeq PGS,"" said Flatley. ""As a reminder, VeriSeq PGS (is) our sequencing-based, pre-implantation genetic sequencing solution used as laboratories transition from the older arrays.""Total NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing) revenue grew more than 50% vs. the second quarter of last year. This result was due in part to a doubling of test send-out samples, as well as an increase in product sales to NIPT providers globally.""Flatley also praised the 35% growth in shipments to oncology customers, a customer base that Illumina has been trying to expand lately.Illumina has launched a special cancer panel and liquid biopsy program to serve this market.But revenue from microarrays, the oldest and lowest-end of Illumina's businesses, shrank 11%.Volume actually grew 29% in that business, Flatley said, but the pricing environment was harsh.Illumina has been facing more competition in that area lately from players such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and Roche (RHHBY).

433,ILMN,"A good stock idea isn't much use if you don't understand what you're looking at. Is it an institutional-quality stock? Is it a cyclical play that probably will only profit from its industry cycle? Is it a turnaround story that involves the fixing of a company problem? Is it a fad stock that will run hot until people tire of the novelty?
"
434,ILMN,"The strategy and target will differ for each of these situations, and it will vary by the kind of uptrend the market is in.Peg the stock wrong or the market wrong, and you will probably lose money or at least make less than you should.If an investor is going to make big money, institutional-quality stocks, operating in a strong uptrend, will most often be the investor's best choice. However, there are times when a cyclical stock, turnaround or fad stock can deliver good gains.Where can an investor find or identify great stock ideas? Your Weekly Review (YWR), also known as the 85-85 list, is a good place to look in Friday's IBD.In this screen, stocks must score an 85 in EPS Rating and in Relative Price Strength Rating. The 85 means that the stocks must be in the top 15 percentile among stocks in IBD's database. Stocks also must be within 15% of a 12-month high.Charts are listed by industry group, but charts aren't printed for every stock. Additional stocks are listed in the fine-print listing on the last page of YWR, today on A8.The big net makes the 85-85 a good place to look for stock ideas. A low-hurdle screen will pick up more cyclicals, turnarounds and fad stocks than a high-hurdle screen.Some people sneer at ""fad stocks."" They argue that such stocks are dangerous, won't last and aren't for serious investors.Well, all stocks are dangerous. While fad stocks might have a shorter life, sometimes all we're talking about is a solid company indirectly benefiting from a fad.For example, egg producer and distributor Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) rode the Atkins diet to big stock gains in 2003.In other cases, fads develop into longer-lasting trends.For instance, Deckers Outdoor (DECK) bought UGG Holdings in August 1995 and eventually turned the Ugg boots — once popular mostly with surfers — into a broader fashion trend.From October 2002 to October 2011, Deckers Outdoors shares rose 9,193%, with Uggs deserving much of the credit.How might the 85-85 be used?Let's look at the 85-85 screen that was published in IBD on Oct. 24, 2014, not long after a market low and the Oct. 21 follow-through day. A follow-through day soon after a market low is often the best time to scout for breakouts, retaking of buy points and bounces off the 10-week moving average, as seen in the minicharts.An investor could've found five institutional-quality stocks in the 85-85 that soon set valid entries: Apple (AAPL), Celgene (CELG), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Illumina (ILMN) and Skyworks (SWKS). Gains varied from 15% to 79%.Four cyclicals in the 85-85 eventually offered entries: Landstar System (LSTR), Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), FedEx (FDX) and Lennar (LEN). Gains ran from 11% to 15%.Turnarounds and fads were scarce.The market itself was and had been choppy, which is why taking a 10% to 15% profit in Apple was prudent.

The company pre-announced Q4 sales of $512 million, up 32%, earlier this month.The investment house also noted that the company's entire system portfolio is also outperforming expectations.Wedbush raised its price target on Illumina stock Wednesday to $230 from $200 and kept its outperform rating.Maxim Group Equity Research raised its price target on Illumina stock to 255 from 236 in a Wednesday report, noting the company's strong Q4 report and 2015 guidance, ""with no signs of growth letting up.""Maxim kept its buy rating on the stock. ""Growth was strongest in the United States and Europe, while strong growth in China was offset by weakness in Japan,"" Maxim's report said.Illumina said late Tuesday that it had earned 87 cents a share in Q4, a 93% rise from last year that topped views by 9 cents. Revenue grew 32% to $512 million, above estimates for $506 million.Illumina stock fell 1.7% to 199.78 in morning trading in the stock market today.Illumina seesawed after the close Tuesday following the better-than-expected earnings report.

The mutual fund was up 4.58% this year going into Tuesday vs. 3.98% for its midcap peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 1.41% for the S&P 500, a proxy for the stock market. It carries an A Rating from IBD for 36-month performance.
"
448,ILMN,"This stock fund has not changed its stripes. Manager Tim Parton said, ""I'm interested in investing in the strongest companies with the biggest market shares and the strongest competitive barriers, which give them earnings durability.""
"
449,ILMN,"For Parton, stock investment ideas like that fall into three categories. One consists of what he calls disrupters. Acuity Brands (AYI) is one. The building products firm was the fund's biggest position as of Jan. 31.
"
450,ILMN,"Their niche is commercial lighting. Their driver is the growing popularity of LED lights. Their 20% market share makes them the dominant player in their space.
"
451,ILMN,"The cost of chips that are the heart of LEDs is falling, making LED systems more attractive to customers that are constructing or retrofitting buildings, Parton says.
"
452,ILMN,"LEDs give property owners more control over lighting and lower key fixed costs, Parton says.
"
453,ILMN,"""Acuity's LED business has doubled every year for three years,"" Parton added. ""Now it's over 40% of their total business, which means the average growth rate of the whole company is going up.""
"
454,ILMN,"All That Jazz
"
455,ILMN,"Consolidators are another of Parton's categories. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) is an example.
"
456,ILMN,"It replaced Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) among fund holdings after it became too large for this midcap fund. Like Valeant, Jazz is based offshore — in low-tax Ireland, in Jazz's case. ""That's quite an advantage in making acquisitions,"" Parton said. ""It hasn't been super-active to date, but it probably will be.""
"
457,ILMN,"Parton likes Jazz's Xyrem narcolepsy drug. It has little competition, but potential abuse concerns attract strict regulatory oversight, he says.
"
458,ILMN,"""Overall, the company has strong cash flow and a low tax rate, and it will take that platform to layer more things on top,"" Parton said.
"
459,ILMN,"His third category consists of pioneers. ""Illumina (ILMN) is pretty much the granddaddy of genome sequencing machines,"" he said. ""They sell the machines as well as the consumables inside.""
"
460,ILMN,"The cost of sequencing someone's genome has plunged to about $1,000 from millions of dollars since about 2000. The technology and falling cost puts Illumina at the heart of ""the way medicine will be done in the future,"" Parton said.
"
461,ILMN,"Illumina's Dominance
"
462,ILMN,"Illumina is already the 800-pound gorilla in its field, and its dominance is still growing, Parton says.
"
463,ILMN,"Parton boosted his stake in Acadia Health Care (ACHC), another consolidator, between June and Dec. 31. The firm runs a chain of psychiatric facilities in the U.S. and U.K.
"
464,ILMN,"Their field is highly fragmented, Parton says. ""It's a business that can be improved a lot by tight, professional management, which is what Acadia offers.""
"
465,ILMN,"Acadia continues to make good acquisitions at good prices. ""So the deals are highly accretive to earnings,"" Parton said.After trailing the S&P 500 for three straight quarters, $2.6 billion JPMorgan Mid Cap Growth is outperforming this year.

Their 20% market share makes them the dominant player in their space.The cost of chips that are the heart of LEDs is falling, making LED systems more attractive to customers that are constructing or retrofitting buildings, Parton says.LEDs give property owners more control over lighting and lower key fixed costs, Parton says.""Acuity's LED business has doubled every year for three years,"" Parton added. ""Now it's over 40% of their total business, which means the average growth rate of the whole company is going up.""All That JazzConsolidators are another of Parton's categories. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) is an example.It replaced Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) among fund holdings after it became too large for this midcap fund. Like Valeant, Jazz is based offshore — in low-tax Ireland, in Jazz's case. ""That's quite an advantage in making acquisitions,"" Parton said. ""It hasn't been super-active to date, but it probably will be.""Parton likes Jazz's Xyrem narcolepsy drug. It has little competition, but potential abuse concerns attract strict regulatory oversight, he says.""Overall, the company has strong cash flow and a low tax rate, and it will take that platform to layer more things on top,"" Parton said.His third category consists of pioneers. ""Illumina (ILMN) is pretty much the granddaddy of genome sequencing machines,"" he said. ""They sell the machines as well as the consumables inside.""The cost of sequencing someone's genome has plunged to about $1,000 from millions of dollars since about 2000. The technology and falling cost puts Illumina at the heart of ""the way medicine will be done in the future,"" Parton said.Illumina's DominanceIllumina is already the 800-pound gorilla in its field, and its dominance is still growing, Parton says.Parton boosted his stake in Acadia Health Care (ACHC), another consolidator, between June and Dec. 31. The firm runs a chain of psychiatric facilities in the U.S. and U.K.Their field is highly fragmented, Parton says. ""It's a business that can be improved a lot by tight, professional management, which is what Acadia offers.""Acadia continues to make good acquisitions at good prices. ""So the deals are highly accretive to earnings,"" Parton said.

475,ILMN,"The stock market often does what's least expected, and that certainly has been the case lately. Consider these four recent occurrences: A heavy distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in recent weeks didn't do much damage to the market. In fact, the market uptrend resumed Thursday when the Nasdaq marked an all-time closing high, rising 1.3% in higher volume.After showing signs of a climax top last month, Ambarella (AMBA) found support at its 10-week moving average again, rising nearly 12% for the week.Regeneron (REGN) is holding near highs despite a series of breakouts from late-stage bases.And right when it looked like Centene (CNC) was going to roll over after a massive price run, it's back above its 50-day moving averageSo it goes in today's market.The good news is that the action in several other IBD 50 names has been far from confusing. The IBD 50 rose 3.6% for the week, ahead of the S&P 500's 2.4% gain but below a 4.25% gain for the Nasdaq.Celgene (CELG) gapped out of an 18-week, cup-shaped base Wednesday, rising 7% in strong volume, after it announced plans to acquire Receptos (RCPT) for just over $7 billion. One of Receptos' key drugs is multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis treatment ozanimod. It's not approved yet, but early trials have been promising.Celgene's weekly chart looks solid. It's still in a buy range, just over 3% above a 129.16 buy point.Small-cap Fleetmatics (FLTX), a member of Wednesday's list, is at the high end of a buy range from a 48.06 cup-with-handle buy point.Monster Beverage (MNST) is in a similar boat as it trades near a 139.75 buy point.Meanwhile, several IBD 50 names are reporting earnings this week.Illumina (ILMN) and Blackhawk Network (HAWK) report Tuesday after the close. Celgene and Valeant (VRX) report Thursday after the close.Valeant is working on a late-stage, flat base with a 246.11 buy point. The base is strengthened by several tight weekly closes.Valeant has pursued an aggressive growth-through-acquisition strategy in recent years. Earlier this year, it bought Salix Pharmaceuticals for around $14.5 billion. In 2013, it scooped up Bausch & Lomb for nearly $9 billion.Q2 profit at Valeant is seen rising 29% from a year ago to $2.46 a share.

523,ILMN,"Even as the market chops back and forth, some Spotlight leaders are working on long weekly winning streaks. When a stock closes higher for multiple weeks in a row, especially five or more, it's a noteworthy sign of steady accumulation by big funds.This is a useful trait to spot while a stock is basing and even after it has broken out and is moving higher. When a stock breaks out of an early-stage base and is able to climb many weeks in a row, it signals that its shares are in big demand and have a good chance to continue even higher in the future.One such stock is PRA Health Sciences (PRAH), which closed higher for the eighth straight week on Friday. The stock is extended about 10% from a 32.09 buy point and has nearly doubled from its IPO price of 18.PRA debuted in November and is one of the world's largest contract research organizations (CROs). PRA offers traditional, project-based trial services as well as what it calls embedded and functional outsourcing services, where PRA integrates with a client's internal developing operations to manage drug development.PRA operates from more than 70 offices worldwide with approximately 11,000 employees. It's part of the highly ranked medical research and equipment industry group. INC Research Holdings (INCR) and Icon (ICLR) are other highly-rated contract research organizations from the group. Both stocks are working on new base patterns.Other Spotlight stocks showing weekly win streaks include medicals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Illumina (ILMN). Both stocks are in buy range after breaking out this week from lengthy consolidations.Chip play Inphi (IPHI) has also climbed for seven straight weeks. Inphi shares are holding just above a 24.69 three-weeks-tight buy point. The stock is also near a 20% profit target for those who bought a 21.43 breakout in late April.

594,ILMN,"The main stock indexes made positive price reversals Tuesday, the latest in the market's run of mixed signals. The Nasdaq, down as much as 0.9% early on, closed only 0.2% lower. Weakness in biotech, solar and some technology stocks hurt the composite. The Nasdaq did close back above its 50-day moving average, which made its reversal all the more interesting.…

595,ILMN,"A promising early rebound fizzled Wednesday, leaving the major indexes to a flat finish. Indeed, if such movement continues in the stock market, expect more players to get worn out rather than shaken out. One divergence lies within the leadership, however.

596,ILMN,"IBD's Big Cap Leaders screen filters through highly liquid, large-cap stocks with a strong record of earnings growth. Eight top-notch medical stocks that made the screen's cut are Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Actavis (ACT), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron (REGN), Shire (SHPG) and Illumina (ILMN).
"
597,ILMN," Valeant Pharmaceuticals has a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning its shares outperform 99% of all stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors. Some of those factors are earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.
"
598,ILMN,"Valeant completed its $11.1 billion acquisition of Salix Pharmaceuticals on April 1. Salix and partner Pharming Group came out Monday with good interim data on the phase-two clinical trial of their conestat alfa drug, Ruconest, developed for the treatment of angioedema attacks. (That's allergy-related swelling.)
"
599,ILMN,"Valeant shares, which eased 0.6% Tuesday, are 61% extended past a cup-with-handle base buy point of 147.39, initially cleared last December.
"
600,ILMN," Actavis, along with its partner Perrigo (PRGO), announced on Tuesday that its new drug application for guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine tablets, a Mucinex D alternative, was given FDA approval.
"
601,ILMN,"Last week its eluxadoline drug, Viberzi, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, also received FDA approval.
"
602,ILMN,"Actavis is trying to stay above a cup-with-handle base buy point of 305.87, initially cleared last Wednesday. It closed off 1% Tuesday to 305.66. Actavis has a 99 Composite Rating, the best.
"
603,ILMN," Gilead has an IBD Composite Rating of 98. The biotech announced on Sunday that the phase-three trial results for its idelalisib drug, Zydelig, in combination with ofatumumab, showed the improvement of progression-free survival in previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
"
604,ILMN,"Last week, the European Medicines Agency validated Gilead's marketing application for its emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide combination for HIV treatment. The investigational combination is now under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency.
"
605,ILMN,"Shares, which barely closed off 0.1% Tuesday at 113.94, are 2% below a 116.93 buy point from a 7-month-long price consolidation.
"
606,ILMN," Celgene is another biotech with a 98 Composite Rating. BMO Capital last week reiterated its outperform rating on Celgene in part because of future prospects for its pleiotropic modulator, CC-122.
"
607,ILMN,"The stock is forming a price consolidation with a 129.16 buy point.
"
608,ILMN," Biogen, a biotech that earns a 97 Composite Rating, is now trading 19% off its March 20 peak of 480.18. That price was reached in a nearly four-month-long, 38% run out of a price consolidation.
"
609,ILMN," Regeneron broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 486.10 buy point in mid-May and gained as much as 7% from that level. In Tuesday's session, the biotech's shares dipped back into the 5% buy range. Regeneron boasts a 99 Composite Rating.
"
610,ILMN," Shire cleared a 258.54 buy point from a flat base on May 21, but the ethical-drug maker's stock is now trading back below that level. Shire has a 97 Composite Rating.
"
611,ILMN," Illumina, which makes gene sequencing systems, is working on a price consolidation with a 213.43 buy point. Last week, shares got within 1.4% of that pivot, but are now trading 3% below that level.

646,ILMN,"Four big drug companies gave mixed fourth-quarter reports and guidance Tuesday as patent losses and foreign-exchange rates clouded the near-term future, while gene-sequencer Illumina posted better-than-expected earnings.After the close, Amgen (AMGN) said its Q4 earnings rose 19% to $2.16 a share, beating consensus by 11 cents. Revenue for the big biotech rose 6% to $5.33 billion, more than $100 million above views.The company affirmed 2015 guidance of single-digit sales and profit growth it issued in October, and its stock was up nearly 1% after hours.Also after the close, Illumina (ILMN) reported profit of 87 cents a share, up 93% from the year-earlier quarter and 9 cents ahead of estimates. It also affirmed previous guidance. The company preannounced Q4 sales of $512 million, up 32%, earlier this month.The other three companies reported before the open.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) said its Q4 profit excluding one-time items was 46 cents a share, down 10% but 5 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales fell 4% to $4.26 billion, beating views by $200 million.For the year, earnings rose 2% to $1.85 a share, with sales slipping 3% to $15.9 billion.The company guided 2015 EPS in the range of $1.55 to $1.70, missing the Street's estimate of $1.71. Sales guidance of $14 billion to $15 billion also missed.On a conference call with analysts, executives said the impact of the strong dollar shaved $800 million off the 2015 guidance and 12 to 14 cents off EPS guidance. A strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive and less competitive, and it shrinks profit on sales that American companies make in euros and other denominations when the firms bring that money back home.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover wrote in a research note that while patent losses will continue to depress operating results this year, he's bullish on Bristol's immuno-oncology pipeline, starting with the recently approved Opdivo.

Analysts had expected $2.17 and $45.6 billion.In a statement, CFO Frank D'Amelio said the revenue guidance ""reflects the anticipated negative impact of $3.5 billion due to recent and expected product losses of exclusivity, as well as $2.8 billion as a result of recent adverse changes in essentially all foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.""S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo lowered his rating on Pfizer to hold from buy. BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said the guidance ""underscores the company's need for a deal"" after its failure to buy AstraZeneca (AZN) last year.On Pfizer's call, CEO Ian Read declined to comment on rumors that Pfizer has been rebuffed by other large targets, but said, ""I don't feel that we need to do a large deal.""Pfizer's stock fell a fraction.Novartis (NVS) had a softer Q4 than the other two, but its stock rose 2.5% as it gave a more encouraging forecast for operating growth.Novartis' Q4 sales declined 2% to $14.6 billion, missing the Street's estimate of $14.7 billion. Earnings rose 3% to $1.21 a share, in line.Full-year sales rose 1% to $58 billion while EPS rose 4% to $5.23.The company said FX should shave 12% off 2015 income, but on a constant-currency basis, sales this year should rise in the midsingle digits while earnings should increase in the high single digits.""Following the corporate restructuring ... we expect Novartis will post stronger margins and have the scale to be in a stronger competitive position with its remaining business lines of drugs, eye-care products and generics,"" Conover wrote in a note Tuesday.

Recent breakouts have been a mixed bag at best. Most Big Cap 20 leaders are hovering just above or just below recent buy points. The best way to handle a lackluster market like this is to keep exposure modest until more breakouts can prove themselves by showing decent gains.Cut losses if sell signals start appearing, and keep a good portion of your powder dry. Stocks that have been able to hold above recent entries include AbbVie (ABBV), Cigna (CI) and Analog Devices (ADI).AbbVie broke out from a cup-with-handle base on May 26 in heavy volume. Shares have traded tight since and remain in buy range past the 66.76 buy point.The giant drugmaker reported accelerating earnings and sales in the most recent quarter.Managed health care provider Cigna is still in buy range past a 135.10 flat-base buy point it cleared in heavy trade on May 22.Analog Devices is pulling back after a heavy volume breakout on May 20. Shares are still in buy range, but like many chip stocks, early breakout gains are in danger of disappearing. On the other hand, stocks like Nike (NKE), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and CarMax (KMX) have all slipped below recent buy points.There are no sell signals so far.Nike is testing support at its 10-week line below a 103.89 buy point. The latest pattern is part of a base-on-base that stretches back to November.Nike is expected to report 6% profit growth when it releases fiscal fourth-quarter results, which ended in May. Sales are expected to climb 3% to $7.67 billion.CarMax broke out from a cup-with-handle base on Friday in light trade, but turned lower Monday. Shares remain just below a 73.30 buy point.CarMax will report fiscal Q1 results on June 19 before the market open. Analysts are looking for earnings to climb 13% to 86 cents a share on 11% revenue growth.It would be the used car dealer's fifth straight quarter of double-digit earnings and sales growth.After some decent initial progress, Skyworks Solutions has returned below a 102.87 flat-base buy point. Volume has been mostly light as the stock pulled back, which is a positive sign. Watch to see if the long-time leader can find support near the breakout price and the 10-week moving average.On the plus side, Regeneron (REGN) is acting well after a low-volume breakout in May. The base was late stage, but shares have gained as much as 12% from the 486.10 buy point and remain extended out of buy range.Stocks still basing include Salesforce.com (CRM), Facebook (FB), Gilead (GILD) and Illumina (ILMN).

788,ILMN,"On Monday at the conference, Summit, N.J.-based drugmaker Celgene (CELG) gave a generally bullish forecast for its flagship cancer-fighting drug Revlimid, which accounts for an estimated 66% of sales.
"
789,ILMN,"Celgene expects overall sales to climb to about $20 billion by 2020, up from about $7.34 billion in 2014.
"
790,ILMN,"Near term, Celgene guided Q4 sales below views, partly on negative currency effects; but preliminary EPS topped Wall Street targets. Sales of Revlimid will climb about 14% to $5.6 billion-$5.7 billion in 2015 as the drug gains approvals to treat more types of cancer.
"
791,ILMN,"Celgene stock formed a cup-with-handle base from January to mid-June with an 80.03 buy point. It gapped up and has risen about 50%. On Tuesday, the stock rose 2.6% to 119.98, hitting a new high after rising 2.9% Monday. Celgene stock cleared a 1-month consolidation that's too short to be a proper base; it is extended above its 50-day and 200-day averages.

792,ILMN,"Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.Top-rated medical stocks such as Illumina (ILMN) are bullish on 2015. At the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco this week, several talked about earnings and sales prospects or announced new takeover deals.IBD's Screen Of The Day is Big Cap Leaders, top-rated stocks generally priced above 15 with a market capitalization of at least $15 billion. Today's screen includes five large drug and other medical stocks with proven track records.Illumina Outlook CautiousGene sequencing equipment maker Illumina on Monday said that it will collaborate with Lockheed Martin (LMT) to develop next-generation gene-sequencing gear. ""We envision the advantages of early national adoption for countries across the globe"" to lower health care costs, Lockheed Health & Life Sciences vice president Horace Blackman said.On Monday at the JPMorgan conference, Illumina reported preliminary Q4 revenue of $512 million, beating estimates of $503.9 million. But its full-year guidance was conservative. The IBD Leaderboard stock just cleared a flat base last week, hitting an intraday peak of 198.48 on Friday; but the stock fell 2.4% on Monday. On Tuesday, it fell 2.6%, closing below its 50-day moving average.Biogen Buying ConvergenceCambridge, Mass.-based Biogen Idec (BIIB) develops treatments for a variety of ailments, including multiple sclerosis, cancer and autoimmune diseases.On Sunday, Biogen agreed to buy the privately held U.K.-based drugmaker Convergence Pharmaceuticals for up to $675 million if milestones are met, expanding Biogen's presence in pain-management drugs. Convergence is developing drugs to treat chronic nerve pain.Biogen rose as high as 361.91 Tuesday, a whisker below its all-time high set on Dec. 19, before closing at 352.74, up 1.4%.Shire To Buy NPS PharmaIn January of 2014, Ireland-based Shire (SHPG) bought U.S. biotech ViroPharma, which specializes in rare-disease drugs, for $4.2 billion. Shire began 2015 with a $5.2 billion buyout bid for NPS Pharmaceuticals (NPSP), another biopharma focused on rare diseases.Shire shares plunged more than 30% to 170.50 on Oct. 15. That's when AbbVie (ABBV) withdrew a $55 billion buyout offer after the Treasury Department tightened rules to limit tax inversions. A tax inversion is a maneuver in which a U.S. company buys a company based in another country and shifts its own headquarters to that country to get a lower tax rate.Shire has partly recovered, but its stock fell 3.9% on Monday. The stock closed down 1.7% on Tuesday at 205.66, below its 50-day line.Actavis Sees 'Exceptional' SalesActavis (ACT), another Irish drugmaker, recently agreed to buy Botox maker Allergan (AGN) for $66 billion, topping a hostile bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX). The pairing will create a global top-10 drugmaker, with combined annual revenue of more than $23 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.Actavis said Monday at the JPMorgan conference that it expects its Q4 EPS to top Wall Street estimates by 10%-15% amid strong sales. Actavis consolidated from late November through Monday, when it rose to an all-time high. It touched an intraday high at 272.28 Tuesday but pulled back to close down 1%.Celgene Bullish On RevlimidOn Monday at the conference, Summit, N.J.-based drugmaker Celgene (CELG) gave a generally bullish forecast for its flagship cancer-fighting drug Revlimid, which accounts for an estimated 66% of sales.Celgene expects overall sales to climb to about $20 billion by 2020, up from about $7.34 billion in 2014.Near term, Celgene guided Q4 sales below views, partly on negative currency effects; but preliminary EPS topped Wall Street targets.

"
801,ILMN,"When it comes to developing cutting-edge real estate for Big Pharma and tech firms, Alexandria Real Estate Equities CEO Joel Marcus has refined a tried-and-true formula.Started by Marcus back in 1994, Alexandria (ARE) is a real estate investment trust focused on developing science and technology campuses in top urban clusters, adjacent to leading academic and medical institutions, in order to create a collaborative environment.The company's activity is centered on science hubs — such as Cambridge, Mass., the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego and New York City.""Our platform focuses on irreplaceable urban innovation centers,"" Marcus told IBD.""They're great places to recruit talent, the transportation is good and they have a 24/7 work-play environment,"" he added. ""We try to own and operate and dominate the market in these irreplaceable markets.""The facilities are high tech and advanced, he says, and they include the kind of infrastructure that companies need to do research and development.""We take the campus location and state-of-the-art facilities and marry them at the intersection of science and technology,"" Marcus said. ""That's really been the secret of our success.""Building For Big NamesUsing this approach, Alexandria has developed campuses for drugmakers such as Eli Lilly (LLY), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE), plus IBD Leaderboard stock Illumina (ILMN), a genetic-testing equipment maker.This year, which marks Alexandria's 20th anniversary, the company has had plenty of cause to celebrate. Earnings have started to grow again, with double-digit increases the past two quarters, after no gains from the end of 2011 through 2013.In the third quarter, earnings rose 14% to $1.21 a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2014 earnings to rise 11% to $4.79 a share following declines the prior four years. They see an 8% rise in 2015 and a 4% increase in 2016.Alexandria's stock price has lifted 36% this year.What's been fueling its growth? Marcus says Alexandria has several factors working in its favor.""We're in a very good economic environment, the Fed has kept interest rates low and we've seen substantially rising rents in urban innovation markets,"" he said. ""There's also a constrained supply. The demand we're seeing from the life science and tech sectors are the highest levels we've seen in the 20-year history of the company.""Marcus adds that the company is seeing ""strong internal growth,"" driven by high occupancy and increasing rental rates in its core markets of Cambridge, San Francisco and New York.Alexandria has a $1 billion pipeline of projects under construction, around 85% of which are leased or under negotiations, says Marcus. That's the highest pre-lease level Alexandria has had.The company has another $1 billion pipeline of projects it will put into play in 2015, he says, adding that both pipelines will help drive ""strong demand and continued up earnings"" over the next few years.Marcus, who used to work as a capital markets lawyer, founded Alexandria to address the real estate infrastructure needs of the biotech industry, which he says were unfilled at the time.""We have a first-mover advantage in almost every market in real estate development,"" he said. ""We focus on urban innovation campuses, and no one else really does that.""Healthy Outlook?RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Carroll says one competitor is BioMed Realty Trust (BMR). It's a REIT focused on providing real estate to the life science industry. Other REITs also dabble in the space, he adds, but it's the location of Alexandria's campuses in urban cluster markets that's the differentiating factor.Carroll said the macro environment for the life science industry looks good: ""You're starting to see the pharma tenants that used to own their own real estate in other locations are finding they're getting better results (in terms of) their ability to do research and collaborate more with people within the industry when they move to these core cluster markets owned by other landlords.""Alexandria has been able to create cluster market campuses in some of the major markets in the U.S., Carroll adds.""Now that tech tenants are finding that they like that atmosphere, they're getting demand from tech tenants too,"" he said.One recent tech project, announced in September, is a strategic partnership with app developer Uber Technologies, whose low-fare ride-sharing service has caught on as a taxi alternative. The project includes the acquisition of two key parcels in the Mission Bay area of San Francisco.What's The Deal With Uber?These parcels will support 422,980 rentable square feet of new, ground-up facilities. The joint venture will be 51% owned by Alexandria and 49% by Uber. It will let Uber expand its corporate headquarters in San Francisco in conjunction with a 15-year lease for the entire project.Alexandria is expected to break ground on the project in January 2015 and finish it by the end of 2016.Mission Bay is home to a campus of the University of California, San Francisco, as well as Alexandria's science and technology cluster, which was recently selected to house the future arena of the Golden State Warriors of the NBA.Marcus said the Uber venture is ""very significant because it has very strong yields, and shareholders will reap the benefits with great cash flow.""It represents a milestone to bring more tech companies to Mission Bay, which historically was more of a life science destination, Marcus adds.Carroll also called the venture with Uber significant: ""There's a lot of demand in that area ... in Mission Bay South of Market (SoMa) in San Francisco.""With a market cap around $6.2 billion, Alexandria is one of the smaller companies in IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group; the largest is Simon Property Group (SPG) with a market cap of $56.6 billion.The group ranks No. 79 in performance of the 197 that IBD tracks.The Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, where several of Alexandria's customers reside, ranks No. 23, and Medical-Biomed/Biotech ranks No. 4.

844,ILMN,"Successful investing requires longevity.After all, it's a lifelong pursuit, so objective number one is to keep yourself in the game.That's why IBD's golden rule is to sell any stock that falls 7%-8% below the price you paid for it. This one simple rule will keep you in the game through many mistakes. Following it always gives you the chance to take advantage of future opportunities.""You positively must understand and accept that the first rule for the highly successful individual investor is... always cut short and limit every single loss,"" IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in his book ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""It is not always necessary to wait for a 7%-8% loss before selling. If your stock isn't acting right or the general market is under severe distribution, it makes sense to cut losses even faster.The 8% rule is not arbitrary. IBD research has shown that a leading stock breaking out of a proper base rarely falls 8% below its proper buy point. So a stock that's down 8% from a proper buy point is giving you valuable feedback.If you take three or four 8% losses in a row then there is likely either a problem with your stock selection or the general market may be rolling over. In either case it pays to pause and examine recent trades.Another critical reason to cut every loss short is the basic math of how large losses work against your portfolio. An 8% loss requires an 8.7% gain to break even. But as the size of the loss grows, the required break-even gain grows even faster. A 50% loss requires a 100% gain, and a 75% loss requires a whopping 300% gain just to recover the loss.Investors may have a hard time imagining their stock selection falling 75%, but every big loss in the stock market starts as a small loss. Consider that the average stock in IBD's model book of huge market winners corrects 72% once it finally tops. Investing in stocks is simply too uncertain to play without a defensive safety net.Let's take a look at the 8% loss-cutting rule in action on Illumina (ILMN).Back in early July 2011, the stock was setting up in a base-on-base pattern following a powerful prior run-up. The base was second stage and well constructed, showing several weeks of tight trading.On July 5, Illumina broke out past a 76.91 buy point in volume 52% above average. The relative strength line was near a new high. CAN SLIM investors could have confidently stepped up and bought shares.Yet nine sessions later the stock was down 8% from the proper buy point (1) to 70.76, triggering an automatic sell signal. Disappointing, but not devastating.What happened next? The stock rallied back above its 50-day line to as high as 74.68, perhaps making you feel foolish for selling out at the ""low."" However, the stock then imploded in dramatic fashion, dropping 67% from the buy point in less than three months to 25.57. Amid the fall, Illumina reported four quarters of sales declines. It took years for the stock to recover.What went wrong? The key point: Get out when your stock is down 8%, without thinking, without hesitation. By the time a reason surfaces your portfolio may have suffered serious unnecessary damage.

"
946,ILMN,"Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
"
947,ILMN,"Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.
"
948,ILMN,"Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
949,ILMN,"Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.
"
950,ILMN,"Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.
"
951,ILMN,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
952,ILMN,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
953,ILMN,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
954,ILMN,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!
"
955,ILMN,"IBD: And at Fidelity?
"
956,ILMN,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
957,ILMN,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
958,ILMN,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.
"
959,ILMN,"IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?
"
960,ILMN,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
961,ILMN,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
962,ILMN,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
963,ILMN,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
964,ILMN,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
965,ILMN,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
966,ILMN,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
967,ILMN,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
968,ILMN,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
969,ILMN,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
970,ILMN,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
971,ILMN,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
972,ILMN,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
973,ILMN,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
974,ILMN,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
975,ILMN,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
976,ILMN,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
977,ILMN,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"
978,ILMN,"The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.
"
979,ILMN,"It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.
"
980,ILMN,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
981,ILMN,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.
"
982,ILMN,"I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.
"
983,ILMN,"I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).
"
984,ILMN,"IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?
"
985,ILMN,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.
"
986,ILMN,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).
"
987,ILMN,"Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.
"
988,ILMN,"IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?
"
989,ILMN,"Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.
"
990,ILMN,"If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.
"
991,ILMN,"IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?
"
992,ILMN,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.
"
993,ILMN,"They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.
"
994,ILMN,"It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.
"
995,ILMN,"IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?
"
996,ILMN,"Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.
"
997,ILMN,"One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.
"
998,ILMN,"IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.
"
999,ILMN,"Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.
"
1000,ILMN,"IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?
"
1001,ILMN,"Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.
"
1002,ILMN,"Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.
"
1003,ILMN,"IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?
"
1004,ILMN,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.
"
1005,ILMN,"Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.
"
1006,ILMN,"Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.
"
1007,ILMN,"IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?
"
1008,ILMN,"Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.
"
1009,ILMN,"Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.
"
1010,ILMN,"He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.
"
1011,ILMN,"And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.
"
1012,ILMN,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!IBD: And at Fidelity?Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.It's a little harder to predict P-E.IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.IBD: Give me an example, please.Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up.

1101,ILMN,"Illumina's (ILMN) systems target an array of genetic analysis, which have huge implications for medical research.

Sales climbed 21% to $331 million, also beating views.Illumina's quarterly record is a bit choppy. That 28% profit rise follows three reports showing gains of 5%, 86% and 20%.Earnings should grow 6% in 2013 and 18% in 2014, consensus says.The medical-research group stands in 16th place out of IBD's 197 industries.A June 10 research note from health care-focused investment bank Leerink Swann outlines the potential risks to what it says is an overall attractive picture: cuts in research budgets, lower stimulus spending and ""growth initiatives outside the company's research sweet spot (e.g., diagnostics, consumer genetics).
"
1102,ILMN,"A stock that gaps up is flashing a bullish sign.The gap up means the stock opens higher than any price in the previous day's range. Further, the stock stays above the previous day's high throughout the session. The result is air on the chart.The Big Cap 20 features quite a few stocks that have gapped up in recent weeks or months.Online social platform operator Facebook (FB) staged a 30% gap up in late July, then advanced strongly.In late December, the stock delivered a stingy-looking gap up. The low of the gap up was barely above the high of the previous day.Facebook slid sideways to down for about six weeks after that poor man's gap up. A disciplined investor probably would've cut losses during the choppy period.A more convincing Facebook gap up occurred Jan. 30. The stock thrust 14% higher in heavy volume. Since then, it's made three new highs. The stock's about 10% above the close of the gap-up session.Biogen (BIIB) gapped up 13% in November after finding support at its 50-day line. The biomed stock consolidated after the gap up, but is 11% above the gap-up day close.Gene-sequencing company Illumina (ILMN) has delivered a series of gap-ups since April. The stock gapped up 13% in April, 10% in July, 10% in October, and 3% and 9% on Jan. 16-17. The stock is 157% past the close of its April gap up and 18% past its most recent gap up.Sometimes a stock will move sideways after a gap up before advancing again. Other times it will advance immediately after the gap up. Cyber memory company Micron Technology (MU) did both.The stock gapped up 11% on March 22, then shaped and broke out of a six-week flat base. Later, the stock gapped up 5% on Sept. 4 and immediately began an advance. Last month, Micron gapped up 10%. The stock made a new high Monday.After consolidating in a shallow pattern for five months, Google (GOOG) gapped up 14% on Oct. 18. The stock advanced an additional 16% from the gap-up close.Google's advance came after it reported quarterly results that topped the Street's views on Q3 earnings and revenue.This is fairly common. Facebook's Jan. 30 gap up also was on strong quarterly results. The same was true for Micron Technology.Sometimes an investor wonders if he or she should buy a stock when an earnings report is near. Waiting for the earnings report — then buying fundamentally strong stocks that gap up on earnings — is probably a better bet.The problem with buying before a quarterly release is that stocks can gap down if results disappoint. Boeing (BA), a former Big Cap 20 stock, gapped down 5% on Jan. 29 on strong earnings but cautious guidance. This was the second gap down in four sessions. Selling on the first gap down on Jan. 24 could've offered some protection.

1171,ILMN,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

1209,ILMN,"Special Report: Race To Retirement
"
1210,ILMN,"Talk about scary. Last year, 81-year-old H. Burt Hiester's portfolio slumped 4%. Almost all of the loss came from the REITs he held. Aiming for dividend yield, the retired Cumberland, Md., insurance salesman focused on mortgage REITs. But that category lost 2% on average last year, according to NAREIT.com.
"
1211,ILMN,"And that was during a great year for most investors, as the S&P 500 soared 32.39%.
"
1212,ILMN,"So Hiester, who trades through TDAmeritrade, is on high alert for what's ahead because he knows that this year's market is supposed to be tougher and choppier. He's married, so his portfolio impacts his wife as well.
"
1213,ILMN,"Adding to his concern, the Federal Reserve's ongoing tapering of bond buys looms like a guillotine over bond proxies such as his REITs. Ditto for the prospect of outright rate hikes at some point.

Cantor Fitzgerald and William Blair both raised their price targets on the stock, to 121 and 158, respectively.Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) surged 12% for the week.

The drug, bought by Jazz in its acquisition of Gentium, treats a rare disease affecting blood circulation in the liver.The stock ended in buy range, 4% above the buy point in the second-stage, cup-with-handle base. Sixty-seven mutual funds with A+ ratings based on three-year performance hold shares in Jazz.Lake Forest, Ill.-based Akorn (AKRX) ended the week 7% higher, after easing back from a 17% spike. The result left shares 35% above a 25.19 buy point in a cup with handle. That base undercut its prior pattern, resetting Akorn's base count. The stock cleared the buy point April 30 in light trade.Gilead Sciences (GILD) climbed 6% to a new high, ending the week not quite 5% above an 83.80 buy point in a cup base.

It finished 14% above a 161.10 buy point from a cup-with-handle base.Outside of the pharmaceutical space, Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) popped 6%, breaking above a 189.59 buy point in a three-weeks tight pattern.

1330,ILMN,"Analysts were singing the praises of life-science giants Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Illumina (ILMN) Wednesday morning after both surged above Q1 estimates late Tuesday. Shares of both companies were up on the stock market today.
"
1331,ILMN,"Gilead's $2.3 billion in sales for its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi was called ""one of the most impressive beats in biopharma history"" by Piper Jaffray's Joshua Schimmer, although he increased his price target by only a dollar to 105. Gilead was up 3% in morning trading Wednesday, near 75.
"
1332,ILMN,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee lifted his 2014 sales estimate to $9.5 billion from his previous $7.4 billion, and added $1.05 to his full-year EPS estimate, now $6.15. He expects Sovaldi sales to hit $11.5 billion next year, with EPS reaching $7.
"
1333,ILMN,"Nomura's Ian Somaiya lifted his price target to 130 from 121. He wrote that Gilead's position in the HCV market is sustainable, and he says Sovaldi and the new Sovaldi-based combo pill expected to launch later this year are superior to competing products from AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK).
"
1334,ILMN,"Cowen's Phil Nadeau was also impressed, but noted that lengthy discussion of ""payor pushback"" on Tuesday's earnings call provided ""probably not nearly enough resolution to satisfy investors."" Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) and insurer United Health (UNH) have both criticized Sovaldi's $84,000 price.
"
1335,ILMN,"""Gilead did discuss pharmacoeconomic arguments that support the price of Sovaldi, such as the value of a cure to the health care system, and the cost of treating patients with end stage liver disease ($42k/yr),"" Nadeau wrote. ""While we found Gilead's discussion and datapoints encouraging, we suspect that investor concerns over payors' ability to limit access to Sovaldi and shuttle patients to competing regimens will linger until ABBV's pricing strategy is known (presumably after approval) and payor strategies are defined in early 2015.""
"
1336,ILMN,"Meanwhile, gene-testing company Illumina was up 6% Wednesday morning, near 156, after it beat estimates and raised guidance. Sales rose 27% over the year-earlier quarter to $421 million, nearly $30 million above consensus. Earnings climbed 15% to 53 cents a share, topping estimates by 9 cents.
"
1337,ILMN,"The company now expects full-year sales growth of 21% to 23%, with EPS of $2.10 to $2.15. Both ranges are above consensus.
"
1338,ILMN,"Leerink analyst Dan Leonard wrote in a note Tuesday that the report ""exceeded even what we would have considered a best-case scenario in the face of multiple new instrument launches,"" and lifted his price target to 180 from 160. He wrote that the launches of the new HiSeq and MiSeq gene-sequencing systems did not appear to be cannibalizing from older versions. He added that orders for the HiSeq X Ten system, which Illumina announced in January with some fanfare due to its claim that it can sequence genomes for $1,000 apiece, were double the initial target.
"
1339,ILMN,"ISI Group's Ross Muken noted that demand was up across Illumina's entire sequencing portfolio, and raised his price target to 162.50 from 152.50 to reflect increased EPS forecasts. However, he maintained his neutral rating on the stock, saying that the current price already reflects 20% annual revenue growth.

1385,ILMN,"The stock market today sets out with the current uptrend in good standing.

"
1394,ILMN,"Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.
"
1395,ILMN,"This approach is working. It has made his $9.7 billion Artisan Mid Cap Fund a top performer among the largest diversified U.S. stock portfolios.
"
1396,ILMN,"In the 12 months ended Jan. 31, its 31.18% return topped 91% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its 16.94% average annual gain in the past three years topped 92% of its rivals.
"
1397,ILMN,"Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.
"
1398,ILMN,"IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap . How does managing different cap-size and style funds help you?
"
1399,ILMN,"Kamm: Our team includes a group of analysts and five portfolio managers who work collaboratively to identify best ideas. We've been at this over 15 years. That level of tenure and trust is important.
"
1400,ILMN,"We look up and down the market-cap scale and globally. That gives us broad perspective. We like to think we're better midcap investors because we know small-cap competitors and international emerging markets competitors that U.S. midcap companies increasingly face.
"
1401,ILMN,"IBD: You divide your portfolio into three types of stocks. What's the advantage?
"
1402,ILMN,"Kamm: The nomenclature we use is garden, crop and harvest.
"
1403,ILMN,"Garden stocks are ones we believe are just emerging. We try to be early into them. We guard against risk by keeping garden positions small.
"
1404,ILMN,"When a garden position turns out right and profit growth plays out, we allocate more into it and push it into our crop bucket or portfolio. Those are our largest positions and fewest positions. That's where we feel the profit cycle has been largely de-risked.
"
1405,ILMN,"The third area is harvest, where we reduce positions.
"
1406,ILMN,"IBD: How are you tweaking new buys to cope with the expected slow-growth economy?
"
1407,ILMN,"Kamm: We've been focused on uniquely positioned franchises that are exposed to some strong growth trends. You see some signs, especially in the U.S., that the economy is getting better. Housing and jobs are examples. But emerging markets are struggling to grow at the same rates they experienced a few years ago.
"
1408,ILMN,"We're focused on durable, high-quality franchises. We're less interested in high-commodity businesses and materials. And those business models are very cyclical, economy sensitive, but tend not to meet our franchise characteristics criteria.
"
1409,ILMN,"IBD: What are some real-world examples, please, as of your latest disclosure?
"
1410,ILMN,"Kamm: We're focused on innovation in health care. We're 10 years past the first sequencing of the human genome. Now we're seeing benefits in novel drug targets.
"
1411,ILMN,"Regeneron (REGN) is an example. They have a drug called Eylea, which is a retinal drug for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for the elderly. It was launched in 2011. In its second full year it sold $1.4 billion. It's a strong driver of company sales and profits.
"
1412,ILMN,"Regeneron also has a diverse pipeline of additional opportunities to extend its profit cycle into the future.
"
1413,ILMN,"They were all discovered in Regeneron's own labs, but primarily funded by Sanofi, a large French drug company, in return for the ability to market these drugs and share profits.
"
1414,ILMN,"IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) recently gapped up after reporting strong results and guidance. Its 30% earnings per share growth was the second straight quarterly acceleration. What's your thesis?
"
1415,ILMN,"Kamm: We think they're positioned for growth. They have a very strong brand associated with high-quality ingredients. They have a significant opportunity to grow their footprint of restaurants in the U.S., and ultimately internationally.
"
1416,ILMN,"They're executing well. They're getting customers through serving lines quicker. They've enhanced menus. They're offering office catering. They're able to drive solid same-store comps year-over-year and make restaurants more profitable through higher volumes.
"
1417,ILMN,"They've resisted increasing prices to the same extent that a lot of restaurants have. Instead, they're driving growth through higher volume and traffic.
"
1418,ILMN,"IBD: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has had a great run and just gapped up the other day. What makes you think it still has room to run?
"
1419,ILMN,"Kamm: It fits our innovation theme. Their sales and profits are driven by Solaris, a biologic drug that's approved for two ultrarare, very serious diseases, not just in the U.S. but globally.
"
1420,ILMN,"They still have room to run because both uses of Solaris still have a lot of growth ahead of them. There's still a lot of opportunity to reach more patients.
"
1421,ILMN,"Solaris is also being tested for three or four additional ultrarare diseases, where early clinical data are encouraging. In three or four years, there will be additional (treatment) approvals for Solaris.
"
1422,ILMN,"They also have asfotase alpha (which targets certain bone diseases and tooth losses), which is expected to be approved later this year.
"
1423,ILMN,"IBD: Is broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) a play on a growing economy?
"
1424,ILMN,"Kamm: They're the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. They've grown by attracting financial advisers away from big banks and wire houses, giving them independence to grow their practices in ways they see fit, and letting them keep a larger percent of their profits.
"
1425,ILMN,"They continue to gain market share, and we like market-share gainers. We like companies that can outgrow the market in a sustainable way.
"
1426,ILMN,"Also, LPL captures some of the float on cash balances that customers keep with them. (Float refers to earnings on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account.) While rates were low, there was not so much float to capture. But if rates rise as the economy improves, then LPL earnings will accelerate.
"
1427,ILMN,"IBD: Where's the innovation in a stock like athletic wear seller Under Armour (UA)?
"
1428,ILMN,"Kamm: The innovation is in new materials that deliver better performance, whether sweat-wicking or shielding athletes from heat or cold. Companies like Under Armour and Nike (NKE) and Adidas have been able to grow by innovating product lines and driving increased value to customers.
"
1429,ILMN,"Under Armour has a great brand with athletes, especially young athletes, who are inclined to spend more. They're expanding into other categories, such as footwear via cleats. And that's translating into more traditional ware like running shoes.
"
1430,ILMN,"They've been mostly a U.S. brand, but they're extending their brand internationally and driving additional growth outside the U.S. So we think they still have a long runway. They're in our bucket category.
"
1431,ILMN,"IBD: Am I right in thinking you like Illumina's (ILMN) genomic sequencing advances?
"
1432,ILMN,"Kamm: Gene sequencing is a transformational technology. In 2007 they launched a next-generation sequencing platform. Cost of sequencing began to fall, leading to big growth in the market. They launched (on Jan. 14) another new product (the HiSeq X Ten) that delivers the first $1,000 genome, a target that researchers have been fixed on for five or six years.
"
1433,ILMN,"So they're the center of action in human genetic research and have significant growth opportunities as they make these tools even more affordable.
"
1434,ILMN,"IBD: TripAdvisor (TRIP) has pulled back from its Nov. 15 high. And earnings per share fell in the most recent quarter. Why aren't you concerned?
"
1435,ILMN,"Kamm: They're the leading review site for hotels and other travel destinations globally. They've moved toward a bidding model, where companies bid for placement on a TripAdvisor site. It's almost like bidding for Google (GOOG) search terms. Earnings have declined during this process because it is a transition. They're foregoing some older advertising measures as they move customers to the new bidding system. Until this new system starts to mature, their profits are lower.
"
1436,ILMN,"This was expected. That's why it's a garden investment. It will move up as they get through the transitional period.
"
1437,ILMN,"IBD: Cepheid (CPHD) has uptrended since June. Why has it shown so much volatility in quarterly earnings?
"
1438,ILMN,"Kamm: This is a crop position. They make diagnostic systems that let hospitals easily identify molecular markers of disease in patients. That used to be a complex, time-consuming process that required highly trained staff. Cepheid made GeneXpert, which automated it. You put a blood sample into a plastic cartridge, which goes into the instrument, and you get the answer. So more hospitals can do molecular testing.
"
1439,ILMN,"The company ran into manufacturing challenges, which hurt earnings. Over (the past year) they've addressed those issues, exited 2013 in a better place in terms of inventory and ability to provide test cartridges to customers. And they have a broad pipeline of new tests that they've brought to market. Now they have to leverage their new systems to do a broader range of tests.
"
1440,ILMN,"IBD: Is Fortune Brands (FBHS) a play on the housing rebound?
"
1441,ILMN,"Kamm: They're a leading housing-products company, and this is a crop position.
"
1442,ILMN,"They have a leading position in fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms, cabinets, faucets and locks in what tend to be attractive segments. It became clear last year that the U.S. housing market was coming out of the depths of the downturn. Fortune has been gaining share in key markets. That's delivering strong margin expansion, and margins are still below the peaks of the last housing cycle, so it's reasonable to assume that margins can continue to rise.
"
1443,ILMN,"IBD: The rate of growth of LinkedIn's (LNKD) earnings per share have declined for two quarters. You've added to your stake in several recent disclosures. What's your game plan?
"
1444,ILMN,"Kamm: LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting and hiring market. The main advantage is that people update their resumes and profiles even when they're not actively looking for a job. People who are hiring can access a rich database of not just job-seekers but also of people who would be open to the right opportunity. That's valuable to corporate HR departments.
"
1445,ILMN,"In recent years LinkedIn has been investing to improve its mobile smartphone and tablet tools and provide more content, more articles and experts who write on topics that are relevant. That brings people to the site more frequently and with a higher level of engagement. And that translates into more advertising dollars for LinkedIn. There's not only a growing number of recruiters who subscribe to the platform. There's also growing advertising business. All of this has a long way to run.
"
1446,ILMN,"IBD: You began your current stake in Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) in September. Why do you like this particular casino stock?
"
1447,ILMN,"Kamm: They're a leading casino operator in Macau and the Cotai Strip (in Macau), which is well known as a high-growth market, noticeably larger than Las Vegas. The subtle shift in the market in recent years is that the market is no longer driven primarily by high rollers, ultrahigh net worth individuals gaming in Macau. It is driven by the mass market today.
"
1448,ILMN,"Melco's properties are well positioned to serve the mass market. And that part of the market is more profitable than the high-net-worth part. Melco is working to open new properties, which will expand its earnings potential.
"
1449,ILMN,"Also, transportation to Macau is improving. And we're seeing changes that make it more attractive for destination travel, not just gambling demand.
"
1450,ILMN,"IBD: Your stake in Tractor Supply (TSCO) has edged up.
"
1451,ILMN,"Kamm: They're the leading supply store for recreational farms and the rural lifestyle. They have 1,300 stores today. We think they have potential for at least 2,100 stores. As they grow, they've done a good job of increasing productivity of existing stores. They've done a good job of understanding their business data.
"
1452,ILMN,"They've done a good job with e-commerce to leverage their brand outside their physical stores. They've done a good job of laying in private label goods within the store to provide different price points and help expand their own margins. All of those drivers have potential in the coming years.Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.This approach is working.

(APTO  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in APTO.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from a loss of 72 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 88 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Aptose Biosciences has seen one downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 20 cents a share from a loss of 17 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 19.2% in the past month.Aptose Biosciences, Inc.

1589,ILMN,"The revival in the ever-volatile biotech sector has not lived up to expectations so far in 2018. The performance of biotech bigwigs has been affected by the slowdown in progress of the key drugs. Competitive pressure has also adversely impacted the top line.While issues like drug pricing and competition will remain headwinds, an ace investor will know that the biotech sector can be a lucrative market for investment. Moreover, it is widely expected that the sector will rebound in the second half of the year.New drug approvals had boosted investor sentiment to a certain extent in the first half. Moreover, the approval of these drugs should boost their respective companies’ top line as a few of them are struggling with a decline in sales of legacy drugs. We believe new drug approvals, label expansion of existing high-profile drugs, pipeline progress, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should positively impact performance.Owing to competitive pressure, quite a few companies have resorted to cost-cutting initiatives, which in turn should propel the bottom line somewhat.Meanwhile, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have picked up pace in the sector as a slowdown in mature products has forced companies to eye lucrative acquisitions to bolster their pipeline. Additionally, the increase in M&A activity is also being propelled by the implementation of the new tax law which has slashed corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.The new tax reform is also luring corporates to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%. We expect many more such deals in the latter half as well.Industry Lags on Shareholder ReturnsEven though the macroeconomic conditions look better than those in 2017, the price performance so far in 2018 has not been that impressive. As mentioned above, the decline in sales of legacy drugs and pipeline setbacks have adversely impacted the price performance of the key biotech players and in turn has pulled down the average for the industry.The Zacks Biomedical and Genetics Industry, which is a 281-stock group within the broader Zacks Medical Sector, has underperformed the S&P 500 and the sector it belongs to on a year-to-date basis.While the stocks in this industry have collectively declined 6.4%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and the Zacks Medical Sector have risen 1.7% and declined 1.1% year to date, respectively. The magnitude of decline in bigger companies has more than offset gains recorded by the small biotechnology companies.Year-to-Date Price Performance Biotech Stocks Trading CheapGiven the underperformance of the industry so far this year, the valuation looks cheap now. Valuation is a tricky business for the biotech companies. It takes several years for a drug to get regulatory approval and so the regular price multiple ratios do not provide a fair picture for biotech companies. More importantly, these companies spend a lot on R&D and hence it is more complex to account for such high expenses on an uncertain future revenue stream.While there is always uncertainty regarding trial results and FDA decisions, one might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price/book ratio. The industry currently has a Price/Book TTM ratio of 3.45, which is toward the highest level in the past year as well as the past five years. When compared with the highest level of 3.57 and median level of 2.18 over the past year, we believe investors can wait for any dip to enter the market.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the Medical market at large, as the current as well as median Price/Book TTM ratio for the Medical sector is 4.34 and 4.12, respectively.                                        Price-to-Book Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Compared to the Zacks S&P 500 Composite too, the space looks inexpensive. The current ratio for the S&P 500 of 3.85 and the median level of 3.74 for the same period are above the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry’s respective ratios.                                        Price-to-Book Trailing Twelve Months (TTM)                                                            In addition to using Price/Book ratio, which is a standard multiple to value any company, price-to-free cash flow is good metric for evaluating smaller biotech companies that do not have any approved drug in their portfolio and are more or less dependent on collaborations for their funding. Given the high levels of R&D, this is a good metric to judge a biotech company.Even using the price-to-free cash flow (adjusted) metric, the space looks inexpensive compared with the Medical market at large, as the current price-to-free cash flow (adjusted) ratio for the Medical market is 11.65 while that for Medical- Biomedical and Genetics industry is 6.5.                                                   Price-to-Free Cash Flow Earnings Outlook Looks NegativeWhile the above ratio analysis shows that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead, one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year’s reported number. But an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates. The trend in earnings estimate revisions has not been favorable either. Pipeline setbacks have led to many companies slashing their outlook.                    Price and Consensus: Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industryLooking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have started to lose confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 4.5% downward since May 31.                                Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Prospects for ImprovementThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.The Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #163, which places it at the bottom 39% of more than 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has deteriorated considerably in the past two weeks.Small Biotechs Promise Long-Term GrowthWhile the near-term outlook is not encouraging, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Biotech industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate reached a trough at the start of the quarter but has revived thereafter to reach the current level of 13.47%. This also compares favorably with 9.98% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite, the highest level in past one year.                                     Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate An important indication of solid long-term prospect of smaller biotech companies is improvement in the free cash flow yield. The image below shows a consistence performance in the group’s free cash flow yield since 2017.                    Free Cash Flow Yield- Zacks Biomedical and Genetics Industry Growing demand for drugs particularly targeted for personalized therapies, increase in the incidence of chronic diseases and technological advancements, evolving treatment regimens, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track in the long term. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that push up costs and a slowdown in innovation should also provide benefits.Bottom LineThe Biomedical and Genetics industry is continuously evolving and largely volatile. In such a scenario, biotech companies are expected to adopt innovative business models, invest in new technologies, increase investments in personalized medicines and seek external partners and collabora¬tors for complementary strengths.The sector is stumble upon challenges posed by the drug pricing issue, pricing/re-imbursement pressure, increasing competition, slowdown in legacy product sales, loss of patent exclusivity of some key drugs and pipeline related setbacks.However, pipeline success in innovative and important therapeutic areas, cost cutting, share buybacks, new product launches, increased M&A activity and appropriate utilization of cash may bring the sector back on track this year.The industry currently has quite a few stocks, which sport either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Here, we list a few such stocks that have also been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions.Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) is one of the leading biotech companies in the world.

1590,ILMN,"Alkermes plc. (ALKS  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Aristada Initio (aripiprazole lauroxil) extended-release product for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. The approval of Aristada Initio makes Aristada the first and only long-acting atypical antipsychotic that can be initiated on day one, which plays a significant role to treat a complex disease like schizophrenia.Aristada Initio leverages proprietary NanoCrystal technology, and the drug utilizes a smaller particle size than Alkermes’ Aristada, an injectable atypical antipsychotic medication that also contains aripiprazole lauroxil.Previously, the standard regimen included being dosed with Aristada for 21 consecutive days once the first dose started. However, the Aristada Initio regimen provides patients with relevant levels of aripiprazole within 4 days of initiation. This is an alternative initiation regimen, which allows the physicians and caregivers to fully dose patients with up to two months of coverage with a proven medication in their system.Although Aristada and Aristada Initio both contain aripiprazole lauroxil, the 2 medications are not interchangeable because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles. Aristada Initio provides faster dissolution, and leads to more rapid achievement of relevant levels of aripiprazole. Aristada Initio is expected to be available in mid-July. Aristada Initio can be used for initiation onto any dose of Aristada (441 mg, 662 mg or 882 mg monthly, 882 mg once every six weeks and 1064 mg once every two months), offering a wide range of flexible dosing options for patients and healthcare providers.The approval of Aristada Initio will further strengthen Alkermes’ portfolio and will boost its revenues.Year to date, shares of Alkermes have declined 24% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.6%.The company has another candidate ALKS 3831 in phase III being evaluated for the treatment of schizophrenia.

1592,ILMN,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics sector have probably already heard of Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Illumina (ILMN  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Amgen and Illumina are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.AMGN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.51, while ILMN has a forward P/E of 56.69.

1594,ILMN,"Decoding the mysteries in the human DNA and genomic sequencing was a far-fetched idea just a decade ago. Not to forget, it took 13 years and an investment of more than $3 billion for the first human genomic sequencing.But now, a genome can be sequenced in just a couple of days, which costs lesser than the latest iPhone (Healthcare IT News). Analysts believe that growing demand for personalized medicine, solid investments and rise in research activities have propelled growth.Buoyed by these trends, Genomics has received a warm response from the MedTech investment space within healthcare. Per Markets and Markets, the global Genomics market, which was worth $13.45 billion in 2016, is expected to reach $23.88 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 10.2%.In fact, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical And Genetics industry rose 2.2% in a month’s time compared with the S&P 500 index's return of 0.3%. So here we discuss about how Genomics has been creating opportunities in MedTech for investors who are keen on putting their money in the healthcare space for solid gains.  Favorable Trends Drive Genomics MarketsThe global Genomics markets have been favored by a streak of solid developments in sequencing, microarray, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), Nucleic acid extraction and Purification techniques.Further, the implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud-based technologies and increased R&D focus have provided the companies with significant exposure to Genomics and lent a competitive edge in the MedTech space of late.With ‘gene editing’ and synthetic DNA production already in vogue, we are not very far from the era where gene can be customized per requirement. A research report by the techcrunch suggests that a highly advanced CRISPR technology is capable of splicing and editing genes in lung cancer and leukemia.In this regard, Pacific Biosciences of California’s (PACB  -  Free Report) Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing technology deserves a mention. This technology helps scientists observe the DNA synthesis in real time by harnessing the natural process of replication started by the enzyme DNA polymerase.

1596,ILMN,"Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) has announced a number of results from various studies to treat diabetes.Novo Nordisk announced positive new results from phase IIIa study, PIONEER 1, comparing 3, 7 and 14 mg oral formulation of Ozempic compared with placebo as monotherapy over 26 weeks in adults with type II diabetes.The study met its primary objective by demonstrating that people treated with any of the three doses of oral Ozempic achieved significant reductionsin blood glucose levels (HbA1c) compared to placebo. Furthermore, people treated with 14 mg oral Ozempic achieved significant reductions (p<0.001) in weight versus placebo, while weight reductions with 7 mg and 3 mg doses did not reach statistical significance.The company also announced results from the SUSTAIN 7 study, which showed that Ozempic 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg provided greater weight reductions compared with dulaglutide 0.75 mg or 1.5 mg, respectively, in adults with type II diabetes, regardless of baseline body mass index (BMI). The greatest reductions occurred in adults with a baseline BMI greater than 25 kg/m2. While the primary endpoint of SUSTAIN 7 was change in HbA1c, this post-hoc exploratory analysis examined the secondary endpoint of change in body weight by baseline BMI.The company also announced data from the CONFIRM study, comparing the effectiveness of Tresiba (insulin degludec injection) versus insulin glargine U300 in more than 4,000 adults with type II diabetes, who were starting basal insulin for the first time. The study showed that, after six months, those treated with Tresiba had significantly lower HbA1c compared to those treated with insulin glargine U300. As a secondary endpoint, there was a 30% lower rate of hypoglycaemic episodes with Tresiba compared to insulin glargine U300. The study also showed another secondary endpoint, where people treated with Tresiba were more likely to stay on their treatment. Those treated with insulin glargine U300 had a 37% higher rate of discontinuing treatment after two years.In another release, the company also posts results from the DUAL IX study, which showed that Xultophy (insulin degludec and liraglutide injection) provided superior HbA1ccompared to insulin glargine U-100 (1.94% vs 1.68% respectively; p<0.0001) when used as an add-on to an SGLT-2i (an oral diabetes medication). Shares of the company have moved down 12.7% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%. All the data look encouraging and should bode well for the company as these candidates will help in generating revenues once they get approved. Novo Nordisk A/S Price  Novo Nordisk A/S Price | Novo Nordisk A/S Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNovo Nordisk has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Illumina, Inc.

1597,ILMN,"Shares of Anika Therapeutics Inc (ANIK  -  Free Report) slumped 37% after the company reported disappointing data from its phase III Cingal 16-02 study. The 16-02 trial compared Cingal, a combination of cross-linked HA and triamcinolone hexacetonide (TH), with TH alone and cross-linked HA in treating patients with osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee. The primary endpoint was a comparison of the pain reduction of Cingal compared with TH alone at 26-weeks. While Cingal achieved greater pain reduction numerically at every time point in the study, the difference at 26-weeks did not reach statistical significance.Year to date, share price of the company decreased 16.3% compared with the industry’s decline of 5.7%.The study showed a strong safety profile which matched with the previous clinical studies (13-01 phase III study). The duration of pain reduction was also similar to the previous study as patient improvement after Cingal injection was maintained near peak levels throughout the 26-week duration of the study.Though the company expected Cingal to perform like it did in the other study, the difference in pain reduction seen in this study did not reach statistically significant levels at six months. Anika is currently following up with the patients in a prospectively designed extension phase of the trial, which will collect data through 39 weeks.Cingal is the first and only commercially-available combination viscosupplement, and it is currently being used successfully by physicians to provide rapid and long-lasting relief from pain and discomfort caused by OA for patients in a growing number of countries. The company will continue to monitor the results of the ongoing 3-month extension study and is actively reviewing the data and plans to work closely with regulators to come to an understanding of the next steps required to gain U.S. regulatory approval of Cingal.Anika Therapeutics Inc.

1598,ILMN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report)) submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for approval of ALXN1210, the company’s investigational long-acting C5 complement inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).The company uses a rare disease priority review voucher, which enables the FDA to expedite the review in eight months, instead of the standard 12 months. Priority Review designation from the FDA is generally granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. The application is supported by data from two rigorous phase III studies in the largest population of patients with PNH ever studied The studies included patients who had never received a complement inhibitor, and patients who were stable on Alexion’s lead drugSoliris (eculizumab) and switched to ALXN1210. The objective of the studies was to demonstrate that patients with PNH can be effectively and safely switched from treatment with Soliris, every two weeks, to treatment with ALXN1210, every eight weeks. Weight-optimized treatment with ALXN1210, every eight weeks, demonstrated non-inferiority to treatment every two weeks with Soliris on all primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints, in both studies.Moreover, none of the patients, treated with ALXN1210, experienced breakthrough hemolysis (one of the key secondary endpoints) compared to five patients treated with Soliris.In addition to the BLA in the United States, Alexion is preparing submissions for the approval of ALXN1210 as a treatment for patients with PNH in the European Union (EU) by mid-year and in Japan in the second half of the year.Year to date, shares of Alexion have increased 2% against the industry’s decline of 5.8%. Further, Alexion is enrolling pediatric PNH patients in a phase III study of ALXN1210. The study includes patients who have never received treatment with a complement inhibitor and those who enter the study stabilized on Soliris. Patients are also being enrolled and dosed in a phase III trial, with ALXN1210 administered intravenously, every eight weeks, in complement inhibitor treatment-naive adolescent and adult patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The company is expected to complete enrollment in the second quarter and announce the results in the fourth quarter of 2018. Enrollment and dosing are also ongoing in a phase III trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with aHUS.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1600,ILMN,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report) plunged 12.3% after the company announced that its division, Ortho Dermatologics, has received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for its New Drug Application (NDA) for Duobrii.The CRL was issued due to questions related to pharmacokinetic data. However, the CRL did not mention any deficiencies related to the clinical efficacy or safety of Duobrii.Duobrii lotion ((halobetasol propionate and tazarotene) (IDP-118) is being evaluated for the treatment of plaque psoriasis.Valeant will now work with the FDA and resolve the matter.The news comes as a big disappointment for Valeant as it is now banking on new drug approvals to propel its top line. Duobrii is one of the key products in that pipeline and a delay in approval will dampen management projections.While Ortho Dermatologics continue to be impacted by transition issues, Valeant had projected Duobrii as one of the key growth drivers going forward and a potential approval would have boosted the company’s struggling dermatology portfolio as well. The FDA had earlier approved its psoriasis treatment, Siliq, following which the drug was launched. Siliq is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients, who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and have failed to respond or have lost response to other systemic therapies. Valeant entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report), granting the former an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Siliq globally, except in Japan and certain other Asian countries where the rights are held by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd.  The agreement was amended in July 2016 to entitle Valeant the right to develop and commercialize Siliq in Europe.Hence, a potential approval of Duobrii would have further boosted the dermatology portfolio as the market for plaque psoriasis holds great potential.Once an acquisition giant, Valeant has been caught up in various controversies since October 2015.  Of late, things were looking up for Valeant as the company started a rebuilding process with its CEO, Joseph C. Papa. Even though it is still early to comment on the rebuilding process, the company’s efforts to sell non-core assets and pay down huge levels of debt is commendable. Valeant’s stock has gained 13.4% in the year so far compared to the gain of 4.8% for the industry.Meanwhile, new drug approvals have boosted investor sentiment for the company. Valeant received clearance for the Thermage FLX System for non-invasively smooth skin on the face, eyes and body.  Earlier, the company received the FDA filing acceptance for the NDA for Plenvu (NER1006), a novel, low volume polyethylene glycol-based bowel preparation for colonoscopies. The company also obtained FDA approval of Vyzulta, a treatment option for glaucoma. The FDA also approved Lumify, the over-the-counter eye drop with low-dose brimonidine for the treatment of eye redness.  The FDA has also accepted New Drug Applications for Altreno (IDP-121), an acne treatment in lotion form; PDUFA action date of Aug 27, 2018 and Bryhali (IDP-122), a topical treatment for plaque psoriasis; PDUFA action date of Oct 5, 2018.Zacks Rank & Key PicksValeant currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1601,ILMN,"On Jun 18, we issued an updated research report on QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report). The company’s business is expected to get a boost from its flourishing molecular diagnostic market, international expansion, extended test menu and growth-driving strategic collaborations. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This Netherlands-based molecular diagnostics provider offers innovative technologies and products for pre-analytical sample preparation and molecular diagnostics solutions. Shares of the company have outperformed the broader industry over the past six months. The stock has rallied 14.6% versus the 8% decline of the industry. QIAGEN ended the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note. We are impressed with the year-over-year growth across most segments. The company also delivered a strong performance with respect to the operating margin. Meanwhile, its commitment to return more to shareholders through increased repurchases reflects its sturdy cash position. Expectations of a favorable currency movement in the ongoing year also buoy optimism among investors.We are also upbeat about QIAGEN’s progress with the test menu expansion strategy. In April, the company announced the receipt of FDA’s pre-market approval for PartoSure. In the same month, it launched QIAstat-Dx in Europe following the closure of the recently-announced Stat-Dx acquisition and the completion of defined development activities by Stat-Dx. The company is planning to launch the test in the United States as well as across other geographies in 2019. QIAGEN also launched two novel liquid biopsy panels, namely AdnaTest ProstateCancerPanel AR-V7 Kit and AdnaTest LungCancer Kit.During the first quarter, QIAGEN announced receiving an approval from Japan’s Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare for QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) as an in vitro diagnostic to detect tuberculosis (TB) infection. Further, the recently-changed guidelines issued by the World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and International Panel Physicians Association will add new impetus to the rising popularity of proactive latent TB screening and treatment.We also look forward to the implementation of the recently-drawn strategies to boost top-line contributions from the NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) portfolio.Meanwhile, QIAGEN is exposed to stiff competition. The company is facing severe rivalry from firms providing competitive pre-analytical solutions and other products used by QIAGEN’s customers. The fact that markets for some of the company’s products are highly aggressive and price sensitive, further aggravates the company’s woes. Also, a heavy reliance on collaborations and declining HPV (Human papillomavirus) sales in the United States are other negatives for this industry player.Zacks Rank & Key PicksQIAGEN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1602,ILMN,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of Health Canada approval for the new Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays for respiratory virus infections.The Panther Fusion respiratory assays include the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV, Panther Fusion Paraflu and Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV tests. Further, these PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based assays offer a highly-advanced approach to syndromic testing via the ability to run one, two or all three assays from a single patient’s specimen, based on the patient’s requirements.According to the company, these new assays, when combined with the Aptima transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assays, enable the Panther Fusion system — as the only instrument — to combine TMA, real-time TMA and real-time PCR with full sample to result automation.Notably, the Panther Fusion module is an in-lab upgrade to the original Panther instrument. Apart from the Panther platform’s existing benefits, this new system adds flexibility of PCR to the proven performance of TMA, used by the Panther system.Further, as a result of this new system, certain additional benefits like increased flexibility, enhanced time and cost efficiency will also be obtained by laboratories.Per the company, regulatory approval was also obtained for three new assays for flu and respiratory infections. This extended the variety of diagnostic tests, capable of being run on the Hologic system.Market ProspectsPer CISION, the molecular diagnostics market is projected to reach $10.12 billion at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2016 to 2021. Considering this huge market potential, we believe, the company’s latest development is quite strategic.Hologic is consistently trying to expand its Diagnostic segment, which generated 35.4% of total revenues in the last reported quarter, despite facing a year-over-year decline of 5.5%. Under this segment, Molecular Diagnostics revenues increased 6.1% (4.4% at constant exchange rate).Stock Performance SolidOver the past three months, Hologic has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 6.4% against the 12.7% decline of the industry. Recent Regulatory Approvals at a GlanceRecently, Hologic announced the receipt of medical device license, issued by Health Canada, to distribute Cynosure’s non-invasive body contouring product, SculpSure, for treating the back, inner and outer thighs, and submental area.Moreover, the company announced that the FDA has granted premarket approval (PMA) for the ThinPrep Integrated Imager, which will make automated imaging of Pap tests broadly available to laboratories and cytologists in the United States in April.The company's Clarity HD high-resolution 3D imaging and Intelligent 2D imaging technology have also received PMA approval from the U.S. FDA and are now available on the 3Dimensions breast tomosynthesis system.Again, in January, Hologic announced that FDA has granted PMA approval for the Aptima HBV Quant Assay for quantitation of hepatitis B viral load on the fully-automated Panther system.Its Cynosure division also announced the launch of TempSure Envi in the same month. This is an FDA-cleared advanced radiofrequency device that minimizes facial fine lines and wrinkles, tightens skin through soft tissue coagulation, and improves the appearance of cellulite.We believe this recent spree of regulatory approvals for the company’s array of products is going to boost the share price further.Zacks Rank and Key PicksHologic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report), Amedisys, Inc.

1603,ILMN,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. After all, efficiency is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health.Moreover, a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.How to Measure Efficiency? We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company’s business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that it will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company’s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or the “debtor’s turnover ratio” is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company’s potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance of the company utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.Screening ParametersIn addition to the abovementioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 19.Here are four stocks from the 19 that made it through the screen:Illumina, Inc.

1604,ILMN,"Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a research collaboration and option agreementwith Kallyope, Inc. a privately-held New York biotechnology platform developer, with the aim of developing novel therapies for diabetes and obesity.Per the agreement, Kallyope will receive an upfront payment and research support for activities conducted in the collaboration in addition to milestones, sales royalties and other incentives. Novo Nordisk will have the option to license up to six products on an exclusive basis. The companies’ efforts will be focussed on the potential applications of peptides in the 'gut-brain axis.' The gut-brain axis is involved in many important aspects of physiology and plays a significant role in appetite regulation and energy homoeostasis. Kallyope has developed an innovative platform to interrogate the gut-brain axis and discover new medicines in multiple therapeutic areas. The deal will allow Novo Nordisk to use Kallyope's unique development platform to target the gut-brain axis with novel biologics. Kallyope will contribute to the discovery process, though Nordisk will be solely responsible for any further drug development.Novo Nordisk is known for its expertise in the discovery and development of peptide therapeutics, as well as for its commitment to and leadership in therapeutics for obesity and diabetes. Novo Nordisk’s capabilities along with Kallyope’s unique and sophisticated platform will provide for a strategic collaboration for Kallyope.Shares of Novo Nordisk have declined 16.8% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4.8%. Novo Nordisk has been enteing into agreements with various companies in order to strengthen its portfolio. In April 2018, Novo Nordisk also inked a global licence deal with biotech company EpiDestiny for sickle cell disease (SCD) program EPI01.The inclusion of EPI01 in Novo Nordisk’s portfolio will be a boost for the company as the candidate forms part of the company’s existing biopharmaceutical business.

1605,ILMN,"Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.

Both the companies will sell the generic version of the drug. Per the FDA, the approval was aimed at making the treatment available to more people.Buprenorphine and naloxone are used to treat adults with opioid dependence/addiction. Buprenorphine helps to suppress withdrawal symptoms caused by discontinuation of opioid drugs, and naloxone reverses and blocks the effect of opioids.The Suboxone brand had U.S. sales of approximately $1.86 billion MAT for the most recent twelve months ending in April 2018 according to IMS Health.Shares of Dr. Reddy have decreased 12% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 2.4%.Last month, Indivior PLC entered into a settlement agreement with Par Pharmaceutical Inc., Par Pharmaceutical Companies Inc., Endo International PLC (collectively, “Par”) and IntelGenx Technologies Corp., resolving patent litigation related to Suboxone Sublingual Film.The litigation was pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and resulted from Par’s submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Suboxone Film.

1606,ILMN,"On Jun 19, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). We are currently looking forward to the company’s modified Rite Aid contract, expected to benefit the company in the long run. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We are encouraged by the company’s consistent sales increase in the Retail Pharmacy International business. Moreover, Walgreens Boots has been gaining traction from a slew of strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.We are also upbeat about the company’s alliance with Express Scripts, via which, both companies aim to expand respective existing group purchasing efforts. This latest pact is expected to improve Express Scripts’ supply chain and make medicines including biosimilars affordable and accessible to patients.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote The above positives apart, Walgreens Boots’ decision to buy a 40% stake in China’s Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores looks promising as that should provide a strong impetus to the company’s worldwide retail pharmacy business. The limited number of Rite Aid stores’ acquisitions also impresses us for which, the company has recently secured a regulatory approval.However, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of fierce competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to reap benefits from its growth initiatives, major business tycoons are already advancing in pharmacy businesses with a fair market share.Notably, a slowdown in generic introduction over the last few years has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. Also, an escalated reimbursement pressure and a generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens Boots’ margins significantly.Over the past three months, shares of Walgreens Boots have underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 3.2% against the industry’s 5.6% increase.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) and Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report).

1607,ILMN,"The medical device industry has been benefiting from favorable consumer behavior, the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests and the use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Further, considering favorable demographics, changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, and increased business investments, this sector has been going strong. Broadly speaking, the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which slashed corporate tax rates to 21% from the earlier 35%, has also buoyed optimism among investors.Additionally, the Senate’s decision, to defer the implementation of an industry-wide excise tax — known as the Medical Device — for another couple of years, has instilled confidence in investors. The tax will be effective from Jan 1, 2020. The bill also delays the Cadillac tax — 40% tax on employer insurance — until 2022. Per Emergo, the U.S. Medical Device industry is projected to reach a market value of $173 billion by 2019.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) and Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) are two close contenders in this space.Notably, both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which raises investors’ optimism.Here, we make a detailed analysis of the companies’ fundamentals to determine which stock is currently positioned better in the Medical Products space.With a market cap of $44.55 billion, Boston Scientific is one of the leading manufacturers of medical devices and products, used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide.On the other hand, based in Deerfield, IL, Baxter is a leading global medical technology company. The company has a market cap of $39.79 billion.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Boston Scientific’s shares have gained 15.3% compared with the industry’s increase of 11.9%. The stock has also surpassed the S&P 500 index’s increase of 13.7%. Shares of Baxter have risen 24.1% in this period.Earnings GrowthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s current-year earnings is pegged at $1.39 per share, which reflects year-over-year projected growth of 10.3%.The same for Baxter is pegged at $2.89, indicating year-over-year rise of 16.5%.Moreover, per the last nine years data, since 2009, Boston Scientific’s earnings per share have witnessed a CAGR of 93.8% to $1.26 in 2017. Baxter’s earnings are projected at a negative CAGR of 34.5% and totaled $2.49 in 2017.Hence, Boston Scientific wins this round.Sales GrowthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s current-year revenues is pegged at $9.84 billion, showing year-over-year growth of 8.8%. The same for Baxter is pinned at $11.37 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.7%.Since 2009, Boston Scientific’s revenues witnessed a CAGR of 10.5% and reached $9.05 billion in 2017. Baxter’s revenues depicted a negative CAGR of 15.9% in 2017.Here too, Boston Scientific wins over Baxter.Factors Driving StocksBoston ScientificOver the recently reported quarters, Boston Scientific demonstrated growth across all business lines and geographies. The 2018 view also paints a bright picture. The company achieved clinical milestones for Ranger Drug Coated Balloon and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device. Also, post the suspension of Lotus valve in Europe, the ACURATE TAVR valve platform continues to build momentum.Boston Scientific recently announced several acquisitions, including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stock’s operational growth.BaxterStrong demand for Baxter’s CRRT, injectable pharmaceuticals, U.S. IV solutions and peritoneal dialysis therapies is a positive. The buyouts of RECOTHORM and PREVELEAK are noteworthy as well.Recently, the company got the FDA approval for Spectrum IQ Infusion System. Baxter’s surgical portfolio is highly diversified, with products available in more than 60 countries. It includes exclusive products like FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix, TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant, COSEAL Surgical Sealant and VASCU-GUARD Patch among others.In ConclusionOur comparative analysis indicates that Boston Scientific is positioned better than Baxter, considering price performance as well as earnings and sales growth.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

1608,ILMN,"Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report), announced the initiation of the phase III ACTIVATE study which will evaluateits lead rare genetic diseases candidate, AG-348 in patients with Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency who do not receive regular blood transfusions. The ACTIVATE study will enroll about 80 adult patients with PK deficiency who do not receive regular blood transfusions.  The ACTIVATE study aims to demonstrate that treatment with AG-348 leads to a sustained increase in hemoglobin in these patients. AG-348 is also undergoing a phase III study called ACTIVATE-T, a single-arm pivotal study for in adult PK deficiency patients who receive regular blood transfusions.Pyruvate kinase deficiency is a genetic blood disorder characterized by low levels of an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is used by red blood cells. Without pyruvate kinase, red blood cells break down too easily, resulting in low levels of these cells (hemolytic anemia)The ACTIVATE study aims to demonstrate that treatment with AG-348 leads to a sustained increase in hemoglobin in these patients. The ACTIVATE study is divided into two parts. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients who achieve at least a 1.5 g/dL increase in hemoglobin sustained over multiple visits in Part 2 of the study.In December last year, Agios reported impressive data from a phase II study on adult, transfusion-independent patients with PK deficiency. Data from the study demonstrated the candidate’s potential as the first disease-modifying therapy for patients with PK deficiency.Shares of the company rose 2% following announcement of the news. Year to date, shares ofAgios have increased 66.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 9.2%.Other than AG 348, Agios also has several interesting candidates in its pipeline. Its lead cancer pipeline includes Tibsovo which is under the priority review in the United States, the most advanced candidate targeting mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). In December 2017, Agios submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for Tibsovo, which has been developed for treating patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia(R/R AML) and an IDH1 mutation.Its other candidates include AG-881, which targets both mutated IDH1 and mutated IDH2. These mutations are found in a wide range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors including AML, chondrosarcoma and cholangiocarcinoma, where both the treatment options and prognosis for patients are poor.Another candidate, AG-270, a first-in-class methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) inhibitor, is being evaluated in a phase I dose-escalation study in patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted tumors. Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1609,ILMN,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value shows that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 19.Here are four stocks from the 19 that made it through the screen:Lululemon Athletica Inc.

1610,ILMN,"Flex Pharma Inc. (FLKS  -  Free Report) announced that the company is ending the phase II studies for its pipeline candidate FLX-787 in two indications. The company discontinued the ongoing phase II studies of FLX-787 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) due to oral tolerability concerns observed in both studies.The concerns were observed in a subset of patients being treated, with the oral disintegrating tablet formulation at 30 mg, taken three times a day. Shares of the company fell by 75% following the news.Though FLX-787 had shown positive efficacy data in multiple sclerosis (MS) and ALS, but recent observations of oral intolerability at the current dose and formulation, in patients in both studies, indicate that more formulation and dose-ranging studies are required. However, this is challenging for the company considering the availability of its current resources.The company’s Board of Directors and management are assessing strategic alternatives, including the potential sale or merger of the company. The company will continue to operate with a reduced internal team that will focus on assessing the potential of FLX-787 in dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and operating the HOTSHOT consumer business, while the strategic review is ongoing.Flex Pharma stated that it plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 60%. The layoffs will be implemented by the end of this month. As a result, the company expects to realize annualized cost savings beginning in the third quarter of 2018. The company expects to incur one-time costs of approximately $0.8 million to $1.1million under the restructuring plan.Shares of the company have decreased 70.2% year to date, compared with the industry’s decline of 6.9%.  Flex Pharma, Inc.

1611,ILMN,"Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion for its oncology drug Avastin (bevacizumab). The FDA approved Avastin in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), followed by Avastin as a single agent, for the treatment of women with advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer following initial surgical resection.The approval is based on data from the phase III GOG-0218 study. The study showed that women who received Avastin in combination with chemotherapy, and continued use of Avastin alone, had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 18.2 months compared to 12 months in women who received chemotherapy alone.Year to date, shares of the company have decreased 16.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.5%. With this approval, Avastin is now approved for 10 distinct uses across six different types of cancer in the United States. Avastin is approved in Europe for the treatment of advanced stages of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer and cervical cancer, and is available in the United States for the treatment of colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, cervical cancer, recurrent, platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, and recurrent glioblastoma. Avastin is one of the leading drugs in Roche’s portfolio. However, sales of Avastin fell 2% in the first quarter of 2018 due to increasing use of cancer immunotherapy medicines in lung cancer.Stiff competition from biosimilars looms large for Avastin. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.

1613,ILMN,"We issued an updated research report on Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report) on May 28.Bayer is facing generic threats/competition for many of its products including the Yaz franchise (oral contraceptives). The genericization of key drugs would negatively impact revenues. We expect the declining Yaz sales trend to persist. Continued weak performance of key drugs could impact the company’s top line and pull down the stock.Bayer has a number of candidates in its pipeline and any adverse pipeline-related news has the potential to impact the stock adversely. In May 2016, Bayer announced the termination of a phase II study on Adempas in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. The decision followed the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee, which observed that patients dosed with Adempas were at a greater risk of death and other serious adverse events than those on the placebo arm.In June 2017, Bayer announced that a phase II study evaluating its investigational oncology compound anetumab ravtansine (BAY 949343) as a monotherapy in patients with recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), who were previously treated, did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival.Bayer’s dependence on its pharmaceutical segment for growth remains a concern. Year to date, shares of the company have declined 5.1%, compared with the industry’s decline of 4.8%.Nevertheless, Bayer is looking to acquire Monsanto in an all-cash transaction worth approximately $66 billion. The combined business is expected to boost Bayer’s Crop Science business and provide accretion to its core earnings from the first full year of the closing of the transaction (slated to close by second quarter of 2018), followed by double-digit percentage growth.In October 2017, Bayer concluded an agreement to sell selected Crop Science businesses to BASF for €5.9 billion. The company intends to divest these assets as part of its strategy to complete the planned acquisition of Monsanto. Further, in April 2018, Bayer signed an agreement to sell further Crop Science businesses to BASF for up to €1.7 billion.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBayer has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Illumina, Inc.

1617,ILMN,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has made another encouraging move with respect to its Aortic & Peripheral Vascular (APV) business. The company recently announced the receipt of FDA approval for 200mm and 250mm lengths of the IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB) for treating long superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).Per the company, in April, Medtronic received approval to treat SFA lesions of up to 360mm in length, on the back of supporting clinical data from the complex lesion imaging cohorts of the IN.PACT Global Study, also covering long lesion, in-stent restenosis and chronic total occlusion groups with lesion lengths >180mm.We note that the IN.PACT Admiral DCB received FDA approval in December 2014, to treat superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Moreover, it is commercially available in Europe since its receipt of the CE mark approval in 2009. So far, more than 200,000 PAD patients in Europe have been treated with the device.A Glimpse of APV BusinessInterestingly, Medtronic’s revenues from the APV division improved 8.8% year over year (up 4.8% at constant exchange rate) in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, the Peripheral Vascular business grew on a low-single digit. The latest development should boost the company’s performance in this segment.Market ProspectsMedtronic’s strategy, to gain traction in the peripheral vascular sub-segment, seems to be aligned with data provided by MarketsAndMarkets. Per the report, the interventional cardiology & peripheral vascular devices market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.1% to reach a value of $31.47 billion from 2016 to 2021.We believe, the high incidence of peripheral artery disease due to unhealthy lifestyle and aging population, penetration by the companies in the untapped markets, rising need for minimally-invasive angioplasty procedures, technological advancements and increasing awareness among people will continue driving global acceptance for this technology. In view of these encouraging factors, we believe that the company’s development regarding IN.PACT Admiral DCB is strategic and it is expected to broaden its customer base.Share Price PerformanceHowever, over the past month, Medtronic has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has gained 1.7% in comparison with the industry’s 2.1% increase. Nevertheless, we believe, the latest FDA approval will boost investor confidence in the stock. Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

1619,ILMN,"The Zacks Rank has proven to be a valuable resource for experienced and beginning investors alike. This is because the model is simple; it identifies stocks that are poised to outperform the market over the next one to three months by harnessing the power of earnings estimates and earnings estimate revisions.Following these estimate trends is the easiest way to track analyst sentiment and profit from improvements in a particular company’s near-term outlook. We believe our #1 (Strong Buy) picks are the strongest options based on this Zacks Rank model, and only about 5% of the several thousand companies we track earn this designation at one time.In the story below, you will learn about one particular company that helped show the strength of the Zacks Rank. If investors had followed our ranking system when it flagged innovative biotech company, they would have witnessed massive profits.Illumina, Inc.

The company operates as a developer and manufacturer of services which assist in the analysis of genetic variation and biological functions. These services are marketed toward research centers, government organizations, and other medical companies.ILMN has been flagged by the Zacks Rank a number of times over the past year, starting with its first #2 (Buy) designation during the week of July 28, 2018. This position was earned as analysts became bullish on the company’s upcoming earnings report, which was published just a few days later. In that report, ILMN posted earnings of $0.82 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.68.The earnings momentum was only just getting going for ILMN, which would never dip below a #3 (Hold) before once again earning a #2 (Buy) again on Oct. 27. This designation came in the wake of another impressive earnings report for ILMN—this time one which saw impressive growth.For this quarter, ILMN posted earnings of $1.11 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents and improving more than 14% from the year-ago period. Revenue for the quarter was $714 million, well ahead of estimates and up nearly 18% year over year.This earnings and revenue success helped usher in an incredibly impressive stretch for ILMN, which saw its share prices and forward-looking EPS estimates move higher. Then, the company shocked investors in late April with quarterly earnings which beat consensus projections by nearly 50% and improved a staggering 126% from the prior-year quarter. ILMN has been holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since then.The below chart demonstrates the price performance for ILMN and 12-month forward EPS estimate (in red), starting from when the stock earned that first #2 (Buy) designation back in July.As we can see, ILMN was a massive winner for those that followed the Zacks Rank. The stock has gained about 66% over the months listed in the chart above, including a solid 20% during its nearly two month run as a #1 (Strong Buy) recently.

Notably, this buyout will cost Myriad Genetics around $375 million. After meeting certain customary closing conditions and receiving regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in first-quarter fiscal 2019.Financial Details of the DealMyriad Genetics intends to use a combination of cash on hand, an existing revolving credit facility and the issuance of common stock to pay $375 million for the buyout.Buyout Integration and Expected Synergy BenefitsMyriad Genetics plans to retain Counsyl as a wholly-owned subsidiary, post the successful completion of the acquisition. Further, integrating Counsyl’s reproductive testing products with its hereditary cancer tests, Myriad Genetics plans to solidify its position as a leading women's health genetic testing company. Per management, the acquisition deal will help the existing customer base for Counsyl's reproductive tests to expand by almost three-fold.Further, we encouragingly note that Counsyl’s reproductive genetic tests are currently being covered by commercial insurance in the United States, with more room for expanded coverage for the Foresight (expanded carrier screening) and Prelude (non-invasive prenatal screening) tests in the near term.Market Opportunities Post BuyoutPer data provided by the company, we believe that Myriad Genetics’ decision to foray into the high-potential reproductive testing market is strategically aligned.

1622,ILMN,"On Jun 8, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). While increasing demand for PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) and specialty pharmacy was a major growth driver for the stock, its dull retail performance over the last few quarters seems to have disappointed investors. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past three months. The stock has lost 4.3% compared with the 6.3% decrease of the broader industry.CVS Health ended the first quarter of 2018 on a mixed note. While earnings were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues lagged the same. However, the  top line’s year-over-year growth was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment, benefiting from the upside in the specialty services. A strong 2019 PBM selling season was another favorable factor.  Notably, the company is already more than halfway through its 2019 renewals. The retention rate is currently in line with the rates it has witnessed over the last few years.Despite a tough pricing competition, CVS Health currently gains momentum through high levels of service and execution, competitive pricing and a unique integrated model, which allows the company to provide differentiated products and services generating savings, better health outcomes as well as convenience.Moreover, solid year-over-year Retail/LTC comparisons were encouraging. The company is presently moving toward achieving the completion of the Aetna deal. Per CVS Health, this landmark acquisition of the U.S. health insurance giant might introduce a vast change on the Healthcare landscape in the United States. Investors are hopeful about CVS Health’s earning of $750 million drawn from the near-term synergies via the Aetna transaction post its closure.Meanwhile, the company’s commencement of this momentous $69-billion healthcare consolidation is keeping all analysts upbeat. On its successful culmination, CVS Health expects to reap $750 million with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the close of the buyout.On the flip side, the company’s highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a big concern as it faces some stiff rivalry in the pharmacy segment. This is because availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments in the portfolio. Particularly, discount retailers have made substantial inroads in gaining a major market share. This apart, CVS Health delivered some sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in the recent past. Per the company, this decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical and Illumina sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Amedisys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Patients, who are pressure intolerant or have persistent evidence of apnea at higher pressures, are often prescribed with the advanced bilevel devices.We believe that positive results from this study are expected to boost the uptake of the company’s bilevel devices.A Glimpse at the CompanyResMed achieved strong global revenue growth over the past few quarters, led by sales of sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems as well as software solutions. We believe, ResMed’s product launches and strategies are anticipated to gain traction in the sleep apnea market and are expected to drive growth for the company in the near term.Among recent developments, the company informed about its first self-branded portable oxygen concentrator, Mobi, subject to launch in the fiscal third quarter. It has also introduced AirMini, the smallest PAP (positive airway pressure) device in the world.ResMed recently received reimbursement approval for mandibular repositioning devices in France. Further, it announced that South Korea will start reimbursing diagnosis and therapeutic treatment for sleep apnea in the near term.Moreover, the company recently announced a definitive agreement to buy HEALTHCAREfirst — a privately-held provider of software solutions and services to home health, and hospice agencies — to boost its software-as-a-service business.Market PotentialPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the sleep apnea devices market is expected to worth roughly $6.49 billion by 2023, at a CAGR of 7.8% between 2018 and 2023. In view of the above data, we conclude that the developmental steps undertaken by the company seem to be progressive and are strategically aligned.Share Price PerformanceIn the past three months, ResMed has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 9.2% compared with 5.2% growth recorded by the industry.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

1624,ILMN,"ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) recently demonstrated a favorable outcome from two clinical analyses in the field of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These studies were conducted for the United Kingdom and the United States, highlighting the cost effectiveness of combining home oxygen therapy with home non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy for persistent hypercapnia patients, who suffer exacerbation of COPD.The combo regimen of Home Oxygen Therapy-Home Mechanical Ventilation (a home NIV), together known as HOT-HMV, has been presented at the American Thoracic Society 2018 International Conference. These are company-sponsored health economic studies.Going by the U.K. study, HOT-HMV treatment reduced exacerbation frequency and 28-day hospital readmission. Data from the analysis was used to develop an economic model from the U.K. National Health Service perspective. While the U.S. study demonstrated a 58.3% reduction in 30-day readmissions for HOT-HMV patients compared with those on home oxygen alone. Evidently, this indicated the treatment to be hugely cost effective. Per ResMed, the U.S. analysis was based on the U.K. study. The study finds were utilized to build an economic model from the U.S. payer perspective.  We are optimistic about this entire development by ResMed, taking into consideration the widely growing market for COPD treatment. Per data provided by GBI Research, the global COPD market is currently worth $11.3 billion and is projected to reach a value of $15.6 billion by 2019. According to the research report, this gaping demand will be met through numerous new, efficient and convenient products making inroads into the market.  Undoubtedly, ResMed’s HOT-HMV studies and the related favorable outcomes are a step forward for the company to intensify its footprint in the niche market.Notably, ResMed achieved strong global revenue growth over the past few quarters, led by sales of sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems as well as software solutions. We believe, ResMed’s product launches and strategies will gain traction in the SDB market and are expected to drive growth for the company in the near term.Among recent developments, the company informed about its first self-branded portable oxygen concentrator Mobi, subject to a fiscal third-quarter launch. It has also introduced AirMini, the world's smallest PAP (positive airway pressure) device.In the past three months, ResMed has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 9% compared with the 5.1% rise of the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1625,ILMN,"On Jun 5, we issued an updated research report on STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report). The company has been actively trying to expand into the adjacent markets and strengthen its core business through acquisitions and dilutions. However, the company operates in a tough competitive landscape, which is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of this developer, manufacturer and marketer of infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction plus surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services have outperformed the industry over the past three months. The stock has rallied 13.4% against its industry’s 13.1% decline.We are encouraged by STERIS witnessing favorable underlying market trends along with new product and service offerings. The company's strong organic growth across specialty services, life sciences and applied sterilization segments also buoys optimism. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. The company has also made certain divestments and organizational changes, expected to better align with its operations.  Over the recent past, STERIS has been pursuing growth of its footprint into adjacent markets via acquisitions and dilutions. Following the Synergy Health buyout, the company sold the Synergy Health Healthcare Consumable Solutions (HCS) business to Vernacare in November 2017. The HCS business used to generate roughly $40.0 million of annual revenues.This apart, the company made six consolidations in fiscal 2018. Through these transactions, the company aims at strengthening the Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services and the Applied Sterilization Technologies businesses. We believe that STERIS can chase back-to-back acquisitions in the long run in order to widen its business and customer base, courtesy of its solid financial position.Meanwhile, STERIS competes for pharmaceutical, research and industrial customers against several large companies with extensive product portfolios and a global reach as well as small entities with limited product offerings and operations in one or a few countries.The company worries over facing fierce competition as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. This might hamper STERIS’ growth considerably.Moreover, multiple STERIS’ clients are undergoing consolidation, partly due to healthcare cost-reduction measures, initiated by competitive pressures as well as legislators, regulators and third-party payors. We think that if the company fails to check its customer consolidation rate now, it will adversely impact its business as well as the financial condition.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical and Illumina sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Varian Medical carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Intuitive Surgical has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 12.1%.Illumina expects long-term earnings growth of 20%.Varian Medical’s expected earnings growth rate is pegged at 25% for the current year.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1626,ILMN,"Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) recently purchased back half of KKR & Co. L.P.’s holdings of its common shares. More specifically, the company bought back more than 2.4 million of its common stock from the global investment firm for a total transaction value of $178 million. The deal also included 7.1% of the aggregate outstanding shares of the company’s common stock. The repurchase deal reflected a price of $73.6, which is 96% of yesterday’s closing value of to $77.04. The transaction will be immediately accretive to the company’s bottom line by 6-7%. Following this news, shares of Amedisys inched up 0.54% at the close of trading on Monday Jun 4, 2018.Amedisys is expected to finance the deal using its $140 million of available cash and the existing revolving credit facility.  With this, the company will be left with $20 million of cash in hand and its outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of $128 million. This in turn will result in a net leverage ratio of approximately 0.7x. As a home health and hospice care provider, Amedisys is upbeat about this recent development, which remains in line with its strategy to deploy capital in an accretive manner, maintaining low leverage and a substantial borrowing capacity for future investment.In this regard, Amedisys’ accretive acquisitions will continue to be its first priority for capital deployment and accordingly, the company considers this transaction the best utility of capital given the current buyout multiples and the company’s business prospects. The company also noted that KKR will continue to remain a significant shareholder of Amedisys. Accordingly, Nathaniel M. Zilkha, a member of the general partner of KKR & Co. L.P., will still remain a director on Amedisys’ board.Other Recent Acquisitions by AmedisysOver the past year, the company made a number of strategic acquisitions, the recent one being East Tennessee Personal Care Service (ETPCS), a personal care provider headquartered in Knoxville, TN. Per Amedisys, this buyout will enlarge the company’s personal care footprint outside Massachusetts and Florida. This apart, the company bought Intercity Home Care, a personal care provider based in Malden, MA. Notably, Intercity Home Care’s entire asset base has been taken over by Associated Home Care. With this, Amedisys believes to have a wider presence in Massachusetts.Other important acquisitions of late include three home health centers (one each in Illinois, Massachusetts and Texas) and two hospice care centers (one in Arizona and another in Massachusetts) from Tenet Healthcare in May 2017 along with the assets of Home Staff, L.L.C., earlier in February, last year.Share Price PerformanceOver the past three months, shares of Amedisys have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

1627,ILMN,"On Jun 4, we issued an updated research report on Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report). While we are encouraged by the global acceptance of the company’s advanced therapies, its escalating costs and expenses raise concerns. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of Medtronic have outperformed the industry.  The stock has grown 10.1% against the industry’s 2.1% decline.Notably, Medtronic exited the fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected fourth-quarter performances. All major business groups contributed to its solid top-line growth at CER, highlighting sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying a successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. Also, a gradually stabilizing Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure(CRHF) market buoys optimism.Medtronic PLC Price Medtronic PLC Price | Medtronic PLC Quote The receipt of FDA approval for the DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) therapy as an adjunctive treatment to reduce partial-onset seizures raises hope for the company in the target medical market. Medtronic is also focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. The company is highly positive about its foray into the $1-billion standalone CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) market with its Guardian Connect.We are currently upbeat about Medtronic’s recently-launched restructuring initiative called Enterprise Excellence plan, aimed at $3-billion annual growth run rate savings by the end of fiscal 2022. Per the company, this new program has been designed to increase its effectiveness and growth-related reinvestment ability along with providing a consistent boost to its margin expansion and driving the EPS leverage.On the flip side, the company has been exposed to steep costs and expenses, weighing heavily on its margins. Also, its 2019 guidance remains conservative on the apprehension of lackluster Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG) and Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG) performances. This in turn dampens investors’ confidence in the stock.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc (AMED  -  Free Report).

1628,ILMN,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past year, the company’s share price has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 54.2% against the industry’s 8.5% fall. Also, the company has outperformed the S&P 500’s 13.2% gain.This renowned sequencing and array-based genetic analysis solution provider has a market cap of $39.64 billion. The company has an earnings growth rate of 20% for the next three to five years.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment. The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive. In the past 60 days, 10 analysts revised their estimates upward with no movement in the opposite direction. Resultantly, earnings estimates rose around 5.4% to $4.84. Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Solid Quarterly PerformanceIllumina exited the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. We are also encouraged by the significant year-over-year growth on both the counts. The substantial upside can be attributed to strong consumables growth across Illumina’s sequencing portfolio.New Products Bode WellWe are upbeat about Illumina’s product launches which continue to contribute to the top line. Management is hopeful about the recently-launched NovaSeq S1 flow cell reagent kit. The company also received product approval certificate for the NextSeq 550Dx instrument from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) in South Korea.Last November, Illumina introduced NextSeq 550Dx instrument as well. This is the company’s second FDA-regulated and CE-IVD marked next-generation sequencing (NGS) system.Efforts to Grow in Oncology Spacellumina’s collaborations with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Loxo Oncology in the field of clinical oncology applications are expected to garner positive results. The alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb will utilize Illumina’s NGS technology to develop and globally commercialize in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays in support of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s oncology portfolio.We also look forward to GRAIL, Illumina’s recently-developed company focused on the cancer screening market. We believe GRAIL is expected to significantly expand Illumina’s share in the multi-billion dollar oncology market.Geographic ExpansionApart from North America, Illumina markets and distributes products directly to customers in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region either through its direct selling force or through distributors that specialize in life science products.In the first quarter, Illumina witnessed 21% growth in the APAC region propelled by 38% shipment growth in Greater China. Obviously, among the emerging markets, China is currently the most favorable space for Illumina’s business.In recent times, management has noticed a considerable increase in demand as customers attempt to set up NIPT operations in China. We believe this recent progress in China will open up avenues for Illumina, thereby enhancing business growth.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

1629,ILMN,"Medtronic plc’s (MDT  -  Free Report) Restorative TherapiesGroup (“RTG”) has been on a strong growth trajectory of late, on encouraging contributions from the majority of sub-segments.We expect this strength to reflect in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results, which are scheduled to release before the opening bell on May 24.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is expected to be.RTG in FocusMedtronic’s RTG presently comprises of Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies divisions. We note that management expects 3-4% revenue growth in RTG business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Per management, this guidance balances the ongoing strength in Pain and Brain Therapies segments with any adverse impact from the weakening spine market.Consequently, RTG’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.09 billion indicates rise of 60.8% from the year-ago quarter.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteIn the last reported quarter, the segment recorded improvement in sales, driven by low-double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single-digit growth in Specialty Therapies and high-single-digit growth in Pain Therapies at CER. However, revenues from the Spine business remained flat at CER on a year-over-year basis.Let's see how things are shaping up in these sub-segments before fourth-quarter results.Brain Therapies: In Brain Therapies, which now includes Neurovascular and Neurosurgery businesses, the company has been witnessing major developments. In the Neurovascular business, which received solid contributions from stroke portfolio in the last reported quarter, Medtronic announced the receipt of FDA approval for the Riptide Aspiration System in January 2018. This adds a valuable tool to the company’s Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) product portfolio benefit of which should get reflected from the yet-to-be-reported quarter itself.Further, in April, Medtronic announced the CE Mark receipt and launch of the Visualase MRI-Guided Laser Ablation System in Europe. Notably, the Visualase system can be used in neurosurgery procedures and provides advanced MRI-guided laser ablation technology. These developments should help the company continue to witness strength in the Brain Therapies business.Pain Therapies: The Pain Therapies division, which now includes Pain (Spinal Cord Stimulation and Drug Pumps) and Interventional Spine businesses, contributed encouragingly to the company’s top line in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Pain Therapies witnessed growth on the solid uptake of Intellis platform for spinal-cord stimulation as well as strength in drug pumps.In January, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for a new clinician programmer for use with the SynchroMed II Intrathecal Drug Delivery system. Again, in April, Medtronic announced its U.S. launch of OptiSphere embolization spheres, a resorbable embolic platform, developed for embolization of hypervascular tumors.In view of the company’s efforts to develop its Pain Therapies division,we believe that solid trend will continue to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter results as well.Spine: Medtronic’s Spine division includes the Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses. In the last reported quarter, a low-single-digit decline in Core Spine was more than offset by mid-single-digit growth in BMP at CER.Per management, the combination of enabling technologies like imaging, navigation, powered instruments, nerve monitoring and Mazor Robotics with spine implants has spurred growth in this division.We expect encouraging top-line contributions from the business in the to-be-reported quarter.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

1630,ILMN,"On May 28, we issued an updated research report on IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report). The company’s robust worldwide commercial capabilities and best-in-class products including the next-generation chemistry analyzer, Catalyst One, are key growth drivers over the near term. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading molecular diagnostic company has outperformed its industry. The stock has increased 11.6% against the industry’s 13% decrease.Notably, IDEXX exited the first quarter of 2018 on a strong note with better-than-expected earnings and revenue improvement. Solid year-over year growth in organic revenues and a raised EPS guidance for 2018 were also encouraging. This stellar performance was driven by robust sales at the Companion Animal Group (CAG) business, fueled by a firm global Catalyst uptake.  International revenues in the first quarter were up 11% organically, driven by 13% organic gains in international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. This reflected continued consumable revenue gains, supported by Catalyst instrument base, increased average testing utilization and sturdy growth in European lab revenues.The companion animal market fundamentals remain safe and sound with tremendous global runway for growth. Additionally, we are upbeat about the company’s expanding premium instrument base in the United States as well as the international markets including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and a consistent customer retention.IDEXX’s innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy enabled by enhanced commercial capability accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth in the reported quarter. Moreover, the company’s healthy top-line growth was driven by considerable contributions from its rest of the business segments.Additionally, the company boasts a strong cash balance, which allows it to carry out share repurchases.Meanwhile, majority of IDEXX’s consolidated revenues is being derived from sale of products in the international markets. Thus, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate, relative to other currencies, had a negative impact on revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. money as well as on profits drawn from products manufactured in the United States and sold internationally. For 2018, adverse currency translations affected adjusted earnings per share to the tune of 4 cents. Also, the company’s heavy dependence on third-party distributors is a drag.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

Data was presented at EuroPCR, the annual meeting of the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), in Paris. Further, these results were published in EuroIntervention.What is AMPLATZER Amulet Occlusion Device?The AMPLATZER Amulet occluder is an advanced, minimally-invasive LAA occlusion device designed to seal off the LAA in people suffering from non-valvular atrial fibrillation in a time-efficient manner. This device blocks the LAA at its opening and reduces the chance of blood clots reaching the bloodstream and causing strokes.The AMPLATZER Amulet device comes in several sizes to cater to several types of complex patient anatomies. Moreover, it is claimed to be used on patients for whom blood-thinner medication is not a very safe option or is contraindicated.Notably, the AMPLATZER Amulet device is currently an investigational device in the United States.Study in DetailsThe AMPLATZER Amulet Observational Post-Market Study had 1,088 non-valvular AF patients enrolled worldwide. The Amulet device was effectively implanted in 99% of the enrolled patients with a follow-up period through 24 months post-device implant for assessment.Notably, the results through one-year follow-up demonstrate that treatment through AMPLATZER Amulet had lowered the risk for ischemic stroke by 57% and also reduced the chance of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism by 60%.A Glimpse of the Structural Heart BusinessThe Structural Heart business has maintained an impressive top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, sales at the segment rose 14.5% on a reported basis.Notably, the Structural Heart business accounted for 10.7% of total revenues under the broader Medical Device segment. The upside was led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip — the company’s market-leading device for the repair of MR. The company recently announced encouraging results from a global study of its Tendyne Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement (TMVR) system. In March, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement in Japan for the same. Notably, in nearly 50 countries, more than 50,000 people have been treated with MitraClip. Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved the MitraClip System in Japan last November.Further, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for the world’s smallest rotatable, bileaflet mechanical heart valve — Masters HP 15mm.

Further, this system has been developed to increase the strength, capacity of the graft and visualization of the interbody spacer in spinal fusion cases. It also encompasses surgical instruments which enable insertion, manipulation and elimination of the implants.What is 3D Printing Technology?Also known as additive manufacturing, 3D printing is the process of turning a digital model into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer (per an article on 3D Hubs). Further, 3D printing has also received a warm response from the MedTech space within healthcare. Notably, research firm Future Market Insights expects the global 3D printed medical devices market to see a CAGR of 18.1% between 2017 and 2027.Zimmer Biomet’s latest offering Zyston Strut Open Titanium System, which is built using the 3D printing process, will allow physicians to develop a unique cage architecture that will maximize graft volume before implantation.In 2016, Zimmer Biomet had announced the receipt of 510(k) clearance for the Unite3D Bridge Fixation System, under its Foot & Ankle business. Notably, this innovative product was a result of the combination of the company’s OsseoTi porous metal technology and the 3D printing process.A Glimpse at the Spine DivisionZimmer Biomet’s Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment revenues were down 3.8% at CER in the first quarter of 2018. The company has been facing revenue dissynergies related to its U.S. spine sales force integration. Meanwhile, we are upbeat about the recent FDA nod that is expected to expand the company’s lumbar spacers portfolio, which includes PEEK-Optima, Trabecular Metal Technology and allograft. We note that, Zimmer Biomet has been gaining from a strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc.Also, the company recently launched products like the Avenue T TLIF Cage as well as Vitality + and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States.Market PotentialPer a report by Market Research Future, we can safely conclude that this latest development will help Zimmer Biomet to cash in on the opportunities in the spinal implants markets. According to the report, the global spinal implants market is expected to see a CAGR of roughly 5.5% between 2017 and 2023.Price PerformanceOver the past three months, Zimmer Biomet has been observed to underperform its industry. The stock has declined 5.8% compared with 3.1% rise of the industry. We believe the latest FDA 510(k) approval may boost investor’s faith in the stock. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderZimmer Biomet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

1633,ILMN,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from the phase III CheckMate -214 study on Opdivo.CheckMate-214 study is an ongoing study evaluating   Immuno-Oncology combination Opdivo (nivolumab) and low-dose (1mg/kg) Yervoy (ipilimumab) compared with  Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent (sunitinib) in intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) over a two-year follow-up period.  The treatment with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy led to statistically significant differences in patient-reported outcomes from baseline versus sunitinib through two years of follow-up. The study demonstrated that patients showed significant benefits in disease-related symptoms and improvements to their cancer-related quality of life and well-being.These benefits occurred early during Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy combination therapy and were largely maintained throughout the treatment period and through Opdivo maintenance therapy.The CheckMate-214 study for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma had earlier shown efficacy benefit of Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy across a number of measures, including overall survival, objective response rate and progression-free survival. However, the results presented now showed that patients treated with this Immuno-Oncology combination also reported significant improvements in disease-related symptoms, as well as positive changes to their physical, emotional and functional well-being.An additional analysis showed similar results with a significant benefit seen for Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy relative to sunitinib on change from baseline at a pre-planned 25-week landmark.Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 16% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%.We note that, Opdivo, became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval in July 2014. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Meanwhile, the company continues to evaluate Opdivo alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Label expansion of the drug into additional indications would give the product an access to a higher patient population and increase its commercial potential significantly.However, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.In a separate release, Bristol-Myers announced that the FDA lifted a partial clinical hold placed on CA209-602 (CheckMate -602), a phase III study evaluating the addition of Opdivo to pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The decision follows consultation with the FDA and agreement on amendments to the study protocol.The FDA put clinical hold on three studies evaluating Opdivo-based combinations in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in September 2017 as an FDA precaution following risks identified in trials studying another anti–PD-1 agent, Keytruda, in patients with multiple myeloma. Stocks That Warrant a LookBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy),.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Illumina’s earnings per share estimates have moved up from $4.83 to $4.86 for 2018 and from $5.57 to $5.60 for 2019 over the past 30 days.

1634,ILMN,"On May 31, 2018, we issued an updated research report on Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report). The company is gaining traction in the emerging markets, particularly in the BRIC zone. However, product recall issue continues to impede growth. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of Boston Scientific have outperformed the industry on several issues. The stock has gained 11.6% versus the industry's 2.1% decline.Notably, Boston Scientific posted an impressive first-quarter 2018 on the back of growth across all business lines and geographies. The 2018 view also paints a bright picture for the near term. Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses as well as invest in new technologies. The company achieved clinical milestones for Ranger Drug Coated Balloon and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device.Also, post the suspension of Lotus valve in Europe, ACURATE TAVR valve platform continues to build momentum for the company’s growth. During the first quarter, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in Electrophysiology and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational efficiency. Also, a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario has started to contribute to the company’s overall top-line performance.Boston Scientific is pulling out all the stops to pump its resources into new technologies and global markets, accounting for higher sales across all its geographical regions in the third quarter. Additionally, we are encouraged by the company’s number of approval gains for its products both in the domestic as well as overseas markets.However, we are concerned about the company’s recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. The fate of Lotus valve issue thrown in the throes of uncertainty for some more time for Boston Scientific. Recently, the company announced a delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe as well as the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall in February 2017.Per the latest update, the company expects to launch LOTUS Edge in the United States and the European markets not before 2019. We currently fear about the indefinite future of the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business within interventional cardiology wherein Lotus valve line is a prime product.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc (AMED  -  Free Report).

1636,ILMN,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of the latest generation of the Afinion test system — Afinion 2 analyzer — in the United States. This system delivers accurate hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) results in 3 minutes and albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) results in 5 minutes. Therefore, the product will enable healthcare providers to adhere to American Diabetes Association (ADA) testing guidelines efficiently and promptly.What Is Afinion 2 Analyzer Rapid Test System?The Afinion 2 analyzer is a rapid and compact multi-assay platform which is capable of streamlining and simplifying the delivery of actionable and accurate measurements of HbA1c and ACR results at the point of care. The Afinion 2 platform also provides all-in-one connectivity to laboratory and hospital information systems (LIS/HIS), which enables healthcare providers to use it in various out-patient settings.Per the ADA, regular measuring of HbA1c and ACR levels are effective for long-term management of patients diagnosed with diabetes.

The division accounted for 24.9% of total sales in first-quarter 2018.In the last reported quarter, the Diagnostics revenues grew 58.7% year over year (up 5.5% on a comparable operational basis) driven by better-than-expected performance of the company’s Rapid Diagnostics business and strength in flu season across the United States.Notably, Rapid Diagnostics recorded sales of $559 million, driven by solid contributions from infectious disease testing that include flu and strep testing. Further, management projects the uptrend in this division to continue on the back of new product launches, benefits from Alere acquisition and strength in Alinity test platform.Market PotentialTheprevailing demographics are in favor of high incidence of diabetes among individuals.

1637,ILMN,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has been in the spotlight of late on favorable developments in its Medical Device business including its core Structural Heart division. The company recently announced encouraging results from a global study of its Tendyne Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement (TMVR) system. Data was presented at EuroPCR, the annual meeting of the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), in Paris.Although this global study of Tendyne device expects to register up to 350 adult patients, the early results were based on successful implantation of Tendyne device in 97 of the first 100 patients. The patients enrolled under the study suffered from symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR) and were not eligible for open heart surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve.Notably, the results at the end of 30 days demonstrated that patients treated with Tendyne witnessed a major reduction of mitral regurgitation symptoms and low mortality rates. Further, the improvement in symptoms was assessed based on New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade severity and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).Tendyne Device in DetailsRepositionable, completely retrievable and minimally invasive replacement option — Tendyne Device — is used to treat functional, degenerative and mixed causes of MR that cannot be treated through minimally invasive valve repair or open-heart surgery.Notably, the Tendyne device is currently under clinical investigation for approval in Europe. Further, the company plans to enroll the first patient under the U.S. pivotal trial for the same in the near term.A Glimpse of the Structural Heart BusinessAbbott’s Structural Heart business maintained an impressive top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, the segment’s sales rose 14.5% on a reported basis.Notably, the Structural Heart business accounted for 10.7% of total revenues in the broader Medical Device segment. The upside was led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip — the company’s market-leading device for the repair of MR. In March, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement in Japan for the same. Notably, in nearly 50 countries, more than 50,000 people have been treated with MitraClip. Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved the MitraClip System in Japan last November.Further, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for the world’s smallest rotatable, bileaflet mechanical heart valve — Masters HP 15mm. With the approval, the company has expanded the Masters Series portfolio under the Structural Heart business.Market ProspectsAbbott’s strategy to gain traction in the Structural Heart segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research and data provided by the company. Per the report, the Tanscatheter Mitral Valve Repair & Replacement market is estimated to reach a worth of $1,878 million (both repair and replacement valves) by 2023, at a CAGR of 30% from 2017 to 2023. Per the company, almost one in 10 people over the age of 75 suffer moderate to severe MR.Share Price PerformanceAbbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

1638,ILMN,"Astute investors always opt for plans that are likely to yield high returns irrespective of market conditions. Efficiency level, which measures a company’s capability to transform available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company’s potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance.How to Measure Efficiency? We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company’s business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that it will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company’s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or the “debtor’s turnover ratio” is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company’s potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 21.Here are five stocks from the 13 that made it through the screen:Marine Products Corporation (MPX  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, and sells recreational fiberglass powerboats for the sportboat, deckboat, cruiser, jet boat, and sport fishing markets worldwide.

1640,ILMN,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that a phase III study evaluating its epilepsy drugLyrica (pregabalin) in pediatric patients met the primary endpoint. The study was evaluating the use of Lyrica Oral Solution CV as adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures in pediatric epilepsy patients one month to less than four years of age, an indication for which Lyrica is not yet approved.Top-line results from the study showed that adjunctive treatment with Lyrica 14 mg/kg/day resulted in a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency versus placebo which was the primary efficacy endpoint. However, treatment with Lyrica at lower dose of 7 mg did not result in statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency versus placebo.These data along with the data from previous studies will be submitted to the FDA for Lyrica pediatric exclusivity determination.Lyrica has already lost patent exclusivity in Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia. In the United States, a favorable court decision in July 2012 regarding generic challenges should protect Lyrica from genericization through Dec 30, 2018.Meanwhile, Pfizer is pursuing a six-month patent-term extension from the FDA for pediatric exclusivity, which, if granted, will keep generic competition at bay till June 2019. We believe that the positive data from the pediatric study may ease Pfizer’s effort to get pediatric exclusivity.Other than epilepsy, Lyrica is indicated to treat post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury in the United States. Lyrica is also indicated to treat partial onset seizures in patients four years of age and older. Sales of Lyrica declined 1% to $1.13 billion in the first quarter of 2018.   Shares of Pfizer have lost 1.5% year to date compared with industry’s decline of 3.8%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Some better-ranked stocks from the same space worth considering are Illumina, Inc.

1642,ILMN,"On May 30, we issued an updated research report on Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The company’s market opportunities continue to expand owing to accelerated demand from clinical and translational customers. Its recent strategic collaborations are also expected to widen its product portfolio.Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over the last three months. The stock has rallied 21.3% against the industry’s 6.6% decline.Notably, Illumina exited the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note with better-than-estimated earnings as well as revenues. Moreover, we are encouraged by the significant year-over-year growth on both counts. This huge upside can be attributed to a strong rise in consumables across Illumina’s sequencing portfolio.Illumina, Inc. Price Illumina, Inc. Price | Illumina, Inc. Quote Additionally, management is hopeful about the recently launched NovaSeq S1 flow cell reagent kit. The company also received a product approval certificate for the NextSeq 550Dx instrument from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea. In the field of oncology, Illumina’s collaborations with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Loxo Oncology are likely to garner positive results down the line. Meanwhile, the company’s raised 2018 guidance indicates that it will deliver an impressive performance in the quarters to come.San Diego, CA-based Illumina is a tools and integrated systems provider for the analysis of genetic variation and function. The company focuses on product innovation via research and development, evident from its recent launch of iSeq 100 Sequencing System.Post a promising first quarter, we expect Illumina to maintain its growth momentum on the continued uptake of sequencing consumables, instruments and microarray portfolios.On the flip side, the company faces stiff competition in the sequencing, SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) genotyping, gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets with several bigwigs already enjoying a significant market share, intellectual property portfolios as well as regulatory expertise. Also, the National Institutes of Health funding issue raises a concern.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), ResMed Inc.

1643,ILMN,"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, (INO  -  Free Report) has initiated a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of its pipeline candidate VGX-3100 on adult men and women with human papilloma virus (HPV)-related anal dysplasia. This will be the third indication that VGX-3100 will be evaluated for. It is already being evaluated to treat HPV-related vulvar and anal precancers.In the phase II study, VGX-3100 will be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection with CELLECTRAdelivery system in adult men and women who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative with histologically confirmed anal or perianal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18.  The study is expected to enroll 24 patients and will administer at least three doses of VGX-3100. In a phase II study for cervical dysplasia, VGX-3100 demonstrated a systemic response (versus localized surgery) and clearance of cervical lesions and eliminating the underlying HPV infection in many patients.Anal HSIL or dysplasia is the precursor to anal cancer, which is estimated to cause more than 1,100 deaths in the United States in 2018. Currently the only treatments for anal dysplasia are surgical excision and electro-cautery or laser therapy. However, more than 50% treated with these current treatments experience recurrence of the disease. VGX-3100 has potential to be the first approved treatment for HPV infection of the cervix and the first non-surgical treatment for precancerous cervical lesions.Year to date, shares of Inovio have rallied 16.5% against the industry’s decline of 9.8%. VGX-3100 a DNA based immunotherapy, is the most advanced candidate in the company’s pipeline, and is currently being evaluated in a phase III study for the treatment of cervical dysplasia caused by HPV.

1644,ILMN,"On May 16, we issued an updated research report on QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company progressing with the testing menu expansion strategy. However, a tough competitive landscape is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This Netherlands-based molecular diagnostics provider offers innovative technologies and products for pre-analytical sample preparation and molecular diagnostics solutions. The stock has been outperforming its industry over the past six months. Per the latest stock movement, it has gained 12.2% against 8.1% decline of the broader industry.QIAGEN ended the first quarter on a solid note. We are impressed with the year-over-year growth in majority of the segments. The company has been proceeding with its test menu expansion strategy. In this regard, in April, the company announced the receipt of pre-market approval by the FDA for PartoSure. In the same month, the company launched QIAstat-Dx in Europe following the closure of the recently-announced Stat-Dx acquisition and completion of defined development activities by Stat-Dx. We are also upbeat about QIAGEN’s Molecular Diagnostics sales that have been growing significantly. During the first quarter, the company witnessed double-digit CER growth in revenues from the QuantiFERON latent TB test along with strength in Personalized Healthcare following rising sales of infectious disease testing products.We also look forward to the implementation of the recently-drawn strategies to boost top-line contributions from the NGS portfolio.Meanwhile, QIAGEN faces stiff competition from firms that provide competitive pre-analytical solutions and other products. The markets for some of the company’s products are very competitive and price sensitive, which add to the concerns.Also, strong reliance on collaborations and declining HPV sales in the United States are other negatives.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and The Cooper Companies, Inc.

1645,ILMN,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) recently announced the initiation of a clinical study — The Bifurcation Cohort — to evaluate the efficiency and safety standards of drug-eluting stents (DES) for treating bifurcation lesions.Study in DetailsThe Bifurcation Cohort, part of the RESOLUTE ONYX Post-Approval Study, will cover 250 patients with bifurcation lesions from 30 sites in the United States and Europe. It will be enrolling patients suffering with coronary artery disease (CAD) and receiving Resolute Onyx DES in diameter sizes varying from 2.0-5.0 mm. Notably, the Resolute Onyx DES is not approved for treating bifurcation lesions in the United States. Further, the primary endpoint for the study will be target vessel failure at 12 months.Per Medtronic, data from the study will be submitted to the FDA for expanded indication approval including bifurcation lesions for the Resolute Onyx DES. Further, the company stated that bifurcation lesions are responsible for 20% of all percutaneous coronary interventions. Thus, we believe the positive data will provide impetus to the company’s efforts to achieve expanded FDA approval for the Resolute Onyx DES and accelerate business growth.CSH PerformanceMedtronic is consistently trying to enhance its Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) segment, which is part of the Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG) segment.CSH revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2018 were up 14% at CER (18% as reported) on low-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform and expanded FDA approval to include patients at intermediate risk.Moreover, continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the business.We encouragingly note that Medtronic recently received FDA nod for the U.S. launch of the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm drug-eluting stent. The stent is the smallest in size in the market presently. The Resolute Onyx DES is available for use in all sizes in the United States, Europe and in countries that recognize the CE Mark.Market PotentialMedtronic’s strategy to gain traction in the CSH segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Transparency Market Research. Per the report, the global coronary stent market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.6% from 2013 to 2019.More specifically, the DES market within the Coronary stents market is expanding fast. It is estimated to witness a CAGR of 9.54% in the 2013-2019 period. The market is likely to expand 9% in the United States, 10% in the Asia Pacific, and 3.1% in Europe as well as the Rest of the World.Stock Performance Over the past three months, Medtronic has outperformed the industry, gaining 2.7% as compared with the industry’s 1.8%.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and The Cooper Companies, Inc.

1646,ILMN,"We issued an updated research report on Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) on May 23.Agios’ only marketed drug is Idhifa, which received FDA approval for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation, in August 2017. However, apart from Idhifa, Agios does not have any approved product in its portfolio yet. Hence, the company’s top line mainly comprises collaboration revenues and milestone payments.Year to date, shares of the company have increased 55.6%, compared with the industry’s increase of 7.2%.The company has several interesting candidates in its pipeline. Its lead cancer pipeline includes Tibsovo (ivosidenib/AG-120; under the priority review in the United States), the most advanced candidate targeting mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). In December 2017, Agios submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for Tibsovo (ivosidenib), which has been developed for treating patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation.Subsequently, in February 2018, the FDA accepted the NDA under priority review for the given indication. The FDA has set an action date of Aug 21, 2018. A regulatory filing for the candidate in the European Union is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the same indication.Its other candidates include AG-881, which targets both mutated IDH1 and mutated IDH2. These mutations are found in a wide range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors including AML, chondrosarcoma and cholangiocarcinoma, where both the treatment options and prognosis for patients are poor.The company's lead rare genetic diseases candidate, AG-348, is under evaluation in a phase II study on adult, transfusion-independent patients with Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. During the first quarter of 2018, the company initiated ACTIVATE-T, a single-arm pivotal study for AG-348, in adult PK deficiency patients who receive regular blood transfusions. In fact, the company plans to initiate another study -ACTIVATE, for AG-348 in adults with PK deficiency who do not receive regular blood transfusions in the second quarter of 2018.Another candidate, AG-270, a first-in-class methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) inhibitor, is being evaluated in a phase I dose-escalation study in patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted tumors.A potential approval for the pipeline candidates will be a huge boost for the company.In May 2016, Agios and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) announced a new global strategic collaboration for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies utilizing Agios’ innovative cellular metabolism research platform. Terms of the Celgene deal are lucrative as Agios is eligible to receive clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments plus royalties on net sales of products resulting under the collaboration.However, the company depends heavily on Celgene for revenues, which it earns in the form of collaboration revenues. The company also faces stiff competition.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAgioshas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Illumina, Inc.

Overall, Q1 earnings growth is on pace to be the strongest in seven years, with growth of 24% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues (read: Top and Flop ETFs at Half-Way Q2).Given this, several equity ETFs have impressed with their performances and generated handsome returns over the trailing one month even after being hit by the trade war worries and geopolitical tensions. While there are winners in many corners of the space, below are five ETFs that buoyed up on robust earnings results.In addition, we have given a chart for their one-month performance and compared them with the broad market fund (SPY  -  Free Report) and the broad sector.PowerShares DWA Healthcare Momentum Portfolio (PTH  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to healthcare stocks that are showing relative strength (momentum). It surged 12.4% in the trailing one-month period on strong Q1 earnings. This is because the stock prices in response to the earnings announcement for the sector have been the second highest with 1.8% gains. Total earnings for 94.8% of the sector’s total market cap are up 14.4% on 7.4% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating EPS and 72.5% beating revenue estimates. PTH has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook. PowerShares S&P SmallCap Energy Fund (PSCE  -  Free Report)This fund targets the small-cap segment of the energy sector. While many energy ETFs have performed exceptionally well this earnings season, PSCE stole the show gaining 12.4% in a month. This is primarily thanks to the dual tailwinds of upbeat earnings reports and the jump in oil prices. Though the price performance in response to earnings have been negative, the energy sector remains the top contributor to total S&P 500 earnings, with earnings growth of 75.7%. Additionally, energy came up with an earnings beat ratio of 72.4% in the small-cap space, the second highest trailing transportation’s 92.9% earnings beat.

1648,ILMN,"In line with its product expansion strategy, Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) has come up with seven new commercial coverage decisions for the company’s market-leading genomic test with respect to prostate cancer, Prolaris.Following multiple reimbursement approvals over the last few months, the molecular diagnostics and personalized medicine major announced that in aggregate, the payers represent six million new covered lives for Prolaris. Plus, per the company, the payers include one top-25 commercial insurer in the United States.Myriad noted that this acceleration in commercial insurer coverage for Prolaris has come close on the heels of the recently updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, which support Prolaris as the standard of care in making treatment decisions for patients suffering low and favorable-intermediate risk prostate cancer.NCCN Guidelines and ProlarisThe updated NCCN guidelines, released in February 2018, revised the medical rules for prostate cancer treatment and broadly included biomarker testing for the same indication. As stated earlier, the changes include new language backing Prolaris as standard of care in taking therapeutic decisions for patients with low and favorable-intermediate risk prostate cancer. The reworked NCCN guidelines accordingly instilled confidence in Myriad Genetics to receive expanded reimbursement coverage for certain tests in the near term. Per the company, certain payers have already updated their policies based on these NCCN rules including the likes of 14 Medicaid states and a favorable Prolaris medical policy decision from several regional payers along with the company’s first Blue Cross Blue Shield plan.Prospects of ProlarisWith this development, Prolaris now provides insurance coverage to 50% of prostate cancer patients in the United States. The company’s growing prospects in the fast-expanding market for prostate cancer tests are also encouraging.Per a report by BCC Research, the prostate cancer global market is estimated to reach a value of worth $65.1 billion by 2021, up from $47.2 billion in 2016 at a CAGR of 6.6%. Thus, the company clearly boasts bountiful prospects in this market.Share Price PerformanceOver the past 30 days, shares of Myriad Genetics have outperformed the industry.

1656,ILMN,"Of late, Medtronic plc's (MDT  -  Free Report) spine business has been registering soft performance due to a challenging market scenario. Let us see if there is any possibility of a rebound this time around. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on May 24.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is likely to be.Spine at a GlanceIn the last reported quarter, Medtronic’s spine division was flat year over year. Despite a mid-single-digit growth in BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) at CER, a low-single digit decline in Core Spine hampered overall sales.However, the company noted that though growth was sluggish, it was in line with the global spine market. Per management, the combination of advanced technologies in imaging, navigation, powered instruments and nerve monitoring has spurred growth in this division. The company has also started to demonstrate positive outcome related to its distribution relationship with Mazor Robotics.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteNevertheless, since the beginning of fiscal 2018, Medtronic is suffering from significant pricing pressure in this business, which offset the strong procedural growth. The company believes that this price reduction basically stems from consolidations within hospitals. The company stated that hospitals are getting more sophisticated with their buying patterns and are consolidating their vendor base resulting in price declines.Medtronic expects this competitive pricing pressure to reduce over the next couple of quarters leading to net procedural growth for the company. However, looking at the company’s outlook, we are uncertain of a near-term recovery. The company earlier noted that spine’s broader Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) segment growth may be marred by the impact of a slower spine market in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

1657,ILMN,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is ChromaDex Corporation (CDXC  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in CDXC.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from a loss of 15 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 34 cents.Also, for the current quarter, ChromaDex has seen one downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 13 cents a share from  a loss of 3 cents cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 12.7% in the past month.ChromaDex Corporation Price and Consensus ChromaDex Corporation Price and Consensus | ChromaDex Corporation Quote So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Illumina, Inc.

While there are winners in many corners of the space, below are five ETFs that buoyed up on robust earnings results. In addition, we have given a chart for their one-month performance and compared them with the broad market fund (SPY  -  Free Report) and the broad sector (read: ETFs to Profit from US-North Korea Tensions).ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK  -  Free Report)This is an actively managed fund focusing on companies that are expected to benefit from the development of new products or services, technological improvement and advancements in genomic revolution, Web x.0 and industrial innovation. An amazing surge in bitcoin prices and incredible earnings from companies like AthenaHealth (ATHN  -  Free Report), Illimina (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report) provided a boost to the fund’s portfolio. Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) also added to the strength on increased production outlook. These stocks make up for a substantial 28.4% of assets, leading to a 6.7% rise in ARKK over the past one month (read: Bitcoin Skyrockets, Race to First Cryptocurrency ETF Heats Up). PowerShares S&P SmallCap Utilities Portfolio (PSCU  -  Free Report)This fund targets the small cap segment of the utilities and telecommunication services sectors. Total earnings for the utilities sector is up 7% on 7.7% higher revenues with a blended beat of 41.4%. Though the blended beat seems encouraging, price impact in response to earnings is much better when compared to negative price reaction for many other sectors. The stocks saw a modest rise of 0.3%, only behind construction. Given this, PSU is leading the utilities sector, gaining nearly 6.5% (read: ETFs in Focus After Utilities Q2 Results). Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to the global companies involved in the solar power industry. It has gained 6.2% over the past month on strong Q2 earnings. In particular, earnings from First Solar (FSLR  -  Free Report), SolarEdge Technologies SEDG, and Canadian Solar CSIQ, have been strong. These stocks are among the top five holdings of the fund. Overall, the solar industry came up with a 67% earnings beat in Q2.Fidelity MSCI Telecommunication Services ETF (FCOM  -  Free Report)This ETF targets the U.S. telecom sector and has gained 5.1% in a month. Telecom kingpins – Verizon Telecommunications (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T (T  -  Free Report) – dominate the fund’s returns and account for 45.9% share in the basket. Both firms reported strong Q2 results (read: ETFs to Watch Out for on Telecom Earnings). Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1659,ILMN,"On Aug 3, 2017, we issued an updated research report on San Diego, CA-based Illumina Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), a company providing tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function.Illumina exited the second quarter on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line was strong with new product launches including the VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe and the strength of NovaSeq. More good news is that the rate of NIPT adoption is increasing outside the U.S.Notably, over the last three months, Illumina has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has grown 4.8% in this period compared with a 3.9% gain of the broader industry. The company’s raised guidance is also encouraging enough to indicate that this bullish trend will continue in the coming period.Also, demand for NovaSeq surpassed the company’s expectations with orders beating forecast over 30%. More than 230 NovaSeq instruments have been ordered since its launch in January. We are also looking forward to GRAIL, Illumina’s own-developed company, focused on the cancer screening market.Within clinical markets, demand from customers undergoing oncology testing remains robust. We are currently looking forward to the performance of the Extended RAS Panel, slated for launch in the third quarter. Significantly in June, the company announced an FDA approval receipt for the Extended RAS companion diagnostic kit (as the Class III PMA).On the flip side, weak margins owing to NovaSeq’s launch, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables will continue to act as deterrents. Also, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding issue and a tough competitive landscape are other few concerns to deal with.Zacks Rank & Key PicksIllumina currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Edwards Lifesciences has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.2%. The stock has gained around 4.7% over the last three months.INSYS Therapeutics has expected long-term earnings growth rate of 20%. The stock has gained around 4.7% over the last three months.Align Technology has expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 24.1%. The stock has surged roughly 24.7% over the last three months.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

The study enrolled 52 patients aged one to 17 years with PJIA and previous inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate who were either Actemra naive or were receiving Actemra IV with adequate disease control. The safety observed for Actemra administered subcutaneously was consistent with the known safety profile of Actemra IV.Sales of Actemra was CHF499 million, an increase of 13% year over year in the first quarter of 2018.

1661,ILMN,"Astute investors always opt for a plan that is likely to yield high returns irrespective of market conditions. Efficiency level, which measures a company’s capability to transform available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company’s potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance. Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value shows that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory.Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 19.Here are five stocks from the 19 that made it through the screen:Marine Products Corporation (MPX  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, and sells recreational fiberglass powerboats for the sportboat, deckboat, cruiser, jet boat, and sport fishing markets worldwide.

1662,ILMN,"Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 57 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 by 50%. The bottom line, however, increased 14% from the year-ago figure of 50 cents.Net sales in the reported quarter increased 1.9% to $1.22 billion. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21 billion.The company’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has declined 9.1% as against the industry’s rally of 4.1%.Segment DiscussionEffective Jan 1, 2017, the company’s reporting segments are: Consumer Health Care Americas (“CHCA”), Consumer Health Care International (“CHCI”), Prescription Pharmaceuticals (“RX”) and Other Segment.CHCA:  CHCA net sales in the first quarter of 2018 came in at $602 million, up 3.2% year over year. This upside can be attributed to a strong performance from the infant nutrition, analgesics and cough cold categories compared with the year-ago quarter. New product sales of $11 million also contributed to the top line.However, this upside was partially offset by lower sales in the animal health category and discontinued products of $2 million.CHCI: CHCI segment reported net sales of $401 million, up 7% (declined 4.5% on a constant-currency basis) from the year-ago period. Excluding exited Russian and unprofitable distribution businesses in 2017, and favorable foreign currency movements of $43 million, net revenues grew 1.4% driven by new product sales of $20 million.However, this was partially offset by lower net sales in the cough cold, personal care and analgesics categories in addition to discontinued products of $6 million.RX:  This segment’s net sales slipped 1.5% to $214 million on a reported basis and 1.6% on a constant-currency basis. New product sales of $10 million were offset by lower net revenues of existing products of $12 million, primarily due to price erosion, which was in line with expectations. New product sales were lower than expected due to a supply disruption of a key new product.2018 Earnings Outlook Perrigo reiterated its revenue guidance and expects it to be in the range of $5.0-$5.1 billion in 2018.The company also reaffirmed its adjusted earnings guidance and expects it to be in the band of $5.05 to $5.45 per share.Corporate Governance Perrigo’s board of directors appointed Rolf A.

1664,ILMN,"There is no mystery behind investors’ hunt for stocks with estimate beating potential ahead of an earnings season. This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if it has been decelerating.Also, seasonal fluctuations can come into play. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company’s financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project its earnings. They also take a company’s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Locate Potential Outperformers? Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true. One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to exceed estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 14.Here are five out of the 14 stocks:Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report):  This is a manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.

1669,ILMN,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced results from the phase III trial, CheckMate -078 trial on blockbuster drug Opdivo in a number of people, the majority of whom were from China.This late-stage multinational, randomized study compared Opdivo to docetaxel in the treatment of patients with stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) whose disease has progressed after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.Results showed that Opdivo demonstrated a statistically significant benefit versus docetaxel on the primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”) as an OS benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression or tumor histology. Opdivo reduced the risk of death by 32% versus chemotherapy.Additionally, the two secondary endpoints of objective response rate and median duration of response demonstrated durability with Opdivo compared to docetaxel.  Objective response rates quadrupled with Opdivo (17%) versus docetaxel (4%); median duration of response not reached with Opdivo versus 5.3 months with docetaxel.The results will be updated in Immuno-Oncology Trials session at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting 2018 in Chicago (Abstract #CT114).We remind investors that the China Food and Drug Administration accepted the company’s Biologics License Application for Opdivo for the proposed indication of previously treated NSCLC in November 2017. A tentative approval will further boost the geographic reach of the drug.The efficacy and safety of Opdivo in a predominantly Chinese patient population with advanced NSCLC were consistent with the results of the global CheckMate -017 and -057 studies. Shares of the company have rallied 13.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 10.6%.Opdivo, became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval in July 2014. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy. Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions. The drug has been performing impressively due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and second-line NSCLC. The FDA also approved Opdivo for intravenous use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) who have been previously treated with Nexavar and Opdivo has rapidly penetrated the second line HCC market.Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.Earlier, the company stopped its phase III combination study, CheckMate-214, earlier than expected after it met its co-primary endpoint. The phase III study evaluated Opdivo plus Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma and met its co-primary endpoint. The study showed superior OS compared to current standard of care sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. The FDA accepted the company's sBLA for the same and will take a decision by Apr 16, 2018.However, Opdivo faces stiff competition from Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq.Concurrently, Bristol-Myers announced a collaboration with Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) to use the latter’s next-generation sequencing technology to develop and globally commercialize in-vitro diagnostic assays in support of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s oncology portfolio.Zacks RankBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1670,ILMN,"After President Donald Trump successfully repealed and replaced the Obamacare Healthcare Bill or the Affordable Care Act last year, his focus shifted to the passage of the “Right To Try” bill this year. On May 30, the President signed the 'Right To Try' bill into a law. This law will help patients suffering from terminal diseases to undergo experimental treatments and use drugs that are not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The passage of this law is definitely good news for patients and is expected to benefit the biotech industry. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now assessing the quality of biosimilar drugs, which will improve the quality parameter of these drugs and at the same time ensure hassle-free availability in the United States. This is why investing in biotech stocks with significant exposure in the U.S. market could be one of the most suitable investment options at present.Trump Signs “Right To Try” LawPresident Trump said that ""it takes a long time"" for a drug to get FDA approval and a terminally ill patient ""don't have an abundance of time."" Addressing this concern, Trump finally signed the “Right To Try” law on May, 30, which will help patients use experimental drugs that are not yet approved by the FDA. Additionally, Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of FDA said that the “Right to Try Act” will help “patients and families who are facing life-threatening diseases or conditions.”A lot of arguments can be made on to what extent this law could actually benefit these terminally ill patients. The FDA’s job is to assess and certify a drug’s quality and safety. But in doing so, the FDA sometimes blocks a drug or adds so many regulations that either the consumer fails to afford it or sometimes the company stops its development altogether. In this respect, the passage of the “Right to Try” law is definitely a win for patients as it gives them the flexibility to choose their preferred mode of medical treatment.WHO To Assess Bio-Similar DrugsDrugs for serious diseases like cancer, leukemia, and AIDs are comparatively expensive. However, cheaper copies of such drugs — known as bio-similars — are now circulating in global markets. According to Emer Cook, Head of Regulation of Medicines and other Health Technologies, WHO, these bio-similar drugs have become an “important part of the treatment armamentarium for many countries, including low- and middle-income countries.” However, lack of proper regulation for these bio-similars outside the United States and European markets is a concern. In order to address this issue, WHO has decided to invite drug-making companies in June to provide a report on their various bio-similar drugs. It is essential to check these bio-similars to determine whether these drugs have the same beneficial result like the original.Our ChoicesThe passage of the “Right To Try” law is expected to ease medical treatments for patients suffering from terminal diseases. Additionally, WHO’s focus on assessing the quality of bio-similar drugs will improve the safety factor of these drugs and in turn benefit the biotech market.In this context, we have selected five biotech stocks that are expected to gain following these developments.

1671,ILMN,"Shares of Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPRX  -  Free Report) rose almost 8.2%, after the company announced that the FDA has accepted the new drug application (NDA) for its lead pipeline candidate, Firdapse, and granted Priority Review to the same. The FDA has set an action date of Nov 28, 2018.Firdapse has been developed for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (“LEMS”). The NDA submission addressed the two issues raised in the 2016 Refusal to File letter during the previous Firdapse NDA submission and included all additional information requested by the FDA.Priority Review designation from the FDA is generally granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. Year to date, Catalyst’s shares have declined 2% against the industry’s increase of 0.8%.Firdapse is currently approved in the European Union (EU) for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS in adults. However, the drug is not yet approved in the United States.  In January 2017, it held a Type C meeting with the FDA, wherein Catalyst was advised, based on the briefing documents, that the company’s proposed NDA should be sufficient for resubmission. In November 2017, the company announced positive top-line results from its second phase III study of Firdapse in patients with LEMS.Catalyst also announced its decision of not including in this FDA submission those limited types of congenital myasthenic syndromes (“CMS”) that are considered mechanistically similar to LEMS. Catalyst decided not to overcomplicate the review of its NDA submission for LEMS with this second indication.The company is currently conducting a phase III study evaluating Firdapse for the treatment of CMS and expects to complete enrollment before the end of 2018 and report top-line results from this study in the first quarter of 2019. If the results of the trial are successful, the company plans to add the CMS indication to its labeling for Firdapse. Catalyst had in-licensed rights to Firdapse from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) in 2012 for the development and commercialization of the product in the United States. Also, Firdapse enjoys Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy status in the United States for the treatment of LEMS. Firdapse received Orphan Drug status in the United States for the treatment of congenital myasthenic syndromes (“CMS”) and myasthenia gravis (“MG”).LEMS is an ultra-rare disease even though several drugs and treatment therapies like steroids, azathioprine, other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin are currently in use. Guanidine HCl tablets are approved for the treatment of LEMS. However, due to significant side effects, the drug is not viewed as an effective treatment. This, in turn, has created ample space for introducing new therapies for LEMS.Therefore, approval of Firdapse in these indications will be a huge boost for the company, given its commercial potential in the target markets.Stocks That Warrant a LookCatalyst  carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Illumina, Inc.

1673,ILMN,"ResMed, Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) recently announced a definitive agreement to buy HEALTHCAREfirst— a privately-held provider of software solutions and services to home health and hospice agencies. After meeting certain customary closing conditions and receiving regulatory approvals, the deal is expected to be finalized before the end of first-quarter fiscal 2019 (per ResMed’s calendar).However, the financial details of the deal have been kept under wraps. Further, the transaction is expected to be immaterial to ResMed’s consolidated financial results.Buyout Integration & SynergiesPer ResMed, HEALTHCAREfirst’s solutions, comprising electronic health record (EHR) software, billing and coding services, and advanced analytics, complement Brightree’s (ResMed’s wholly-owned subsidiary) line of software solutions. Integration of HEALTHCAREfirst’s solutions with ResMed’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) portfolio will enhance the latter’s efficacy in managing the growing population and providing benefits to patients, their families, agencies and payers.A Glimpse of the SaaS BusinessResMed witnessed a 14% year-over-year growth in revenues from the Brightree SaaS business in the last reported quarter. Notably, the company has been actively working on chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, health care analytics, care co-ordination and SaaS models for home health, home nursing and hospice. In this area, the company introduced Brightree's new offering OASIS for the home health and hospice market. Notably, OASIS stands for Outcome and Assessment Information Set.ResMed is also expanding its range of out-of-hospital software offerings through the acquisition of software-as-a-service businesses for home health, home nursing and other alternative care settings. We believe this buyout will help ResMed solidify its SaaS portfolio.Market Potential Per ResMed, a rapidly aging population, growing incidence of chronic conditions along with changes in the trend with higher inclination toward homecare and other lower-cost care settings will continue to provide impetus to the home health and hospice segments.Going by a Stratistics MRC report published by Reuters, the global home healthcare market is expected to reach a worth of around $494.78 billion in 2023, at a CAGR of 10.1% from 2016 to 2023.

Moreover, the NovaSeq platform continued to drive growth with more than 230 orders since the launch in Jan 2017.Product revenues (82.0% of total revenue) increased 6.5% year over year to $543 million. Service and Other (18%) revenues were up 32.2% year over year to $119 million.Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. QuoteOperational UpdateIllumina's adjusted gross margin came in at 67.1%, reflecting a contraction of 540 basis points (bps) year over year owing to NovaSeq introduction, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables. Excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets and including stock-based compensation expenses, adjusted gross margin was 67.0%, highlighting a contraction of 540 bps from the prior-year period.Research and development expenses were up 4% year over year to $130 million and selling, general & administrative expenses rose 14.2% to $169 million. Consequently, the adjusted operating margin of 23.1% reflected a decline of 570 bps from the year-ago period, primarily due to increased investments in GRAIL and Helix.Financial UpdateIllumina exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.89 billion, up from $1.78 billion in the first quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $346 million, compared with $341 million in the year-ago period.2017 GuidanceBanking on the solid second-quarter performance, Illumina has raised its full-year 2017 revenue growth expectations to 12% from the earlier provided range of 10–12%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 revenues is pegged at $2.65 billion.The company continues to expect adjusted EPS in the band of $3.60–$3.70 (unchanged from earlier guidance). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Illumina’s 2017 bottom line stands at $3.63, near the low end of the guided range.Our TakeIllumina exited the second quarter on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the top line was strong on several product launches including the VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe and the strength in NovaSeq, the bottom line was impacted by margin pressure.We are currently looking forward to the performance of the Extended RAS Panel that is slated for launch in the third quarter. Notably, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for this test next-generation sequencing kit in Jun 2017. Also, Illumina’s recently developed venture for the cancer screening market – GRAIL – has started to deliver positive news.On the flip side, weak margins owing to NovaSeq launch, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables will continue to act as deterrents. Also, a tough competitive landscape is a concern. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksIllumina currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (MLAB  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

1676,ILMN,"Medtronic plc’s (MDT  -  Free Report) Diabetes Group has been on a solid growth trajectory of late, on encouraging contributions from majority of the sub-segments.We expect this strength to reflect in fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results, which are scheduled to release before the opening bell on May 24.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is likely to be.Diabetes in FocusMedtronic’s Diabetes Group presently comprises the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Services & Solutions (DSS) divisions. The Diabetes segment develops, manufactures, and markets advanced, integrated diabetes management solutions that includes insulin pump therapy, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, and therapy management software.We note that management expects double-digit revenue growth in the Diabetes Group in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Per management, consistently strong adoption of MiniMed 670G system in the United States along with enhanced sensor supply capacity will drive the upside.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diabetes Group revenues of $621 million indicates a rise of 21.3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, our estimates for Diabetes Group revenues in the United States of $362 million reflect a rise of 19.5% from a year ago.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC Quote In the last reported quarter, the segment recorded improvement in sales and benefited from increased uptake of the new sensor-augmented insulin pump systems in the United States as well as in the international markets along with enhanced production capacity for the same. Notably, the MiniMed 670G system has served over 20,000 patients in the United States.This apart, management is optimistic about the uptick in consumable revenues from Animas Corporation’s (one of the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Care Companies) users in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Moreover, they have stated that the company is progressing well with the smooth transition of Animas users. We expect the trend to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter as well.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic proceeded with initiatives to boost the performance of its MiniMed portfolio. In February, the company expanded its product portfolio with the addition of MiniMed Mio Advance infusion set. The latest offering in the Diabetes business was planned to be made commercially available in Canada, Hong Kong and certain countries in Europe in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.In the same month, the company announced that the FDA has approved a new arm indication for the Guardian Sensor 3 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) used with the MiniMed 670G insulin pump. Notably, the Guardian Sensor 3 is the company’s latest and most accurate CGM. Per Medtronic, this is the only sensor to have received an FDA nod for controlling automated insulin delivery via a hybrid closed loop system, the MiniMed 670G.This new arm indication for the Guardian Sensor 3 offers more convenience and flexibility to patients. It is available in the United States for use with the MiniMed 670G system. We believe these developments will be beneficial to the company’s Diabetes Group portfolio, which should get reflected in the yet-to-be-reported quarter results.Let's see how things are shaping up in these sub-segments before the fourth-quarter release.IIM revenues rose in the high-teens at CER in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. However, the company witnessed 15% growth in new patient count in the United States. This growth was led by solid uptake of MiniMed 670G system in the United States with the Guardian sensor 3 CGM. In addition, the division delivered low-20s digit constant currency growth in international markets on account of continued strength in the MiniMed 640G system.Given the developments with regard to the MiniMed 670G system, we expect top-line contributions from the continued uptake of this product to rise and get reflected in the soon-to-be reported quarter results.DSS grew mid-single digits at CER as consumables benefitted from rise in installed base and enhanced patient utilization. The improvement in this business is expected to continue.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical and Illumina sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Amedisys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1677,ILMN,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results, after markets close on Apr 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.03% with the average earnings beat being 13% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Illumina is expected to gain from strong Product revenues. Over the last few quarters, the company’s product revenues have been gaining from rising demand for sequencing consumables and instruments as well as the microarray range.Within consumables, the NovaSeq platform continues to see growth with close to 285 NovaSeq systems currently in customers’ hands since the launch last January. For 2018, NovaSeq shipments are projected in the range of 330 to 350.Management is hopeful that launches like S4 flow cell, Xp workflow and Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit will drive NovaSeq demand in the near term.Given the transition in Illumina’s high-throughput portfolio related to the NovaSeq introduction, instrument revenues have also been rising. Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues of $621 million reflects an increase of 26.5% from the year-ago quarter.Total Services and other revenues, which include genotyping and sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts and revenues from oncology agreements, have also been strong. The upside is being driven by strength in genotyping services due to sequencing instrument maintenance contracts and increased consumer demand.At NIPT, Illumina won Dutch National contract during the previous quarter along with some other encouraging developments. Per management, these factors will more than double sales from this business in 2018.  Moreover, the company is making progress with NIPT adoption, courtesy of continued uptake of VeriSeq NIPT Solution, which includes CE-IVD marked library prep and analysis software.With MiniSeq and MiSeq shipments accounting for roughly 60% of the new-to-sequencing customer demand and growing NextSeq adoption with commercial customers using the platform in production settings, Illumina’s benchtop portfolio has been encouraging.The bullish trend is expected to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Service and other revenues of $123 million shows a rise of 15% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Illumina’s first-quarter results:In January 2018, Illumina announced the launch of the iSeq 100 Sequencing System. This next-generation sequencing system delivers excellent data accuracy, at a low capital cost, making Illumina technology available to virtually any lab. Since the company began shipping the product in January itself, investors will be watching out for the difference it will make to the top-line results in the quarter to be reported.Geographically, Illumina has been witnessing growing revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) led by sequencing instruments and consumables. Solid performance in Asia Pacific propelled by 12% shipment growth in Greater China also encourages us. Recently, management has noticed an uptick in demand from customers who are attempting to set up NIPT operations in China. We believe these developments will open channels for Illumina, thereby enhancing business growth.Although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move may mar sales in China in the near term.Total oncology testing was up 60% in the last reported quarter. Per management, the solid results were primarily led by continued growth in the translational liquid biopsy segment. Furthermore, Illumina continues to expect robust demand for oncology testing.Overall, first-quarter total revenues are projected at $743 million, up 24.2% from the prior-year quarter.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Illumina has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +6.07%, a combination that suggests that the company is likely to beat estimates.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.02 reflects a 59.4% rise on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.34% and a Zacks Rank #3.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.19% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1678,ILMN,"Making its debut on 06/23/2005, smart beta exchange traded fund PowerShares Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Portfolio (PBE  -  Free Report) provides investors broad exposure to the Health Care ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor & IndexPBE is managed by Invesco Powershares, and this fund has amassed over $238.34 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Health Care ETFs. PBE, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Intellidex Index.This is comprised of stocks of 30 U.S. biotechnology and genome companies. These are companies that are principally engaged in the research, development, manufacture and marketing and distribution of various biotechnological products, services and processes and companies that benefit significantly from scientific and technological advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering and research.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.58% for PBE, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.44%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Healthcare sector - about 100% of the portfolio.When you look at individual holdings, Illumina Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) accounts for about 5.45% of the fund's total assets, followed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRTX  -  Free Report) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 45.9% of PBE's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has added roughly 3.16% so far this year and is up about 17.49% in the last one year (as of 04/12/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $41.34 and $54.07.The ETF has a beta of 1.38 and standard deviation of 28.06% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high choice in the space. With about 31 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Portfolio is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Health Care ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report) tracks S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index and the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) tracks Nasdaq Biotechnology Index. SPDR S&P Biotech ETF has $4.65 B in assets, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF has $8.80 B. XBI has an expense ratio of 0.35% and IBB charges 0.47%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Health Care ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1682,ILMN,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), a leading provider of tools and integrated systems for analysis of genetic variation and function, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, Illumina’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, at an average of 8.56%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the last reported first quarter of 2017, Illumina witnessed robust revenue growth on account of consistent improvement in sequencing consumables and strong demand of microarrays. While management is still emphasizing on its portfolio of sequencing platforms to fortify its market position, we expect the company to maintain top-line growth in the second quarter of 2017.Per management, top-line growth in the first quarter can also be attributed to strong uptake of the NovaSeq platform with more than 135 orders placed in this period.Moreover, with an active HiSeq customer base of roughly 800 customers, the company expects the replacement of older generation instruments by NovaSeq trend to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. QuoteFurther, the company recently launched VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe, a CE-IVD marked next-generation sequencing based approach to noninvasive prenatal testing. Notably, outside the U.S., the rate of NIPT adoption is increasing. The Netherlands and Denmark began covering the test in the first quarter and the same is expected shortly in France. The company continues to see positive reimbursement trends in Europe as well. Also, Illumina has been forging ahead with its NIPT expansion plans in China.We believe these developments will boost the company’s top line in the upcoming quarter.On the flip side, weak margins owing to the introduction of NovaSeq, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables will continue to act as deterrents for the company. Also, a tough competitive landscape may pose a challenge for the company. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding which Illumina has been facing for quite some time now.Overall, for the second quarter of 2017, Illumina projects revenue growth of approximately 7%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $642.5 million. The company expects adjusted EPS in the range of 65–70 cents. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is stable at 68 cents, within the guided range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Illumina is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Illumina has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 68 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Illumina’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.(TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1683,ILMN,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Illuminais seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ILMN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.25 per share for ILMN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ILMN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.73% heading into earnings season.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

1684,ILMN,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 30, after market close. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.3%. Let's see how things are shaping up ahead of this announcement.Let’s take a look at Illumina’s announcement of preliminary fourth-quarter results at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference held in San Francisco, CA.Per the announcement, preliminary revenues for the fourth quarter are estimated at $775 million, up 25% year over year. The figure is also higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $748 million.The preliminary figure for 2017 revenues is $2.75 billion, up 15% from 2016 driven by the adoption of NovaSeq and growth in clinical and consumer genomics. The figure is also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 billion.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Similar to last quarter, Illumina is expected to gain from strong Product as well as Service and other revenues. Over the last few quarters, the company’s product revenues increased primarily on higher sequencing consumable revenues. Total Service and other revenues demonstrate strong growth led by continued demand for NextSeq from NIPT customers and partners.The company expects fourth-quarter sequencing consumables to increase more than 30%, up $100 million from the year-ago quarter on the back of increased utilization in the high throughput systems and strong pull-through on NextSeq.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues of $621 million reflects an increase of 4.2% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Service and other revenues of $121 million indicates a rise of 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Illumina’s fourth-quarter results:In November 2017, Illumina introduced its second FDA-regulated and CE-IVD marked next-generation sequencing (NGS) system — NextSeq 550Dx. With this, Illumina now has a solid diagnostic NGS portfolio, courtesy of its NextSeq 550Dx and the MiSeqDx products. This portfolio is capable of meeting any clinical requirement for NGS-based in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products. This is likely to boost the top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Last October, Illumina announced the availability of the NovaSeq S4 flow cell and reagent kit for its NovaSeq 6000 System. Management expects to witness strong NovaSeq uptake through the fourth quarter of 2017 into 2018 and beyond. Moreover, in the same month, Illumina announced the availability of Nextera DNA Flex — a whole genome sequencing library prep product. We expect these factors to drive revenues as well.Also, encouraged by the solid third-quarter performance, Illumina raised its adjusted EPS to the band of $3.73-$3.78 from the earlier $3.60-$3.70.On the flip side, a tough competitive landscape may pose a challenge. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding, which Illumina has been facing for quite some time now.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Illumina has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Illumina is +0.84%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Illumina carries a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 98 cents reflects a 1% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks Worth ConsideringHere are a few medical other stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Myriad Genetics, Inc.

Notably, amplicon technology is highly effective in capturing DNA and RNA from very limited amount of samples for application in a range of research areas. Ion AmpliSeq technology was developed to facilitate amplicon sequencing on the Ion Torrent NGS systems.Illumina will now distribute the product directly to customers under the brand AmpliSeq. Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher will continue to sell Ion AmpliSeq chemistry for both IVD and RUO applications to Ion Torrent NGS customers. Furthermore, Thermo Fisher will retain the right to make the technology available on other next-generation sequencing platforms.  Next-generation Sequencing Platform in FocusIllumina is consistently working on enhancing its next-generation sequencing platform. Illumina recently introduced its second FDA-regulated and CE-IVD marked next-generation sequencing system — NextSeq 550Dx. In August 2017, Illumina partnered with Telegraph Hill Partners to set up an independent company Verogen, Inc. The entity is expected to strengthen Illumina’s NGS business in the forensic genomics market.According to Markets and Markets, the global next-generation sequencing market is estimated to reach a worth of $12.45 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 20.5%.Over the last three months, Illumina has gained 18.7% as against the broader industry’s decline of 6.1%.Estimate Revision TrendThe current estimate revision trend is favorable.

1687,ILMN,"On Jan 9, we issued an updated research report on Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. (PACB  -  Free Report). Solid contribution from the Instrument and Consumable revenue platforms have been boosting Pacific Biosciences' growth trajectory. However, cutthroat competition in the niche space has been hampering Pacific Biosciences revenues. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Pacific Biosciences is a leading player in the DNA sequencing market. However, the niche space is highly competitive owing to the presence of established players like Illumina (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report). Low-cost sequencing products from Illumina continue to gain traction, which is a headwind for the company. Moreover, Pacific Biosciences is a relatively small company compared with the second generation sequencing technology firms.Moreover, product launches from the likes of 10X, Oxford Nanopore, Dovetail Genomics are expected to intensify competition in the genome assembly market, which will increase pricing pressure on Pacific Biosciences over the long term.Among other major concerns, Pacific Biosciences’ sales in Europe have declined substantially on a year-over-year basis, lagging the company’s target. A number of customers in Europe have been slow in initiating the usage of Sequel systems. As a result, the company’s products witnessed poor adoption in European markets in the recent past.Further, management forecasts 8-10% rise in operating expenses for full-year 2017 on a year-over-year basis. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2017 totaled $29.8 million compared with $29.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Cash and investments at the end of the third quarter was $84 million compared with $102.6 million at the end of the second quarter.On a positive note, Pacific Biosciences’ flagship platform — the Sequel system — has been fortifying the company’s footprint worldwide. Sequel system is a nucleic acid sequencing platform based on SMRT technology that was developed in partnership with Roche. However, Pacific Bioscience’s agreement with Roche terminated earlier in 2016. The Sequel System has been a persistent contributor to Pacific Bioscience’s top line.Price PerformanceThe price movement of Pacific Biosciences has been unfavorable over the last six months. Notably, the stock has lost almost 21.1% comparing unfavorably with the industry’s rally of roughly 8.8%. Further, the current level compares unfavorably with the S&P 500 index’s return of 9.3%. The ongoing sluggishness in the European markets is the principal cause for the dismal price performance. Further, the company terminated its three-year long agreement with Roche Diagnostics. The collaboration provided a way to generate millions of long, single-molecule barcoded DNA fragments, averaging 10-30 kilobases that originated from much longer fragments of around 100 kilobases.Key PickA better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

1689,ILMN,"On Dec 26, we issued an updated research report on Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last three months, shares of this San Diego, CA-based company have been trading above the broader industry. The stock has rallied 7.6% versus the broader industry’s decline of 9.5% during the period.We are encouraged to note that the company’s third-quarter 2017 performance was quite promising. The top line was driven by a solid uptake of sequencing consumables and instruments as well as microarray portfolios. Meanwhile, the company’s raised 2017 guidance indicates that this bullish trend is here to stay.Management is hopeful that recent launches from the company’s product portfolio including NovaSeq S4 flow cell and the reagent kit for its NovaSeq 6000 System will drive demand for NovaSeq. We also look forward to the introduction of NovaSeqXp workflow. Besides, the company’s launch of Nextera DNA Flex buoys optimism. Moreover, it has recently partnered with Telegraph Hill Partners to set up an independent entity.We are also curious about GRAIL’s prospects, Illumina’s venture in the cancer screening market. Importantly, the company has started a detailed planning to embark on a large-scale clinical trial in 2017.Illumina is currently keeping pace with its goals to strengthen foothold in the multi-billion gene sequencing market with some highly competitive products in its existing portfolio and the pipeline. For its market expansion, the company’s primary focus was on reproductive and genetic health space, for which, Illumina seeks to widen its portfolio by providing the verifi laboratory-developed non-invasive prenatal test (“NIPT”).This market is rapidly developing on a global scale, allowing the company to witness consistent growth in the number of NIPT samples. Good news is that positive NIPT reimbursement trends have been observed within the United States during the third quarter. Incidentally, the rate of NIPT adoption is equally high beyond the country’s periphery.We are particularly upbeat about the strong uptake of VeriSeq NIPT CE-IVD solution in third-quarter 2017. On a positive note, countries like The Netherlands and Denmark too have started covering the test since the first quarter, followed by England and France. Hence, the company continues to see positive reimbursement trends in Europe as well.On the flip side, weak margins due to the NovaSeq launch, higher array service revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables continue to raise concerns. Also, the National Institutes of Health funding issue and a tough competitive landscape are a few more challenges to deal with.Key PicksSome of the top-ranked medical stocks are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and ICU Medical Inc. (ICUI  -  Free Report). Notably, Bio Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Baxter International Inc. and ICU Medical Inc. carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1690,ILMN,"Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $3.81 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.64 and were up 20% from the year-ago quarter figure of $3.17.However, revenues of $3.7 billion, up 7% year over year, slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.76 billion. The year-over-year increase was aided by strong growth in the immunology franchise, partially offset by loss of sales of Cinryze and Lialda.Shire’s shares closed 2.8% higher on Friday, presumably on the earnings beat and strong immunology franchise growth. However, the company’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock fell 16.6% during this time compared with the industry’s 2.2% decline.Quarter in DetailProduct sales increased 7% year over year to $3.6 billion driven by the immunology franchise. Royalties and other revenues were up 20% to $164 million primarily due to an increase in royalties acquired from Dyax and Sensipar.The company’s Ophthalmology franchise contributed $77.4 million to total product sales, up 34.8% sequentially, driven by strong demand for Xiidra.The immunology franchise registered sales of $801.7 million, up 32.2% year over year. Neuroscience franchise sales came in at $691.1 million, up 12.1% driven by strong demand for Adderall XR amid generic competition. Moreover, Mydayis, which was approved in June for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”) and has been available through prescription since late August in the United States, brought in sales of $10.2 million. Vyvanse sales increased 5% to $538.4 million.Genetic disease portfolio sales were down 7.1% to $628.1 million primarily due to lower sales of Cinryze, which declined 65.6% to $56.9 million as a result of supply shortage arising from manufacturing interruption. However, sales of Firazyr were up 33.6% to $137.4 million and Elaprase sales increased 4.2% to $152.9 million.The company may have lost some hereditary angioedema (“HAE”) patients to rival products due to this shortage. However, to avoid supply shortage in the future, the company is planning to manufacture Cinryze itself. An application for in-house manufacturing facility has been filed in the United States.Lialda sales were down 58.4% to $86.7 million due to the entry of generic competition. The company has launched an authorized generic version of its own to counter the competition. However, Gattex and Natpara showed impressive performance with sales increasing 46.1% and 67.8% to $84.9 million and $39.1 million, respectively. Oncology sales added $68.5 million to total revenue.Research and development (R&D) costs were down 21.2% to $402.8 million and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 1.8% to $859.7 million primarily due to synergies related to the Baxalta integration.The company is in the process of divesting five of its manufacturing facilities, as it has excess facility following the Baxalta acquisition. Shire has already divested two of its facilities along with the divestment of Hayward, CA biotechnology site.2017 Outlook ReiteratedShire maintained its earnings per ADS guidance in the range of $14.80–$15.20 and product sales projection in the range of $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion. The company re-stated its forecast for royalties and other revenues of around $600–$700 million. Gross margin is estimated between 74.5% and 76.5%.Regulatory UpdateIn August, Shire submitted a marketing authorization application in Europe seeking approval of lifitegrast (approved as Xiidra in the United States) for treating dry eye disease. In September, the FDA granted fast track designation for its chronic lung disease candidate, SHP607. An ongoing phase II study is evaluating the candidate in extremely premature infants.Subsequent to the quarter in October, the European Commission approved the label expansion of Firazyr to include paediatric patients (adolescents and children aged 2 years and older) with acute HAE. Meanwhile, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended the approval of its marketing authorization application for Lyophilized Oncaspar, a new dried formulation. Shire’s hemophilia A candidate, SHP654, was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA.The company is planning to file a biologics license application for HAE candidate, SHP643, by March 2018 and a new drug application for chronic constipation candidate, SHP555, by the end of this year.Pipeline UpdateShire continues to progress with its pipeline candidates. In September, angioedema candidate, SHP616, demonstrated significant reduction in HAE monthly attack rate versus placebo in pivotal SAHARA study in patients 12 years of age or older. Meanwhile, Intuniv demonstrated superiority over placebo in improving clinically administered ADHD rating scale compared to baseline in a phase III study.Our TakeShire’s third-quarter results were encouraging with the company beating bottom-line estimates driven by the sales of immunology sales. The approval of label expansion of Firazyr in Europe is expected to boost sales going ahead. A potential approval of Lyophilized Oncaspar will provide further boost to its top line.The availability of Mydayis boosted the company’s immunology space. Its uptake has been strong with over 3,000 physicians prescribing to over 11,000 patients till Oct 17. The manufacturing issue related to Cinryze was also addressed with $100 million of products shipped to customers in early October. This shipment is expected to have a significant impact on fourth-quarter sales.However, generic competition for Lialda is expected to continue, further impacting the sales unfavorably in the fourth quarter.Shire PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Shire PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Shire PLC QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksShire carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the pharma sector include Illumina, Inc.

Adjusted earnings also surpassed the year-ago number by 14.4%.Including one-time items, the company reported EPS of $1.11, compared with 87 cents a year ago.RevenuesIn the reported quarter, Illumina's revenues grew 17.6% year over year to $714 million. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%. Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Per management, top-line growth in the third quarter can be attributed to strong uptake of sequencing consumables and instruments as well as microarray portfolios. Moreover, the NovaSeq platform continued to drive growth with close to 200 NovaSeq systems currently at customers’ hands since the launch in January 2017. Management is also hopeful that recent launches like S4 flow cell, Xp workflow and Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit will drive NovaSeq demand.Product revenues (83.5% of total revenue) increased 15.9% year over year to $596 million. Service and Other (15.5%) revenues were up 26.9% year over year to $118 million.Operational UpdateIllumina's adjusted gross margin came in at 67.5%, reflecting a contraction of 267 basis points (bps) year over year owing to NovaSeq introduction, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables. Excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets and including stock-based compensation expenses, adjusted gross margin was 68.8%, highlighting a contraction of 320 bps from a year ago.Research and development expenses were up 20.1% year over year to $134 million and selling, general & administrative expenses rose 6.3% to $167 million.

Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $581 million, compared with $517 million in the year-ago period.2017 GuidanceBanking on the solid third-quarter performance, Illumina has raised its full-year 2017 revenue growth expectations to 13% from the earlier provided range of 12%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 revenues is pegged at $2.69 billion.The company raised its adjusted EPS to the band of $3.73-$3.78 from the earlier $3.60–$3.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Illumina’s 2017 bottom line stands at $3.64, far below the low end of the guided range. Our TakeIllumina exited the third quarter on a solid note. We are also encouraged by the year-over-year increase in both the fronts. The company has also raised its full-year 2017 revenue guidance and the adjusted EPS range. We are looking forward to the performance of NovaSeq S4 flow cell, reagent kit and NovaSeq Xp workflow for its NovaSeq 6000 System.On the flip side, weak margins owing to the lower instrument margin associated with NovaSeq launch and higher array services mix will continue to act as deterrents. Also, a tough competitive landscape is a concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Illumina has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

1693,ILMN,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, after markets close on Oct 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.6% with average earnings beat of 9.3% in three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Illumina is expected to gain from strong performance in Product revenues as well as Service and other revenue segments. Over the last few quarters, the company’s product revenues increased primarily onrising sequencing consumable revenues. Total Service and other revenues are demonstrating strong growth led by continued demand for NextSeq from NIPT customers and partners. We expect these factors to drive the yet-to-be reported quarter’s performance as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues of $579 million reflects an increase of 12.6% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Service and other revenues of $116 million indicates a rise of 24.7% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, third-quarter 2017 total revenues are projected at $694 million, up 14.3% from the prior-year quarter. Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Here are the other factors that might influence Illumina’s third-quarter results:Illumina earlier announced that its FDA-approved next-generation sequencing (NGS) -- Extended RAS Panel has met the Current Colorectal Cancer Guidelines. This new kit fulfills the most up-to-date guidance for RAS testing to determine eligibility of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in metastatic colorectal cancer. Management expected the shipment of this kit to start in the third quarter of 2017. Hence, we expect this to drive the top line.In the second quarter, Illumina witnessed 12% growth in the Asia-Pacific region, propelled by 16% rise in China. Among the emerging markets, China currently offers the most favorable space for Illumina’s business growth. In recent times, management has noticed a considerable rise in demand from customers looking to set up NIPT operations in China. With China currently being the fourth largest developing nation (in terms of nominal GDP), we believe the progress in the country will open up channels for Illumina, thereby driving its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Also, encouraged by the solid second-quarter performance, Illumina has raised its full-year 2017 revenue growth expectations to 12% from the earlier provided range of 10-12%. On the flip side, a tough competitive landscape may pose a challenge for the company. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding which Illumina has been facing for quite some time now.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Illumina does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Illumina is -0.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Illumina carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 98 cents reflects a 1% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.06% and a Zacks Rank #3.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

Moreover, investors are awaiting response to the Extended RAS Panel which is slated for launch in the third quarter. In June, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for the Extended RAS companion diagnostic kit (as the Class III PMA).We are also looking forward to GRAIL, Illumina’s own-developed company, focused on the cancer screening market.On the flip side, weak margins due to the NovaSeq launch, higher array service revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables continue to raise concerns. Also, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding issue and a tough competitive landscape are a few challenges to deal with.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.
