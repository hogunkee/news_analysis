2,PSX,"Valero Energy's (VLO) second quarter beat estimates as refining throughput volumes increased on discounted crude on the Gulf Coast.The refiner's Q2 earnings rose 27% to $1.22 per share, in line with an earlier announcement. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting $1.21. Revenue rose 2.6% to $34.9 billion, beating estimates for $29.2 billion.Shares were flat at 49.97 on the stock market today.Valero's refining throughput volumes rose 115,000 barrels per day to 2.7 million barrels per day as discounted light crude from shale plays in North America continued to flow to the Gulf.Phillips 66's (PSX) Q2 EPS rose 0.7% to $1.51, falling short of views by 19 cents. Revenue climbed 7.2% to $46.3 billion, under estimates for $47.5 billion.Shares fell 1% to 81.64.The refiner was spun off from ConocoPhillips (COP) in 2012.

3,PSX,"Pioneer Natural Resources shares jumped Wednesday after the Texas-based oil company got the OK from Washington Tuesday to export oil. Refiners' shares sank on the news.Domestic drillers Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) received approval from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security to export condensate, a type of ultralight oil, reported the Wall Street Journal. Shipments can begin as early as August and likely will be small.The ruling probably will encourage other oil producers to ask for export permission, and the Commerce Department is working on an industrywide approval, according to the report. But as of Tuesday, the department said ""no change in policy on crude-oil exports"" has been made. By midafternoon, Pioneer Natural shares had traded up 4% to 230.57 in the stock market today, Wednesday. Enterprise Products shares rose 1.1% to 76.97.Separately Tuesday, Enterprise announced plans to build a 1,200-mile pipeline to connect the Bakken play in North Dakota to the oil pricing hub of Cushing, Okla.The pipeline will have a daily capacity of 340,000 barrels of oil and should be operational by the end of 2016.The Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production group is highly ranked at No. 3 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.Only refined petroleum products can be exported under current laws. The ban started in the 1970s as an attempt to protect Americans from price spikes caused by Middle Eastern countries and OPEC using oil as a political weapon. But with the new influx of oil from previously unreachable plays in the Dakotas and Texas, many analysts and lawmakers believe that the ban is outdated.Refiners are the biggest opponents to lifting the ban and have benefited from the discount of light crude in the U.S., sending refined products abroad at much higher prices.Valero Energy (VLO) shares fell 10.6% to 50.08. Phillips 66 (PSX) fell 5% to 80.60.The IBD Oil & Gas-Refining/Marketing group is ranked at No. 17.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

81,PSX,"If you want to make a splash on Wall Street with your initial public offering, it helps if your name is instantly recognizable to most investors.Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP) has that advantage.The company is a master limited partnership (MLP) that owns and operates oil and refined petroleum product pipelines and terminals.It was founded as a subsidiary of Phillips 66 (PSX), the Houston-based oil and gas giant that ranks as one of the world's biggest companies.Phillips 66 Partners' assets include a crude oil pipeline, terminal and storage system in Louisiana; a refined petroleum product pipeline, terminal and storage system in Texas; and another refined petroleum product pipeline, terminal and storage system in Illinois.The partnership gets just about all of its revenue by charging tariffs and fees for transporting, terminaling, and storing crude oil and refined products for Phillips 66.Auspicious StartPhillips 66 Partners had its initial public offering July 23. Its units priced at $23 a share, above the target range of $19 to $21. They opened at 28.98 on the first day of trading and closed at 29.70, up 29% from the IPO price.Shares then peaked at 35.94 on July 29, and they currently trade near 33.The early strength in Phillips 66 Partners' share price — and the reason for much of the optimism around the company's growth prospects — has a lot to do with its relationship with Phillips 66.In a report initiating coverage on Phillips 66 Partners, Citigroup analyst John Tysseland said the company is ""set to benefit from a large portfolio of drop-down eligible assets from Phillips 66.""He estimates that around $5.4 billion worth of crude oil, refined product and natural gas pipelines, terminals and other midstream assets that are still being operated by Phillips 66 ""will likely be dropped down to the partnership"" over the next three to five years.""With the potential to add about $660 million in additional EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), these drop-downs serve as the primary driver of double-digit distribution growth to PSXP over the next several years,"" Tysseland noted.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Gabe Moreen has a similarly upbeat assessment, saying that Phillips 66 Partners offers unit holders ""the ability to invest in a pure-play drop-down story with the potential for substantial cash distribution growth — driven by PSX's stable of logistics assets — as long as PSX continues to drop down assets at a reasonable pace and valuation.""In most circumstances, it's risky to depend on one client for your business because of the possibility that the relationship goes sour somewhere down the line.""If PSX becomes financially strained, does not support PSXP's growth, proposes changes to contractual terms, or defaults on contractual terms, PSXP would be materially impacted,"" JPMorgan analyst Jeremy Tonet noted in a report.MLPs A Rising TrendHowever, it's unlikely Phillips 66 would do anything to undermine the partnership. Phillips 66 is one of a growing number of oil and gas firms that have formed MLPs to operate their midstream business units. It has a vested interest in seeing the partnership succeed.""PSXP is integral to its parent's business,"" noted John Edwards, analyst at Credit Suisse.He cites a couple of reasons. For one thing, Phillips 66 Partners' assets support the refining and marketing operations of PSX's refineries. For another, Phillips 66 Partners is a primary growth/financing vehicle for PSX's expanding transportation and midstream business.On a third-quarter conference call with analysts, Phillips 66 Partners Chief Executive Greg Garland said the parent company has plans to rapidly grow its midstream businesses and plans to use the partnership to achieve that growth.""Given its large portfolio of midstream assets and strategy for growth, we anticipate near-term opportunities to acquire additional assets,"" Garland said. ""This will allow for significant Phillips 66 Partners growth in the near-term and provide the platform on attractive growth profile longer term.""Phillips 66 Partners charges fixed fees for the use of its pipelines, terminals, barge docks and storage facilities. All of the company's assets operate under long-term, fee-based transportation and terminaling agreements with its parent company.""These agreements include specified minimum volume commitments and rate escalators, which provide the partnership with long-term, stable cash flows that have little to no direct sensitivity to commodity price fluctuations,"" Citigroup's Tysseland noted.Phillips 66 Partners reported its first quarter as a publicly traded company on Oct. 30.It posted transportation and terminaling revenue of $29.6 million, up from $21.3 million the prior year and above the $27.6 million expected by JPMorgan.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $19.2 million, up from $11.9 million a year earlier and above consensus estimates.Phillips 66 Partners is part of IBD's Oil & Gas-Transportation/Pipeline group. Master limited partnership peers in the group include Kinder Morgan Energy (KMP), Plains All American Pipeline (PAA) and Sunoco Logistics Partners (SXL).

Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2%. S&P 500 futures traded a fraction below fair value.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) exerted downward force on both the Dow industrials and the S&P 500, slipping 2% after reporting first-quarter results.A big, 1.6% rebound for the Nasdaq on Thursday narrowed the index's loss for the week to 0.4%.

That left the index down 0.3% for the week through Thursday, after diving as much as 3.3% to a mid-session low on Wednesday.The message — it's a volatile market — is reflected in IBD's current Market Pulse market status indicator.Preliminary first-quarter GDP growth estimates from the Commerce Department were positive, with growth of 2.3% coming in below the fourth-quarter's 2.9% advance, but outpacing economist projections for a slowdown to 2% growth. The closely-watched price inflation number was also better-than-expected, with the GDP Price Index up 2%, below Q4's 2.3% increase and countering expectations for an uptick to 2.4% growth.Consumer spending met expectations for a 1.1% increase, although well below the prior quarters 4% surge.Leading tech names Expedia (EXPE), Amazon, and Intel reported quarterly results late Thursday.Expedia spiked 10.7% after reporting a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss late Thursday, and a 15% rise in bookings, to $27.2 billion.Amazon hurtled ahead 7%.

The company also announced plans to raise the price of its Prime membership to $119, from $99.

Intel's premarket gain positioned the stock for a gap-up breakout at the open above a 53.88 buy point in a flat base.

128,PSX,"Warren Buffett lords over an empire that sells everything from candy to car insurance. And on Saturday, the Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) chief releases his hotly awaited annual letter to shareholders.X Investors in Berkshire Hathaway will look to learn what the Nebraska-based conglomerate will do with a rapidly swelling pile of cash that crossed $100 billion last September. They hope, too, for the 87-year-old chief to drop more clues on a succession plan.Buffett's letter to shareholders, combining insights from the legendary investor with humorous reflections, has appeared with clockwork regularity every year since 1977. They're archived on the Berkshire Hathaway website.Some Berkshire watchers are hoping the company will put its cash to use by expanding its portfolio of companies. Berkshire hasn't made a major purchase since its $37 billion acquisition of Precision Castparts, a maker of parts for jet engines and gas turbines, in 2015.CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert says Berkshire's acquisition strategy is less likely to focus on heavily regulated industries (like those in the financial services sector) when it can leverage upside to these industries via stock investments. Similarly, its technology exposure has been a result of investments, not acquisitions, she added.""Against that backdrop, our sense is future acquisitions will likely be in the energy, materials and industrials areas, and possibly health care and consumer staples,"" she wrote in a note Thursday, without naming specific companies.It's a different story on Buffett's stock buys. Buffett started purchasing Apple (AAPL) in 2016 and has steadily raised his stake in the iPhone maker's stock, which has jumped 25% in the past year alone. Apple is now Berkshire's largest stock holding, accounting for roughly 15% of his $191.2 billion portfolio at the end of 2017.Seifert is also watching for these items in the chairman's letter:Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway rose 1% to close at 202.76 on the stock market today.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportAs Buffett struggles to find companies to buy, nearly all his cash hoard is held in U.S. Treasury bills. The cash pile increased by $3.3 billion this month after Phillips 66 (PSX) bought back 35 million shares from Berkshire Hathaway.Buffett may also write about using that money to pay a dividend — but the odds are slim. He's famously averse to such use of his money, but many Berkshire watchers say that a special cash dividend, a one-time affair at management's discretion, makes sense.On stock buybacks, Buffett has said he's open to such a move if the price falls below 120% of book value. As of Thursday, class B shares of Berkshire stock traded at about 160% of book value. But the giant cash stockpile may incline Berkshire's board and management to be less strict about that 120% buyback threshold, some say.Buffett's letter to shareholders also coincides with Berkshire's Q4 and full-year results.CFRA sees operating EPS of $6.32 in 2017 and expects underwriting results at Berkshire's core insurance and reinsurance units to remain under pressure in Q4, as damages from numerous disasters continued to pile up. But operating revenue growth in 2018 should quicken to 7%-9% from 6%-7% in 2017.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why This 99 Composite Rating Stock Just PlungedHow To Make Money In Stocks Using The CAN SLIM Investing SystemThe Big Picture: Here Are Two Reasons To WorryNot Every Market Follow-Through Works: 2 Red Flags To Watch For

141,PSX,"Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) $9 billion cash bid for Energy Future Holdings, and in turn the vast majority of electric transmission utility Oncor, appeared to be in doubt after hedge fund Elliott Management reportedly moved to block the deal.Elliott Management, which has been trying to outbid Berkshire for Oncor, has purchased a type of Energy Future's debt that ""closes a potential loophole that Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. could have used to force the deal,"" the Wall Street Journal said late Wednesday, citing people familiar with the situation.Energy Future Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy protection more than three years ago following a crash in energy prices, is the parent of Oncor. Oncor delivers electricity and other services to nearly 10 million customers in Texas and has held up despite its parent company's difficulties.In a statement late Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway said it would not raise its offer, in which it would take an 80% stake in Oncor.""We appreciate the continued opportunity to collaborate with many stakeholder groups in Texas and thank them for their outstanding support, which sets our offer apart from any other bid,"" Greg Abel, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, said then.Berkshire Hathaway announced the deal last month, a move intended to bulk up, or at least reshuffle, the company's holdings in the energy industry. That deal followed an unsuccessful buyout attempt from NextEra (NEE). NextEra's bid fell apart in April.Berkshire also owns a part of Phillips 66 (PSX). The company offloaded its stake in General Electric (GE) in the second quarter.Berkshire rose 0.1% in morning trade in the stock market today.RELATED:Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Dumps General Electric Stake, Trims AirlinesWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway In Buy Zone, Gets Rating Upgrade

142,PSX,"Has Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett found another chemical company to acquire?X Lanxess stock shot up in Frankfurt trading after it emerged that Berkshire's General Reinsurance unit is now among the six largest shareholders in the company with a newly disclosed 3% stake in the German company.Buffett may have hinted that he is again on the hunt for an acquisition during a recent trip to another chemical maker, Lubrizol, which Berkshire bought in 2011 for $9.7 billion.During the April 5 visit, he was asked how Lubrizol fit in the Berkshire portfolio. Buffett, who famously invests in old-school industries and companies with a competitive edge, replied that a ""terrific business"" like Lubrizol takes ""decades and decades to build."" It was second largest in terms of earnings in his portfolio and a very important asset to Berkshire, he added.""Find me another Lubrizol, I'll send flowers your way,"" he told an interviewer during the visit.Two recent moves by Lanxess CEO Matthias Zachert — a $2.4 billion purchase of Chemtura and a joint rubber-related venture with Saudi Aramco — could make it one of the biggest manufacturers of additives for lubricants and flame retardants, reports said.Lanxess, like Lubrizol, operates chemicals businesses around the world, including the key market of China.Indeed, Buffett's acquisition of Lubrizol was seen as a major bet on emerging markets and overseas growth. The chemical maker's products can be found in everything from heavy-duty industrial engines to personal care products.The Lubrizol purchase came under a cloud when a former director at Berkshire was forced to resign after failing to disclose a prior stake in the company. More recently, Lubrizol incurred a significant loss tied to the purchase of certain oilfield businesses from Weatherford International (WFT).Before Tuesday's news, Lanxess shares had given up 8% since May 11, after its chief executive warned that growth rates are likely to slow in the second half of the year.Berkshire's class B shares were down 0.3% at 165.12 on the stock market today.Buffett has something of a track record of buying equity stakes in a company before purchasing it outright. That happened with the 2010 buyout of railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $26 billion as well as the 2011 acquisition of Lubrizol.But not all of Berkshire's stakes turn into acquisitions. While Berkshire has loaded up on Phillips 66 (PSX) shares in recent years, ending 2016 with a roughly 16% stake in the oil and gas refiner, there has yet to be a takeover despite some talk of a possibility.RELATED:Is Warren Buffett About To Make His Next Mega Acquisition?

He lowered Tesoro's (TSO) EPS outlook to 73 cents from $1.01.Large oil companies have been spinning off their downstream operations to focus on the more lucrative upstream segment. ConocoPhillips (COP) spun off its refining arm, now known as Phillips 66, last May.But refiners had been outperforming other oil related companies.

Even that meager gain beat the broad market because the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each fell modestly.A few more stocks broke out during the holiday-shortened week.For example, PolyOne (POL) topped a cup-without-handle base Tuesday, although volume was merely average.

With oil prices at $45 a barrel, it will be very hard for those stocks to perform.""Grant Engelbart, a portfolio manager at CLS Investments, agrees that rebounding oil prices will be key to energy companies' profitability — and therefore their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares.At the same time, he notes that no energy company has actually cut dividends this earnings season and a few — including Exxon, Phillips 66 (PSX) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) — actually raised dividends.""We think dividend cuts have probably come to an end, and companies that have mandates to raise dividends will continue to do so,"" Engelbart said in a phone call.The latest reports reveal energy companies have done a good job navigating the new landscape by cutting back expenditures during the price bust and holding off on massive outlays with the rebound, he added.Helped by cost cuts, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) pumped out $9.5 billion in cash flow, which the Anglo-Dutch giant used to cover dividends for a third straight quarter and reduce debt in Q1.Yellow flags remain. Revenue for Exxon was worse than expected in the first quarter, and Chevron kept its dividend unchanged even as Exxon raised its payout. The two companies alone account for nearly 40% of the S&P 500 energy sector's market cap.The energy sector will also face tougher year-over-year comparisons over the course of 2017, making earnings growth less dramatic.Oil and gas companies floundered in the ugly commodity collapse of 2014-15. By early 2016, with a hoped-for rebound yet to materialize and their profits cratering, the likes of ConocoPhillips (COP), Kinder Morgan (KMI), Anadarko Petroleum (APC)  and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) were forced to slash dividend payouts.  In some cases, as stock prices plunged, dividend yields spiked as much as 12%.Even Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, was forced to borrow money to pay out dividends. Smaller-cap energy companies struggled the most to increase or maintain their dividend payments.Share buybacks, a form of shareholder returns that is easier for companies to turn on and off than dividends, were pared back even more.For 2016 as a whole, the energy sector represented 1.1% of all S&P 500 buybacks vs. 2.7% in 2015 and 7.4% in 2014, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. It contributed 9.1% to S&P 500 dividends  in 2016 vs. 10.56% the previous year.In the fourth quarter of 2016, the combined dividend yield and buyback yield for the energy sector was 3.19% — the lowest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors.Exxon, which has grown dividends for 35 years in a row, is now no longer the biggest dividend payer in the S&P 500.Apple (AAPL), which started paying dividends in 2012 and has been hiking payouts aggressively, is the new king. The iPhone maker on May 2 hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to 63 cents, taking its annual dividends to $13.22 billion vs. $12.77 billion for Exxon.Still, dividend yields for energy stocks are more attractive. With Apple stock hitting new highs, the dividend yield is just 1.6%, less than half of Exxon's 3.7% and Chevron's 4%.Apple also has replaced Exxon as ""the poster child for buybacks"" in recent years, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple buybacks in 2016 totaled $33.71 billion, making it the second largest S&P 500 company for buybacks, behind Allergan (AGN).Meanwhile, Exxon did not even rank among the top 20 and ""has done very little in the way of buybacks of late,"" Silverblatt wrote recently.Despite some recent good news for shareholders, current prices don't bode well for revenue or payouts.U.S. crude prices settled 3.2% higher Wednesday at $47.33 a barrel, on data showing a sharp drawdown in U.S. inventories. Meanwhile, OPEC and top non-OPEC producers have suggested they will extend production cuts through the end of this year and possibly into 2018.Prices could get a bump from new, aggressive moves by the oil group and its partners to further reduce the global glut of inventories. But that would likely be offset by increased production from U.S. companies.Still, while the top line remains challenged, companies could improve their bottom lines — and their cash flow — by focusing on lower-cost regions like the Permian Basin. U.S. producers have also been using new technologies and techniques that allow them to extract oil profitably, even at lower prices.RELATED:Uh-Oh, OPEC: Top Shale Play Vows Big Output Boost Even With Sub-$50 OilEOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, DataEven This Latest Idea From OPEC May Not Lift Oil Prices As Shale Looms

271,PSX,"Diamondback Energy (FANG), Concho Resources (CXO), Continental Resources (CLR) and other U.S. exploration and production companies will report earnings this week, likely providing more information on capital spending, production outlooks and oilfield service costs.Senior Robert W. Baird oil and gas analyst Daniel Katzenberg said he expects some increases in production outlooks for the year and said any increases in output without a corresponding bump in capital spending would be major a confidence boost for investors.Liquids production from U.S. shale plays is expected to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.The number of oil rigs in operation has swelled for 15 straight weeks, according to Baker Hughes data, suggesting continued U.S. production gains in the near future.Even oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (CVX) have turned their investment focus to expanding their holdings in the Permian Basin while curtailing spending in other areas.But the IEA worries that U.S. production won't be enough to offset the decline in investment in conventional drilling as demand for crude grows.But questions remain about service costs. Katzenberg doesn't think cost inflation will be an issue for E&Ps until WTI crude hits $60 per barrel.He said the average estimate is for a 20% increase this year, but he's only forecasting a 10% increase as improvements in drilling will offset some of the cost increases.IBD'S TAKE: Q1 reports from U.S. E&P companies will shed some light on how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given by service providers during the crude price bust.""However, given investor trepidation, updated cost commentary, and its impact on 2017 plans, remains the biggest risk to the group over the earnings period, in our opinion,"" Katzenberg  wrote in note dated April 20.Diamondback Energy, Devon Energy (DVN) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are scheduled to release first-quarter results Tuesday. Continental, Laredo Petroleum (LPI), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), and Concho Resources (CXO) are on tap for Wednesday. Parsley Energy (PE) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) will announce results Thursday.Analysts expect Parsley and Occidental to report profits, with revenue up 191.2% and 27.3% respectively.International oil majors BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) will also report this week.RELATED: Exxon, Chevron Signal Stalling Investment As Oil Prices Lose Momentum

272,PSX,"The recent retreat in oil prices has weighed on shares of exploration and production companies as well as oilfield services firms, like Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB), that cater to them. But cheaper oil can be good news for refiners, which could see wider profit margins as their input costs drop, and one stock in particular has drawn the attention of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Warren Buffett.Shares of Marathon Petroleum (MPC) are in a cup base with a 54.69 buy point and closed Friday at 50.79. The stock broke out previously in September and November.Valero Energy (VLO) is in a flat base with a 71.50 entry and will start the next trading week at 68.90.Western Refining (WNR) is in a flat base with a 40.19 buy point. It finished Friday at 36.75.Phillips 66 (PSX) has a longer way to go. Shares are in a flat base with an 88.97 entry but are about 10% below that threshold.But for what it's worth, Berkshire has built up its stake in the refiner in the last few years and now holds more than 15%, making Berkshire the top shareholder.The rapid accumulation of shares has raised speculation about a buyout.

275,PSX,"President Trump took steps to advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, marking the start of an era with fewer constraints on the oil industry to the chagrin of environmentalists who have bitterly fought the projects.The moves, among Trump's first actions since taking office, are a major departure from the Obama administration, which rejected TransCanada's Keystone proposal in 2015 and has kept Dakota Access blocked since September. Environmentalists, concerned about climate change and damage to waters, land and Native-American cultural sites, now face an executive branch that's less sympathetic to their efforts. For the oil industry, it heralds more freedom to expand infrastructure and ease transportation bottlenecks.""We are going to renegotiate some of the terms,"" Trump told reporters today in the Oval Office as he signed the two measures. ""We will build our own pipelines we will build our own pipes.""Foreshadowing Trump's plans, the president told U.S. auto executives at a White House meeting Tuesday morning: ""We're going to make the process much more simple for the oil companies and everybody else that wants to do business in the United States.""TransCanada (TRP) climbed 3.7% to 48.92 in afternoon trade on the stock market today. Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) and Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the developers of the Dakota project, climbed 3% and 4%, respectively.TransCanada had no immediate comment on the president's actions before they were announced, and Energy Transfer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Standing Rock tribe that opposes the Dakota project says she would comment ""if it happens.""IBD'S TAKE: TransCanada is among five hot stocks soaring to new highs Tuesday.White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday said both Dakota Access and Keystone are examples of projects that would ""increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into America's energy supply more."" He said Trump wanted to balance environmental protection with activity that can grow jobs and the economy.It wasn't immediately clear what mechanism the documents Trump signed today would take. But his advisers have urged the new president to direct the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to grant an easement that would allow construction of the final portion of Dakota Access, reversing the Obama administration's conclusion that more environmental scrutiny was needed.The advisers had also urged the president to pave the way for Keystone XL by rescinding a 49-year-old directive from former President Lyndon B. Johnson that assigned the State Department responsibility for determining whether proposed cross-border energy projects serve the ""national interest.""TransCanada may need to submit another formal application to build the pipeline. The company's plans for Keystone XL already have been vetted, with years of environmental scrutiny culminating in Obama's 2015 decision that the pipeline was not in the U.S. interest.TransCanada has not said it would reapply for permission to build the pipeline, but the day after Trump's election, the Calgary-based company said it was looking for ways to convince the new administration of the project's benefits to the U.S. economy. The company has previously said it remains ""committed to Keystone XL.""Environmentalists fiercely battled the project, making it a flashpoint in broader debates about U.S. energy policy and climate change. Landowners in the pipeline's path warned that a spill of dense crude could contaminate the Ogallala aquifer, a source of drinking water that stretches from Texas to South Dakota. And activists said it would promote further development of oil sands in Alberta, Canada that generally require more energy to extract.Dakota Access opponents say the pipeline would damage sites culturally significant to Native Americans and pose an environmental hazard where it crosses the Missouri River. Earlier this month, the Department of the Army withheld the final easement necessary for construction beneath the lake.Energy Transfer has argued it went through the full permitting process and has the necessary approvals. The company has said the line will be in service in the first quarter of this year, a delay from its original expectations that Dakota Access would be operational by the end of 2016.Swift approval of Dakota Access could reinvigorate the sometimes violent protests at the site of the proposed construction. Environmental activists vowed to continue battling both projects.""A powerful alliance of indigenous communities, ranchers, farmers, and climate activists stopped the Keystone pipeline the first time, and the same alliance will come together to stop Keystone again if Trump tries to raise it from the dead,"" said Travis Nichols, a spokesman with Greenpeace.Josh Nelson, the deputy political director of the CREDO activist group said the action would show Trump is ""in the pocket of big corporations and foreign oil interests.""""Fierce grassroots activism has stopped these pipelines over and over again,"" he said. ""CREDO will do everything in its power to stop the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, and keep dirty fossil fuels in the ground where they belong.""Pipeline supporters said a final easement for the project would illustrate Trump's commitment to building out energy infrastructure needed to ferry oil and gas around the U.S. Although Keystone XL would transport oil sands crude from Canada, some space on the line is slated to be filled by supplies from North Dakota's Bakken shale play.Dakota Access, likewise, is aimed at giving Bakken producers a new route to energy markets, allowing them to forgo more costly rail shipments that have been a backstop when existing pipes fill up. With a capacity of about 470,000 barrels a day, Dakota Access would ship about half of current Bakken crude production and enable producers to access Midwest and Gulf Coast markets.Craig Stevens, spokesman for the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now said moves to advance Keystone XL and Dakota Access would be a ""positive development"" for ""our nation's resource development energy infrastructure as a whole.Energy Transfer owns the Dakota Access project with Phillips 66 (PSX) and Sunoco Logistics Partners (SXL). Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Enbridge Energy Partners (ENB) announced a venture in August that would also take a minority stake in the pipeline.

276,PSX,"Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) and Sunoco Logistics Partners (SXL) fell Monday after the Army Corps of Engineers denied an easement needed for the Dakota Access Pipeline Sunday, but a supportive Trump administration said it will review the ruling come January.The 1,172-mile pipeline, owned by Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, is mostly completed except for a small portion that runs near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The tribes leaders were worried the pipeline could contaminate the reservation's water supply and groups have spent months protesting the project.Phillips 66 (PSX) also has a 25% stake in the Dakota Access project.""The White House's directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions,"" Energy Transfer and Sunoco Logistics said in a release.But the win could be short lived for the Sioux and environmental groups as a spokesman for President-Elect Donald Trump said the administration supported the project and could reverse the decision once in office.The pipeline ""is something we support construction of, and we will review the situation when we are in the White House to make the appropriate determination at that time,"" spokesman Jason Miller said, according to Bloomberg.""I think we'll get a new administration, we'll get new eyes, and there's always a possibility,"" Bloomberg also quoted House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy as saying.Meanwhile, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, a Republican, was critical of the Obama administration, the news service said.""The Obama administration's refusal to issue an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline violates the rule of law and fails to resolve the issue,"" Hoeven said in a written statement. ""Instead, it passes the decision off to the next administration, which has already indicated it will approve the easement, and in the meantime perpetuates a difficult situation for North Dakotans.""Energy Transfer shares lost 1.8% to 33.76 on the stock market today, while Sunoco Logistics also slid 1.8%. Phillips 66 rose 0.7%.TransCanada Corporation (TRP) shares have been on the rise since Trump's election on hopes he will ask the company to reapply for a permit to build the TransCanada pipeline which was rejected by the Obama administration.While Continental Resources' (CLR) Harold Hamm said it wouldn't be Trump's Energy secretary, Trump is considering Exxon Mobil's (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, according to his transition team.TransCanada shares dipped 0.1%. Continental shares reversed to trade down 0.3%, while Exxon climbed 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. The election and OPEC's decision to cut production have helped boost shares of U.S. shale oil companies Continental, Parsley Energy and others into buy range. RELATED: Analysts Are Bullish On Fracking Supplier Antero Midstream

The deal also includes the assumption of approximately $1.7 billion of Western's net debt and the $605 million market value of a non-controlling interest in Western Refining Logistics.The deal ""extends our portfolio into attractive and growing markets,"" Greg Goff, chairman and chief executive officer of Tesoro, said in the statement. ""Our increased scale and diversity will enable us to leverage and enhance in-house technical capabilities, which we expect will result in cost efficiencies, the ability to drive more growth and increased productivity.""The combined companies will deliver $350 million to $425 million of annual synergies as a result of the acquisition, with that rate of cost savings to be achieved within two years. They will have a refining system with over 1.1 million barrels a day of capacity, it said.The deal comes as U.S. independent refiners, including leaders Valero Energy (VLO) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC), brace for lower margins after a two-year period in which they enjoyed strong profits. The so-called West Texas Intermediate 3-2-1 oil refining margin has fallen to $11.81 a barrel, down from a peak of more than $30 a barrel in early 2015.The combination will transform Tesoro into the fifth-largest U.S. refiner behind Valero, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Marathon and Philips 66 (PSX) and ahead of Motiva Enterprises LLC and Chevron (CVX), according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The purchase price represents a premium of 22.3% to the closing price of Western's stock on the day prior to announcement, according to the statement. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the shareholders of both companies and the receipt of regulatory approval, the companies said.

Revenue from Berkshire's flagship insurance businesses climbed 9.9% to $43.59 billion.""Our insurance underwriting operations generated increased net earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to 2015,"" management said in a regulatory filing.That reflected foreign-exchange rate fluctuation for Berkshire's reinsurance activities overseas, as well as an increase in underwriting gains for its Geico business, partly offset by lower gains from General Re and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group operations.Berkshire saw a 10.3% drop in its Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad revenue to $8.85 billion, down from $9.87 billion in the second quarter of 2015, as railroads continue to be slammed by lower shipments of petroleum, coal and other products.IBD'S TAKE: While Berkshire Hathaway and other large diversified manufacturers have generally reported middling results, smaller rivals have outperformed the market.

283,PSX,"SolarCity (SCTY), First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR) could bloom under Hillary Clinton, but her goal of 500 million solar panels cumulatively installed by 2025, along with the potential for higher gasoline taxes, could slam Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and Valero Energy (VLO), S&P analysts said Wednesday.But that doesn't mean a Donald Trump presidency would boost gasoline to the detriment of solar, S&P analyst Stewart Glickman says.""We think efforts to rein in gasoline consumption would dissipate"" if Trump were president, Glickman wrote in a research report. ""A potential loss of incentives for renewables could push incremental demand for refined products, which we think would be a mild tailwind for these oil and gas companies.""Solar and oil/gas both depend heavily on subsidies, Glickman notes. In December, Congress voted in a five-year extension to the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), a key subsidy underpinning the solar industry. But stocks have plunged on net-metering actions in Arizona and Nevada that reduce financial incentives for solar installations.IBD's 20-company Energy-Solar industry group is down 45% this year and ranks No. 196 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. Conversely, the Oil & Gas-Integrated industry group is up 17% since January and ranks No. 14.Clinton could spell the difference for solar stocks, Glickman says. During her hypothetical two-term presidency, she plans to reduce U.S. oil consumption by a third by reaching 500 million in solar panel installations.To date, the U.S. has installed 25 gigawatts to 30 GW, or roughly 100 million to 120 million panels installed cumulatively. So, Clinton's goal would require a 20% compound annual growth rate over eight years, or 45% over four years.""Generating that kind of growth is possible but highly contingent, in our view, on the continued extension of the ITC, which is now slated to expire in 2021,"" he wrote. And strong demand for green energy could depress the fundamentals for fossil fuels, which run best at high utilization, he said.In Q1, the International Energy Association estimated U.S. crude oil demand stood at 19.5 million barrels per day, the highest globally, with No. 2 China at 11.5 million barrels daily. A one-third reduction under Clinton would eliminate 6 million barrels per day, contributing to ""markedly weaker utilization and earnings power,"" Glickman said.Trump, on the other hand, has argued in favor of all forms of energy, ""but doesn't want to pick favorites."" Glickman expects Trump to reduce or eliminate the ITC. S&P analyst Angelo Zino says a reduction to 10% from the current 30% would force solar demand to fall 60%.A Clinton victory would help Canadian Solar (CSIQ), First Solar, SolarCity and SunPower, but hurt Valero, Phillips 66 (PSX), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), HollyFrontier (HFC) and Tesoro (TSO), Glickman says.""We think the new administration could pursue enhanced environmental protection efforts or higher gasoline taxes, both of which could curb gasoline demand and thus cut throughput at these refining companies,"" he said, adding that global integrated oil companies like Exxon and Chevron could feel some heat.

(PPL) to Invesco (IVZ), have lagged behind the S&P 500 by an average of 2.2 percentage points in June, with Penske Automotive Group (PAG) and PRA Health (PRAH) trailing by as much as 9.1 percentage points.To be sure, the potential impact on U.S. companies is diluted by distance, and it won't be the end of the world for these shares if Brexit goes through, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients last month.""U.K. subsidiaries of U.S. companies are relatively insulated from potential disruptions"" because they ""tend to focus more on domestic end markets rather than trade or export out of the U.K."" Lakos-Bujas wrote. ""We therefore see the fallout from potential disruptions in trade agreements as less significant for their fundamentals.""Among companies with the highest revenue exposure in the U.K., there's still time to hedge risks ahead of Thursday's vote, according to Katherine Fogertey, a derivatives strategist at Goldman Sachs. ""The options market is not pricing in strong incremental downside to the stocks with the largest exposure to the region,"" she wrote in a note to clients last week. ""It is still attractive to buy puts for many stocks with high U.K. sales exposure.""Among 18 stocks with liquid options and more than 15% of sales from the U.K., the top two candidates are Penske Automotive and PPL, Fogertey wrote. She recommends buying puts of Penske as insurance related to the company's scheduled earnings on July 28 and its U.K. exposure. Similarly, for PPL, a strategy known in the options market as a straddle can be used to hedge for its earnings scheduled for July 28 and the company's large foreign-exchange exposure.Within U.S.-domiciled companies, there's a lack of consistency when reporting international sales, particularly by region. With the caveat that such reporting is ""poor,"" Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, last week compiled a list of 20 companies in the S&P 500 Index with a high proportion of foreign sales in the U.K. Topping that list are Exxon Mobil (XOM), Phillips 66 (PSX), Ford Motor (F), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Beyond the U.S., Bloomberg has compiled an equally-weighted index of 10 stocks -- including Rolls-Royce Holdings, Barclays (BCS) and Berkeley Group Holdings -- to track British exposure to the EU across multiple industries. The Bloomberg Brexit Equity Index is down 16% in the past 12 months and is on track for its worst year of performance since 2008.Most visibly, bookmaker odds tracking prospects for the referendum's defeat have converged with the direction of the broader stock market in recent days.Odds on the U.K. remaining in the EU have fluctuated from as low as almost 63% a week ago to 79% currently, according to Oddschecker calculations based on bookmakers' quotes. That's more or less aligned directionally with fluctuations in the S&P 500 this month.

285,PSX,"Warren Buffett disclosed in a regulatory filing Monday that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought 9.8 million shares of Apple, valued at about $1.07 billion at the end of the quarter.Berkshire also sold its entire stake of 4.6 million shares in AT&T (T), raised the number of shares it holds in oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX) by 23% to 75.6 million shares, and sold off all but 1% of its shares of home cleaning and beauty products maker Procter & Gamble (PG). Berkshire now holds just 315,000 shares of P&G.Berkshire shares ""B"" class shares closed up 0.3% in the stock market today.  Apple stock rose 3.7% Monday but has fallen more than 30% from a high reached on July 20, 2015, amid weakening sales of its flagship iPhone smartphone. In late April, Apple said that iPhone sales fell for the first time ever in the first quarter, on a year-over-year basis.Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on April 28 that he had sold all of his Apple stock.

Executives at Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Ross Stores (ROST) also got in on the action.Eddy Cue, the iPhone maker's senior vice president of internet software and sales, disclosed on Wednesday the sale of 50,000 Apple shares for a transaction value of $4.97 million.Cue was most recently in the news for reportedly being the driving force behind Apple's interest in merging with Time Warner (TWX) late last year.Apple shares dropped 2.4% for the week.Four Facebook executives unloaded shares this week. CTO Mike Schroepfer on Thursday disclosed a sale and options exercise of 20,000 Facebook shares with a total value of $2.37 million.CFO David Wehner sold 5,265 shares for $631,274 this week, while Chief Product Officer Christopher Cox shed 15,600 of his shares for $1.86 million.Director Jan Koum, who has been an active seller in recent months, unloaded over 1.72 million shares for a transaction total of $204.5 million.Facebook shares retreated by 0.8% for the week.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway increased its position in Phillips 66 (PSX), disclosing on Wednesday the purchase of 537,968 shares for a total of $43.1 million.Berkshire has been buying a significant amount of the oil refiner's shares since Q2 of last year. Last week, the conglomerate disclosed the purchase of 1.47 million shares, giving it a roughly 15% stake.Berkshire shares are off 1.3% for the week. Phillips 66 is down 0.6%.The Apple chip supplier's executive chairman of the board, David Aldrich, reported on Thursday a sale and options exercise of 15,000 shares, amounting to a little over $1 million.Aldrich is a regular seller of Skyworks shares, which are trading 40% below their 52-week high.Skyworks shares are up 0.6% for the week.The fast casual Mexican food chain's co-CEO and chairman, Steve Ells, disclosed Thursday the sale and options exercise of 21,000 shares for $9.25 million.Chipotle's shares are down 2.6% this week and trading 42% below their 52-week high as several foodborne illnesses have impacted financial results.Michael Balmuth, Ross Stores' chairman of the board, disclosed Thursday the sale and options exercise of nearly 195,000 shares for a transaction value of $10.42 million.Last month, the off-price retailer reported quarterly earnings that met views and revenue that slightly missed.Ross traded down 1.5% for the week.Insider transactions don’t typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news.

287,PSX,"Crude settled at the lowest level in two weeks as shifting winds moved wildfires away from oil-sands facilities in Alberta, reducing concern that production cuts would make a substantial dent in U.S. oil stockpiles.Futures erased intraday gains and declined 2.7% in New York. Wildfires in Canada have led to cuts equivalent to about 40% of oil-sands production, based on IHS Energy estimates. The impact of a reduction in output may be muted due to U.S. crude stockpiles holding at the highest level since 1929. Once fires in Alberta are under control, the majority of oil sands mining projects can be back to normal production levels in about one week, Morgan Stanley said.“Without any damage, then the barrels lost are inconsequential, because we’re still at all-time record highs for U.S. storage,” Michael Hiley, head of over-the-counter energy trading at New York-based LPS Partners, said by telephone.U.S. crude inventories have climbed to 543.4 million barrels, the most since October 1929, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Nationwide crude stocks are forecast to have increased by 750,000 barrels last week, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts before the EIA report Wednesday. Supplies at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI and the nation’s biggest oil-storage hub, are near a record.West Texas Intermediate for June delivery dropped $1.22 to settle at $43.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was 32% above the 100-day average.Brent for July settlement slipped $1.74 to end the session at $43.63 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. WTI for July was at a 40-cent premium to Brent. The last time the premium widened to more than 30 cents was in March.Assuming a 10-day ramp-up in activity, Alberta could lose about 650,000 barrels a day for three weeks, or almost 14 million barrels in total, Goldman Sachs’s analysts including Jeffrey Currie said in a report Monday. “While significant, such a disruption would have an only limited impact on overall North American crude inventories.”Suncor Energy (SU), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Husky Energy are among companies that have shut plants or reduced production in Alberta due to the wildfires. Suncor, Phillips 66 (PSX) and Statoil STA (STO) have declared force majeure -- a provision protecting companies from liability for contracts that go unfulfilled for reasons beyond their control -- on supplies from the region.Cooler temperatures are helping firefighters battle the blaze. Damage to oil-sands sites has been limited and some companies are already planning to restart facilities. Suncor said it has begun planning to resume production after moving more than 10,000 employees, families and Fort McMurray residents out of the region.Oil prices remain about 60% below their peak in mid-2014 as the global oversupply persists. While American production has dropped, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has boosted supply to more than 33 million barrels a day, underpinned by gains from Iran and Iraq.Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, replaced its oil minister Ali al-Naimi over the weekend with the chairman of state energy company Saudi Arabian Oil, Khalid Al-Falih. Speaking in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Al-Falih indicated that Saudi Arabia plans to act vigorously to defend its market share and exports as the market rebalances.“The shake-up in Saudi Arabia confirms what was in the process of happening,” John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy, said by telephone. It’s an ""even firmer stance on their part to battle for market share and use oil to hurt the frackers and Iran and continue to oversupply this market.”

The Model 3 has seen a surge of early demand, but the company recently said about 12,200 preorders have been canceled, putting the total at about 373,000.Shares of Tesla are up 1.25% for the week.CEO Jeff Immelt this week disclosed the purchase of 67,600 company shares worth $2 million.GE this week said that the company would put as much as $1.4 billion toward developing Saudi Arabia's oil-dependent economy, which has been strained by a two-year long oversupply of crude.More broadly, GE has worked to become more of a tech company, with added focus on industrial analytics.GE shares settled with a 1.9% weekly gain.CEO Reed Hastings sold 85,659 shares of the online movie and TV service.

289,PSX,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has become much more diversified and thus ""much less reliant"" on Warren Buffett's stock-market clairvoyance, evolving into a company positioned to outperform the S&P 500 amid economic uncertainty, UBS said Monday in initiating coverage of the investment firm.""We believe that the current uncertain economic and market environment plays into the hands of BRK, with its structural advantages of permanent capital, strong cash generation and industry-leading portfolio of businesses,"" UBS analyst Brian Meredith wrote in the initiation note, which gave Berkshire's A shares (BRKA) a buy rating and a 244,500 price target.""This enables BRK to make acquisitions and/or invest in its operating units despite challenging environments, positioning it to grow earnings and book value faster than the S&P 500,"" Meredith wrote.Berkshire over the years has become more of a diversified conglomerate and less of an insurance and investment firm, UBS said, helping cushion the company against difficulties in the insurance business and minimizing risk associated with Buffett's eventual departure from the company.""While Buffett's superior capital allocation skills and market 'clout' would be missed, as long as the culture does not change, we would expect the company to continue to outperform,"" Meredith said, adding that the market hasn't priced in a significant premium for him as CEO amid the shift to a diversified conglomerate.Berkshire Hathaway’s entry into insurance began with the 1967 purchase of National Indemnity. But over the years, it has diversified through acquisitions, growing into four main areas of operation that oversee such companies as Geico, Duracell and various energy, manufacturing and railroad companies.That diversification has cushioned the company against difficulties in the insurance business and would likely help minimize risk associated with Buffett’s departure from the company, UBS said.Berkshire's A shares closed up 0.8% in the stock market today. The more widely traded B shares also rose 0.8% Monday and have climbed nearly 14% since a Jan. 25 low.UBS' coverage comes as Buffett's stake in Wells Fargo (WFC) nears 10%, an amount that would necessitate a review from the Federal Reserve intended to protect against undue investor influence, Bloomberg reported.Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway has also been amassing a large stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX), possibly foreshadowing a huge acquisition.Wells Fargo dipped 0.4% Monday, while Phillips 66 lost 0.65%.

292,PSX,"When Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) discusses fourth quarter earnings on Saturday, the company's recent major investments will likely be high on the agenda.A company spokesperson said the company will discuss Q4 results when it releases its annual report that day.Buffett has been loading up on shares of oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX). As of mid-February, Berkshire owned about 14% of that company's equity. The sometimes nearly daily purchases of millions of shares of Phillips 66 has fueled speculation that he might acquire the company outright, which would be one of Berkshire's largest ever purchases.Phillips 66's market value of roughly $42.16 billion would likely push the price above the $37.2 billion Berkshire paid in January for forged components and aerospace castings maker Precision Castparts.Buffett continues to like top U.S. home mortgage lender Wells Fargo (WFC) too, and last quarter bought another 9 million shares, according to the company's end of quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Wells Fargo on Wednesday set aside $1.2 billion for energy-related loan losses.Analyst consensus is for Berkshire to report an 8.7% increase in Q4 earnings per share to $1.75. Anything above that could spur a stock rise after the company just met estimates the prior quarter and missed the quarter before that.Berkshire avoided a Standard & Poor's rating downgrade last week, when S&P left its ""AA"" credit rating for the Warren Buffett-led company alone, saying its diversification and ""modest"" financial risks indicated that a downgrade wasn't necessary despite red flags.S&P put Berkshire on review last August, citing the company's huge cash outlay for the Precision Castparts deal. But S&P in its latest report cited Berkshire's ""consistently strong"" profitability and liquidity, in addition to its cash flow from subsidiaries.Berkshire ""B"" type shares took a hit during the recent market correction, amid concerns about its cash outlays. But it's rebounded about 6% from a Jan. 15 low of 124.12 to close up 0.3% in Wednesday stock market trading to close at 131.03.Phillips 66 rose 0.5% to 79.09 and Wells Fargo slid 1% to 47.61.
"
293,PSX,"Warren Buffett said Saturday that the net worth of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) rose $15.4 billion in 2015, boosting the per-share book value of both its Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%.Buffett was upbeat in his annual letter to shareholders, saying it's been a terrible mistake to bet against America for 240 years, and ""now is no time to start.""""America's golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs,"" Buffett said in the letter.In the 31-page missive, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, climbed 31.8% to $5.478 billion. Earnings per share for Class B shares rose to $2.22 in Q4, crushing consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $1.75.For the full year, earnings grew 21.2% to $24.08 billion. Total revenue for the year rose 8% to $210.8 billion, up from $194.7 billion in 2014.Berkshire owns Geico Insurance, BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen, and as of January, Precision Castparts. Berkshire also holds significant holdings in companies such as Kraft Heinz (KHC), IBM (IBM) and  Wells Fargo (WFC).It should be no surprise that the company's Railroads, Utilities and Energy business fared the worst amid declining rail shipments and plunging gas prices.  Still, revenue for that business was down just 1.7% in Q4 at $40.004 billion. Earnings fell 2.9% to $1.507 billion.Total revenue for the company's flagship insurance businesses continued to show big gains, rising 10.9% in the quarter to $162.89 billion. But earnings fell to $4.9 billion in 2015 vs. $5.2 billion in 2014.  Earnings for the underwriting business soared 60% to $306 million, while earnings for the Insurance-investment income unit were up 17.4% at $1.033 billion.Earnings for other businesses and miscellaneous items climbed 36.3% to $1.827 billion.Buffett commented on the $37.2 billion purchase in January of aerospace components maker Precision Castparts, which he described as a newcomer to the ""Powerhouse Six"" businesses in the company's Railroads/Utility/Energy group. ""PCC fits perfectly into the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalized per-share earnings power.""He also commented on a proxy proposal regarding climate change that's on the agenda for the company's annual meeting, which is slated to be streamed live for the first time ever on the morning of April 30. Buffett said concerns about how climate change might affect the company's insurance payouts are unwarranted because Berkshire's insurance policies are typically repriced every year, factoring in increased risk such as climate change.Commenting on stock investments, Buffett said the company increased its interest in each of its top four holdings last year: American Express (AXP), Coca Cola (KO), IBM and Wells Fargo.  Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo shares were essentially flat in 2015, while IBM and American Express were big losers.Berkshire most recently has been buying big blocks of oil refiner Philips 66 (PSX) and as of Dec. 31 owned 55.38 million shares, giving it a 10.5% stake in the company, which has continued rising this year.Buffett also noted that in 2015 Berkshire invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment, 86% of it deployed in the U.S.Berkshire Hathaway shares declined for most of 2015 and into early 2016, and hasn't been above its 200-day line since a brief spell last July. But the stock is up 7% from an intraday low of 123.55 on Feb. 3 and closed at 131.92 in Friday trading on the stock market today, down 0.3% for the day.

294,PSX,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett's bet with a hedge fund may show that all you need is the pastoral eminence known as the S&P 500 -- rather than the fancy approach such funds use to beat the market.Buffett's 10-year bet that the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX), an S&P 500 index fund, could outperform five funds of hedge funds selected by Protege Partners appears to be paying off, says Fortune, which has followed the bet since first reporting on it in 2008.Protege's five funds of hedge funds rose 1.7% on average last year, in contrast to the 1.36% gain that the Vanguard fund brought in. However, Fortune notes, the Vanguard fund has gained 65.67% over the bet's first eight years, which include 2015, compared to 21.87% on average for the Protege funds of funds.Berkshire Hathaway's class B shares closed down 0.4% in the stock market today and are up 5% so far this year. The S&P 500 is down about 2.9% for 2016.The Berkshire Hathaway chief's hunch appears to be backed by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which said Wednesday that most small-, mid- and large-cap managers have been underperforming S&P indexes.Last year, 66.11% of large-cap managers, 56.81% of midcap managers and 72.2% of small-cap managers underperformed the S&P 500, the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600, respectively.Over five years, 84.15% of large-cap managers, 76.69% of midcap managers and 90.13% of small-cap managers lagged their respective benchmarks. And over 10 years, 82.14% of large-cap managers, 87.61% of midcap managers and 88.42% of small-cap managers failed to outperform.But if Warren Buffett is so smart, why not just invest like the legendary ""Sage of Omaha""?Berkshire Hathaway's top stock holdings include American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), and he has built up his position in Phillips 66 (PSX) in recent months.Many investors do try to mimic Berkshire Hathaway's investments, but Buffett thinks that's a bad idea.“I wouldn’t ever urge them to do anything based on what we do. If they want to do what Berkshire does, then they should buy Berkshire,” Buffett told CNBC last month. “I think they’re making a big mistake by piggybacking me or 10 other people whose names appear in the paper.”

295,PSX,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has been loading up on shares of Phillips 66 (PSX) and now owns about 14%, fueling speculation that Buffett may buy the oil refiner outright.If so, it would likely be among his largest takeovers ever. Phillips 66 has a market cap of $40 billion. Last month, Berkshire closed its $37.2 billion purchase of Precision Castparts, its biggest acquisition to date.Berkshire began buying big lots of Phillips 66 stock in August, when it purchased $4.5 billion worth of the shares to boost its stake to 10.8%. Berkshire bought more shares last month to give it a 13.7% stake. Additional purchases this month put the stake over 14%.Phillips 66 CEO Greg Garland was asked about the big Berkshire purchases on a Jan. 29 earnings call but only said, ""We don't comment on conversations with shareholders.""Berkshire didn't respond to requests for comment.Shares of Berkshire closed up 2.4% on the stock market today. Phillips 66 rallied 3.2%.Buffett's pattern of Phillips 66 stock purchases is reminiscent of his transactions leading up to his $9.7 billion acquisition of lubricant and chemical maker Lubrizol in 2011, said S&P Global Markets Intelligence analyst Cathy Seifert.""He bought an equity stake and then bought the company,"" she told IBD.Seifert said she doesn't have knowledge of a specific plan by Buffett to buy Phillips 66, but his purchases of its stock follow a well-trodden path.""You have to think what his patterns tend to be,"" Seifert said. ""This move lately was an opportunity to, No. 1, diversify holdings and, No. 2,  gain opportunistic exposure to the space at an attractive price. It's a function of diversification and a long-term macro view of an opportunity to get in.""Any purchase of Phillips 66 would come at a tricky time for the sector. While integrated giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are suffering amid low oil prices, pure-play refineries generally benefit, as they enjoying reduced input costs and fatter profit margins.But the good times may be nearing an end.Earlier this week, a Delta Air Lines (DAL)-owned refinery, Monroe Energy, prepared to reduce output by 10%, according to Reuters. It followed Valero Energy (VLO), which slashed gasoline output by 25% at a Tennessee refinery.Analysts expect more output cuts by refiners who will try to avoid flooding the already saturated market, Reuters said.Shares of Delta Air Lines rose 0.7% Friday, and Valero climbed 3.9%. Exxon rose 1.8%, and Chevron gained 2.9%.

296,PSX,"Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) continued to build its stock portfolio last year while shedding bond holdings.On Saturday, Berkshire released its list of stock holdings, along with full-year 2015 and fourth-quarter financial results.Buffett's top 15 stock holdings include what he calls the company's ""Big Four"" investments: American Express (AXP), Coca Cola (KO), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Berkshire purchased additional shares of IBM during the year, boosting its total ownership to 81.03 million shares, or an 8.4% ownership stake at the end of the year vs. 7.8% at the end of 2014. Wells Fargo grew to 500 million shares, or a 9.8% stake, up from 9.4%.At Coke and American Express, share buybacks raised Berkshire's percentage ownership. Its 400 million shares of Coke are a 9.3% stake, up from 9.2%. And it owns 151.6 million shares of American Express, or 15.6%, up from 14.8%.Buffett said a major Berkshire equity position that's not on the list of 15 is Bank of America (BAC).""We can buy 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At year-end, these shares were worth $11.8 billion,"" he said, adding that it's likely Berkshire will buy them just before the options expire.Buffett added: ""It is important for you to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth-largest equity investment.""Berkshire's class B shares closed up 1.7% in the stock market today, and they are up nearly 10% from a Feb. 3 intraday low. Although its position improved, its stock still traded below both its 50-day and 200-day averages.American Express rose 0.4%, Coke ended flat, IBM fell 0.8%, but Wells Fargo slid 2.4%.Among other Berkshire top stock holdings, it has 46.6 million shares of IBD Leaderboard stock AT&T (T) (0.8% ownership), 24.7 million shares of credit rating and research agency Moody's (MCO) (12.6%), 18.5 million shares of dialysis services company DaVita Healthcare Partners (DVA) (8.8%), and 22.16 million shares of heavy equipment maker Deere (DE) (7%).Berkshire has also been buying big blocks of oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX) since last summer, fueling speculation that it may be Buffett's next acquisition target. As of Dec. 31, Berkshire owned 55.38 million shares or 10.5% of the company, and its stake has since risen to around 15%. Phillips was up 1.5% at 80.27 Monday.Meanwhile, for a sixth year in a row, Buffett reduced his bond holdings amid continued low yields. Berkshire owned about $25 billion in aggregate, on an amortized cost basis as of Dec. 31, down from nearly $35 billion at the end of 2009, Bloomberg said. Buffett said bonds are such a poor investment tool that they ""should come with a warning label.""At the end of 2015, his biggest bond holdings were in foreign bonds, followed by corporate bonds, U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

297,PSX,"Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), continued to scoop up shares of refiner Phillips 66 (PSX), even as oil prices staged a rally this week.In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, Buffett disclosed the purchase of 1.69 million more shares in multiple transactions made from Monday to Wednesday.The slump in oil has impacted giants such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), but it's seen as possibly good news for pure-play refiners like Phillips 66, as volume rises amid strong sales of pickups and SUVs.According to a Friday filing, Buffett bought 2.54 million shares of the Houston-based refiner, valued at about $198 million.That followed major purchases earlier in January, and it gave Berkshire a total 72.29 million shares of Phillips, about a 13.7% stake. That's up from 67.45 million shares in mid-January. In August, Berkshire said that it had purchased another $4.5 billion worth of the refiner's stock, bringing its stake to 10.8% at the time.Low oil prices have kept input costs low for refiners such as Phillips 66, Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Tesoro (TSO).Phillips 66, which is Berkshire's sixth-largest stock holding, said Friday that fourth-quarter earnings per share fell 20% to $1.31, 6 cents better than analyst consensus. It was the sixth quarter in a row the company has topped EPS estimates. Phillips 66 is the highest-rated large refiner in IBD's 39-company Oil & Gas-Refining/Marketing Group.But Phillips 66's revenue fell 38% to $22.03 billion, below forecasts for $22.32 billion.Phillips 66 shares closed up 1% on the stock market Thursday. Berkshire Hathaway, which on Friday completed its $37.2 billion purchase of aerospace and industrial castings maker Precision Castparts, also rose 1%.

Its stock rallied 4.8% on Jan. 19 after peer New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) reported strong quarterly earnings growth.TAL will be in the spotlight when it releases fiscal third-quarter earnings Wednesday before the market opens.

Facebook stock, which boasts a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, rose 4%.Hawaiian HoldingsThe parent of Hawaiian Airlines is No. 13 on the IBD 50. The regional carrier, which provides flights among 11 major U.S. cities and four Hawaiian islands, has been outperforming many of its peers. It has a couple of advantages, including its geographic location between the U.S. and China. A rising wave of Chinese tourists boosts revenue.CardHub, a credit-card-market tracker, recently gave the carrier's frequent-flyer program high marks. Such programs are an incentive for global travelers.Hawaiian Holdings is projected to record a 110% jump in Q4 EPS after the market close Tuesday, to 84 cents, on a 1% dip in revenue to $567.2 million. Shares climbed 2.2%.Phillips 66While oil majors likeExxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) have been slammed as prices plummet due to the oil glut, cheap prices have led to more oil being refined, giving a lift to Phillips 66 and other refiners. With volume declining, Phillips is seeing an effect too.It will release its Q4 results early Friday. Wall Street is looking for a 17.2% drop in EPS to $1.35 and a 37% drop in revenue to $22.32 billion. But the No. 36 company on the IBD 50 could top earnings estimates after beating for the last five quarters in a row.

Tractor Supply on Jan. 12 said that seasonal challenges, including unusually warm weather that hurt its cold-weather-goods sales in some sections of the country, hurt its Q4 sales. As a result, Tractor Supply projected that same-store sales for the quarter fell 1.4% year over year.The company will release full Q4 results late Wednesday. The outlook is for EPS of 82 cents, a penny above last year's figure. Sales are projected to rise 5.1% to $1.66 billion.

"
333,PSX,"Stocks traded a bit lower yesterday - after Wednesday's FED induced rally.....as traders considered the language and odds of a December rate hike.  Selling was subdued, there was no ""get me outta here"" tone to the action at all.
"
334,PSX,"The mkt paused really - as investors now thought about the latest GDP report - which came in at +1.5%.....(great because it is positive) but when compared to the 2nd qtr it looks a bit pale.....yesterday's report was more a 60% drop from qtr to qtr all at a time when the FED suggests the economy is poised to 'explode' and that 'rates will rise in December'.
"
335,PSX,"In addition - yesterday's report was a disappointment when you consider year over year growth......last year's 3rd qtr growth rate was 2% - so all this says is that the economy continues to be held hostage to the dynamics of  weakness at home and abroad.   As the journal points out the ""US Economy Slogs Through Soft Patch"" -  consumer spending, business spending and home building all contributing to our positive report all in the face of 'headwinds' abroad.
"
336,PSX,"But do not be blindsided....Consumer spending  is misleading...because it includes what 'consumers spend' on healthcare - which is not something that many people consider they read the story about the health of the consumer......Spending by consumers on healthcare represents 30% of GDP...or some $18 bil ...but the gov't includes this under the heading of 'consumer spending' - making it appear as if the consumer spending is stronger than what reality might prove otherwise.   Remember - spending on healthcare is not really an option for the family budget - so that gets filed under the 'must pay' budget line.....which means that 'discretionary spending' gets cut back.....it's all semantics really....as far as Obama is concerned - Consumer spending - no matter on what - is still consumer spending....So - It's all good!
"
337,PSX,"Now in other news......our broken corporate tax structure has created another opportunity for a huge merger between Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN)  as they consider 'hooking up'  to avoid US taxes...you see - Allergan is based in Ireland and Ireland is a bit friendlier to big corporations......so if Pfizer gets into bed with Allergan in Ireland - they cut their US corporate tax liability in what is known as the 'inversion trade'...... Where one US company buys a smaller foreign rival and then moves the corporate headquarters abroad and BOOM!  - they just cut their US tax obligation by millions of dollars....   And to make the point - PFE CEO - Ian Read made no bones about it.....saying that ""US Corporate tax rates have put the company at a disadvantage to its foreign rivals.....We are fighting with one hand tied behind our back.....and that Pfizer was doing what we need to do to ensure that we can continue to innovate.""
"
338,PSX,"When will Washington wake up?  How many more 'inversion trades' must we see before those Bozo's in Congress recognize that they are nothing but a bunch of clowns as evidenced by the new 2 yr budget deal that lifts the debt ceiling even higher and rolls back fiscal austerity...but hey - it removes the risk of a debt limit/default risk for another  2 yrs....so the mkt will embrace that.
"
339,PSX,"And the 'other pharma' story continues to keep us glued to our seats....Valeant Pharma  (VRX) continues to make headlines......CVS Health Corp. (CVS), Express Scripts  (ESRX) and United Health  are all cutting ties with Philidor Rx - the pharmacy that has helped to propel VRX  to international fame.....The stock closed down $5 pts and is now down another 6 pts in early pre-mkt trading.  Remember that old quote - 'Where there's smoke, there's fire..'.....The question now is - is the fire just a log or the whole house?
"
340,PSX,"US futures are up 2 pts - Global mkts are under a bit of pressure.   The BoJ (Bank of Japan) did not increase their QE program which caught some by surprise but did not cause a negative mkt reaction.   In Europe  - EU eco data was mixed....CPI did rise by 1%, while German retail sales missed the expectation.  Inflation figures were better, but still low and will have no impact on the ECB's plan for more stimulus. 
"

Where one US company buys a smaller foreign rival and then moves the corporate headquarters abroad and BOOM!  - they just cut their US tax obligation by millions of dollars....   And to make the point - PFE CEO - Ian Read made no bones about it.....saying that ""US Corporate tax rates have put the company at a disadvantage to its foreign rivals.....We are fighting with one hand tied behind our back.....and that Pfizer was doing what we need to do to ensure that we can continue to innovate.""When will Washington wake up?  How many more 'inversion trades' must we see before those Bozo's in Congress recognize that they are nothing but a bunch of clowns as evidenced by the new 2 yr budget deal that lifts the debt ceiling even higher and rolls back fiscal austerity...but hey - it removes the risk of a debt limit/default risk for another  2 yrs....so the mkt will embrace that.And the 'other pharma' story continues to keep us glued to our seats....Valeant Pharma  (VRX) continues to make headlines......CVS Health Corp. (CVS), Express Scripts  (ESRX) and United Health  are all cutting ties with Philidor Rx - the pharmacy that has helped to propel VRX  to international fame.....The stock closed down $5 pts and is now down another 6 pts in early pre-mkt trading.  Remember that old quote - 'Where there's smoke, there's fire..'.....The question now is - is the fire just a log or the whole house?US futures are up 2 pts - Global mkts are under a bit of pressure.   The BoJ (Bank of Japan) did not increase their QE program which caught some by surprise but did not cause a negative mkt reaction.   In Europe  - EU eco data was mixed....CPI did rise by 1%, while German retail sales missed the expectation.  Inflation figures were better, but still low and will have no impact on the ECB's plan for more stimulus. It is the last day of the month - so we will sure have some 'window dressing  or undressing' taking place  as asset managers close their books on October.   Earnings continue to weigh on some stocks, but overall the season is not as bad as originally expected....so the nervousness that permeated the mkts in early October seemed to have subsided.   Expect to see the mkt challenge 2100 today.....and then back off and churn in line....Eco data today  could derail us - but I doubt it.  Pers Income of +0.2%, Pers Spend of +0.2%, ISM Milwaukee of 44 and Chicago Purch Manager of 49.4.On the earnings front look for some of the OILS....Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil  (XOM) , Phillips 66 (PSX), along with CVS Health Corp.

418,PSX,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output rose 5.4% in April after edging down 1.1% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in April averaged 1,224,948 barrels a day, up 62,814 barrels a day from March.Like crude, natural gas output went up too – from March’s 2,119,751 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,241,623 thousand cubic feet per day - a new all-time high. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 15%).Record Number of Producing WellsMeanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,571 at the end of April, the highest on record.The healthy (and somewhat unexpected) improvement in oil activity – primarily attributed to high number of well completions – follows four monthly production decreases in a row. Importantly, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the 15th month.Therefore, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. In fact, April production came in just short of a record high of 1,227,483 barrels per day recorded in December 2014.Rig Count ImprovesSome 60 drilling rigs were active in the state in April, up one from the March average. The drilling rig count increased further to 62 in May. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 50 rigs operating.A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production. Going by the outlook of crude producers, seven to ten more rigs are likely to join the fleet by the end of this year.Though the current rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling, one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well. In other words, modern rigs have helped boost the per-unit output.More rigs in operation and higher production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota.Crude Prices, Production Should Remain StrongLast month, the U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark topped $70 per barrel – a three-and-half-year high. The surge could primarily be attributed to robust global economic growth that led to healthy oil demand. With stronger oil prices increasing producer profits, crude output in the United States is expected to keep climbing. As it is, the current domestic production of 10.9 million barrels per day is the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.While commodity prices have retreated over the past few weeks on reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela, oil market fundamentals remain largely tight with strong demand amid stuttering supply. Industry watchers are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark in the short-to-medium term.Dakota Access Pipeline: A Trump Card for North DakotaWhile Bakken in North Dakota has significant accumulations of profitable oil reserves, production in the area fell sharply during the oil slump. However, with rebounding crude prices, Bakken has been regaining strength, with output gradually approaching the peak levels that was achieved in 2014.Apart from the strength in oil prices, there is another factor that is set speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) mega project recently marked its one-year anniversary. The conduit has carried around 182.5 million barrels of oil since inception, proving to be quite a game changer for the producers in the Bakken shale play.The pipeline, with a capacity to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil per day (or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output) has successfully bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil-producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially. Moreover, the pipeline’s service has bolstered the revival of Bakken output, with large operators like Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) counting on the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their products to market.While there are apprehensions that growing North Dakota production could outpace the pipeline capacity again sometime next year leading to widening discount for the regional crude, current prices continue to exceed breakeven costs comfortably.Oil Production Expected to Hit Record Shortly    Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.In fact, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels per day before mid-2018.Two Top-Ranked Stocks to BuyThough a number of companies have built sizeable acreage positions in North Dakota, we have shortlisted two of them that might fetch you outstanding returns.

419,PSX,"While designing their portfolio, an investor may end up making a wrong choice. This can be due to a lack of expertise in identifying outperformers from a plethora of stocks on the market at any point of time.Choice of improper stocks can adversely impact investors’ returns, thereby ruining the very objective of investing their hard-earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market. In a bid to avoid such a scenario, investors, more often than not rely on guidance from proper channels.Broker Advice – The SaviorIn the field of investing, brokers are deemed to be experts, equipped with thorough knowledge. Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations.  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding on their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.Be Guided by Earnings Estimate Revisions Since brokers indulge in meticulous research, the question of their actions being arbitrary/out of the blue does not arise. The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa.Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters, it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason/logic behind brokers improving their recommendation on a particular stock. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.To take care of the earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Revenues Performance – A Key PointerAccording to many market watchers, a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance, especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel (which will hurt travel-focused companies). Therefore, one must take the top-line performance into consideration as well while formulating a winning strategy. We have included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Delek US Holdings Inc. (DK  -  Free Report) has a diversified energy business focused on petroleum refining, marketing and supply of refined products, and retail marketing of fuel and general merchandise.

420,PSX,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the Guggenheim Multi-Asset Income ETF (CVY  -  Free Report) debuted on 09/21/2006, and offers broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by Invesco, and has been able to amass over $294.75 M, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index.The Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index is comprised of approximately 125 to 150 stocks selected, based on a multi-factor proprietary model, from a universe of domestic and international companies, including U.S.-listed common stocks, ADRs paying dividends, REITs, MLPs, closed-end funds and traditional preferred stocks.Cost & Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.79% for CVY, making it on par with most peer products in the space.CVY's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 3.96%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Valero Energy Corp (VLO  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.35% of the fund's total assets, followed by Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST  -  Free Report).CVY's top 10 holdings account for about 11.7% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskCVY has gained about 1.38% so far this year, and as of 06/14/2018, is up roughly 10.38% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $20.64 and $23.39.CVY has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 12.73% for the trailing three-year period. With about 149 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

421,PSX,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 1.1% in March after edging down 0.4% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in March averaged 1,162,071 barrels a day, down 13,245 barrels a day from February.But unlike crude, natural gas output went up – from February’s 2,106,121 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,116,294 thousand cubic feet per day – a new all-time high. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 12%).Record Number of Producing WellsMeanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,457 at the end of March, the highest on record.While the slight drop in oil activity – primarily attributed to windy weather – is the fourth month-over-month production decrease in a row, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the fourteenth month.Therefore, notwithstanding the temporary blip, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation.Rig Count ImprovesSome 59 drilling rigs were active in the state in March, up two from the February average. The drilling rig count increased further to 60 in April. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 46 rigs operating.A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production.

In other words, modern rigs have helped boost the per-unit output.Shale Industry Adjusts to the New RealityMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Crude Prices on a Steady Climb UpwardThe U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit a three-and-half-year high of $72.24 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on surging domestic production and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline Increased Takeaway CapacityApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that is set speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration.As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor – carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – brought the controversial conduit online in early June 2017. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 73% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to some 17%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report),  and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.While there are apprehensions that growing North Dakota production could outpace the pipeline capacity again sometime next year leading to widening discount for the regional crude, current prices continue to exceed breakeven costs by around $30 per barrel.But there is definitely a case to build more infrastructure for the ever-increasing natural gas volumes. Recently, North Dakota Public Service Commission green lighted Tulsa-based ONEOK Inc.’s (OKE  -  Free Report) suspended Demicks Lake processing plant. The 200 million-cubic-feet-per-day facility, costing around $400 million, is likely to be completed by the fourth quarter of next year. The conduit will enhance processing capacity in North Dakota's Williston Basin, where wells churn out the maximum gas.Oil Production Expected to Hit Record in 2018     Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.In fact, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime by mid-2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

422,PSX,"Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) Dakota Access pipeline has been benefiting oil producers in Bakken Shale.  We note that the opening of the pipeline was mired in controversy. However, once it became fully operational in June 2017, this 1,172-mile pipeline has proved to be beneficial for producers in the region.How?The pipeline, with a capacity to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil per day, was targeted to bridge the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil-producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins. The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where oil majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested,    has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.  Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.Owing to improved access to the markets, discount for Bakken crude has gone down from $7 or $8 to $5. This has increased the number of operational rigs in the region from 38 in January 2017 to 53 at the end of 2017. If the current oil price environment persists, the number of active rigs is expected to increase in the coming quarters. Production per rig is higher in the Bakken Shale than most of the other shale plays in the United States. The rise in rig count pushed oil production from around one million barrels per day (bpd) to 1,185,000 bpd. Moreover, in October alone, the state witnessed an all-time high total output of more than 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.With an increase in output, revenues are expected to surge for oil producers and the state as well. During the first year of operations, the state is expected to receive $250 million in tax. It had put North Dakota state-revenue 17% higher than estimated. Notably, during the first five months of the pipeline’s operation, state revenues were $43 million higher than previous projection.  Crude transportation has become much easier since the introduction of the pipeline. Previously, 12 trains with 100 cars used to ship oil out of the state, which now has reduced to two. It has lessened the risk of accidents and spills.In addition with the financial perks, the pipeline has provided jobs for locals both directly and indirectly. It has lowered the rate of unemployment in the North Dakota state to 2.8%, while the U.S. unemployment rate is 4.1%.The Dakota Access Controversy The pipeline, which was supposed to become operational by the end of 2016, faced immense objection delaying the commencement of services. Work on the project was halted by the Obama administration amid protests from a Native American tribe, blocking the construction of the final part of the pipeline through North Dakota. The protests of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe drew international attention. They were of the opinion that the pipeline would desecrate their sacred burial ground as well as contaminate the water supply. Efforts to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline were restarted after President Trump brushed aside former President Obama’s efforts of blocking the pipeline's construction. Trump ignored the bitter opposition from environmental activists and ordered the completion of the pipeline.The pipeline, despite the pending litigation against its operator, has already leaked at least three times. However, in early December 2017, a judge paid heed to the request of the tribe. It asked Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop an oil spill response plan for the stretch of pipe below the Missouri River, which is due in April 2018.Although the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline by Energy Transfer Partners, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, has faced criticism, it has also proved to be beneficial in some respects. With the expected positive results from the project, it will be hard to cast a vote against the pipeline.

423,PSX,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices lost ground.On the news front, U.S. energy major Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) set its investment budget for 2018 at $18.3 billion, down 4% from its projected spending this year. Meanwhile, Bill Barrett Corp.  and Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) struck separate acquisition deals.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1.7% to close at $57.36 per barrel, while natural gas prices slumped 9.4% to $2.772 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon's Restructuring, Shell's Cash Dividend Resumption & More)Notwithstanding OPEC and other major producers’ agreement to expand their output-cut deal beyond March – for another nine months to the end of 2018 – the U.S. oil benchmark dropped to its lowest settlement since Nov 16.The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. In fact, U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day last week to 9.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. A massive build in gasoline supplies also played spoilsport.Meanwhile, natural gas futures sunk to their lowest finish since Oct 27 following a surprise increase in supplies and predictions of warmer-than-normal weather (translating into weak heating gas demand) over the next few days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Chevron Corporation offered a glimpse of its 2018 capital spending plans.The company has set its capital and exploratory budget at $18.3 billion, down by 4% from its 2017 projected investment of less than $19 billion. Next year's budget is also around 18% lower than the company’s 2016 spending of $22.4 billion and down 46% from the 2015 expenditure of $34 billion.Revised downward for the fifth consecutive year, the second-biggest U.S. oil and gas group's cut in capital spending reflects Chevron's plans to optimize its expenses, while relying increasingly on shale drilling.Of the American multinational's total 2018 capital expenditure, a little over 86% is planned to be incurred in its upstream operations. In particular, Chevron is concentrating on increasing its investment in shale as it strives to boost its U.S. shale production next year.For 2018, the company intends to spend $4.3 billion in shale – up 70% year over year – the lion's share (or $3.3 billion) going to the lucrative Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico alone. The remaining $1 billion has been set aside for other shale investments.Overall, the oil giant plans to shell out $6.6 billion for its domestic upstream operations. An additional $9.2 billion will target international upstream projects.

Shares of Bill Barrett further plunged 18.71% to eventually close at $4.65 on Dec 6.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s plans to issue common stock to repay Fifth Creek’s debt did not find much favor among investors. However, despite the stock dilution, the combined entity is poised for long-term growth on increased scale and synergies.

Subject to satisfactory conditions and shareholder’s approval, the transaction is set for closure by the first or second quarter of 2018.Post the acquisition, the new combined entity will be listed on the exchange under the name “New BBG” with both Bill Barrett and Fifth Creek becoming its subsidiaries. Mr. Scott Woodall, President and CEO of Bill Barrett, will continue to serve at the same positions of the combined entity.Fifth Creek will receive 100 million shares of the New BBG. Along with that, the transaction value also includes the assumption of $54 million of Fifth Creek’s debt by Bill Barrett.

However, the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps. Contract drilling services provider Helmerich and Payne remains focused on increasing directional drilling. Earlier this year, the company had acquired Dallas-based drilling tech firm MOTIVE Drilling Technologies, Inc. for around $75 million.Established in 2010, MagVAR provides technological assistance pertaining to directional drilling to energy explorers and drillers. The technology is utilized in both onshore and offshore fields in Asia, North America, South America, Europe and Africa.With the help of comprehensive 3-D geomagnetic reference modeling, MagVAR aims at the identification and the elimination of the anomalies in real-time, thus improving the accuracy of directional drilling process. It will help to enhance well production and lower drilling costs.The acquisition will improve the directional drilling process and will enable Helmerich & Payne to drill wells more efficiently and accurately leading to better quality wellbore. (Read more Helmerich & Payne Buys MagVAR to Enhance Drilling Technology)4.    In a bid to expand its Utica acreage, upstream player Eclipse Resources Corp. (ECR  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal with private operator Travis Peak Resources LLC to acquire the latter’s north-central Pennsylvania assets. Post the announcement, shares of the company rose more than 6% to eventually close at $2.28 on Dec 11.Per the deal, Eclipse Resources will acquire 44,500 net acres in Tioga and Potter counties of Pennsylvania in an all-equity deal valued at $93.7 million, thus maintaining its leverage and liquidity metrics. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the transaction is set for closure by January 2018.In a separate transaction, Eclipse Resources agreed to acquire Cardinal NE Holdings, LLC for 18.3 million in cash. The deal will entitle Eclipse Resources to gain midstream assets and related gathering infrastructure in the acquired acreage.The Travis Peak acquisition will add around 87 net drilling locations and boost the company’s Utica dry gas acreage by approximately 85%. The acquisition includes one proved developed producing well with production capacity of 6.5 million cubic feet per day.5.    Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) plan to gauge shippers’ interest in transporting significant volumes of liquid, through Gray Oak Pipeline, to the Gulf Coast market from Permian Basin of West Texas. The to-be-built pipeline’s open season has been announced on Dec 11.As per the firms’ estimates, the Gray Oak Pipeline will initially have a daily throughput capacity of 385,000 barrels. If shippers show significant interest, Phillips 66 and Enbridge will think of expanding capacity.The Gray Oak Pipeline will likely commence operations by the second half of 2019. Investors should know that the pipeline system will open access to shippers and crude producers for transporting liquid to oil refining facilities and export terminals.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-0.8%+1.1%CVX+0.8%+13.2%COP+1.4%+15.3%OXY-2.3%+13.9%SLB+1.1%-7.3%RIG-2.3%+13.3%VLO+2.3%+33.6%ANDV+5.3%+20.9% Shrugging off the week’s bearish oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a +0.3% return last week.

424,PSX,"Midstream energy player Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) has received consent for a new share repurchase program of $3 billion from its board of directors. Since the third quarter of 2012, the company’s total authorization for share repurchases has increased to $12 billion.Phillips 66’s board of directors has also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 70 cents per common stock. The dividend is payable on Dec 1, 2017 to its shareholders of record as of the close of business on Nov 17, 2017.These announcements are in sync with the company’s strategy to enhance shareholder value. Phillips 66 has increased quarterly dividend rate seven times. Since 2012, it has returned over $15 billion to its shareholders in the form of dividends, share repurchases and share exchanges. Phillips 66 has repurchased and exchanged over 20% of outstanding shares since its formation.These actions increase the positivity that currently surrounds Phillips 66’s stock price. The company’s shares have been touching new highs. Phillips 66 is believed to have an association with the biggest North American travel center operator, Pilot Flying J, wherein Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathatway Inc  has a stake of 38.6%. Berkshire Hathatway aims to have the majority ownership by 2023 in Pilot Flying-J.ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has divested 50% of its stake in the CFJ Properties, which included Flying J truck stops to Pilot Travel Centers in 2010 for $626 million. During that time, the sales agreement comprised long-term supply contract agreements with Flying-J. However, as per sources, Phillips 66 still has long-term supply agreements with Flying-J. Phillips 66’s brand name along with the old ConocoPhillips signs is still seen at some of the Flying-J Travel Centers across the country.Moreover, the company is likely to carry on with its upward trajectory as Berkshire holds considerable stakes in both companies and the supply agreements are expected to continue and expand.Shares of the company have returned 13.3% compared with the industry’s increase of 9.6% over the last three months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Phillips 66 carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

426,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded its largest weekly draw since 2016. The massive 12.6 million barrels dip pushed storage levels to their lowest since February 2015, while keeping them under the five-year average. Despite the record decline, U.S. benchmark crude futures lost as much as 5% (or $3.73) to $70.38 per barrel Wednesday – the worst daily slump in 13 months. The front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures further edged down to $70.33 at yesterday’s close.The price plunge could be attributed to fears of supply resumption from Libya and escalating trade conflict between the United States and China.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 12.6 million barrels for the week ending Jul 6, following a shock increase of 1.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 4.8 million barrels.Steep decline in imports, partly due to an outage at Syncrude facility in Canada, led to the massive stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 45 of the last 66 weeks and are down more than 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 405.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18% below the year-ago figure and 4% under the five-year average.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – plunged 2.1 million barrels to 25.7 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 23.7 days in the previous week to 22.90 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.0 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were down for the second week. The 694,000 barrels draw – below the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 239 million barrels. Following last week’s decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 1.4% above the year-earlier level and is 6% over the five-year range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 4.1 million barrels last week, ahead of analysts’ expectations for 1.7 million barrels increase in supply level. The fourth successive weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 121.7 million barrels, current supplies are 21% below the year-ago level and 12% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 0.4% from the prior week to 96.7%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

427,PSX,"Investors looking for stocks in the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing sector might want to consider either HollyFrontier (HFC  -  Free Report) or Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.HollyFrontier has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Phillips 66 has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that HFC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.HFC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.38, while PSX has a forward P/E of 15.45. We also note that HFC has a PEG ratio of 1.27. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PSX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.82.Another notable valuation metric for HFC is its P/B ratio of 1.93. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PSX has a P/B of 2.12.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HFC's Value grade of A and PSX's Value grade of C.HFC stands above PSX thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that HFC is the superior value option right now.

428,PSX,"Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) has made progress in the expansion of Sweeny Hub — a key midstream project — that is expected to enhance its integrated NGL value chain.The project, which is anticipated to cost about $1.5 billion, is scheduled to commence commercial operations in late 2020. The construction of two 150,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) natural gas liquids (NGL) fractionators in Old Ocean, TX, additional NGL storage capacity and related pipeline infrastructure are part of the project.The company has already secured supply agreements for Y-grade NGL feedstock. This includes an agreement with DCP Midstream LP (DCP  -  Free Report), which has an option to buy about 30% ownership interest in the new fractionators.Currently, the Sweeny Hub has 100,000 bpd of fractionation capacity through Phillips 66 Partners LP’s (PSXP  -  Free Report) Sweeny Fractionator One, 200,000 bpd of LPG export capability and access to 9 million barrels of gross NGL storage capacity. The midstream project is located near Phillips 66 Partners’ Clemens Caverns.After completion of the expansion project, the Sweeny Hub will have 400,000 bpd of NGL fractionation capacity and access to 15 million barrels of total storage capacity. The expansion is projected to generate more than 25 new full-time jobs and about 2,000 construction-related jobs in Brazoria County.  Phillips 66 is a diversified energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining as well as marketing and specialties businesses. The company plans to allocate money toward more profitable business units like Midstream and Chemicals instead of extensive refining and marketing operations. Midstream business is in high demand in the central United States, as there is a huge need for fresh pipeline and infrastructure properties in the flourishing shales. Moreover, improving petrochemical demand will boost the requirement for more chemical business in the United States.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Phillips 66’s shares have gained 22.8% compared with the industry’s 23.2% rise. Zacks Rank & Key PicksPhillips 66 currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked player in the same sector is Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

429,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell more than expected as exports jumped to a new record. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories rose from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall. Meanwhile, refinery activity continued to rebound from post-Hurricane Harvey challenges.However, the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by the news of production resumption at Libya’s largest oil field and slipping compliance to OPEC’s output cut deal.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 0.9% (or 44 cents) to settle at $49.98 per barrel Wednesday – the lowest settlement since Sep 19.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 29, following a decrease of 1.8 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.5 million barrels.Soaring exports in the wake of widening Brent premium to WTI led to the big stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. A discount in U.S. oil prices to the global benchmark Brent (or a larger spread) makes domestic crude attractive in overseas markets.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 465 million barrels, current crude supplies are marginally below the year-ago period. However, stocks are close to the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.5 million barrels to 62.5 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 31.5 days in the previous week to 30.3 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the second week running as refinery throughput decreased. The 1.6 million barrels addition – slightly above the polled number of 1.5 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 218.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is remains 3.7% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 2.6 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 2.4 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to strengthening demand. At 135.4 million barrels, current supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago level but are in the top half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 5.4% from the prior week to 88.6%. While refinery runs have rebounded from storm-induced nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% - the highest since 2005.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

431,PSX,"It was a week where oil prices extended the streak of gains, while natural gas futures slipped following a clutch of bearish data sets.On the news front, European oil major BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) started pumping natural gas from the Khazzan field in Oman, midstream energy player Phillips 66 Partners L.P. (PSXP  -  Free Report) entered into a $2.4 billion agreement to buy Bakken assets from its parent, while Drilling powerhouse Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report) decided to scrap six floaters, taking a $1.4 billion hit in the process. Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.5% to close at $50.66 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 2.2% to $2.959 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: BP's Contract Renewal, SDRL's Bankruptcy, REN's Asset Sale.)The U.S. oil benchmark closed at its highest level since May 24 as traders held out hope for price stability amid an improving supply-demand narrative. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs dropping for a third straight week helped cement those gains.Energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year, helping to tighten the market significantly. Further, the Paris-based IEA said that the global oil supply had come down by 720,000 per day last month to 97.7 million barrels on outages and maintenance in non-OPEC countries.Meanwhile, according to the OPEC’s latest monthly report, the oil cartel’s production fell by 79,000 barrels a day in August to 32.76 million as output dropped in Libya, Gabon, Venezuela and Iraq. This points to the success of the 14-member group’s output curb initiatives and rising compliance levels, which reached a record 116%.Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done.The number of active rigs drilling for crude in the U.S. – an indicator of oil industry activity – fell by five to 744 as of Friday, as per data from oilfield services firm Baker Hughes Inc.Meanwhile, an above-average increase in natural gas supplies, together with unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production weighed on natural gas futures.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant BP plc announced the commencement of natural gas production at the Khazzan field in Oman. The company will be using fracking technology, which is rarely used in the Middle East. In the field, BP holds a 60% stake, while the remaining is owned by Oman Oil Company Exploration & Production.The Khazzan gas project, estimated expected to have an inventory of 300 drilling wells, is the largest start-up for BP in 2017. Also, it is the sixth project start-up among the seven new key developments of the company this year. All the projects are likely to take the energy giant closer to its target of adding 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent every day by 2020.BP has two planned phases for the Khazzan project. The company expects the field to generate 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas after the completion of the phases. Further, the company estimates recoverable reserves from the natural gas field of around 10.5 trillion cubic feet.2.    Midstream energy player Phillips 66 Partners L.P. recently announced the signing of a deal worth $2.4 billion – with parent company Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report).Slated to close by early October, the deal will allow the partnership to buy Phillips 66’s 25% stake in each of Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC and Dakota Access, LLC. It is to be noted that the remaining 75% stake in Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company and Dakota Access, LLC lies with Bakken Holdings Company, LLC.Investors should know that Dakota Access, LLC and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC own and operate the Bakken Pipeline that includes both Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline (“ETCOP”). The Bakken Pipeline spreads over 1,926 miles and has a capacity to transport 520,000 barrels of crude every day. Also per the agreement, Phillips 66 Partners is expected to purchase 100% stake in Merey Sweeny LP, which owns a coke processing plant at the Sweeny refinery of Phillips 66.This will mark the largest ever transaction for Phillips 66 Partners. The addition of pipeline assets will provide the partnership with stable fee-based revenues. This will generate lucrative cash distributions for the unit holders. Phillips 66 Partners revealed that the transaction will grow its distribution by 30% and will also help generate $1.1 billion in annual operating income by 2018.3.    Offshore driller Transocean Ltd. recently announced that it will retire six of its cold stacked floaters. The company expressed its desire to put the rigs up for sale, which can be recycled to be more environment-friendly. Following the move, Transocean is expected to incur an impairment cost of around $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Although the move may create a short-term headwind, most analysts believe that it will not affect the company in the long term.The retirement of the six deepwater floaters is in line with the company’s strategy of increasing its fleet quality. The removal of old and less competitive rigs will make way for new high-specification assets, making the company’s operations more technically capable. It will provide Transocean’s fleet a competitive advantage. Also, reactivation cost for most of the cold-stacked rigs is high and will face tough competition from the new-build rigs due to the technological gap.Transocean has four ultra-deepwater drillships under construction. Transocean’s recent purchase of Songa, a Norwegian company, may have led the company to take the step. Songa’s complementary assets and strong fleet quality will strengthen Transocean’s portfolio.4.    In a bid to transform itself into a Delaware Basin pure play U.S.-based upstream company Halcón Resources Corporation (HK  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to offload non-operated assets in Williston Basin to a private player. These assets have a production capacity of 1,891 barrels of oil, 1,931 thousand cubic feet of gas and 65 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. Subject to regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions, the deal will entitle a payment of up to $104 million to Halcón. Halcón plans to use the proceeds from the sale for reducing debt. This will strengthen the company’s balance sheet and provide it with increased liquidity to execute drilling projects.Halcón, being one of the big sufferers of the weak crude environment, filed for bankruptcy in July 2016. In September, it completed financial restructuring and emerged from bankruptcy. Since then, the company has been divesting assets in most of its basins to concentrate on the prolific Delaware play. In less than nine months, Halcón divested around 2,000 wellbores across its obsolete and non-core assets for more than $2 billion cash proceeds. In July, the company sold around 104, 000 acres in Williston Basin for $1.04 billion. In August, it closed another $6 million deal to sell the non-operating assets in Williston Basin.Since the beginning of 2017, the company has been strengthening its foothold in the Delaware Basin through acquisitions. This has enabled Halcón to increase its acreage in the region at a reasonable price and has poised it for growth. In the Delaware Basin, the company currently owns over 41,500 net acres in Ward and Pecos counties. In January, Halcón acquired over 21,000 acres in Pecos for $705 million, while divesting the El Halcón assets in the East Texas Eagle Ford for $500 million. Halcón also aimed to purchase an additional 15,040 net acres in Ward. The company bought around 594 acres in Pecos in March with a production capacity of 160 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In June, the company further increased its acreage by over 3,600 acres in Pecos. The company also expects to acquire an additional 8,320 net acres in the northern part of Ward, by Dec 31.5.    Brazilian energy behemoth Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently announced senior notes offering worth $2 billion. The offering will be made in two tranches.The first tranche of the notes offering, with an interest rate of 5.3%, will raise $1 billion and is scheduled to mature in 2025. The second part worth $1billion carries an interest rate of 6% and is slated to mature in 2028. Petrobras intends to use the proceeds from the offering for the repayment of borrowings under its senior credit facility and for general corporate purposes.The company has also offered holders additional notes maturing between 2019 and 2021, with the option to either repurchase their debt or exchange it with longer dated securities. The move will help the company to trim its outstanding debt load and extend the long-term maturities of securities.Currently, Petrobras is concentrating on improving its liquidity and operational performance. The company’s efforts to deleverage or at least refinance its debt obligations to extend its maturity are working in its favor. The company’s divestment goals will help to reinstate its financial health by mitigating the leverage.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-0.2%-0.3%CVX+2.5%+9.3%COP+7.1%+13.3%OXY+2.2%+2.8%SLB+1.6%-9.5%RIG+1.1%-18.2%VLO+6.2%+14.2%ANDV+2.4%+31.1%The Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies –  generated a +1% return last week.

433,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another massive drop on continued strong refinery runs. With oil supplies falling for the ninth week, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by the steadily rising domestic oil output that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. At 9.53 million barrels a day, production is at the highest level in more than two years, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies. Surprise builds in refined product inventories – gasoline and distillate – added to the pessimism. As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 1% (or 48 cents) to $45.96 per barrel Wednesday.In any case, the federal data was overshadowed by the impact of Hurricane Harvey-induced shutdowns at crude production and refining infrastructure.Gasoline Prices JumpThe Gulf of Mexico (GoM), which bore the brunt of Hurricane Harvey, has major refining infrastructures. According to the EIA, more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity and around 51% of the nation’s natural gas processing capacity are located in the GoM.Exxon Mobil Corporation’s (XOM  -  Free Report) Baytown, Royal Dutch Shell plc’s (RDS.A  -  Free Report) Deer Park, Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s (MPC  -  Free Report) Galveston Bay, Phillips 66’s (PSX  -  Free Report) Sweeny Texas, Petrobras’ (PBR  -  Free Report) Pasadena, Valero Energy Corporation’s (VLO  -  Free Report) Corpus Christi are among the facilities affected. As a result, gasoline soared to a two-year high of $1.885 a gallon after Harvey caused weeks of disruptions at refineries in its path and shut units, creating supply shortages that will affect facilities for months.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 5.4 million barrels for the week ending Aug 25, following a decline of 3.3 million barrels in the previous week.The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.5 million barrels. Continued strength in refinery crude runs led to the bigger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production rose to the highest level since July 2015.Inventory reduction in 19 of the past 21 weeks has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 457.8 million barrels, current crude supplies are at their lowest since January 2016 and are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 689,000 barrels to 57.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26.5 days in the previous week to 26 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the third time in four weeks on higher production and imports. The nominal 35,000 barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.9 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 229.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 0.9% below the year-earlier level but is close to the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up by 748,000 barrels last week, as opposed to analysts’ expectations for 600,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The third successive weekly rise could be attributed to fall in demand. At 149.2 million barrels, current supplies are 3.6% below the year-ago level but are in the upper half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization jumped 1.2% from the prior week’s 12-year highs to 96.6%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Range Resources Corp.

434,PSX,"We have closed the book for the Q2 earnings season with releases from all S&P 500 Oil/ Energy companies already out. From our article, it is clear that the Energy sector contributed the most to year-over-year earnings growth in the S&P 500 Index.Among the major industries in the Energy sector, we found Q2 performances of the Oil Refining & Marketing industry the most impressive. The refining industry generated huge cash flow from core operations for investors in second-quarter 2017. Also, the industry’s dividend yield is higher than that of the S&P 500 Index. Thus, it is a good time to consider stocks from the oil refining industry.Oil Refining IndustryThis industry mainly deals in downstream operations. Companies belonging to this space have plants that help refine raw crude to produce end products like gasoline, heating oils and diesel. In other words, refining companies buy raw crude from the exploration and production players and sell the refined products.The industry has a good industry rank and is undervalued as compared to the S&P 500 index. Industry RankIn terms of Zacks Industry Rank,Oil Refining Industry is among the top performing industries.The industry is ranked #100 and lies in the top 39% of industries. The industry rank is impressive as the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Undervalued as Compared to S&P 500Compared to the S&P 500, the Oil Refining Industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has more potential to grow in the near future compared to the index. The Oil Refining industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.57, which is below the index’s mark of 10.69. The EV/EBITDA ratio is one of the best multiples for valuing oil and gas companies because energy firms have a large amount of debt and EV (Enterprise Value) has included the parameter.Terrific Q2 Performance With the help of our proprietary model, we picked up key parameters that highlighted the terrific performance of the Oil Refining Industry during the second quarter of this year.Beats S&P 500 The performance of any stock or industry over a specified period of time gets reflected in the pricing chart. The April-to-June quarter has clearly shown that the Oil Refining & Marketing industry has surpassed the S&P 500 Index.During the aforesaid period, the industry has gained 4.4% as compared with the 2.8% improvement of the index. We are highlighting the positive price movement of the Oil Refining industry as many major industries in the Oil/Energy sector have seen negative movements.Cash Flow & Earnings Skyrocket During second-quarter 2017, net cash flow from operations from the Oil Refining industry jumped more than 200% sequentially to $973 million. In other words, the industry saw a marked improvement in cash flow in Q2 from the decline in Q1.On top of that, earnings out of core operations – as measured by earnings before income, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) – was registered at $776 million, highlighting almost 60% improvement from the prior quarter.Lucrative Dividend Yield for Q2Along with improved earnings, the Oil Refining industry also recorded a lucrative dividend yield which outpaced the S&P 500 Index.During the April-to-June quarter of this year, the industry reported dividend yield of 3.35%, which is far better than 1.9% yield of the S&P 500 Index.Refining Stocks in FocusPicking the prospective energy stocks can be a daunting task.

435,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a sharp decline for the sixth week in a row on record high refinery runs. With oil supplies continuing to fall, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.However, gains were capped by a strong dollar and escalating tensions between the US and North Korea that sparked investor movement away from riskier assets to safe havens like gold. As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 0.8% (or 39 cents) to $49.56 per barrel Wednesday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 6.45 million barrels for the week ending August 4, 2017, following a decline of 1.53 million barrels in the previous week.The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.5 million barrels. A surge in refinery crude runs to 12-year highs and dip in imports as well as domestic production led to the large stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consume.The sixteenth inventory reduction in 18 weeks has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Nevertheless, U.S. still remains awash with excess oil. At 475.44 million barrels, current crude supplies are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.After declining in 15 of the last 16 weeks, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up 569,000 barrels from previous week’s level to 56.37 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 27.9 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.3 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the first time in 8 weeks as demand weakened in the face of increasing imports and production. The 3.42 million barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.25 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 231.10 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1.8% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 1.73 million barrels last week, well ahead of analysts’ expectations for 600,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The fourth successive weekly fall could be attributed to strong demand and lower imports. At 147.69 million barrels, current supplies are 2.3% below the year-ago level but are in the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.9% from the prior week to 96.3%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

436,PSX,"Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) mega project, Dakota Access Pipeline, recently marked its one-year anniversary. Disregarding criticism from Native American tribes and environmental groups, the pipeline has been operational for a year now and proved to be a silver bullet for North Dakota’s economic potential.Clears Many ChallengesThe pipeline was supposed to become operational by the end of 2016. However, it received immense censure from a Native American tribe that delayed the commencement of its services. The Obama administration halted pipeline construction amid protests, blocking the building of the final part of the pipeline through North Dakota.The protests drew international attention as the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe objected the project. They were of the opinion that the pipeline would desecrate their sacred burial ground as well as contaminate water supply.However, making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and brushed aside former Obama’s efforts of blocking the pipeline's construction. Efforts to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline were thus reinvigorated, as Trump signed an executive order to smoothly execute the pipeline’s operations. The pipeline finally came online on Jun 1 last year.Dakota Pipeline: Trump Card for North Dakota?Though the opening of the pipeline was mired in controversy, the $3.8 billion Dakota Pipeline has proved to be quite a game changer for the producers in the Bakken shale play.While Bakken in North Dakota has significant accumulations of profitable oil reserves, production in the area fell sharply during the oil slump. However, with rebounding crude prices, Bakken has been regaining strength, with output gradually approaching the peak levels that was achieved in 2014.Apart from improving energy landscape, another factor that has been boosting its production prospects is the 1,172-mile-long Dakota Access pipeline. While North Dakota production volumes lag Texas and Gulf of Mexico levels, the output growth has enhanced domestic energy independence, with the pipeline already carrying around 182.5 million barrels of oil.In March 2018, oil production hit 1,162,071 barrels per day(bpd) as against 1,025,638 bpd a year-earlier, gaining impetus from the pipeline project. North Dakota’s total number of producing wells totaled 14,457, banking on improved energy landscape and midstream network.The pipeline, with a capacity to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil per day, has successfully bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil-producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.The commencement of the pipeline’s service has bolstered the revival of Bakken output, with large operators like Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) counting on the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their products to market. Oasis Petroleum currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of the Dakota Access pipeline.In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from more than 24% in the early part of 2017 to little in excess of 10%.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to the Gulf and East Coast refineries, and also reaches the international markets. As expected, the pipeline, in which energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, helped to improve the region’s drilling economics. It helped in lowering transportation costs for operators from $8 a barrel to around $4-$5 per barrel. Reportedly, the number of operational rigs in the region totaled 60 in April, witnessing more than 50% year-over-year increase.The pipeline project also generated huge employment opportunities in its construction, engineering, manufacturing and technology activities, creating around 40,000 jobs.Although the pipeline has been subject to several minor leaks since its inception, it hasn’t recorded any major incident. Minor spills were in fact effectively contained and cleaned up, without leading to severe loss of volumes. Reportedly, in the first six months of its operation, the pipeline transported 61.25 million barrels with a nominal loss of less than 4 barrels of oil during the same period of time.Final ThoughtsWhile a years’ time is certainly not enough to gauge success or failure, the pipeline has definitely been a big booster in many ways. Overall, rebounding oil prices together with the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost. Reportedly, a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime during the next few months.However, with the opponents still concerned of emission levels and safety issues, they want the pipeline operator to have proper oil spill response plan in place.Nonetheless, with surging production volumes, effective infrastructural development is the need of the hour. With pipelines being the efficient and preferred choice of transportation, prospects of Dakota Access Pipeline look encouraging.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

438,PSX,"First-quarter 2018 earnings cycle is in full swing, with reports from 154 S&P 500 members already on board. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 25.4% from the prior-year quarter on 10.3% higher revenues, with 80.5% companies delivering positive earnings surprises and 72.1% beating revenue estimates.For the first-quarter of 2018, we expect Energy to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors, posting earnings growth of 58.6%. For the January-to-March quarter, we project earnings of $14 billion — the highest in the last four quarters.  Importantly, Energy will likely be among the major drivers behind the S&P 500’s year-over-year earnings growth. Excluding Energy, the index’s Q1 earnings growth will likely drop to 16.5% from 17.8%.A favorable Q1 oil pricing scenario is expected to back Energy’s performance. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price for the month of January, February and March was reported at $63.70 per barrel, $62.23 and $62.73, respectively.

439,PSX,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) – formed following the merger of Tesoro Corporation and El Paso-based Western Refining Inc. – is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 8. Tesoro completed the merger on Jun 1 and renamed itself to Andeavor, which started trading on NYSE under the ticker ANDV from Aug 1.San Antonio, TX-based downstream operator Andeavor – which counts Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) among its peers – posted a positive earnings surprise of 44.44% in the preceding quarter. Significant contribution from the logistics segment and improved performance of the refining segment drove the results.  Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an impressive record. The company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 57.52%.Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise |  Andeavor QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at playApart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018. In June, Andeavor earned credit rating upgrade from both S&P and Fitch on healthy financials and decent coverage and liquid ratios. The company also intends to repurchase shares to offset the dilution associated with the merger.  The company also clinched a deal with Mexico’s Pemex Logística which is expected to strengthen its geographical foothold in Mexico and expand its marketing business under the ARCO brand. The company will also be able to utilize El Paso refining capacity that it has access to now, thanks to the acquisition. This bodes well for the company’s long-term growth opportunities.Although crude ended the second quarter of this year with a decline of 8.4%, the pricing environment of commodities was much healthier than the year-ago quarter, courtesy of the historical OPEC agreement. Andeavor is unlikely to benefit from the improvement in oil prices as the input cost for refiners increase with a price hike. Also, rising costs due to tougher RIN obligations are likely to weigh on the earnings and margins of the company. The RIN expense has increased from $3.3 to $3.5 per barrel in the second quarter when compared with the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Andeavor will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to surpass estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterThat is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at $1.61.Zacks Rank: Andeavor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

442,PSX,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 0.4% in February after edging down 0.3% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in February averaged 1,174,769 barrels a day, down 4,795 barrels a day from January.But unlike crude, natural gas output went up – from January’s 2,071,820 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,102,266 thousand cubic feet per day – a new all-time high. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 15%).Meanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,327 at the end of February, essentially unchanged from the previous month.While the slight drop in oil activity – primarily attributed to cold weather – is the third month-over-month production decrease in a row, the decline was much smaller than anticipated. Moreover, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the thirteenth month.Therefore, notwithstanding the temporary blip, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation.Steady Rise in Rig CountSome 57 drilling rigs were active in the state in February, up one from the January average. The drilling rig count increased to 59 in March and climbed further to tally 60 per the latest count. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 39 rigs operating.A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production. Going by the outlook of crude producers, seven to ten more rigs are likely to join the fleet by the end of this year.Though the current rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling, one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well. In other words, modern rigs have helped boost the per-unit output.Shale Industry Adjusts to the New RealityMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Is the Oil Crisis Over?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit a more than three-year high of around $68.5 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline: The Bakken Game-ChangerApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor – carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – brought the controversial conduit online in early June 2017. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to little over 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.While there are apprehensions that growing North Dakota production could outpace the pipeline capacity again sometime next year leading to widening discount for the regional crude, current prices continue to exceed breakeven costs by around $30 per barrel.Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.In fact, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime by mid-2018, eventually hitting 1.3 million barrels by the end of the year.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Phillips66, which was spun off from ConocoPhillips (COP) on May 1, 2012, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 432.25%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.     Phillips 66 Price and EPS Surprise  Phillips 66 Price and EPS Surprise | Phillips 66 QuoteFactors Likely to Influence EarningsThe company’s free cash flow has been negative over the last two years, reflecting weak business operations. Hence, its ability to pay dividends is at risk. Since the beginning of 2012, there has been exponential growth in long-term debt, reflecting Phillips 66’s weak balance sheet.However, it is to be noted that the company’s prospects are negatively correlated with oil prices. This is because refiners buy raw crude to produce refined products like gasoline. Oil and gas prices have been low for almost three years now and during second-quarter 2017, the prices of both commodities deteriorated further. The prolonged weakness can be attributed to the supply glut in the commodity market. During the quarter under review, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Therefore, this was favorable for the refiners as decrease in crude price translates to lower input cost. This is likely to be reflected in the company’s second-quarter profitability.Q2 Stock Price PerformancePricing chart for the first three months of this year reveals that Phillips 66’s shares underperformed the industry. During the aforesaid period, the company’s shares gained 5.2% as against 8.2% increase for the broader industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Phillips 66 will beat estimates this quarter.

Also, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $103,155.0 million.Segmental ResultsMidstreamThe segment posted quarterly income of $139 million compared with $35 million in the year-ago quarter.

447,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both rose from their week earlier levels.Following the negative data sets, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 1.2% (or 79 cents) to $64.73 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Apr 9.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 2.1 million barrels for the week ending Jun 1, following a decrease of 3.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.3 million barrels.Soaring imports and record high domestic production led to the shock build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as refiner demand hit a five-month high.In particular, U.S. output rose by 31,000 barrels per day last week to 10.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Despite last week’s increase, oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 41 of the last 61 weeks and are down more than 75 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 436.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – fell 955,000 barrels to 34.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26 days in the previous week to 25.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were up a third week in a row as demand weakened. The 4.6 million barrels gain – defying the polled number of 600,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 239 million barrels. Following last week’s addition, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product inched closer to the year-earlier level and it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 2.2 million barrels last week, significantly ahead of analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels increase in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 116.8 million barrels, current supplies are 22.7% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.5% from the prior week to 95.4%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

Meanwhile, Chevron’s Blind Faith platform in the Mississippi Canyon region and the Petronius platform in Viosca Knoll area witnessed stoppage of production.Notably, per EIA, 17% of the country’s daily oil output and 5% of natural gas production come from the Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, the region holds more than 45% of the country’s refining capacity. Although the refineries are not threatened directly by Alberto, floods can affect their operations.Flood watches are spread across Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi, where several refineries and terminals are located. Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) have refineries in Louisiana and are monitoring the storm.Local Measures Alberto is this year’s first named Atlantic storm.

450,PSX,"Launched on 09/21/2006, the Guggenheim Multi-Asset Income ETF (CVY  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares. It has amassed assets over $292.13 M, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. CVY seeks to match the performance of the Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index before fees and expenses.The Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index is comprised of approximately 125 to 150 stocks selected, based on a multi-factor proprietary model, from a universe of domestic and international companies, including U.S.-listed common stocks, ADRs paying dividends, REITs, MLPs, closed-end funds and traditional preferred stocks.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for CVY are 0.79%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.99%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.28% of the fund's total assets, followed by Valero Energy Corp (VLO  -  Free Report) and Bank Of America Corp (BAC L).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.39% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has gained about 0.49%, and is up roughly 11.87% in the last one year (as of 05/23/2018). CVY has traded between $20.64 and $23.39 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 12.72% for the trailing three-year period. With about 148 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

451,PSX,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal worth $23.3 billion to acquire its rival Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report), marking the biggest-ever deal by an oil refiner, in a bid to become the top independent refiner in the United States.  When the mega-acquisition deal will culminate, it is likely to give all the leading refiners a run for their money. The combined company is set to create the largest U.S. refiner in terms of refining capacity, surpassing Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) that currently holds the position. The new entity will also create a nationwide refining giant in terms of market capitalization, taking over the crown from Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report).Post the announcement of the deal, shares of Marathon Petroleum have declined 8% to close at $74.91 on Apr 30. It further slid almost 2.7% yesterday to close at $72.90. This reflects investors’ disappointment toward the pricey deal, considering that Marathon is paying a hefty premium for Andeavor’s shares. However, many analysts still find the premium reasonable, owing to the synergies associated with the deal and long-term opportunities it could provide.On the other hand, Andeavor’s share price rose more than 13% to close at $138.32 on Apr 30. However, shares have declined about 3.5% yesterday to stand at $133.48.Deal DetailsMarathon Petroleum has agreed to buy all the outstanding shares of Andeavor’s representing a total equity value of $23.3 billion. The deal also assumes Andeavor’s debt, thus pushing the total value of the transaction to $35.6 billion.Investors in Andeavor can choose to receive $152.27 per share in cash or 1.87 shares of Marathon Petroleum in exchange of their current shareholdings.Marathon’s bid represents 24% premium to Andeavor’s closing share price of $122.38 on Apr 27, thus valuing Andeavor at $152.27 a share.The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both the companies. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, along with shareholders’ consent and other regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure in the second quarter of 2018.Post the culmination of the deal, Marathon will own 66% stake in the combined entity, while Andeavor will hold the remaining 34% interest.Deal MotiveMarathon Petroleum’s operations are focused on the Gulf Coast and Midwest while Andeavor’s refinery activities are mainly concentrated in California, the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest. The complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal.The buyout will integrate the premier assets of both the companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the region. The deal will enable the companies to pool their expertise and share their best practices, thereby enhancing buying power in securing services in the region.The deal comes at an opportune time as the U.S. refiners are set to benefit from the record U.S. shale output. The combined entity also looks well positioned to capitalize from regulations to lower pollution levels from ships. Andeavor’s port assets in California along with Marathon Petroleum’s facilities in the U.S. Gulf Coast will allow the new entity to sell lower-sulfur ship fuel.Deal BenefitsThe deal expands the geographical footprint of Marathon Petroleum in attractive markets, expanding its foothold in the Permian Basin, thereby creating an enviable retail and marketing portfolio. The combined entity will have a processing capacity of more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) at 16 refineries spread across the country, selling fuel via 7,800 branded filling stations. The deal makes the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Additionally, the strategic acquisition is expected to lead to significant commercial, financial and operational synergies, due to the integration of asset, systems and staff. The agreement is expected to result in operational synergies of around $1 billion within the first three years. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to Marathon Petroleum’s earnings and cash flows. Based on the forecasted cash-flow generation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has also approved share buybacks of $5 billion.

453,PSX,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Phillips 66 is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PSX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 90 cents per share for PSX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents per share.

454,PSX,"The Scott Pruitt-led Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is facing a backlash from farm groups and ethanol organizations after reports emerged that it granted RIN obligation waiver – typically reserved for smaller refineries – to a large downstream operator.What Are RINs?It all started in 2005 when the Congress passed the 'Energy Policy Act' to reduce America's dependence on imports, lower greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the country's energy security. The legislation, among other provisions, created a Renewable Fuel Standard (or RFS) requiring the mixing of renewable fuels (like corn ethanol or other biofuels) into gasoline and diesel.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (or EPA) calls for a blending target known as the Renewable Volume Obligation (or RVO). For example, in 2010, EPA proposed that 12.9 billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels be blended into gasoline and diesel. By 2017, the amount had jumped to 18.8 billion gallons and the RVO requirement for 2018 is 19.3 billion gallons.Apart from its efforts to force the use of ethanol in the domestic gasoline mix – the percentage of which has gone up from around 3% in 2005 to roughly 10% now – Congress instructed the EPA to develop a system of electronically tracking numbers that could allow the agency to check whether the assigned blending requirements were being met by the concerned parties.These 38-character tracking numbers or tradable certificates (sometimes referred to as ‘credits’) are known as RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers). Each physical gallon of renewable fuel produced/imported is assigned a RIN that follows the fuel’s journey to a blender. Post blending, RINs are separated from the blended gallons of petroleum-based fuels, and they are used as proof by obligated parties that they have complied with the federal program.A Burden on Smaller OperatorsInterestingly, the so-called RFS point-of-obligation are not the actual parties engaged in blending gasoline with ethanol or other biofuels, but refineries and gasoline-diesel importers. That means, all oil refiners – big and small – are required to shoulder the burden for mixing ethanol into gasoline, even if they do not possess the blending terminals to do so.For most of the smaller players, investing in a new ethanol blending and distribution infrastructure is not financially viable. So, the only option for them is to buy RIN credits that they require to meet the RFS standard. Most independent refiners have to purchase them from integrated majors and biofuel producers who sell their excess credits.EPA’s ‘Secret’ Exemption to Refining Giant Andeavor CriticizedPer recent media reports, the EPA granted an RFS obligation exemption for 25 oil refineries last year. While the move to award so-called ‘hardship exemptions’ is not unusual, the amount is up significantly from the 12-15 handed out in a typical year. But more than the larger-than-usual number of hardship exemptions, what raised concern was the name of Andeavor’s (ANDV  -  Free Report) three units among the beneficiaries.Under the RFS provisions, smaller refineries (producing less than 75,000 barrels per day) may apply for waivers with the agency on grounds of ‘disproportionate economic hardship.’ However, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Andeavor – which generated $1.5 billion in profits last year – hardly fits the bill to receive an exemption from the country's biofuel regulations, feels industry observers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Agriculture Industry Up in ArmsThough the EPA refused to comment on the issue citing ‘confidential business information,’ the decision has angered several agriculture industry bodies who believe these waivers significantly lower the quantity of fuel to be mixed with ethanol, thereby effectively reducing the demand for biofuels in U.S. and adversely affecting domestic corn producers. Moreover, these ‘secret handouts’ basically lets the refiners get out of their obligations to blend ethanol fuels.Finally, the alleged exemption (intended for small, financially weak refiners) granted to a profitable energy giant like Andeavor has been condemned as being an unfair and illegal practice, apart from undermining the federal mandate.The agricultural groups have demanded the EPA immediately stop issuing waivers and halt reviewing any such applications that are under consideration, pending a transparent public debate.  RIN Prices TumbleThe facilities of independent refiners can process just petroleum products and not ethanol. Consequently, these entities have to either buy or build special ethanol blending terminals or purchase RINs to comply with the RFS.Originally sold for a few cents a gallon under EPA supervision, the ethanol RIN price soared to $1.50 per gallon in 2013 as an unregulated trading market emerged. Subsequently, it fell below 25 cents only to top $1-a-gallon recently. This translates into an additional operating cost of $3-4/barrel of crude processed for refiners.Now, the EPA’s decision to exempt dozens of refiners from RFS compliance has given rise to expectations about more such waivers and significant reduction in ethanol demand. This sent RIN biofuel credit prices tumbling to around 30 cents, the lowest since September 2015.In particular, the bailout of Andeavor has raised hopes that the scheme might be (or had already been) extended to large integrated energy conglomerates like Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), as well as big independent refiners like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report).   Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

455,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise weekly decline even as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. Following the data sets, front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 0.2% (or 14 cents) to end at $63.37 per barrel yesterday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Mar 30, following an increase of 1.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some one million barrels.Higher refinery runs and lower imports led to the surprise draw build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production reached a new record.In particular, U.S. output rose by 27,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.5 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 37 of the last 52 weeks and are down more than 108 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 425.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20.6% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 3.7 million barrels to 34.9 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26.1 days in the previous week to 25.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 33.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their fifth weekly decrease in a row as production slipped. The 1.1 million barrels drawn – below the polled number of 1.9 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 238.5 million barrels. Following last week’s decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) edged up 537,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels decrease in supply level. The small weekly rise could be attributed to higher production and weak demand. At 129.5 million barrels, current supplies are 15% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.7% from the prior week to 93%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Concho Resources Inc.

456,PSX,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 0.6% in January after decreasing 1.2% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in January averaged 1,175,638 barrels a day, down 7,198 barrels a day from December.With crude, natural gas output came down, too – from December’s 2,084,925 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,068,244 thousand cubic feet per day. Meanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,313 at the end of January, unchanged from the previous month.While the slight drop in oil activity – primarily attributed to winter weather – is the second month-over-month production decrease in a row, the decline was much smaller than anticipated. Moreover, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the twelfth month.Therefore, notwithstanding the temporary blip, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation.Rig Count Pushes HigherSome 56 drilling rigs were active in the state in January, up four from the December average. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 38 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production.Though the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling, one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well. In other words, modern rigs have helped boost the per-unit output.$60 Is the New $80 for Shale IndustryMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.What Lies Ahead?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit a more than three-year high of around $66 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline: Safe and Reliable Method for Transporting OilApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June 2017.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to little over 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report),  and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.In fact, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime by mid-2018, eventually hitting 1.3 million barrels by the end of the year.Want to Own a North Dakota Play Now?If you are looking for a near term North Dakota play, Continental Resources may be a good selection.

457,PSX,"The Dow traversed a difficult week, declining over three consecutive trading sessions. Investors remained concerned over the prospects of a trade war following President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s decision to dismiss Secretary of State Rex Tillerson added to investors’ jitters. Ultimately, investors looking to pick up blue chip stocks on the dip helped the index finish in the green on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 1.8% on last Friday, moving past the 25,000 mark for the first time since Feb 28. Upbeat jobs data and lower wage growth subdued inflationary concerns and curbed rate hike fears. The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000 job additions. However, average hourly wages rose only 0.1% in February, lower than January’s 0.3% increase.The index gained 3.3% last week. President Trump signed his tariff plan into law per which fresh levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports will be imposed. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the NAFTA with the two countries. Also, the United States wants to discuss national security issues with both these countries.The Dow This WeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday. Investors remained concerned about the prospects of a trade war following Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets.Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.The index lost 0.6% on Tuesday after the Trump administration dismissed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Additionally, Trump ordered Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) to abandon the planned takeover of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), following which shares of Qualcomm declined and weighed on the broader markets.Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February, in line with the consensus estimate. This figure was lower than January’s increase of 0.5%. This development significantly reduced rate hike fears.The index decreased 1% on Wednesday, ending in the red for the third consecutive trading day following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5%, weighing on the Dow, which registered a one-day decline of around 250 points. Shares of 3M declined 1.4%.The index rebounded on Thursday, increasing 0.5%. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents. This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment.However, the Dow managed to post a one-day rise of around 116 points, after investors indulged in bargain hunting, seeking out blue-chip stocks on the dip. Dow component UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) increased 1.8% and was the biggest contributor to the blue-chip index’s gains on the day.Components Moving the Index Apple Inc.

461,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a big weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high.Middle East Tensions Overshadow EIA DataHowever, oil traders chose to overlook bearish trends from the EIA data set and were more concerned about the uncertainty surrounding mounting tensions in the Middle East and the resultant fears of supplies being disrupted. The commodity settled at a three-year high of $66.82 per barrel yesterday after President Trump hinted at the possibility of a military strike against Syria, and Saudi Arabia claimed to have intercepted missiles fired by Yemeni rebels.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 3.3 million barrels for the week ending Apr 6, following a decrease of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 100,000 barrels.Record-high domestic production and surging imports led to the larger-than-expected build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as refiner demand strengthened.In particular, U.S. output rose by 65,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.5 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.While oil inventories rose last week, stockpiles have actually shrunk in 37 of the last 53 weeks and are down nearly 105 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 428.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.1 million barrels to 36 million barrels.At 25.4 days, the crude supply cover was unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 32.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their first increase in six weeks as production edged up. The 458,000 barrels build – contrary to the polled number of 2 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 238.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s rise, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 1 million barrels last week, slightly lower than analysts’ expectations for 1.2 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to higher demand. At 128.5 million barrels, current supplies are 15% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.5% from the prior week to 93.5%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Concho Resources Inc.

464,PSX,"Oil major ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently announced the mechanical completion of its new 1.5 million ton a year ethane cracker at its Baytown, TX complex. Production at the site is expected to commence in the April-June period of 2018. The commissioning process of the facility has also been initiated. What Does the New Facility Hold in Store?Regional Benefits: ExxonMobil started the construction of the ethane cracker in 2014, which generated at least 10,000 construction jobs in the locality along with 4,000 associated jobs. It is expected to add 350 new permanent jobs after coming online. Notably, the project is expected to contribute $90 million a year to local tax revenues when it becomes operational. The company expects to inject $870 million per year in local economic activities. The project is in line with the company’s $20 billion Growing the Gulf initiative, which spans 10 years.Per John Verity, the president of ExxonMobil Chemical Company, “Our new ethane cracker will allow us to economically meet rapidly growing demand for high-performance polyethylene products around the world while continuing to sustain economic development and create jobs for decades to come.”Benefits for the Company: The new multibillion-dollar development is expected to ramp up ExxonMobil's ethylene capacity by 1.5 million tons per year. The project signifies one of the largest U.S. Gulf Coast investments made by the company. The facility is expected to benefit the company's export initiatives and improve its global competitiveness.

465,PSX,"Friday, February 2, 2018Happy Groundhog Day! As we see on the first Friday of almost every month, new non-farm payrolls from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have been released before the opening bell. This comes in conjunction with tonnage of new Q4 earnings reports both after yesterday’s market close and before today’s open. The headline was better than expected, but not a huge surprise: 200K new jobs created in January, with an Unemployment Rate remaining steady at 4.1%.While this 200K number is higher than the analyst consensus of roughly 180K (analyst for months have been expecting 180K new jobs), it is below the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report released Wednesday morning, which showed 234K new jobs in just the private sector alone. Typically, however, while the ADP and BLS numbers do tend to align with future revisions, initially they are often far apart from one another.Pre-market trading, which had been deep in the red ahead of the BLS announcement, clawed back to around -180 points on the Dow, only to plummet back to around -225 points following the news. Since that time, in the last 15 minutes or so, markets have again worked to climb out of its early hole. Meanwhile, the 10-year t-bill races up past 2.8% following the release of the jobs data.Not that there is anything to particularly grieve in today’s jobs report: Construction posted the biggest improvement of any sector compared to a year ago, at 36K new jobs. And the U-6 (aka “real unemployment”) fell to 8.2%, the lowest we’ve seen in quite some time. Otherwise, these figures came in much as expected, aside from the predicted 4.1% unemployment rate, Average Hourly Earnings was again a positive, if tepid, +0.3% (2.9% year over year) and a consistent Labor Force Participation Rate of 62.7%.Finally, December’s BLS totals were revised upward, from 148K to 160K. This is slightly offset by November’s revision, to 216K from the 252K originally announced.Q4 Earnings RoundupFollowing yesterday afternoon’s modest beat from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) biggest profit in history and Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) earnings miss on tax adjustment, before today’s bell bring another full load of earnings reports:ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) missed both top- and bottom-line estimates, bringing in 88 cents per share ($1.04 for the Zacks consensus) on $66.5 billion in revenues ($74.4 billion expected).

The company’s shares have returned 10.4% compared with the industry’s 14.9% rally. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Phillips 66 is likely to beat on earnings this time because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%.

468,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved up 1.8% (or $1.14) to end at $65.61 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since December 2014.But the positive effect from the record tenth straight crude inventory withdrawal was partly offset by builds in gasoline and distillate supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production revisited its rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.1 million barrels for the week ending Jan 19, following a decrease of 6.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.6 million barrels.An uptick in exports led to the stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. However, the withdrawal failed to match expectations as U.S. output edged up 128,000 barrels per day last week to 9.9 million barrels per day – tantalizingly close to the all-time record of just over 10 million barrels per day set in 1970.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 122 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 3.2 million barrels to three-year lows of 39.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 23.9 days in the previous week to 24.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the eleventh straight week on the strength of imports. The 3.1 million barrels addition – more than the polled number of 2.1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 244 million barrels.

The company launched feedstock and started operations at the new cracker, which was primarily scheduled to come online during the 2017-end.Per the company, the new facility, one of the most energy efficient crackers, has a production capacity of 1.5 million metric tons per annum. The new ethane cracker's construction was started in 2014 and its completion marks the finishing of the final phase of the company’s $6 billion U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project. The facility is expected to increase the company’s U.S. ethylene and polyethylene production capacity by 40%.The facility is expected to benefit the company with its ethylene and polyethylene production, which is currently facing a rising global demand. The ethylene will be used to produce goods like containers, pipes, films and others. The company's high-quality products will reach its clients in the United States and rest of the world.The increased natural gas production in the United States, which primarily originated from shale basins, is expected to support the new facility by churning out plentiful ethane at low cost. Moreover, the produced ethylene from the new facility will also support the company’s derivative units' output. The units include the company's Old Ocean facility near Sweeny, where two new polyethylene units began operations in last September.The new facility from Chevron Phillips Chemical started ahead of ExxonMobil Corporation’s (XOM  -  Free Report) under-construction ethane cracker in Baytown.

471,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a massive weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. However, product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply, which offset the bearish impact of the crude oil inventory increase.The front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended at $61.19 per barrel yesterday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 5 million barrels for the week ending Mar 9, following an increase of 2.4 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.5 million barrels.Record high domestic production led to the massive stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as imports fell and refiner demand strengthened.In particular, U.S. output rose by 12,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.4 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.While oil inventories rose for a third successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 49 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 430.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18.4% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 338,000 barrels to 28.5 million barrels. It is the first time in 12 weeks that Cushing inventories have increased after dropping to the lowest level since December 2014.The crude supply cover was up from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 34.1 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their second weekly decrease in a row as demand strengthened. The 6.3 million barrels draw – significantly above the polled number of 500,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 244.8 million barrels. Following last week’s hefty decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 4.4 million barrels last week, comfortably exceeding analysts’ expectations for 1.6 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to lower production and imports. At 133.1 million barrels, current supplies are 15.4% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 2% from the prior week to 90%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

472,PSX,"Happy Groundhog Day! As we see on the first Friday of almost every month, new non-farm payrolls from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have been released before the opening bell. This comes in conjunction with tonnage of new Q4 earnings reports both after yesterday’s market close and before today’s open. The headline was better than expected, but not a huge surprise: 200K new jobs created in January, with an Unemployment Rate remaining steady at 4.1%.While this 200K number is higher than the analyst consensus of roughly 180K (analyst for months have been expecting 180K new jobs), it is below the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report released Wednesday morning, which showed 234K new jobs in just the private sector alone. Typically, however, while the ADP and BLS numbers do tend to align with future revisions, initially they are often far apart from one another.Pre-market trading, which had been deep in the red ahead of the BLS announcement, clawed back to around -180 points on the Dow, only to plummet back to around -225 points following the news. Since that time, in the last 15 minutes or so, markets have again worked to climb out of its early hole. Meanwhile, the 10-year t-bill races up past 2.8% following the release of the jobs data.Not that there is anything to particularly grieve in today’s jobs report: Construction posted the biggest improvement of any sector compared to a year ago, at 36K new jobs. And the U-6 (aka “real unemployment”) fell to 8.2%, the lowest we’ve seen in quite some time. Otherwise, these figures came in much as expected, aside from the predicted 4.1% unemployment rate, Average Hourly Earnings was again a positive, if tepid, +0.3% (2.9% year over year) and a consistent Labor Force Participation Rate of 62.7%.Finally, December’s BLS totals were revised upward, from 148K to 160K. This is slightly offset by November’s revision, to 216K from the 252K originally announced.Q4 Earnings RoundupFollowing yesterday afternoon’s modest beat from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) biggest profit in history and Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) earnings miss on tax adjustment, before today’s bell bring another full load of earnings reports:ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) missed both top- and bottom-line estimates, bringing in 88 cents per share ($1.04 for the Zacks consensus) on $66.5 billion in revenues ($74.4 billion expected).

474,PSX,"The third-quarter earnings cycle is in full swing, wherein 164 S&P 500 members have reported their numbers. This accounts for 38.2% of the index’s total market capitalization. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 7% from the same period last year on 4.8% higher revenues, with 72% companies delivering positive earnings surprises and 68.3% beating revenue estimates.We would like to remind investors that the Oil/Energy sector made a comeback in fourth-quarter 2016 after a prolonged period of weakness. The improvement in the sector’s performance drove the aggregate growth for the S&P 500 Index. In fact, the most important feature of this earnings season seems to be the positive revenue momentum, in terms of  growth as well as beats.Third-quarter earnings growth seems dismal compared with the prior two quarters. However, the growth rate is expected to improve, as evident from the current upbeat projection of 8.95% growth for fourth-quarter earnings. The energy sector is poised to see the strongest growth in the quarter under review.True to the predictions, the sector came out quite a winner. So far, for the sector components enlisted on the S&P 500 Index, total Q3 earnings grew 253.9% on 33.5% higher revenues.Importantly, oil and gas prices during third-quarter supported the growth. Prices of oil at the end of the quarter improved, amid persistent decline in domestic inventories and improvement of supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil price at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices were around $45 per barrel.Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu on Sep 30, 2016.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Oct 27ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest publicly traded oil company.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings of 78 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. The quarterly earnings, however, increased from 41 cents recorded a year ago. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.94%.  Our proven model shows that ExxonMobil is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

476,PSX,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices turned lower.On the news front, U.S. supermajor Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) started production at its giant Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia, while energy pipeline and logistics provider Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) announced a new $3 billion stock repurchase program.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 4.6% to close at $49.29 per barrel, while natural gas prices declined 4.8% to $2.863 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: XOM Loses #1 Energy Spot, CVX Names New CEO.)The U.S. oil benchmark registered its first decline in five weeks on renewed oversupply concerns. Market observers fretted over soaring U.S. exports that rose to a record – of nearly 2 million barrels per day – in the wake of widening Brent premium to WTI.A discount in U.S. oil prices to the global benchmark Brent (or a larger spread) makes domestic crude attractive in overseas markets. Worryingly, higher exports are expected to encourage shale players to ramp up production, which is already at its highest level since July 2015.The news of production resumption at Libya’s largest oil field and slipping compliance to OPEC’s output cut deal further dented the commodity.Meanwhile, natural gas futures finished lower despite a smaller-than-expected increase in supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production, led to the nearly 5% drop in prices.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy behemoth Chevron recently commenced production at its Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia. This is a major milestone for the company as the first cargo is on track to set sail in the coming weeks. Chevron is the chief operator of the Wheatstone project owning a 64.14% stake.The project is located 7.5 miles west of Onslow and is to process gas from Wheatstone and Iago fields, both of which are operated by Chevron. The company holds an 80.2 % interest in the offshore licenses containing the Wheatstone and Iago fields. The Wheatstone fields are estimated to contain over 4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas deposits.The Wheatstone project consists of two liquefaction trains with a shipment capacity of 8.9 million metric tons per year of LNG. While the first liquefaction train has already started production, the second one is expected to become operational in another six months. The project provides Chevron and its partners an opportunity to serve the fast-growing economies of China and India along with other Asian countries.

Since the third quarter of 2012, the company’s total authorization for share repurchases has increased to $12 billion.Phillips 66’s board of directors has also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 70 cents per common stock. The dividend is payable on Dec 1, 2017 to its shareholders of record as of the close of business on Nov 17, 2017.These announcements are in sync with the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s strategy to enhance shareholder value. Phillips 66 has increased quarterly dividend rate seven times.Since 2012, it has returned over $15 billion to its shareholders in the form of dividends, share repurchases and share exchanges.

Shell had signed the deal in January. Per the deal, KUFPEC — a subsidiary of Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. — was to acquire two subsidiaries of Shell.The deal was set for closure by the end of the first quarter of 2017, subject to satisfactory conditions. However, the deal was called off as Shell and Thailand’s government could not come to terms regarding matters of share sales within the stipulated time.The divestment was part of the company’s move to lower debt, arising from the $50 billion mega-acquisition of BG Group. It was part of its portfolio optimization strategy and the $30 billion global divestment program for 2016-2018. However, with Shell already closing more than $25 billion divestment deals, it remains on track to meet its target by 2018.Notably, Thailand represents a promising part of Shell’s world class portfolio.

Turbot-1 well represents the fifth oil discovery in the region.On Aug 14, ExxonMobil’s affiliate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Ltd started drilling the Turbot-1 well. The company discovered a reservoir of 75 feet (23 meters) of superior, oil-bearing sandstone in the main objective. On Sept 29, the well was drilled to reach a depth of 18,445 feet (5,622 meters) in 5,912 feet (1,802 meters) of water.Located in the southeastern portion of the Stabroek Block, the Turbot-1 well is located about 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the southeast of the Liza phase one project. In fact, ExxonMobil’s Stabroek Block spans across acreage of 6.6 million (26,800 square kilometers). While the company holds 45% in the Stabroek Block, the other partners include Hess Corporation and CNOOC Ltd. holding 30% and 25% interest, respectively.Markedly, ExxonMobil’s presence in Guyana dates back to 2008 when it initiated oil and gas exploration activities. The company, however, drilled its first exploration in 2015.

477,PSX,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output rose 0.9% in November after climbing 6.9% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (""DMR"") latest data said that oil production in November averaged 1,194,920 barrels a day, up 11,110 barrels a day from October.Record Number of Producing WellsReflecting a healthy increase, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. As daily output consolidated above 1 million barrels for the tenth month in a row, the state’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,324 at the end of November, a new all-time high.Interestingly, natural gas output was up 1.4% in November to 2,095,342 thousand cubic feet per day – another record – as operators scrambled to the core areas of the Bakken where wells tend to produce more gas along with crude.Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 54 drilling rigs were active in the state in November. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 37 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the year-over-year improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates essentially steady drilling activities and production. However, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling.Shale Industry Adjusting to ‘Low’ OilMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.What Lies Ahead?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark hit a more than three-year high of $65.61 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of a bull run in the near future.In this context, the improvement in North Dakota’s November production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline Set to Increase Production FurtherApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report),  and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.With the latest monthly production attaining highest levels since July 2015, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime in the first half of 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

478,PSX,"Toward the end of 2017, we saw partial recovery in oil prices. Solid demand growth, declining inventories and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 is keeping the market steady and supporting strong uptrend.While there might be a number of winners within the energy sector, refiners have stood out amid weakness in the commodity prices. Moreover, the overhaul of the nation’s tax code is expected to benefit the refiners. With the implementation of the law, the corporate income tax will be lowered from 35% to 21%, which will benefit the refiners.This is because unlike crude producers and equipment makers who have been victims of stubborn low oil price environment and struggled to generate positive cash flows, refiners have been among the handful of energy sub industries displaying strength during the shaky period.The business of downstream players is negatively correlated with crude prices. This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline, the prime transportation fuel in the United States. Hence, lower the oil price, higher will be their profits. Therefore, the income from converting crude into gasoline and diesel — also known as refining margin or crack spread — has been going up over the past few quarters.Consequently, these companies — having generated positive income before taxes — are in a much better shape to take advantage of the current situation. Consequently, shares of the major downstream operators have been rising lately.    In this context, we put the spotlight on two of the refining players — Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) — with market caps of $50.92 billion and $38.28 billion, respectively. Since both stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it will be interesting to see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Valero Beats on the BoursesOver the past year, Valero surpassed the industry’s gain of 22.6% as well as S&P 500 index’s rally of 21.3%. Moreover, Valero’s rise of 40.4% has outshined Phillips 66’s returns of 20.3%.ValuationPhillips 66 and Valero have P/E ratios of 29.4 and 20.3, respectively. Clearly, Valero is the cheaper proposition. Notably, while Valero is underpriced, Phillips 66 is overpriced compared with the industry’s P/E ratio of 25.4.LiquidityThe liquidity of a company is determined through quick ratio which is a more stringent test to measure the capability of a company to pay both short- and long-term obligations.Valero has a better liquidity than the industry’s level of 1.02 and that of Phillips 66’s 0.86. Valero’s quick ratio of 1.24 puts it in a more comfortable position to meet short-term obligations.Return on Capital (ROC)Coming to Phillips 66 and Valero, ROC for the trailing 12-months is 5.4% and 7.1%, respectively, which are above the sector’s level of 5.3%.Last Quarter Performance & ProjectionsPhillips 66 delivered impressive results in third-quarter 2017 wherein adjusted earnings per share not only surged 58.1% year over year to $1.66 but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. Phillips 66 expects year-over year earnings growth of 60.28% and 39.39% in 2017 and 2018, respectively.Valero’s third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings surged over54% year over year to $1.91 per share, also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83. Valero expects year-over year growth of 34.41% and 29.68% in its earnings in 2017 and 2018, respectively.In terms of long-term growth expectations, Phillips 66 scores above Valero. The expected growth rate for Phillips 66 for the next 3-5 years is 10.00% compared with an expected growth of 9.86% for Valero.Earnings Surprise HistoryConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Phillips 66 seems to be a clear winner. Phillips 66 delivered average positive earnings surprise of 429.3% in the trailing four quarters. However, the Valero reported average negative earnings surprise of 10.3% in the same period.Dividend YieldIna year, the dividend yield for both Valero and Phillips 66 has been higher than the broader sector. While the sector depicted yield of 2.6%, Valero returned almost 3%. Phillips 66 has a dividend yield of 2.7%.Cash Flow From OperationsOver the last nine months, Phillips 66 reported a sharp year-over-year decline in cash flow from operating activities, which is a key metric to gauge the financial health of the firms. Valero’s figure was unchanged. Valero generated enough cash to fund capital payment.Phillips 66 generated operating cash flow of $1717 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared with $2296 million reported in the corresponding period of 2016. Valero generated cash flow from operations of $3822 million, unchanged from the corresponding period of 2016.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Valero has an edge over Phillips 66 considering price performance, valuation, liquidity, dividend yield.  Phillips 66 scores on long-term projections and earnings surprise history. On overall comparison, the scale is slightly tilted in favor of Valero.However, we prefer to be on the sidelines and ask investors to hold the stocks for now, reflected by the companies’ Zacks Rank.A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Statoil ASA  and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report).

480,PSX,"Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) has released capital budget of an estimated $2.3 billion for 2018, up 15% from 2017 capex of $2 billion. Of this, $1.4 billion will be allocated to growth capital and the remaining $0.9 billion will be for sustaining capital.Phillips 66 has apportioned $1.2 billion toward the Midstream segment, of which $1 billion is for growth capital and $218 million is for sustaining capital. The company will allocate growth capital for natural gas liquids and transportation businesses.  The development projects are also integrated with current assets and infrastructure. This includes the expansion of the Beaumont Terminal that is underway, expansion of the Gulf Coast fractionation plant capacity and investment in pipelines and other terminals.In the Midstream segment, budgeted spending of $595 million will be directed towards Phillips 66 Partners. The partnership would spend $510 on growth capital. Organic projects, such as expansion of the Sand Hills Pipeline, completion of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline eastern segment, and an isomerization unit at the Phillips 66 Lake Charles Refinery will be supported by the partnership under the capital.The company plans to invest $827 million in the Refining segment, with $541 million going to consistency, security and environmental projects. Refining growth capital of $286 million is for small, high return, rapid payout projects to boost clean product yields. Such projects consist of conclusion of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit modernization at the Bayway Refinery and FCC optimization at the Sweeny Refinery.Phillips 66 has allocated $140 million of the total capital spending to Marketing and Specialties. The company will invest $75 million for growth projects with emphasis on enhancing retail sites in Europe.The company intends to fund $116 million in Corporate and Other projects, related to information technology and facilities.Phillips 66’s proportionate share of capital spending by joint ventures — Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream) and WRB Refining LP (WRB) — is estimated at $946 million. Including these equity associates, the company’s total 2018 capital program is projected at $3.2 billion.Phillips 66’s share of CPChem’s 2018 capital expenditures is anticipated at $398 million, down about 45% from 2017. The decline is due to the conclusion of the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. The new polyethylene units, part of this project, were commissioned during the third quarter of 2017, while the ethane cracker at the Cedar Bayou facility is expected to be brought online in first-quarter 2018.Phillips 66’s expected share of DCP Midstream’s 2018 capital spending is $405 million, with $350 million targeted toward growth projects including the Sand Hills Pipeline expansion and two DJ Basin gas processing plants.The company’s allocation toward WRB’s capital expenditures is projected at $143 million. The projects to be funded include completion of the Wood River Refinery FCC unit to boost clean product yield. Capital spending by these three major joint ventures is likely to be self-funded.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 16.8% compared with the industry’s rally of 18.1% in the last three months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksPhillips 66 currently carries a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold).

481,PSX,"Things can change very quickly in the oil market.Just a few months ago, or until September, the commodity had a very difficult year when the broader market was hitting all-time highs. In June, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell to nearly $42 a barrel -- the lowest in ten months. Since then, the contract has risen about 37%. In fact, WTI hit a more than two-year high of around $59 recently.Unlike other short-lived rallies over the past three years, we believe the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals. Solid demand growth, declining inventories and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 is helping to balance the market and support the strong uptrend.Add to this support from the pro-energy tax reform bill and the industry has not been this bullish in more than two years.Senate Passes Tax Bill: Energy Sector to BenefitIn the early hours of Dec 2, the Senate approved the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades by a 51-49 vote.With the Senate clearing its version of the tax reform bill, President Donald Trump has secured his first major legislative win after more than 10 months in office. We note that the House had passed its version of the tax bill in mid-November. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package is expected to be enacted into law by year-end, following resolution of the differences in the two versions.The plan’s proposal to reduce the corporate income tax rate – from 35% to 20% – have been generally welcomed by corporate America, and justifiably so. The top U.S. corporate rate is 35% but it balloons to an average of almost 39% when local taxes are included -  higher than most large developed countries.The domestic oil and gas industry is one of the many beneficiaries of the sweeping tax reform.In particular, cutting the corporate tax rate and changes to cost-recovery allowances are expected to aid the energy industry to keep on ploughing back billions of dollars in the domestic economy, apart from creating new jobs to go with the 10 million the sector already employs.  Digging into the DetailsEnergy companies invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) has announced a $22 billion capital plan this year, while Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) has set its capital spending budget for 2017 at around $20 billion.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors the oil industry and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Refiners Likely to Benefit the MostWhile there might be a number of winners within the energy sector itself, refiners seem to be the standout gainers from the overhaul of the nation’s tax code. Should the plan go through and corporate income tax lowered from 35% to 20%, refiners are likely to experience a jump in their potential earnings.This is because unlike crude producers and equipment makers who have been victims of the sustained period of stubborn low oil price environment and struggled to generate positive cash flows, refiners have been among the handful of energy subindustries that showed strength during the shaky period.The business of the downstream players is negatively correlated with crude prices. This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline, the prime transportation fuel in the U.S. Hence, lower the oil price, higher will be their profits. Therefore, the income from converting crude into gasoline and diesel – also known as refining margin or crack spread – has been going up over the past few quarters.Consequently, these companies – having generated positive income before taxes – are in a much better shape to take advantage of the lower corporate tax burden. Consequently, shares of the major downstream operators surged on Dec 4.    With the S&P 500 refining stock index climbing to its highest since at least 1996, it was no surprise that most participants had a field day. In fact, stocks like Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) PBF Energy Inc. (PBF  -  Free Report) gained 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively, on the day. The bill, in its current form, would also benefit the likes of Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), the largest oil refiner by market capitalization and one boasting of a healthy realized margin.

482,PSX,"The U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") recently vowed to take legal action against protesters and activists who damage oil pipelines and other energy infrastructure. The verdict came in response to the letter sent by more than 80 U.S. representatives inquiring whether the activists who damaged energy infrastructure in October 2016 could be charged under the domestic terrorism law. The letter, which was sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is still under review.  In support of the question raised by the representatives, DOJ stated that the damage done by activists could disrupt services and consequently affect people’s lives. The damages can also burden taxpayers and even put lives at risk. The damaged pipelines can also hurt the environment. The DOJ’s decision can increase the persisting tension between climate activists and the administrative board.Although the DOJ’s legal actions will lead lawmakers to distinguish between lawful and unlawful protests, the department is yet to shed light on last year’s events where activists protested in four states. The protestors twisted shut valves on a few pipelines, which were responsible for crude oil imports from Canada. The Climate Direct Action group said that the action was in favor of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The tribe has been vocal about the Dakota Access Pipeline operated by Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP  -  Free Report), as it can cause damage to the tribe's burial ground and pollute its waters. The controversial pipeline has witnessed protests since the time it of its planning. Energy Transfer started construction of the pipeline in June 2016 with oil and gas companies like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) as minor partners. There are cases where activists have been recognized and penalized for their actions. A protestor was sentenced for 32 days for illegally tampering with a Kinder Morgan (KMI  -  Free Report) pipeline in Washington. The construction of the Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline by Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report) through Lancaster County also faced protests. Recently, five protesters were arrested in Martic Township for creating obstacles at the construction site.What Lies Ahead?Instances of damage to energy infrastructure are expected to go down following the decision taken by the DOJ. The actions will also assure oil and gas companies of the safety of their assets. However, the decision may ignite another controversy regarding protests against climate changes.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

483,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected weekly build. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories increased slightly from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall.Meanwhile, refinery activity improved. However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 0.7% (or 37 cents) to $55.33 per barrel Wednesday – the lowest settlement since Nov 2. The commodity fell further yesterday, finishing at $55.14 (down 19 cents or 0.3%).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories increased by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Nov 10, following a rise of 2.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some one million barrels.Record high domestic production and higher imports led to the surprise stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. In particular, U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day last week to more than 9.6 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.While oil inventories rose for a second successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 24 of the last 32 weeks and are down more than 75 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 459 million barrels, current crude supplies are 6.4% below the year-ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 1.5 million barrels to 63.1 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 28.7 days in the previous week to 28.3 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the first time in four weeks as demand weakened. The 894,000 barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 210.4 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 5.1% below the year-earlier level but is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 799,000 barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 2 million barrels decrease in supply level. The marginal weekly fall could be attributed to weakening demand. At 124.8 million barrels, current supplies are 16.2% below the year-ago level and are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.4% from the prior week to 91%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp.

484,PSX,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 8.San Antonio, TX-based downstream operator Andeavor — which counts Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) among its peers — posted a positive earnings surprise of 20.25% in the preceding quarter on significant contribution from the logistics and refining segments.  Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an impressive record. The company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 40.70%.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 for third-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 13.4% over the last 30 days. Further, the earnings estimates for the current year have also moved up by 3 cents at $6.82.These surging earnings estimate revisions signal promising prospects about Andeavor. Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise  Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise | Andeavor Quote Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model also shows that Andeavor is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Andeavor’s Earnings ESP is +6.38%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $3.25, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.    Zacks Rank: Valero currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Valero’s favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.Factors at PlayApart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018.Andeavor expects throughput level for the third quarter between 1,090 MBbl/d and 1,145 MBbl/d. This is higher than the 873 MBbl/d recorded in the year-ago quarter and 893 MBbl/d recorded in the prior quarter. With throughput set to be higher, we expect the company to report solid quarterly results.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $11,629 million for the third quarter, up 77.7% and 48.2% from the year-ago and prior quarter respectively.During the quarter, Andeavor strengthened its geographical foothold and began operations in Mexico with the opening of the first ARCO gas station in Tijuana. The development is likely to contribute to earnings and provide long-term growth opportunities.We also appreciate the company’s strong balance sheet with high liquidity and low leverage ratios.The positive factors are also reflected in the share price of Andeavor which rallied 10.2% during the quarter. Further, year-to-date, shares of the company have rose 26% compared the 7% gain recorded by the industry.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

485,PSX,"Before we attempt to get our arms around another deluge of earnings reports ahead of the final opening bell of this trading week, we get a first look at Q3 GDP: 3.0%, up from the consensus estimate of 2.7%, and a second consecutive 3-handle following Q2’s final read of 3.1%. This marks the first time since 2014 the U.S. economy had GDP numbers at or above 3% since 2014.Particularly noteworthy about this number is that we did see some negative impact on GDP in the quarter from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria — most notably in consumer spending, which had ratcheted down from 3.3% the previous quarter to 2.4% this time around. That Q3 GDP could take a 90-basis-point hit and still reach 3% illustrates economic strength beyond the power of the consumer.Inventories were up 0.7%, but this is normal coming as it does ahead of holiday season. Perhaps surprisingly, the federal government spent more in Q3. And maybe most importantly, as Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank pointed out last week, no major economies in the world are currently experiencing a recession. Growth is now global and synchronized; it is a very rare occurrence to see no geopolitical headwinds from the Americas to Europe to Asia-Pacific.Q3 Earnings Roll OnAside from big blowout beats after yesterday’s close from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) — which by themselves have already added an additional $80 billion to the market — we see more earnings tonnage, generally from oil & gas and pharma/bio sectors:ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) shares are up modestly in today’s pre-market following Q3 results that surpassed estimates on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of 93 cents per share topped the Zacks consensus by 4 cents, whereas revenues really outperformed expectations: $66.17 billion far exceeded the $63.51 billion we had been looking for. This marks the fourth beat out of the past five quarters for the largest oil & gas “supermajor,” and in an energy sector that has struggled in 2017, XOM looks to be improving.Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) also beat estimates for both earnings and sales this morning, with $1.03 per share surpassing the 98-cent consensus on revenues of $36.21 billion, ahead of the $34.06 expected. Outgoing CEO John Watson, who will retire early next year, cited continued improvement in both earnings and cash flow for the supermajor.Refining company Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) posted a mixed Q3 during today’s pre-market, with earnings of $1.66 per share beating the consensus estimate by 4 cents, though $26.2 billion in revenues fell short of our estimated $29.9 billion. The company’s Refining business more than tripled in the quarter, offset by underperformance quarter over quarter from Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing.Pharmaceuticals major Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) posted $1.11 per share, ahead of the $1.03 Zacks consensus estimate. However, quarterly sales of $10.33 billion was short of the $10.50 billion we had been expecting. That said, Merck upped its fiscal year earnings guidance from $3.76-3.88 per share last time around to $3.91-3.97 this morning. Following an initial bump up of 1% in the pre-market, shares are now trading down more than 2.5% ahead of the bell.Also, biopharma firm AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), which had branched off from Abbott Labs in 2013, beat earnings estimates by 2 cents to $1.41 per share, whereas revenues of $7 billion came in basically in-line with estimates. Lymphoma treatment Imbruvica rose 37.3% year over year, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira improved 14.8% from the year-ago quarter.

489,PSX,"Leading refining player Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before market opens.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Phillips 66 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 433.14%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.     Phillips 66 Price and EPS Surprise  Phillips 66 Price and EPS Surprise | Phillips 66 QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60 for the third quarter has seen one upward revision and one downward revision by firms in the last seven days. It reflects year-over-year growth of 52.4%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,994 million for the impending quarter, up 35.8% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Phillips 66 is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.43%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.64, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at $1.60. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Phillips 66 carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings. The combination of Phillip 66’s favorable Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Factors Likely to Influence EarningsThe company has plans to allocate money for more profitable business units like Midstream and Chemicals instead of extensive refining and marketing operations. Midstream business is in high demand in the central United States, due to increasing requirement for fresh pipeline and infrastructure properties in the flourishing shales. Moreover, improving petrochemical demand should call for more chemical business in the United States. Such decisions reflect the company’s efficiency, which would be reflected in current quarter’s operations.We appreciate the company’s decision to invest $1.3 billion out of the total 2017 capital budget of $2.3 billion in growth projects.However, the company’s free cash flow has been negative over the last two years, reflecting weak business operations. Hence, its ability to pay dividends is at risk. Since the beginning of 2012, there has been exponential increase in long-term debt, reflecting Phillips 66’s weak balance sheet.Q3 Stock Price PerformanceDuring the reporting quarter, pricing chart reveals that Phillips 66’s shares have outperformed the industry. During the aforesaid period, the company’s shares have returned 10.7% compared with the industry’s 10.5% increase.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to beat earnings this quarter.Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report), headquartered in Houston, TX, has diversified energy infrastructure properties.

490,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly as refinery throughput rose. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories rose from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall.The bullish impact from the surprise crude inventory draw was supported by other developments including strong Chinese data, mounting tensions between Iraq and Kurdistan near an oil-rich region, President Trump’s decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, and a falling U.S. rig count.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained around 4.4% for the week to settle at $51.45 per barrel Friday – the highest since Sep 29.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2.7 million barrels for the week ending Oct 6, following a decrease of 6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 400,000 barrels.Improving refinery crude runs amid higher utilization rates, together with lower domestic production, led to the big stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 462.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are 2.5% below the year-ago period. However, stocks are close to the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.3 million barrels to 63.8 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 30.3 days in the previous week to 29.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the third week running following the end of the peak driving season. The 2.5 million barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.4 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 221.4 million barrels. Despite increases over the past few weeks, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1.8% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 1.5 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 1.6 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to strengthening export demand and storm-induced outages. At 134 million barrels – the lowest since June 2015 – current supplies are 14.6% below the year-ago level and are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.1% from the prior week to 89.2%. While refinery runs have rebounded from storm-induced nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% -- the highest since 2005.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp.

491,PSX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large build, triggered by nine-year low refinery activity following last month’s Hurricane Harvey. Moreover, with almost a quarter of the nation’s fuel processing capacity shut down in the immediate aftermath of the catastrophe, product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply.While the data sets were neither overly optimistic or pessimistic fundamentally and much of what came out of the report was anyways expected, bullish commentary regarding world demand catapulted crude above $50 a barrel for the first time since Jul 31 yesterday.Eventually, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.2% (or 59 cents) to settle at $49.89 per barrel Thursday.Improving Supply-Demand NarrativeEnergy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year, helping to tighten the market significantly.Further, the Paris-based IEA said that the global oil supply had come down by 720,000 per day last month to 97.7 million barrels on outages and maintenance in non-OPEC countries.  Meanwhile, according to the OPEC’s latest monthly report, the oil cartel’s production fell by 79,000 barrels a day in August to 32.76 million as output dropped in Libya, Gabon, Venezuela and Iraq. This points to the success of the 14-member group’s output curb initiatives and rising compliance levels.Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and fellow exporters are said to be open to extending their production cut agreement beyond its March expiry.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 5.9 million barrels for the week ending Sep 8, following an increase of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 10.1 million barrels.Lower refinery throughput due to lingering Hurricane Harvey effects on Gulf Coast units, together with volume ramp-up from the production facilities shuttered in the wake of the storm, led to the big stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. Nevertheless, the build was significantly below forecasts.At 468.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are down 2.5% from the year-ago period but are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1 million barrels to 59.1 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 27.5 days in the previous week to 29.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were down for the second week running as Gulf Coast refineries continued to be sidelined by damage from Hurricane Harvey. The massive 8.4 million barrels draw – way above the polled number of 4 million barrels and the largest since at least 1990 – took gasoline stockpiles down to 218.3 million barrels. Following last week’s slide, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product has fallen 4.4% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 3.2 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 300,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The second successive weekly fall could be attributed to plunging production, which reached a seven-year low of 3,973 thousand barrels per day on storm-induced outages. At 144.6 million barrels, current supplies are 11.2% below the year-ago level but are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 2% from the prior week to 77.7%. – the lowest since 2008 – as the facilities continue to recover from the impact of Harvey.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report). Each of these firms has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Range Resources Corp. (RRC  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

492,PSX,"On September 11, the United Nations Security Council declared fresh sanctions against North Korea. It took only eight days after North Korea’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test for the UN to pass this resolution.The United States was initially demanding a complete oil embargo to fully paralyze the North Korean economy, but later softened its demands. The UN, meanwhile, ended up imposing restrictions on the rouge nation’s oil imports. The toughest-ever UN sanctions against North Korea also call for a complete ban on its import of natural gas liquids and condensates. Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said imposing restrictions on fuel and oil supplies will restrict North Korea from funding programs related to nuclear and missile tests. The aggressive step taken by the UN to partially paralyze the North Korean regime is indeed commendable. But tensions within North Korea may indirectly hurt global demand for crude.U.S. Seeks to Freeze China’s Oil Exports to North KoreaNorth Korea imports nearly all of its crude supplies from China. In fact, China meets 90% of North Korea’s oil demand, according to media resources. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), North Korea’s average daily crude import is roughly 10,000 barrels. These volumes are sent to the Ponghwa Chemical Factory, which is North Korea’s only oil refinery. So, if China stops exporting oil, the economy of North Korea may bear the brunt. And if refined fuels like gasoline and diesel become scarce, public transportation and logistics costs will significantly rise.UN Refrains From Complete Oil EmbargoThe UN has decided not to allow North Korea’s crude imports to exceed its last 12-month average, restricting the annual export of refined petroleum products to 2 million barrels. This is less than half the volumes — 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products — that the country imports annually, as per data provided by some U.S. officials. According to the U.S. estimate, these fresh sanctions will ensure that North Korea gets 56% less fuel from abroad.Moreover, import of natural gas liquids and condensates by North Korea has been totally banned.While producing natural gas, producers also get low density crud, which is referred to as condensates; natural gas also contains fuels like propane and butane in its raw state. With the total ban on natural gas imports, North Korea will not receive any substitute for refined petroleum products, supplies of which have now been capped.Textile Exports, Overseas Contracts Take a HitThe resolution also places a ban on North Korea’s textile exports. As per Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, North Korea’s textile industry generated the second-highest export revenues of $752 million, second only to coal, in 2016.Also, the UN will not allow the renewal of contracts for overseas North Korean workers. Investors should note that North Korea makes $500 million annually out of taxing salaries of roughly 93,000 laborers working abroad, according to Nikki Haley.In fact, Haley believes that all these measures may not even fully paralyze North Korea’s economy, but will just take the country several steps backward from funding its weapons program. As per the estimate provided by the U.S., the resolution will likely lead to a revenue loss of $1.3 billion for North Korea.Crude Prices to Fall, Gasoline Prices to BenefitA debate has ensued regarding North Korea’s possible retaliation to these sanctions. Several market watchers think Pyongyang is preparing a strong response for the U.S.. Overall, the energy sector will be severely affected if North Korean tensions result in conflicts with neighboring countries like China, Japan and South Korea.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, South China Sea is the route through which more than 33% of worldwide crude and 50% of global liquefied natural gas are transported every year. Hence, violence following military actions in and around North Korea may stop the flow of imported oil to South Korea, Japan, and China.According to energy consultancy group Wood Mackenzie, South Korea, Japan, and China are responsible for almost 34% of global trade for crude, transported by sea. Also, data provided by World’s Top Exports (WTEx), shows that China, Japan, and South Korea are among the top five oil importing countries in the world, accounting for almost 32% of worldwide crude import, with China being the largest oil importing nation. The total value of crude, imported by the three countries in 2016, was estimated at $211.2 billion by this independent education and research website.Hence, North Korean tensions will probably lower global crude demand to a great extent. Asia’s leading refining plants, accounting for 65% of the continent’s total refining capacity, are located in China, Japan, and South Korea, as per Wood Mackenzie. Therefore, any military action in North Korea might lead to significant reduction of oil demand by refiners. Either way, strong forces are working to push crude prices lower.  If the flow of imported crude is cut off, China, Japan, and South Korea will have to rely on their respective limited domestic crude reserves to carry out daily operations. As a result, there will be lower gasoline production by refiners. Scarcity of gasoline will likely flare up commodity prices.U.S. Oil Refiners to GainLower crude prices and higher gasoline prices will boost margins for U.S. refining players. This is because refiners buy raw crude to produce refined petroleum products like gasoline. The end products are then sold at fuel pump stations.This is why it is time for investors to focus on the refining industry. The Zacks Oil Refining industry is ranked #62 and lies in the top 24% of industries. This is a good industry rank, as the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

493,PSX,"The U.S. energy department has approved the issue of up to 4.5 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (“SPR”) to counter the disruption in the market caused by refinery outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast due to Harvey. The last time SPR approved such an emergency release was in 2012 following Hurricane Isaac.Part of the overall federal initiative to respond to those impacted by Harvey, the emergency step will ensure that refining units have the crude oil they require to continue operating. This was necessitated after Colonial Pipeline – the country’s biggest gasoline mover – was closed down. The important pipeline is responsible for carrying gasoline between Houston and the East Coast.About SPR  The reserve was developed following the energy restrictions imposed by Arab nations in 1973 after the Yom Kippur War. This resulted in fuel supply panic and compelled the government to create an emergency reserve. The reserve has more than 700 million barrels of oil capacity and can meet domestic demand for more than a month. A network of tanks and deep underground storage caverns were used to create the reserve.The Beneficiaries The Trump administration has sanctioned three million barrels for Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), while Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) will receive 500,000 barrels of oil per day. Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Marathon Petroleum has resumed operations in its Galveston Bay refinery. Corpus Christi and Three Rivers refineries owned by Valero are now operational at half capacity. Per Bloomberg, the reserve will be delivered to the refineries from the Bayou Choctaw site.Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) also received the emergency supply lent by the energy department. The company received 500,000 barrels of crude oil twice. The oil given to the Phillips 66 refinery is essentially in the form of a loan, which the company will replace at a later date when supplies become normal again.Major refiners whose operations in Texas were hit by Harvey include ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) and others.Oil Release Aimed at Easing Gasoline PricesOperations were disrupted in 13 Texas oil refineries and 11 ports. The halted crude deliveries in the U.S. Gulf coast refineries have made the market unstable due to reduced refinery output. It pushed the prices of oil products like gasoline higher for the last weeks. Gasoline price climbed up above $2 per gallon, which marks a two-year high. The government believes the move will curb rising prices and therefore benefit consumers. The energy department is yet to estimate a date by which the Gulf Coast refineries will be fully operational.The energy department had initially thought of releasing gasoline from the emergency reserve located in New York Harbor, Boston and Maine. The 1 million barrels of gasoline reserve was built following the damage to New York fuel infrastructure due to the storm Sandy in 2012.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.
