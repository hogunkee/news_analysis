56,ADI,"Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 78 to 82 Wednesday. X IBD's proprietary rating tracks share price movement with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The rating shows how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks compares to all the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research shows that the best stocks tend to have an RS Rating of over 80 as they begin their biggest climbs.Taiwan Semiconductor broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 37.02 entry from a flat base. In the scenario where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to take shape. Also keep in mind that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure. Taiwan Semiconductor showed -2% EPS growth last quarter, while sales growth came in at 2%. The company holds the No. 6 rank among its peers in the Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group.

U.S. crude futures fell as fewer refiners were available to convert oil to gasoline and other products. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.4 million barrels in the latest week with gasoline supplies flat, the Energy Information Administration reported, but that doesn't reflect Harvey's impact. Domestic production was essentially flat at 9.53 million barrels a day, still near the record high of 9.61 million reached in June 2015.Two days after Gilead Sciences (GILD) said it would pay $11.9 billion, or $180 a share, for Kite Pharma (KITE) and pivot to cellular therapies, Novartis (NVS) was the first to grab FDA approval for a CAR-T treatment.

63,ADI,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and other U.S. indexes tumbled Tuesday morning as global markets were rattled following North Korea's overnight launch of a ballistic missile that crossed over northern Japan before crashing into the ocean. It was the latest in a series of provocations from the rogue nuclear-armed nation.XJapan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decried the ""grave"" threat while South Korea President Moon Jae-in ordered his military to show that it can ""overwhelm"" North Korea in the event of an attack.President Trump, who earlier this month vowed ""fire and fury"" for North Korea, has not responded directly yet.S&P 500 futures retreated 0.6% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.8%. Dow Jones industrial futures slid 0.5% vs. fair value, or more than over 100 points against fair value.South Korea's Kospi fell 0.2% Tuesday, well off session lows. Japan's Nikkei slid 0.45%. Major European indexes fell more than 1% intraday.Gold prices, already moving to 2017 highs on Monday, rose 0.9% with global tensions and a falling dollar.In the current choppy market, it's key to follow proper buy and sell rules. Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), leading gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), and Biogen (BIIB) all show the importance of waiting on proper buy points before taking a new position.Tesla dipped below its 50-day moving average on Monday. Skyworks drifted further below that support area as iPhone chipmakers failed to rally with Apple. On the upside, GLD broke out into a buy zone, and kept rising overnight. Biogen, meanwhile, approached an entry point.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index closed Monday higher. The Nasdaq moved back above its 50-day moving average while the S&P 500 index finished just below that level.As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. Why not buy before a stock surges out of a base? If it rallies, you get a bigger gain, right? But as an investor you shouldn't try to seek the biggest possible gain, but to maximize the odds of a big gain while minimizing losses.A buy point is the price level at which a stock is most likely to begin a significant advance. It's an area of the chart that offers the least amount of resistance to price progress.If a stock clears a buy point and then reverses below that level, that is not good technical action. Because it's clearly negative, it's easier to cut losses short. You may have an opportunity later to buy the stock again if it makes a new move into buy territory.In contrast, if you buy within a consolidation or when a stock is extended or in a downtrend, it can fall significantly over a few days or weeks without necessarily triggering any major changes in the chart. So you can either be shaken out of ""normal"" stock action or find yourself saddled with big capital losses.Tesla shares fell 0.7% to 345.66 in Monday's stock market trading, dipping just below their 50-day moving average. Tesla is in a cup-with-handle base with a 370.10 buy point. If you cheated and bought the stock on the Aug. 16 peak of 366.50, you'd be sitting on a near-6% loss.Tesla shares fell 1.8% to 339.40 in premarket trading Tuesday.Skyworks, which already was below its 50-day line, dipped 1.3% to 100.70, falling intraday to a new low for its handle. Skyworks' potential entry is all the way at 108.65.Skyworks stock is not alone. Fellow Apple chip stock Broadcom (AVGO) is below its 50-day line, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI) are just above that support level. Despite Apple's continued rise — shares rose 1% to 161.47 on Monday, still in range from a 156.75 entry — we haven't seen a wave of breakouts from key suppliers.Skyworks was not yet active in premarket action, while Apple fell modestly.SPDR Gold Shares, or GLD, rose 1.6% to 124.69, clearing a 123.41 buy point in strong volume. GLD largely tracks gold, which topped $1.300 an ounce and hit an 11-month high. GLD had just topped a prior buy point on June 6, but failed  to close above that level. GLD, and gold prices, then sold off for the next month before making a new move higher.GLD rose 0.65% to 125.50 in early trading as North Korea's missile launch pushed more investors into gold.Biogen rose 2.5% to 292.30 on Monday, closing in on a 297.05 buy point. Biogen announced positive trial data on an experimental Alzheimer's drug early Monday.Biogen's stock rose to 296.91 on Aug. 16, but didn't top the entry. Shares then retreated toward the 10-week line. Biogen's latest move is encouraging, but not definitive.Biogen was little changed Tuesday morning.Watching breakouts overall can give you a strong indication of the market's health. If a number of top-rated stocks are breaking out and continuing to advance, that's clearly bullish. But if breakouts fail or stall, that's a reason to be cautious or move to the sidelines.RELATED:The Big Picture: Nasdaq Fights For Support; This Sector RalliesChart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real Opportunity5 Chip Stocks Set Up Bases; Best Buy Due: Investing Action PlanBiogen's Alzheimer's Drug Shows Promise, Stock Nears Buy PointThese 4 Chip Stocks Just Carved This 'Super Growth' PatternETFs: Gold Soars, Biotechs Rally

The Hang Seng has let an 11.9% year-to-date gain shrivel to less than 0.5%.Despite the decline in Chinese mainland equities, Autohome, a member of IBD Leaderboard since Jan. 2 this year, scored a new breakout from a rare pattern called the ascending base. In such a pattern, the stock has already broken out but then posts three quick corrections of around 10% to 20% over a nine- to 16-week period. The stock must make a new high before each correction; hence, it's an ""ascending base.""Autohome focuses on advertising and marketing of automobiles through its website. The company's earnings have grown 28%, 15%, 39%, 58%, 82% and 53% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Analysts see Q2 earnings rising 23% to 87 cents a share.On Jan. 2, Autohome had initially cleared a 17-week base that shows elements of a double bottom. This base gave a 67.79 standard buy point.A narrow five-day handle formed on the tail end of the base. That provided a slightly lower buy point of 65.67, a dime above the handle's high. That handle began forming on Dec. 22 last year and the resulting lower entry is very close to the 66.55 ""alternative entry point"" created by the middle interim peak wedged in between the two sell-offs within the base.Check out this recent Investor's Corner column on how a chart pattern can lead to more than one correct interpretation of the stock's current balance of supply (AKA sellers) vs. demand (buyers) and the proper time to buy.On the Leaderboard daily and weekly charts, users can see chart annotations placed in real time on specific buy points, including bases and follow-on entry points.Elsewhere, software sector leader Salesforce.com (CRM) rallied as much as 4.4% and struck a new high of 132.55 before pulling back and giving up nearly half of that impressive gain. The cloud-based business software giant remains in buy range after clearing a 128.97 breakout point in a seven-week cup without handle, a variation on the cup-with-handle base, a bullish chart pattern.IBD's Medical-Products group recently bumped the enterprise software industry group off the No. 1 rung among 197 industry groups ranked each day by Investor's Business Daily.

HDFC's 50-day average turnover is a healthy 826,000 shares per day. That big advance instantly gave the Indian lender much needed progress in creating the right side of what currently looks like a cup base.Notice on a daily chart how much of the current base in HDFC has formed beneath the 50-day moving average. A no-no.Consumer spending-linked names continued to fare well. Shake Shack (SHAK), a new idea on IBD SwingTrader, surged more than 5% and at one point reached as high as 62.54 in volume that is running nearly triple its normal pace.The burger and shake chain broke out of a well-formed first-stage cup with handle at 44.50 on April 26. Volume came in just 13% above the 50-day average on that session.However, Shake Shack saw a 69% boost in volume vs. normal levels the very next session as shares rose another 4.1% to 47.26, quickly exiting the permissible 5% buy zone.On May 4, the New York-based chain roared more than 18% higher after reporting a first-quarter adjusted profit of 15 cents a share, up 50% as sales jumped 29% to $99.1 million, a quarterly record.Net margin improved 90 basis points to 5.7%.Shake Shack now gets a top-flight 93 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. That ranks it No. 1 within the Retail-Restaurants industry group. The SMR Rating, which analyzes a company's sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity, has improved to an A on a scale of A (excellent) to E (rotten).Going back to Apple, new reports have noted that some analysts express concern over whether the company's services segment will keep both the top and bottom lines increasing at a fast rate.Apple, however, still shows strong growth prospects.The Street sees earnings in the June-ending fiscal third quarter rising 31% to $2.18 a share on a 15% pickup in revenue to $52.26 billion. That would mark the fourth quarter in a row of low double-digit top-line gains. Sales jumped 5%, 7%, 12%, 13% and 16% in the prior five quarters.Apple has climbed 61% since it initially broke out of a first stage base on Jan. 6, 2017. The move past a 118.12 buy point in a cup with handle marked an emerging change in the stock's character.In other financial markets, the U.S. Treasury bonds saw a rebound in yields as investors sold.

In March, the U.S. central bank hiked the Fed funds rate by a quarter point to a range of 1.5%-1.75%.Bond traders expect the Fed to bump the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points again in June and in September.

Stock market futures were positive Tuesday and at least mixed on Wednesday before the open.Twenty-one stocks with Composite Ratings of 95 or above that trade at least $8 million in shares fell below their 50-days on Wednesday. That includes chip plays ASML Holding (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX) and NXP Semiconductor (NXPI).

Early Tuesday, Lam Research briefly retook a double-bottom buy point at the open, but soon reversed. ASML came within a whisker of moving back into a buy zone Tuesday before its own reversal. Those reversals, along with similar action from some other chip-gear names, were a bearish sign for leading stocks Tuesday before Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled and Facebook (FB) renewed its ongoing crash.NXP Semiconductor plunged 4.3% to 116.26, crashing through its 50-day line and approaching its 200-day for the first time since Qualcomm (QCOM) agreed to buy the automotive- and wireless-chip maker in late September.

76,ADI,"If Broadcom (AVGO) fails in its quest to buy Qualcomm (QCOM), the acquisitive chipmaker is likely to look for other targets as the semiconductor industry consolidates.X In a report Thursday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani pointed to several chip companies that Broadcom could pursue if it is jilted by Qualcomm shareholders in a proxy vote on March 6.""Fundamentally, (Broadcom is) in a unique position given (its) ability to generate about $9 billion to $10 billion of free cash flow annually, a balance sheet that is almost net debt neutral and a management team that has an impeccable history in integrating assets,"" Daryanani said.He reiterated his ""top pick"" buy rating on Broadcom with a price target of 325.Broadcom shares were up 0.7% to close at 249.35 on the stock market today.Broadcom has a well-established playbook when it comes to making value-enhancing mergers and acquisitions, Daryanani said. It looks for chipmakers in markets with only two or three competitors and targets those with leading market-share positions. It likes companies with a stable growth outlook, entrenched customers and room for profit-margin accretion.Given those criteria, Broadcom's options are rather limited, Daryanani said. Still, he highlighted five chip companies that might be in play if the Qualcomm takeover fails.They include Analog Devices (ADI), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), Microsemi (MSCC) and Xilinx (XLNX).Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!Xilinx satisfies most of Broadcom's requirements, though its valuation might be too high, based on Broadcom's acquisition history, Daryanani said.Microsemi has potential for operating expense reduction and margin improvement. Plus, company executives are likely willing sellers at a price over $70 a share, Daryanani said. Microsemi currently trades near 61.Marvell would be a nice fit for Broadcom, but regulatory hurdles make the deal improbable, he said.Analog Devices and Maxim in theory could have room for operating profit margin expansion, but that might be difficult given their diversified customer bases, he said.RELATED:Broadcom Trims Its Offer For Qualcomm After NXP Deal

77,ADI,"The proliferation of semiconductors in electric vehicles is creating a big market opportunity for numerous suppliers, a Wall Street analyst said Thursday.X The report by Nomura analyst Romit Shah says the average semiconductor content per electric vehicle is about $924, more than triple what is in standard internal combustion gas-powered automobiles, based on data from STMicroelectronics (STM).Shah projects the category of alternative electric vehicles will grow to 53 million units by 2030, up from 3.4 million units in 2017, implying a compound annual growth rate of 23%.""This is significantly higher than the overall automotive compound annual growth rate, which our Nomura colleagues estimate to be 2.2% over the same time frame,"" Shah wrote. ""We believe that there are a number of major shifts in transportation technology that will expand the demand for automotive semiconductors by orders of magnitude.""Some of the companies set to benefit from the growth in auto electronics include NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as STMicroelectronics and Analog Devices (ADI).Among recent events about these companies, NXP on Friday announced new chip products for radar applications in automated driving. Analog Devices received at least six price-target increases to its stock after delivering a beat-and-raise quarterly report on Nov. 22.In addition, Texas Instruments is currently trading near a record high, while STMicroelectronics is forming a base with a 24.90 buy point as it gets set to report quarterly earnings on Jan. 24.Shah said he spent his summer at electric-car company Tesla (TSLA), where he also spent significant time analyzing the supply chain for alternative energy vehicles. The category includes hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, such as Tesla, which is in the process of rolling out its mass-market Model 3.He expects advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous driving, and powertrain electrification to be the biggest drivers of chip content. His report focused on the electrification of the powertrain, which is the primary piece of an electric vehicle, housing the batteries and other technologies that provide the power for vehicle performance.IBD'S TAKE: Never has the chip sector been more competitive, with more than 750 companies vying globally to build the insides of the next hot device or power future megacomputers.

85,ADI,"Apple (AAPL) hit a record high Tuesday morning, looking at first glance like a market leader after reclaiming a buy point Friday. But Friday's move had some glaring weaknesses and by Tuesday's close Apple retreated to settle just under its entry area again.X Meanwhile, iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), which have been market laggards in the past several weeks, hit key resistance Tuesday. But Qualcomm (QCOM) made a big move.On Tuesday, Apple hit a record high of 179.39, but reversed with the market, closing down 0.5% to 176.19, back below the 176.34 flat-base buy point.Apple rose 1% to 177.09 on Friday, reclaiming the 173.64 entry. That wasn't an especially powerful price gain. Meanwhile, volume was 7% below normal. You want to see trading activity rise at least 40%-50% above average on breakouts and moves into buy zones.Apple's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is well off recent highs. (The RS line is the blue line in the stock charts below.) Friday's 1% stock move, not much more than the S&P 500's 0.7% advance, did little to change that. You want to see a stock's RS line lead or confirm a breakout or move into a buy area.Apple's RS line hasn't made headway since early May. Even when Apple briefly broke out on Dec. 18, the stock's RS line was off its prior highs.Can Apple's move into buy zone work? If the market continues to power ahead, then there's a good chance that Apple's stock will continue to climb. It's also possible that Apple will begin to outperform the S&P 500 significantly again.Investors should try to focus on stocks that will deliver the strongest gains, while minimizing the risk of losses, especially big losses.Apple reports earnings on Feb. 1.Broadcom is currently in a flat base with a 285.78 buy point. Broadcom sank 0.4% to 263.25 after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average. The RS line has fallen to its lowest levels since early July or early May. That reflects a series of flat bases on top of or next to each other without making much headway.IBD'S TAKE: With the market now in a confirmed rally for 100 days, it can be hard to see who are the true leading stocks and which are in the middle of the pack. See why IBD's relative strength line is so important.Qualcomm is an interesting case for two reasons.First, the wireless chip giant is in a royalties battle with key customer Apple, as well as related legal and regulatory challenges and probes around the world. Those woes helped send the stock crashing from October 2016 to last September.Second, Broadcom is making a now-hostile bid for Qualcomm, so the latter's shares skyrocketed in November. Since peaking in late November, Qualcomm and Broadcom shares have  generally moved in a similar fashion. Then again, so has Skyworks Solutions.But Qualcomm separated from Broadcom on Tuesday, climbing 4.4% to 68.25 as it laid out its case for staying independent, offering bullish 2019 targets.Qualcomm is in a huge cup-with-handle base. If you prefer, you can view the handle as a flat base on its own. Either way, the buy point would be 69.38. Shares closed Friday at 65.38, finding support at its fast-rising 50-day line.Qualcomm's RS line has lagged badly since late Nov. 24, reflecting the stock's underperformance over that time. But the RS did get a nice bounce Tuesday with shares rising and the major averages retreating.Skyworks Solutions is in a consolidation essentially next to two prior patterns that had short-lived breakouts. Skyworks has a 117.75 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 101.21, continuing to trade below its 50-day and 200-day line. The 50-day line last week fell below the 200-day, negative technical action known as a bearish cross.Meanwhile, the RS line peaked in early June and is now just off its lowest levels in a year.Skyworks found resistance at its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, reversing lower to close off 1.3% at 99.86.Qorvo, like Skyworks, is in a consolidation next to a pair of bases with breakouts that soon failed. It's also below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The RS line is right around the lowest levels in a year after peaking last May.Qorvo is in a consolidation with an 81.30 buy point, but has a lot of work to do. Qorvo sank 2.45% to 69.30 on Tuesday, finding resistance at its 200-day line.Analog Devices (ADI) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), both seen as iPhone X plays, are both in shallow, short cup bases. The RS lines are lagging, though a powerful stock gain could lift these stocks' RS lines above at least a short-term high from their recent pseudo-handles (they are not proper handles). Keep in mind that the RS lines have basically been flat for a year. Integrated Device's earnings have been spotty.Analog Devices rose 1.2% to 93.10, closing in on a 94.09 entry.

Meanwhile, the Fed is virtually assured of raising rates at 2 p.m. ET, but the question is how many hikes that policymakers will forecast for 2018.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value after briefly falling following the Alabama election results. Dow and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced about 0.15%.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is close to carving out a flat base. But Apple chip plays are not faring as well, with Broadcom (AVGO) undercutting its buy point Tuesday, joining Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Applied Materials (AMAT), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qorvo (QRVO) below the 50-day line as chipmakers continue to slump.The GOP tax plan being hashed out between the House and Senate now has a 21% corporate tax cut, down from the current 35%, but up from prior  plans for 20%. There would be a 37% personal income rate and the mortgage interest deduction would  be capped at $750,000, down from the current $1 million but above the House's $500,000.Apple shares fell 0.6% to 171.70 in Tuesday's stock market trading, but they're still holding support slightly above the 50-day moving average.Apple appears to be headed toward a flat base, which needs a minimum of five weeks. That would occur at the end of this week. This hypothetical bullish consolidation, with a potential buy point of 176.34, would be a base-on-base formation above a prior cup-with-handle pattern.Apple is investing $390 million in Finisar (FNSR) to help the optical components maker revamp a Texas plant to make key iPhone chips. Finisar shot up in premarket trading on Wednesday's news.Apple, a member of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials, has shaken off iPhone X supply concerns.But such worries may be affecting key iPhone-related chip plays, which are also struggling due to general weakness in semiconductors.Broadcom had been one of the stronger Apple chipmakers, holding above its 259.46 buy point for the most part since the late-October breakout, becoming somewhat extended in late November.Broadcom, which is mounting a now-hostile bid for fellow wireless-chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM), reported strong earnings and guidance as well as a big dividend hike last week.Shares popped intraday Dec. 7 on the report, but closed flat. In the last three sessions, shares tested their buy point and 50-day moving average, finally closing below both levels with Tuesday's 0.4% loss to 258.81.Because Broadcom wiped out a 10% gain from its buy point, that entry is now invalid. A strong, high-volume retaking of the 50-day line could present a new buying opportunity.The chip-equipment giant is not a direct Apple supplier, though it's been deemed an iPhone X play for its work with OLED screens.Applied Materials fell 2.2% to 50.47 on Tuesday, continuing to hold below its 50-day moving average.In fact, just one of the 22 largest chip-gear stocks by market cap is current above that key support line, Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC). That's despite the record chip-gear sales in 2017 and 2018 seen by industry group SEMI.Among top chipmakers, Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN) are slightly above their 50-day lines, but not many others are, outside of M&A-related plays.Analog Devices successfully broke out in late September/early October, unlike many other Apple suppliers. Shares rose more than 9% above an 85.81 buy point by Nov. 20. But shares then reversed lower on the company's latest earnings report and soon undercut their 50-day line.In recent sessions, Analog Devices has been holding just above or below the 85.81 entry, which is technically still valid. Shares fell 0.4% to 85.48 on Tuesday.Skyworks broke out in late October and Qorvo in early November, with both rising for a few sessions but then quickly tumbling through their buy points and 50-day lines.Skyworks fell 0.5% to 96.47 on Tuesday, about 18% off its high. Qorvo lost 1.3% to 67.70, hitting a four-month low intraday.RELATED:The Big Picture: This Key Tech Sector Shows Unusual Weakness5 Truck Stocks Set Up Buy Points Despite Tesla Semi: Investing Action PlanBullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?Bullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy Point

88,ADI,"Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) is poised for another winning year in 2018, a Wall Street investment bank predicted Monday.X Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said his best ideas in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in 2018 are unchanged from 2017. They include Nvidia, Micron Technology (MU), Analog Devices (ADI), Xilinx (XLNX), Western Digital (WDC), Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML Holding (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX) and Universal Display (OLED).""Yes, semiconductor stocks had an excellent run in 2017 – with the SOX up 39%,"" Muse said in a note to clients. ""But multiples still remain below the broader market and remain inexpensive vs. most other cyclicals. And very importantly, we believe we are on the cusp of true rising silicon intensity led by AI/Big Data (creation, transmission, analytics, storage) that will likely drive the third meaningful upcycle for semis.""Still, chip stocks will ""face a wall of worry"" in 2018 as fears persist that the current cycle is peaking, he said.Nvidia is likely to lead semi stocks for the third year in a row, thanks to its leadership in artificial intelligence, Muse said.He has a near-term price target on Nvidia of 250, but longer term sees it hitting 300.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes Nvidia, Applied Materials and Universal Display.Nvidia jumped 3% to close at 199.35 on the stock market today.In addition to artificial intelligence and Big Data, another technology trend in 2018 will be the continued adoption of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays in smartphones, Muse said.The OLED trend is helping equipment maker Applied Materials and technology and materials supplier Universal Display, he said.RELATED:Entegris Looking For China Growth, Possible Acquisitions In 2018Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018Looking For The Next Nvidia?

89,ADI,"XThe stock market trimmed losses but remained lower Tuesday afternoon as worries ran through the Apple (AAPL) supply chain.The Nasdaq composite, most sensitive to the technology companies that make parts for Apple products, was down 0.3%. The S&P 500 also fell 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average was nearly flat.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 showed some support at the 50-day moving average, a hopeful sign. The S&P 500 slipped below its 50-day line but pared losses and was trading right at the line. The Nasdaq, which had been down 1%, started bouncing as it touched its 50-day line.Volume was tracking higher across the board. Despite the index declines, advancing stocks led decliners by 9-to-7 on the NYSE and Nasdaq. Indeed, the selling was concentrated in chip stocks, while other technology industry groups were basically flat or even higher.The chip sector was rattled after a report said Apple is dropping Dialog Semiconductor power-management chips and will start using in-house technology. The news shook the stocks of other iPhone suppliers. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) fell 1.6% in double its usual volume; Analog Devices (ADI) slipped 1.8% also in heavy trading.Chip ETFs felt the pain also. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Seminconductor (SOXX) fell below the 50-day moving average for the first time in more than four months.Gold stocks led as geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea sparked safe-haven buying. IBD's gold and silver mining industry group was the day's best performer, up 2.4%.Homebuilders also led, after two small-cap companies in the industry agreed to merge. Colorado-based Century Communities (CCS) and San Jose, Calif.-based  UCP Inc. (UCP) will combine in a deal valued at $336  million, including debt. The combined company will have a backlog of more than $450 million and essentially no overlap in territory. Their land is in California, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington.Century shares jumped 2.5% in volatile trading that took the stock to a record high. UCP gapped up 22% and climbed back above the 50-day moving average as it forms a new base.The deal gave the up-trending homebuilding industry a boost just as many of its leaders were starting to sag. Toll Bros. (TOL) jumped 3% and Lennar (LEN) 0.3% as both are rising above short-term trend lines. D.R. Horton (DHI) was little changed but continues to shape a cup-with-handle ahead of next week's earnings report.Mortgage companies, a related industry, rose nearly as much as homebuilders, up 1.3%.HealthSouth (HLS) broke out of a long saucer base, crossing above a 43.48 buy point.

But the parent company of Google pulled back to a 0.4% advance to 864.40, with volume was tracking well below average. The mild price behavior also left something to be desired for the breakout. Alphabet may get into the auto insurance business as part of the growth in self-diving cars, a Morgan Stanley report said.The S&P 500 fell 0.1% while the small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.3% increase.The Dow Jones industrial average lagged with a 0.2% loss after a mysterious drop by Merck (MRK). The Dow component slid more than 2%, its biggest move since Feb. 2, when the pharmaceutical company announced earnings. There was no news on the wires today, but medical stocks were generally lackluster.The chip sector was buzzing in today's market with news that Intel (INTC) agreed to acquire Mobileye (MBLY) in a $15 billion deal.Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS) hit a new high in heavy trading. Analog Devices (ADI) rose less than 1% but volume was tracking well above the usual level. Lam Research (LRCX) also hit a new high, but it's well extended in price after a breakout in November and several visits to the 10-week moving average.Logitech International (LOGI) broke out of a flat base, surging past the 30 buy point in heavy volume. The stock's relative strength line also made a new high, a bullish sign.The maker of mice, keyboards and other PC accessories is the leader in IBD's computer hardware and peripherals industry group.

97,ADI,"Biotech sector funds ruled the roost last year but technology focused funds are the clear winners now.Of 217 sector funds that are 10 years or older with at least $100 million in assets, three of the five top sector funds of 2016 were focused on technology. The other two represented the financial services and transportation sectors.All five sector funds featured in the 2017 IBD Mutual Fund Awards beat the benchmark S&P 500 for the past one, three, five and 10 years. Apple or iPhone-related chip stocks were a common underlying theme among the three technology funds.Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX) was the top-performing sector fund last year with a 32.4% return. Its three, five and 10-year average annual return is 23.3%, 22% and 10.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 rose nearly 12% last year and 9.9%, 14.7% and 7% for the same periods. Fidelity Select Semiconductors is still beating the S&P 500 so far this year with a gain of 8.58% vs. 5.09%, though it's trailing the top sector funds by about eight percentage points.The Fidelity fund, launched in July 1985, has $2.8 billion in total assets. In October, it changed its name from Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio to better reflect its focus on chipmakers and chip designers.""Despite a subdued macro environment — semiconductor industry revenue was essentially flat for the past couple of years — semiconductor stocks performed well,"" Steve Barwikowski, who has managed the fund since 2009, told IBD. ""The biggest factor has been M&A with roughly $100 billion worth of deals in each of the last two years.""More than 99% of the fund's assets were in tech stocks, while less than a percentage point was in communications services. Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Applied Materials (AMAT), its top five holdings at the end of the year, accounted for 52% of the fund's assets.Barwikowski thinks the chip industry could benefit from the new administration's pro-growth policies in areas such as tax and trade.""I am optimistic that the chips are poised for the best growth we have seen in a few years driven by a combination of healthy supply chain inventories, a more stable personal computing market, continued secular growth in the auto and cloud markets, a strong mobile phone cycle in the second half of the year, and potentially a healthier global macro environment,"" he said. ""Strong fundamentals are somewhat balanced by higher valuations, but there are definitely good opportunities for stock picking.""Up next is RMB Mendon Financial Services (RMBKX) with a 29.7% return in 2016. The $557.4 million fund, managed by Mendon Capital Advisors founder Anton Schutz, was launched in June 1999.As of Nov. 30, the fund was 85% invested in U.S. stocks and had less than 4% in cash. The top five holdings in the 62-stock portfolio were BNC Bancorp (BNCN), Yadkin Financial (YDKN), OceanFirst Financial (OCFC), Atlantic Capital Bancshares (ACBI) and Opus Bank (OPB).""Most of the gain in the financial services sector came in the last two months of the quarter following the surprising results of the presidential election,"" Schutz wrote in the fund's Q4 commentary. ""With visibility increasing around who the decision makers will be in Washington for the next four years, it became clear this was a significant inflection point for financial services in terms of both fundamentals and valuations.""He noted tail winds including corporate tax reform, amendments to Dodd-Frank and the delay of new Department of Labor rules.Fidelity Select Transportation Fund (FSRFX), with $644.7 million in assets, returned 10.5% last year. Industrials accounted for 99.1% of assets as of Jan. 31, with consumer cyclicals and technology making up less than 1%.Its top holdings by weighting as of Dec. 31 were United Parcel Service (UPS), Union Pacific (UNP), FedEx (FDX), CSX (CSX) and American Airlines Group (AAL).""My approach centers on the concepts of value and risk,"" fund manager Matthew Moulis said on Fidelity.com. ""In particular, I look for stocks that I think represent good value, where value is related to the price paid for attributes such as expected profit growth, return on capital and conversion of free cash flow.""Red Oak Technology Select Fund (ROGSX) came in third with a 24.6% return last year. Its average annual gains for the past three, five and 10 years were 12.9%, 18.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The Red Oak fund held total assets of $412.6 million as of Dec. 31, according to fund tracker Morningstar.Technology accounted for 86% of the fund's holdings as of Dec. 31, followed by consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials, at less than 6% each. Mark Oelschlager manages the fund. The fund's top five holdings were Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), which recently agreed to by Mobileye (MBLY). Nearly a quarter, or 23%, of the fund's assets were in these names.Red Oak Technology and Fidelity Select Semiconductors both owned Intel, which had a 20% run in Q4. The chip giant's shares have dipped 2% this year, but IBD's overall chipmaker industry group has gained 8% this year and is ranked No. 38 among the 197 tracked by IBD.Columbia Seligman Communications & Information (SLMCX) rounds out the top five with a 15.4% return in 2016. Paul Wick has managed the $4.9 billion fund for 27 years. The fund was 91% invested in technology, 3% each in financial services and consumer cyclicals, and a little over 1% in industrials.Several chip names made its top five as of Jan. 31, including Lam Research (LRCX), Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO). The three stocks rose 12%, 23% and 26% in Q4 last year. Apple (AAPL), up 20%, was also a top holding. The iPhone maker has rallied this year — it's close to the 20% profit-taking zone from a Jan. 9 breakout past a 117.12 cup-with-handle entry.""We are generally positive about the technology sector going forward despite many of the end markets being challenged for growth, whether that be in PCs, smartphones or networking,"" the managers said in their Q4 commentary. ""We are feeling optimistic about U.S. economic prospects in the wake of the election. In particular, we are enthusiastic that a less onerous regulatory environment should lead to more robust U.S. economic growth and that repatriation of cash held overseas will benefit a huge swath of technology companies in which the portfolio is invested.""RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

99,ADI,"Looking for some ideas for your portfolio? Want to boost the octane in your retirement account? Then check out how American Funds and Fidelity Investments — the second- and third-largest mutual fund complexes after Vanguard as of Dec. 31, according to Morningstar Inc. — were allocating their shareholders' money.The main lesson for individual investors? Even the smart money, in the form of these two fund families, can disagree about some key decisions.The three sectors in which their stock fund weightings differed from each other the most were information technology, consumer staples and energy.Fidelity's stock funds overall had 26% of their shareholders' money in tech, the group's largest sector weighting, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research for research firm CFRA.American Funds was well below that, with just 18% in tech.American Funds had more in consumer staples, 9% vs. only 7% for Fidelity.And American Funds had more in energy, 10% vs. just 6% for Fidelity.We recently dissected recent big buys by Fidelity, so here's a look at some big fourth-quarter buys by American Funds, whose 64 stock mutual funds were up 4.90% year-to-date as of Feb. 28, according to Morningstar Inc. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, was up 5.94%.American Funds boosted its share count in chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) by a whopping 43%.Analog Devices has a top-notch 98 Composite Rating from IBD, a peg under the highest possible on a scale from 1-99. The stock's earnings per share rose 6%, 2% and 68% in the past three quarters. Share price is up 14% this year going into Monday.Drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was another stock in which American Funds made a big increase in its share count, adding 40% more to its stake.Bristol-Myers has a weak 61 Composite Rating. Share price has been trending lower since mid-July. Shares are down 2% this year but have rallied 22% since Jan. 26, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' consensus view and cut its 2017 guidance.One reason for Bristol-Myers' rally is that its cancer drug Opdivo recently won approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer. It got a similar green light in Europe last year.American Funds jacked up its number of shares in Facebook (FB) by a net 39% in Q4. The stock has a good 92 Comp Rating. Shares have climbed 19% so far this year.Alphabet (GOOGL) is another name in which American Funds raised its bet, by 16% in the social-media giant's case. Share price is up 7% so far this year.Additional tech-oriented bellwethers were among the stocks in which American Funds made net new buys, including consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL), chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) and software titan Microsoft (MSFT).But the big fund family hedged its bets in some other tech titans, including net redemptions in chipmaker Intel (INTC) and Amazon (AMZN).

Information technology and health care were the fund's first- and third-biggest sectors as of March 31, with 35% and 17% weightings respectively. Consumer discretionary stocks — such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and Time Warner (TWX), the fund's third and ninth biggest positions as of Feb. 28 — constituted the fund's second-biggest sector bet at 22%.All of this reflects the fund's overall strategy, which is long-term capital growth by investing mainly in large U.S. companies.

118,ADI,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 smartphone hasn't been announced yet, but analysts are already picking winners and losers among component suppliers for the rumored device.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang on Friday predicted that Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Dialog Semiconductor, Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Qorvo (QRVO) would be content-gainers in Apple's next-generation handset.Component-share losers in the iPhone 8 likely will include Analog Devices (ADI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qualcomm (QCOM), he said.Cypress could gain a USB type-C driver in the handset, Zhang said. Maxim likely has a design win for the power-management chip for the OLED display, he said. Qorvo will gain content, but at a lower gross margin, he said.Qualcomm is likely to be a loser as Apple shifts more to Intel (INTC) wireless chips. Apple and Qualcomm are engaged in a nasty legal battle over wireless-patent royalties and terms.Cirrus Logic is expected to lose power amplifier share to Maxim, Zhang said. And Analog Devices lost the Force Touch component business to a competitor for the OLED iPhone.Apple is expected to introduce the iPhone 8 in September, along with iPhone 7S handsets, which are upgraded versions of the current iPhone 7 devices. The iPhone 8 is likely to be in very short supply initially because of production snags that Apple's contract manufacturers have experienced. Component suppliers have had trouble integrating the fingerprint security sensor into the OLED display, analysts say.The iPhone 8 is expected to be Apple's biggest smartphone redesign since the iPhone 6, which came out in September 2014. The iPhone 8 is rumored to feature a 5.8-inch borderless OLED screen, glass-sandwich design, wireless charging and augmented-reality capability. Apple is expected to replace the physical home button with a virtual on-screen button, which will allow for a larger display.Many Wall Street analysts expect the iPhone 8 — Apple's 11th-generation handset and 10th-anniversary smartphone — to kick off a ""supercycle"" of upgrade purchases among iPhone users.Earlier this month, Pacific Crest Securities identified chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) as three companies likely to benefit from the release of the iPhone 8.Audio-chip maker Cirrus Logic has the highest exposure to Apple of the three companies spotlighted by Pacific Crest. Cirrus gets about 75% of its revenue from Apple.Broadcom is best positioned to make content gains in the iPhone 8 with its radio-frequency, Wi-Fi and wireless-charging chips, Pacific Crest said. Broadcom gets 15% to 20% of its revenue from Apple.Skyworks also is seen making content gains in the new iPhone, Pacific Crest said. Skyworks gets about 40% of its revenue from Apple.On Wednesday, investment bank Cowen said Apple's contract manufacturers might not reach mass production of the iPhone 8 until late October or early November, three months later than usual for the annual iPhone update.

Dow component Cisco Systems (CSCO), meanwhile, plunged 7% after reporting earnings and issuing tepid guidance.The Nasdaq rose 0.8%, helped by strength in chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Skyworks (SWKS) and Analog Devices (ADI), which showed gains of more than 2%.

Investors initially focused on an earnings miss, but other metrics looked good, including a 50% rise in sales. The company also announced a $6 billion share buyback.Elsewhere, Leaderboard name Trade Desk (TTD) recovered nicely after Wednesday's rout. Shares jumped 8% to 51.54.

124,ADI,"Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) believes that clouds have silver linings — and it intends to mine them.XThe Lowell, Mass.-based chipmaker sees an enormous opportunity to supply internet cloud data centers with semiconductor systems to support ever-faster networking capability.Macom Chief Executive John Croteau touted his company's potential to gain business from data-center customers during a recent conference call with analysts, calling them a ""predictable, high-value growth driver for the company for many years to come.""""Personally I haven't seen such a breakout in our part of the industry since the advent of digital handsets and smartphones decades ago,"" Croteau said during the April call. ""It's shaping up to be that big.""In the March quarter, data center sales accounted for 27% of Macom's revenue and the group was its largest end market. Sales in the segment were up 70% year over year, excluding its acquisition of AppliedMicro, which it completed in the quarter.Macom is focusing its resources on maximizing market share gains in the cloud data center market, where demand for its systems is outstripping supply.""With rapidly developing backlog, program awards and customer commitments, it's now clear that 100G and greater optical connectivity in data centers is real and it's far bigger and (happening) far sooner than anyone in the industry has predicted,"" Croteau said.The optical-fiber business has shifted from the ""notoriously cyclical"" carrier-based deployments to cloud data centers, which have ""insatiable demand"" for faster and higher bandwidth connectivity, he said. That shift was evident at the Optical Fiber Conference and Exhibition in Los Angeles in March, Croteau said.Networking gear maker Cisco Systems (CSCO) predicts that internet cloud traffic will nearly quadruple from 2015 to 2020, going from 3.9 zettabytes per year to 14.1. (One zettabyte is equal to 1 billion terabytes.) That includes everything from business software applications to consumer video streams.""Macom is well positioned with a portfolio spanning high-performance analog, lasers, silicon photonics, optical subassemblies and mixed signal (chips) across all protocols and form factors,"" he said.Macom is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday.Analysts expect Macom to earn 69 cents a share, up 35%, on sales of $196 million, up 38%, in the June quarter.Optical-component sales for cloud data centers are likely to be the main driver in fiscal third-quarter results, Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg said in a July 11 report. But the sector is expected to face continued headwinds from an inventory buildup in China related to delays in telecom infrastructure upgrades, he said.For the September quarter, Wall Street is modeling Macom to earn 76 cents a share, up 41%, on sales of $205 million, up 34%.Macom stock has been a top performer of late. It broke out of a cup base with a buy point of 53.90 on April 24. It hit a record high of 65.99 intraday on Wednesday.Shares were hit hard Thursday amid a broad market selloff, but started to climb back in Friday action.IBD'S TAKE: Macom Technology Solutions has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, putting it in the top 2% of stocks for performance in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Macom, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Macom's 100-gigabit optical modules are being used by Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit through systems supplied by contract manufacturer Fabrinet (FN). The Amazon deal could lead to business from other providers of cloud computing services, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said in a June 26 note to clients.""With the industry's broadest portfolio of electronic, photonic and subassembly solutions for datacom modules, Macom in the past has discussed opportunities to partner directly with leading hyperscale operators,"" Bolton said. ""We believe the Amazon-Fabrinet-Macom partnership is one of the first such partnerships. Should this partnership prove successful and ramp to high volume, we imagine it will lead to partnerships with other hyperscale operators.""Macom competitors include Analog Devices (ADI); Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD), which is being acquired by Broadcom (AVGO), and Inphi (IPHI).Macom is on track to enable 4 million 100G ports this year, and sees the total addressable market growing to 40 million to 50 million in 2018 and 2019, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a May 16 note to clients.Later, in a July 11 note, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said Macom is uniquely positioned in the 100G-connectivity space because it controls the whole package from transceiver components to digital-signal processors.Data centers have upgrade cycles every two to three years, vs. telecom service providers which upgrade their systems every five to seven years, Curtis said.""By developing in-house, they are now sharing road maps with key customers and conducting business more like a partnership vs. a transaction,"" Curtis said. ""The top 5 cloud players are rapidly increasing their capex investments and are incentivized to continue as IP (internet protocol) traffic increases.""RELATED:This Ad Tech Firm Does Bidding For Customers, One At A TimeHomebuilder Wins By Wooing New Entrants To HomeownershipBiotech Finds Its Stride With Kidney Cancer Treatment

125,ADI,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial averages were heading lower early Thursday morning. On Wednesday, chip stocks fueled the Nasdaq composite's 0.7% rally, on strong industry growth figures. But shares of Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip suppliers such as Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) are all still below key support levels after significant sell-offs.XNasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6% vs. fair value, while S&P 500 futures sank 0.4%. Dow futures were off 0.25%.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.4% and China's Shanghai composite rose 0.2%. In Europe intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE fell 0.7%, Germany's Dax 0.8% and France's CAC-40 1%.Apple shares themselves aren't acting that badly. The iPhone maker tumbled with other leading techs on June 9, then fell through its 50-day moving average on June 10. But since then the stock has moved sideways. Technically, Apple is in a flat base with a potential 156.75 buy point, though it needs to get above its 50-day line before investors should pay close attention.Apple's influence on the market is hard to overstate. Not only is the world's most valuable company by market cap and a member of the three major indexes, but its business strongly influences a raft of other companies, notably iPhone chip suppliers. Those chip stocks have been showing technical weakness, which one up session can't repair. Let's take a look at Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo.Broadcom is one of the better-looking iPhone chip stocks. Shares began pulling back with other techs on June 9, but held above its 50-day moving average until finally losing that support last week. On Monday, shares fell intraday to 229.08, almost roundtripping a near-13% gain from a 227.85 buy point cleared in early May.Texas Instruments tumbled hard on June 9, losing a buy point. That started a test of the 50-day over several sessions, with shares closing below that level for good on June 20. Since then shares have continued to trend lower. On Wednesday, TI rose 0.85% after finding some support at the 200-day line.Analog Devices' woes started a little earlier that most techs. Analog Devices broke out on May 30, closing just above the 84.34 buy point. The next morning Analog Devices skyrocketed intraday to 90.49, but closed up only 1.1% at 85.76. On June 1, shares tumbled below the entry area, followed by undercutting the 50-day line two sessions later. Analog traded above and below the 50-day for several weeks before starting a new leg down on June 27. Shares rose 2.1% on Wednesday, trading between the 50-day and 200-day lines.Skyworks was well extended from any buy zone on June 9, nearly hitting an all-time high, when shares quickly reversed. Skyworks closed below its 50-day line for good on June 23, then kept heading lower. Skyworks rose 2.3% on Wednesday, but is still more than 5% below its 50-day.Qorvo is trying to find support at its 200-day line after a sharp June sell-off that took the chip stock below its 50-day line and a buy point. Shares rose 3.1% on Wednesday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Why The Sloppy Second-Half Start For StocksChip Stocks Jump As Industry Sees Strongest Growth In 7 YearsApple iPhone Demand Soft, But That's OK, Analyst ContendsQ2 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

Analysts at Bankhaus Lampe on Tuesday claimed there was ""strong evidence"" that Apple was working on making its own power management chips for the iPhone. Dialog has not commented.Bankhaus Lampe downgraded Dialog to ""sell"" saying that Apple is working on its own battery-saving chip for the iPhone — which could replace Dialog's power circuits as early as 2019.The news comes little more than a week after shares in Imagination Technologies, a U.K. chip designer, plummeted after the company warned investors Apple was phasing out its chips in iPhones.Imagination Technologies garners royalty payments from Apple.Expectations for a strong iPhone upgrade cycle had been rising, sending up shares of Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO). While Dialog makes power management chips, Skyworks and Qorvo make more complicated devices that enable iPhones to utilize radio spectrum. Cirrus Logic makes audio devices.IBD'S TAKE: Arista Networks and Paycom Software are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. But word of Apple's plans hit shares of Cirrus Logic, which sank 2% to close at 63.38 after sinking as low as 60.96 on the stock market today.

That yet-to-be announced handset is usually referred to as the iPhone 8, but some analysts have taken to calling it the iPhone 10 or iPhone X because it is Apple's 10th-anniversary smartphone.Besides Apple, Pacific Crest identified Analog Devices (ADI), Applied Materials (AMAT), Broadcom (AVGO) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) as stocks best aligned to benefit from new features in the iPhone 8 and rival smartphones. Broadcom stock hit an all-time high Tuesday, while shares of both Analog Devices and Applied materials touched 16-year-plus highs.Apple stock, meanwhile, rose 0.72% on the stock market today to a record high of 136.70.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 78, meaning it has outperformed 78% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

154,ADI,"Chinese smartphone maker Vivo is expected to be first to market with a highly anticipated new smartphone feature: a fingerprint sensor embedded in the display, analysts said Monday.The in-display fingerprint sensor is seen as one of the big features of Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 smartphone because it will eliminate the need for a physical home button and allow for a bigger display. But Vivo looks like it will be first with the new feature, beating smartphone giants Samsung and Apple.Vivo is expected to announce a new smartphone with in-display fingerprint sensing at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai conference, which runs Wednesday through Saturday.Vivo is expected to use a Qualcomm (QCOM) ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a report Sunday.Other companies developing in-display fingerprint sensors include Goodix; Analog Devices (ADI), using technology licensed from Sonavation; and Synaptics (SYNA), he said.Synaptics is believed to be working with Samsung to incorporate its technology in upcoming smartphones.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page, Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.In a report Monday, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said he also believes the Vivo phone will use a Qualcomm fingerprint sensor.Synaptics in-display fingerprint reader technology is likely to be delayed until the second quarter of 2018 as the company works to improve its accuracy, Zhang said. Synaptics is expected to get some meaningful design wins for its optical fingerprint sensor in the second half of 2017, he said.Qualcomm stock lost 0.6% to close at 56.56 on the stock market today.

156,ADI,"Since equity ETFs are essentially a basket of stocks, they tend to trade like individual stocks but can be less volatile since there are many other holdings.Today's two picks are at the top of their respective flat bases. For those who prefer to buy when an ETF bounces off its 50-day moving average, both funds are also within striking distance from a recent rebound.XVanguard Growth (VUG) closed Monday just shy of a 129.87 flat-base buy point. It found support near the 50-day line last week and is up about 2% from the support line. Shares advanced nearly 8% from their prior touch of the 50-day line to the June 2 intraday high.The fund, which tracks the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index, has attracted north of $27 billion in assets. Technology was for the biggest chunk of assets, at almost 28% as of June 30, followed by 18% in consumer cyclical and 15% in health care, according to Morningstar Inc. Consumer defensive and industrials made up about 9% each.The tech-heavy stance is evident in the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's class A (GOOGL) and class C (GOOG) shares. Those five names accounted for nearly one-fifth of total assets; each of the stocks have rallied more than 20% this year.VUG has outperformed the S&P 500 year to date by 17.3% to 11.1% through July 14. It's slightly outpaced the benchmark index based on three- and five-year average annual returns. For the 10-year period, the ETF returned an average annual 8.6% vs. 7% for the S&P 500. VUG carries a 0.06% expense ratio.Also closing in on a flat-base entry, at 109.85, and within 2% of its recent bounce off the 50-day line is iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth (IWP). The fund advanced nearly 5% from a late-April breakout from a flat base to the start of its current pattern.The $7.7 billion fund, which celebrated its 16th anniversary Monday, provides exposure to domestic midsize companies that are expected to grow their earnings at an above-average pace vs. the market. Top holdings as of July 13 included drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS), chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) and Illumina (ILMN), a maker of gene-sequencing systems.Technology was also the biggest sector weighting for the fund, at 23% of assets. IWP, whose 15-year average annual return of 10.8% is ahead of the S&P 500's 9% gain, has a 0.25% expense ratio.Monday's emerging markets picks were little changed: iShares Emerging Markets Dividend (DVYE) remains just below a 41.40 flat-base buy point, while SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) is still in buy range from a 30.88 flat-base entry.RELATED:For Outsize Dividends, Check Out These 2 Hot Emerging Markets PlaysLook Outside The U.S. For Top Dividend Funds So Far This YearCan The Bull Keep Running In The Second Half?

157,ADI,"Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has staged a big turnaround since crashing 28% after reporting in-line results for the first quarter on May 1, and it showed up in its shares Wednesday following the company's launch of its Epyc server chips and a bullish analyst report.AMD stock jumped 10.6% to finish regular-session trading at 13.98 on the stock market today. AMD shares hit a recent low of 9.85 on May 3 after its first-quarter report.Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsay on Wednesday reiterated his buy rating on AMD stock and raised his price target to 20 from 17.Ramsay said he is impressed by AMD's new Epyc server chips for data centers, showcased at a launch event Tuesday in Austin, Texas. Joining AMD at the event were customers and partners backing Epyc, including Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure unit, Baidu (BIDU), Dell Technologies (DVMT) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), he said.""AMD has built the foundation to re-emerge as a solid competitor in the enterprise, cloud and storage tiers of the server market and to uniquely combine CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit) technologies to add unique value to customers for deep learning and AI (artificial intelligence),"" Ramsay said in a note to clients.In the data center market, AMD competes with Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA).IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now features seven chip-industry players including Nvidia and Microchip Technology.Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore is cautious about AMD's prospects. In a report Wednesday, he maintained his equal-weight, or neutral, rating on AMD with a price target of 11.""After attending the product launch in Austin, we think the ecosystem has developed faster than we would have expected in the early going, in terms of partners and customers openly highlighting their usage of Epyc,"" Moore said. ""It's nice progress, though we still think bulls underestimate longer-term challenges.""Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell kept his overweight rating on Analog Devices (ADI), but lowered his price target on the stock to 94 from 103.McConnell is upbeat about Analog Devices because of its exposure to the automotive chip business and synergies from its recent acquisition of Linear Technology. But he lowered his estimates for the company's consumer device business because of lower sales to customer Apple (AAPL).Meanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on Intel stock to neutral from buy and cut its price target to 38 from 42.The investment bank predicted that Intel will lose market share to AMD's latest server chips and Nvidia's artificial intelligence processors.Analog Devices stock was up 1%, near 80.10, in afternoon trading Wednesday.

158,ADI,"Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI) could grapple for Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), which is rumored to be on the sales block amid heavy chip industry M&A action.Maxim stock was up 7% Wednesday afternoon on a report that Texas Instruments was looking to acquire the company. Reports last week had Analog Devices doing the same. Texas Instruments stock was down nearly 1% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, while Analog Devices stock was up a fraction.Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Texas Instruments is in talks to acquire Maxim. Maxim, which has an $11 billion market value, might not sell unless the company's receives a high premium, sources told Bloomberg.An $11 billion offer would actually be on the low end in terms of big chip industry deals this year. Broadcom (BRCM) is being acquired by Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago (AVGO) for a whopping $37 billion.That deal, announced in May, was the biggest pure-tech merger — until this month's announced $67 billion merger of Dell and EMC (EMC).In June, Intel (INTC) agreed to buy Altera (ALTR) for $16.7 billion.This month, Lam Research (LRCX) announced it plans to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC) for $10.6 billion. That same day Western Digital (WDC) said it agreed to acquire SanDisk (SNDK) for $19 billion.Also this month, Microsemi (MSCC) leaped over the bid by Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) in a battle to acquire PMC-Sierra (PMCS), making a $2.4 billion offer.Chip M&A action has ramped amid an industry downturn with slowing growth, increasing costs and competition, and macroeconomic concerns, particularly in China, analysts say.Maxim makes sense for Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, analysts say, and both figure in on the M&A speculation.Texas Instruments CEO Kevin March, however, seemed doubtful of joining the M&A move, in comments during the company's recent Q2 earnings conference call with analysts.""We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe we're focused on the two best opportunities that are out there today, being analog and embedded processing,"" March told analysts. ""So those two reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A.""MKM Partners analyst Ian Ing suggested in a research report that Texas Instruments might want to change its M&A tune.""Assuming robust M&A activity, we think the potential exists for the creation of an analog competitor with comparable scale and cost leadership,"" he wrote. ""Texas Instruments may need to respond pre-emptively and become acquisitive.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter and on Facebook.

The bid topped Skyworks' earlier all-cash bid valued at roughly $2 billion, or $10.50 a share, announced after the close on Oct. 5.Under the terms of Microsemi's proposal, PMC shareholders will receive $8.75 in cash and 0.0736 of a share of Microsemi common stock for each share of PMC common stock. Microsemi put the offer at a 50% premium to PMC's closing price on Oct. 5.The implied total transaction is valued at about $2.4 billion, and the implied enterprise value is $2.2 billion, net of PMC's net cash balance on June 27, according to Microsemi.'Engage In Discussions'On Oct. 20, PMC acknowledged receipt of Microsemi's unsolicited bid: ""PMC's board of directors believes, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Microsemi proposal would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal ... so it has determined to engage in discussions with Microsemi.""But PMC says that there can be no ""assurances that any definitive agreement or transaction"" will result from Microsemi's offer and that it has yet to determine whether Microsemi's offer constitutes a ""superior proposal"" over Skyworks' bid.Still, PMC adds that its board continues to recommend the merger pact with Skyworks. The boards of both Skyworks and PMC have approved the transaction between the two companies, which is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2016, subject to PMC shareholders' OK, Skyworks said.Microsemi provides chips for communications, defense, security, aerospace and industrial markets. Products include high-performance analog and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) — chips that can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing; timing and synchronization devices; power management products; voice-processing devices; radio-frequency chips; security technologies; scalable anti-tamper products; and others.PMC's portfolio enables many different types of communications-network infrastructure equipment in the storage, mobile and optical networks market segments.Microsemi is no stranger to acquisitions, having purchased more than 40 companies. In the last five years, it's completed a number of large, transformative acquisitions, including Actel, Zarlink, Symmetricom and most recently Vitesse Semiconductor in April.Microsemi is expected to put up a good fight to come out a winner.""I think Microsemi really wants this deal and expect they will continue to pursue PMC,"" Raymond James analyst Steven Smigie told IBD. ""For Skyworks, the deal helps them diversify their business a little. It's helpful for them. But they don't have a hole in their portfolio where they need to buy PMC.""Smigie says the PMC transaction is the type of deal Microsemi likes.""(PMC) is struggling a bit, and there's a lot of costs they can take out,"" he said. ""It's a good fit with Microsemi with the type of portfolio Microsemi typically buys. My feeling from speaking to management over time: this (company) is something Microsemi will be more aggressive about buying. My thinking is Microsemi is more likely to win at end of day.""According to the company, Microsemi and PMC have been in negotiations for the past 18 months.Microsemi has much to gain from acquiring PMC.""We believe this transaction offers compelling strategic and financial benefits for the shareholders of both Microsemi and PMC,"" Microsemi CEO James Peterson said. ""This acquisition will provide Microsemi with a leading position in high-performance and scalable storage solutions targeted for data-center and cloud applications while also adding a complementary portfolio of high-value communications products.""Microsemi expects the transaction to be immediately accretive to Microsemi's non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. Microsemi estimates more than 60 cents of non-GAAP EPS accretion in the first full year after closing the transaction.Microsemi sees greater than $100 million in total cost synergies, with $75 million in operating savings realized in the first full quarter of the combined operations.Robust GrowthMicrosemi has been faring handsomely on the financial front with its current mix.It's seen six straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. In the third quarter, earnings rose 17% to 68 cents a share. Sales increased 8.5% to $317.1 million.Revenue in its aerospace segment was up 16% from a year earlier in the third quarter, propelled by strength in commercial-air end markets, Peterson said on the quarter's conference call. Commercial-air end markets saw ""record results in booking, benefiting from strong industry fundamentals, (and) increasing content on next-generation aircraft,"" he said.The company's defense end markets ""are recovering and poised to take a leadership role in driving future results,"" he added.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 24% to $2.72 a share. They expect a 16% gain in 2016.In announcing the bid for PMC, Microsemi said that it expects fourth-quarter EPS of 72 to 74 cents, in line with prior guidance.Microsemi intends to fund the PMC transaction and repay its existing credit facility with existing cash, $2.7 billion in new transaction debt and about $600 million in Microsemi common stock.Shareholders of Microsemi would own roughly 85% of the combined entity after completion of the transaction, and PMC shareholders would own 15%.Meanwhile, Microsemi's stock fell 5.43% on Monday, Oct. 19, the day it announced the deal. It then slipped Tuesday and Wednesday, recovering Thursday and Friday for a 2.9% loss for the week, closing at 36.26, just a hair below its all-time high set in the prior week.""They levered up a lot to get the deal done,"" said Smigie. ""The environment is soft out there, and (having a lot of debt) makes people a little nervous. Also, we've been seeing a big run in the stock, and a lot of people might want to cash out.""Another reason for the stock decline may be some ""fears"" that there could be a bidding war that ""could force Microsemi to either increase the amount of debt, or it's going to have to give away more stock, which would make it more costly for them,"" he added.Microsemi is a part of IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, where it earns a 94 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99. Other members of the group include Analog Devices (ADI) and Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), both of which have 95 Composite Ratings.

187,ADI,"Wall Street analysts on Monday raised their price targets on a bunch of top-performing chip stocks, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Microchip Technology (MCHP).XNvidia and Microchip are both on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. The list currently includes three chipmakers and three semiconductor capital equipment suppliers.Needham reiterated its buy rating on graphics-chip maker Nvidia and raised its price target to 200 from 130. Jefferies maintained its buy rating on Nvidia and upped its price target to 180 from 140.Mizuho Securities kept its neutral rating on Microchip, but increased its price target to 82 from 80.Nvidia soared 4.7% to 153.70 on the stock market today. Microchip rose 0.5% to 78.76.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill increased his price target on Nvidia stock on expectations that the company's recent deal with Toyota Motor (TM) will generate ""meaningful revenue over the next 24 months.""Toyota is using Nvidia chip sets for advanced driver assistance systems and eventually self-driving cars.Gill estimates that the Toyota deal could generate an incremental $1 billion to $1.7 billion in revenue and 35 to 65 cents in earnings per share over 2.5 years.Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis sees Nvidia as a ""key beneficiary of the 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing"" because it supplies systems for deep learning applications.""Nvidia's decadelong investment in CUDA, its proprietary GPU-processing language has resulted in a multiyear competitive advantage, that has yet to be fully appreciated by investors,"" Lipacis said in a note to clients. Nvidia is a leader in graphics processing units, or GPUs.Previous shifts in computing included the move from mainframes to minicomputers, minicomputers to PCs, and PCs to mobile phones and data centers. The latest shift is to parallel processing, artificial intelligence and the internet of things, Lipacis said.In addition to Nvidia, other chipmakers likely to benefit from the growth of parallel processing include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cavium (CAVM) and Xilinx (XLNX), he said.Lipacis upgraded Cavium and Xilinx to buy from hold. He raised his price target on Cavium to 79 from 73 and upped his price target on Xilinx to 77 from 68.Likely beneficiaries of the internet-of-things trend include Analog Devices (ADI), Microchip Technology, Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Intel (INTC) has ""the most to lose"" in the shift from traditional data centers to parallel processing and internet of things. As such, Lipacis downgraded Intel stock to underperform from hold and slashed his price target to 29 from 38.Intel dropped 0.7% to 33.65 on Monday.Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh updated his ratings on a host of semiconductor stocks on Monday.He raised his price targets on AMD, Microchip, Texas Instruments and Xilinx, but cut his target on Qorvo (QRVO).Rakesh reiterated his buy rating on AMD and upped his price target to 15 from 14. AMD is seen benefiting from second-half 2017 game console sales and improved demand for PCs and graphics processors.Microchip is continuing to see strong orders from automotive and industrial markets, Rakesh said.Texas Instruments also is benefiting from growth in the automotive and industrial markets. Rakesh rates TI as neutral, but upped his price target to 82 from 78.Xilinx is seeing opportunities in automotive and 5G wireless deployments, but trades at a premium multiple, Rakesh said. He rates Xilinx as neutral, but raised his price target to 68 from 64.Qorvo is likely to be impacted by near-term weakness in the China mobile phone market and faces high expectations for wireless revenue in the September quarter. Rakesh maintained his hold rating on Qorvo and cut his price target to 70 from 72.RELATED:Apple-Qualcomm Legal Dispute Likely To Be 'Long And Ugly'Chipmakers Microsemi, Skyworks Solutions Snare Fresh Buy Ratings

188,ADI,"The Nasdaq fell for a second straight week, with many big-cap techs struggling, while the Dow industrials edged higher for a fourth straight weekly gain. It's an uneven market. With the uptrend under pressure, investors should be especially cautious about buying even leading stocks.X In a choppy market, breakouts are more apt to fail. Apple (AAPL) chipmakers Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS), along with NetEase (NTES) and Ciena (CIEN) have all seen their breakouts fail in recent days.IBD'S TAKE: The ""M"" in CAN SLIM stands for market. Here's why market direction is key to winning in stocks.Analog Devices broke out of a cup base on May 30. The next day, Analog Devices reported strong earnings, and shares sprinted almost 7% soon after the open to 90.49. But Analog pulled all the way back to 85.76 by the close. In the next three sessions, Analog plunged through its buy point and then its 50-day moving average. Since then shares have been up and down, though they are currently just above their 50-day line.Texas Instruments tried several times to clear an 82.54 buy point, finally appearing to do so last week. But the stock plunged 4.1% last Friday. This week, TI is down 2%, moving below its 50-day line. While Texas Instruments hasn't fallen 7%-8% below the entry points, the technical action has not been encouraging.Cirrus Logic initially cleared a cup-base entry on April 7, but moved in and out of a buy zone until after a May 18 rebound from the 50-day line. Cirrus Logic then steadily rose, even becoming extended in early June. But shares tumbled 5.4% on Friday and 4% on Monday, dropping below their buy point and the 50-day line. The stock is now 12% off its high, making that old entry point invalid.The iPhone chipmakers' stumbles come amid Apple's own stock woes. Apple consolidated for several weeks, and appeared to be on its way toward sketching a short flat base. But shares crashed 3.9% last Friday. This week, the stock has fallen 4.5%. And unlike many leading techs, Apple hasn't found support at its 50-day moving average.The Chinese mobile-gaming platform broke out of a cup-with-handle base on June 5. NetEase was clearing a late-stage base, which is more likely fail. Still, shares extended gains the next session. But after hitting an all-time intraday high on June 7, shares began to reverse hard, falling below the entry area on Tuesday and continuing to fall. The depth of NetEase's decline from the high and the buy point both make the old buy point invalid, even with Friday's modest rebound.NetEase's retreat came amid a pullback by many Chinese internet giants. YY (YY), a live group video-chat player, saw its own late-May breakout trigger a sell signal this week.The fiber-optic gear giant gapped out of a cup base on June 1 on earnings, soaring 16% to 27.19, just above a 26.94 buy point. But two sessions later, Ciena was below the entry, and shares have now fallen far enough to make the buy point invalid.RELATED:The Big Picture: Two Sectors Move Up3 Chip Stocks Are Plays On iPhone 8-Led Wireless Charging Shift3 China-Based Leaders, 2 Sell Signals And Signs Of StrengthTired Of Tech Swings?

189,ADI,"Technology stocks still led the U.S. stock market with less than an hour to go on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's minutes from its latest interest-rate policy meeting in June did not appear to show any significant surprises in the central bank's thinking on the economy.The minutes noted that while the U.S. economy continues to show strength in the labor markets and business spending, inflation remains a concern as the Fed continues to gradually raise the cost of money back to normal levels. ""Recent readings on headline and core PCE price inflation had come in lower than participants had expected,"" the minutes noted. ""On a 12-month basis, headline PCE price inflation was running somewhat below the committee's 2% objective in April, partly because of factors that appeared to be transitory.""The Nasdaq composite, powered by a broad rally in the semiconductor sector, rose nearly 0.6% at 3:20 p.m. ET. At the session's high of 6163, the tech-centered index was slightly above its 50-day moving average. It challenged buying support at that intermediate-term support line on June 29. The Nasdaq 100 gained more than 1.1%.A sharp drop in crude oil futures hit the pause button for a rebound in energy stocks, weighing partly on the other broad equity indexes. U.S. oil futures sank more than 4% to $45.07 a barrel.The S&P 500 rose 0.1% while the Dow Jones industrial average was flat.Among IBD's 197 industry groups ranked daily for relative performance, the chipmaking, chip design and chipmaking equipment groups occupied three of the top four spots, with gains of 1.5% or more. Gaming software, design software, desktop software and internet retailing stocks also led the market, with each group rising more than 1%.Volume on both main exchanges is almost guaranteed to be higher vs. Monday, which was a half-day session that ended at 1 p.m. ET; the markets were closed on Tuesday for the Fourth of July holiday.While Intel (INTC) remains sluggish, as seen by its poor relative performance since a Jan. 24 breakout past a 37.44 cup-with-handle entry failed, shares enjoyed a solid 2% gain to 34.22 in about average turnover. Watch to see if the former big-cap tech leader, which has already issued a few sell signals this year, has the muscle to rebound back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are near 35.65 and 35.97, respectively.The king of microprocessors for computers and other electronic devices has a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 54, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. However, it's expected to grow quarterly earnings in the June quarter by 15%, which would mark the third quarter of double-digit EPS gains in four quarters.In Intel's semiconductor manufacturing industry group, eight names have an IBD Composite Rating of 90 or higher and trade at 10 a share or higher.  Power Integrations (POWI) and IXYS (IXYS) are both holding nicely above their respective 50-day moving averages, while Macom Tech (MTSI), No. 40 in the IBD 50, is currently testing support.However, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Analog Devices (ADI), Tower Semiconductor (TSEM), Microchip Tech (MCHP) and Skyworks (SWKS) are currently treading below their 50-day lines.Continued price action below the 50-day would imply that institutional investors are taking a break from heavy buying and are more inclined to take some profits. Mild corrections could lead to future bases forming.Skyworks, up more than 2% to 97.68, is still nearly 13% below a 52-week peak of 121.11. That is enough of a decline for the Apple iPhone chip supplier to create a shallow new cup or flat-base pattern. Fundamentals are improving at the Woburn, Mass., firm, which stopped a two-quarter slump in profits by growing earnings per share 1% and 16% in the prior two quarters.The Street sees earnings rebounding even faster in the June-ended fiscal third quarter, rising 23% to $1.52 a share, which would mark the strongest gain in six quarters. Analysts see revenue increasing 18% to $890.5 million, then up an additional 17% to $973.7 million in the September-ending fiscal fourth quarter.Skyworks gets a 91 Composite Rating, far superior to the 54 score of Intel.Among the nine chipmakers mentioned above, Microchip earns the highest Composite Rating of 98. Earnings are seen jumping 24% to $4.96 a share in fiscal 2018, ending in March next year.RELATED:Is It Time To Sell Intel?Inside IBD 50: Why It's Important To Think ""Small Supply""Where Are Stocks Headed?

190,ADI,"As the tech-heavy Nasdaq comes under selling pressure again and top chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) pull back from recent highs, Cypress Semiconductor (CY) is trying to design a new breakout.X Based on Wednesday's action, Cypress reached an important technical milestone, with its Relative Strength (RS) Rating jumping into the 80-plus percentile with an improvement to 81, a rise from 65 the day before. Over 100 years of market history shows that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains tend to have an RS Rating of over 80 as they launch their biggest price moves.Cypress Semiconductor is working on a consolidation with a 15.08 entry. It retook its 50-day moving average on Wednesday and found support at that benchmark line on Thursday. The stock closed about 7% below the buy point.See if it can clear the breakout price in volume at least 40% above average. Keep in mind that it's a later-stage pattern, and investors should be aware that those involve more risk.In terms of fundamental health, Cypress Semiconductor has posted three quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including a spike from 15% to 86% in Q1. Sales gains have also risen over the same time frame, with a rise from 18% to 27% last quarter.Cypress Semiconductor holds the No. 10 rank among its peers in the Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group.

191,ADI,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turn higher Friday after the Nasdaq composite closed Thursday below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell back below their 50-day lines, joining Apple, Netflix and many others. Some stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), are holding support. But they are fighting against the tide.Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value after falling for much of the overnight session. Futures for the S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and Dow futures climbed 0.35%. Crude futures rose nearly 1% after gaining for several days in a row.XThis year's broad tech rally was fueled by several big trends: FANG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet, plus Apple), China internets, chipmakers, optical gear plays and, more recently, enterprise software firms.But more and more stocks are breaking 50-day lines or round-tripping on breakouts.Apple tumbled below its 50-day moving average on June 10 and hasn't found a way back. Even with recent struggles, including Thursday's 1.5% loss, Apple is still up 24% in 2017, the third-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Microsoft and Alphabet on Tuesday closed just below their 50-day lines and bounced back on Wednesday. On Thursday, both Microsoft and Google's parent fell more decisively below that key support line. Microsoft and Alphabet are among the biggest cloud-computing rivals to much-larger Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: The market direction is still uptrend under pressure, which means investors should be cautious about taking new positions and ready to take profits and cut losses quickly. Pay attention to the leading stocks and major averages and read The Big Picture daily.Facebook traded below its 50-day line intraday for the fifth time in June, but once again closed above that line. Facebook announced this week that it has topped two billion monthly users. What makes that even more amazing is that the social giant is blocked in China, the world's largest internet market.Amazon has pulled back toward its 50-day line but has found support so far. Amazon continues to roil the retail, apparel and broader consumer fields, with Nike (NKE) confirming in its Thursday night earnings call that it will sell some shoes directly via the e-commerce giant.Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) have fallen below their 50-day lines. NetEase (NTES) is once again round-tripping its late-stage breakout.

Lumentum (LITE), which is seen as a possible Apple iPhone 3D sensor play, is close to round-tripping.Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) and SAP (SAP) are all below their 50-day moving averages.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both had strong earnings last week, are holding up well so far.While many techs are weak, financials are making gains, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) a notable breakout this week. Big banks announced huge dividend hikes and stock buybacks late Wednesday after passing the second round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Meanwhile, higher Treasury yields, while a negative for the broader stock market (and housing stocks in particular), also are giving a lift to financials.Meanwhile, biotechs have been big winners in June. Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN) are two big-name breakouts, but there have been others.Defense and aerospace firms like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have held up well, either within buy range or just extended.In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 1.7% but China's Shanghai composite rose 0.1% 0.2%.

192,ADI,"Chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) early Wednesday posted better-than-expected sales and earnings per share for its fiscal second quarter and guided Wall Street higher for the current quarter.Analog Devices reported adjusted earnings of $1.03 a share, up 61% year over year, on revenue of $1.15 billion, up 47%, for the quarter ended April 29. Analysts expected the Norwood, Mass.-based company to earn 84 cents a share on sales of $1.1 billion.For the current quarter, Analog Devices expects to earn $1.14 a share excluding items, up 39%, on sales of $1.38 billion, up 55%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling for $1.04 and $1.35 billion.Shares initially jumped as much as 6.7% but pared gains at closed up 1.1% at 85.76 on the stock market today. Analog Devices stock broke out of a cup base with a buy point of 84.34 on Tuesday. ADI stock was up 53% from the start of 2016 through Tuesday's close. It previously broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 67.01 on Nov. 15 and a flat base with a buy point of 74.97 on Jan. 25.Analog Devices makes analog, digital and mixed-signal processors for industrial, telecommunications, computer and consumer electronics markets.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes nine chip industry players, including Nvidia and Cavium.""Business conditions during the quarter were strong, and our results were above the high end of our revised guidance range led by broad-based strength, particularly in the industrial end market,"" Analog Devices Chief Executive Vincent Roche said in a prepared statement. ""In addition, we closed the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation and are on track with our integration activities. This acquisition creates a high-performance analog industry powerhouse, and I am confident that we are well on our way to creating tremendous value for our customers, employees, and shareholders.""The news hasn't been all great for ADI recently.Rosenblatt Securities predicted last week that ADI would be a component-share loser in Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 smartphone. Analog Devices lost the Force Touch component business to a competitor for the OLED iPhone, Rosenblatt said.RELATED:Two Major Chip Stocks Break Out To Buy Points While Another TumblesApple iPhone 8 Chip Winners And Losers Predicted

207,ADI,"X The major indexes fell mildly in unison Tuesday and volume rose on both exchanges, according to preliminary figures. The action hints at a new instance of heavier than normal institutional selling as investors seek clues to how the British national elections will play out.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 both dropped 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average, seeing four of its 30 components fall 1 point or more, lost 0.2%.A rally in metals and oil stocks, particularly in gold mining, oil exploration and oil and gas field services, helped blunt the overall market decline. U.S. near-term expiring crude oil futures advanced 1.8% to $48.26 a barrel, further underlining the market's tendency in recent months to hold close to the $50 level.Gold futures rallied more than 1% to $1,295.80 a troy ounce on the Comex. The heavily traded SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF, meanwhile, gained 1.1% to 123.12 as volume climbed 31% above usual levels. It was the ETF's second upward gap in price in three sessions, a bullish sign for gold. Further gains could mark a shattering of a nearly six-year downtrend that began in September 2011.Back to equities, a handful of stocks with good IBD SmartSelect Ratings got handed bigger losses than the general market. Such action is normal for the best growth stocks. But if selling intensifies among the key indexes, expect true high-growth companies to fall as much as 1.5 to 2.5 times the market's general decline.This is why when the key indexes fall 10% or more, you tend to see more stocks fall anywhere from 15% to 25% or more from their 52-week highs. Those that fall the least show the most power and are more capable of building and finishing brand-new bases.Criteo (CRTO) sank hard for a second day in a row, losing support at the key 50-day moving average. Shares dropped more than 2% to 47.75 in volume running nearly 90% above usual levels. Those who bought at the January breakout past a 44.24 buy point should consider at least selling some shares to preserve profits because the stock has triggered a sell signal.The French digital-advertising giant is on track to see a further slowdown in earnings growth following some blockbuster quarters in FY 2016. Q1 profit grew just 7% to 46 cents a share, amid a 29% jump in revenue to $516.7 million, and Q2 profit is seen rising just 3% to 34 cents a share. In the year-ago quarter, earnings vaulted 106% to 33 cents.Criteo is part of IBD's Commercial Services-Advertising industry group, and shows mixed ratings including a decent but not great Composite Rating of 83, an 87 EPS Rating, and an A for Sales + Margins + Return on equity (SMR). However, due to big drops on Monday and Tuesday, Criteo's Relative Price Strength Rating has slid to a mediocre 65 on a scale of 1 to 99. This means that the stock is now performing just 65% of all public companies over the past 12 months.Check all of a stock's most important gauges of fundamentals, price strength, and level of institutional ownership via IBD's time-saving Stock Checkup tool.A pair of consumer-spending plays have not triggered sell signals, but they should both be watched carefully for potential weakness. Diet products expert Nutrisystem (NTRI) slumped more than 2% to 50.15 in average volume. The stock is now basing but is seeing stubborn upside resistance at the 50-day moving average. Grubhub (GRUB) fell nearly 2% to 43.76, but volume was dull. The mobile and online food ordering service is holding a slim gain above a 42.35 breakout point.Grubhub's second-quarter earnings are seen rising 13% to 26 cents a share, which would mark the smallest increase in five quarters. In the year-ago quarter, earnings jumped 35%, making for a tough comparison. But revenue growth continues to stay hearty.Elsewhere, Analog Devices (ADI) showed some mettle, rising more than 1.4% to 80.10 and hoisting itself back above the critical 50-day moving average in solid turnover.The fast-growing chipmaker still has a lot of ground to recover after last week's breakout past an 84.34 cup buy point quickly turned tail. However, support near 80 and the 50-day line provide some clues that institutional investors are not completely fleeing the stock.In fact, mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares have climbed nicely in recent quarters, up to 1,610 funds and a combined 192.4 million shares as of the end of Q1 this year, vs. 1,288 funds and 177.8 million shares at the end of June 2016.Dave & Buster's (PLAY) rallied 3% to 70.14 and new highs in blistering trade. After the market close, the restaurant-cum-family-fun-arcade chain reported 98 cents a share in fiscal Q1 profit, up a healthy 36% and well above the consensus view of 81 cents.After-tax margin also improved nicely, rising 220 basis points to 14.1%, certainly a quarterly record since the company went public in October 2014 at 16 a share.Shares fell more than 2.6% in after-hours trade but are still sharply extended past a prior flat-base breakout at 58.35. The six-week flat base began forming in early January.RELATED:The Case For A New Bull Run In GoldETF Action: Which Gold-Related Funds Moved Sharply Today?

208,ADI,"X The major indexes, including the Dow Jones industrial average, refused to move far from the break-even line amid lackluster volume on Monday. Investors appear to be waiting for news later in the week that includes Thursday's scheduled congressional testimony by ousted FBI chief James Comey, the British general elections the same day and a European Central Bank monetary policy meeting.Meanwhile, government bond prices didn't move much following data showing that wage inflation is still relatively tame. Unit labor costs in the U.S. came in at a revised gain of 2.2% in Q1, missing the Econoday consensus view of 2.6%. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond was at 2.18%, still down sharply from a March 13% high of 2.62%.The Dow Jones industrial average spent much of Monday's session in barely negative territory before finishing near 21,201, down about 0.1%. It rode gains of 1.3% and 0.6% in the prior two weeks. The S&P 500 ended Monday's session off 0.1%.The Nasdaq was off less than 0.2%. Small caps, however, cooled off after solid gains last week. The S&P SmallCap 600, which throttled 1.7% higher last week, lost around 0.7%.Losing industry groups included dairy product, generic drug, integrated telecom service, staffing, diversified operations and fiber-optic telecom gear, all of which slipped more than 1%. Leisure service, long-term medical care, wood product and paint stocks also fell 1% or more.Some semiconductor plays showed some profit-taking. The chip sector is currently No. 1 among 33 groups for mid-to-long-term relative price performance. Chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI), which currently ranks No. 13 in the IBD Big Cap 20, staged a third day in a row of steep losses in heavy trade and dropped more than 3% to 78.50 in double normal volume. At its intraday low of 78.26, Analog triggered the loss-cutting sell rule for those who bought during last week's breakout past an 84.34 cup buy point.Cup-without-handle bases tend to have a higher risk of failure. However, in Analog's case, a rest was already likely due since the stock initially broke out as early as July 2016, when it rallied past a 59.97 first-stage breakout.From here, long-term holders should watch to see if the stock can find stickiness near its 50-day moving average. Another key price level is its recent low of 74.65.Broadcom (AVGO), part of the fabless semiconductor industry group, fell nearly 1% to 252.21 in quick turnover, yet its overall uptrend remains unperturbed. The diverse chip supplier remains a true market leader due to outstanding fundamentals and excellent price action. Thus, investors may want to continue tracking the stock for potential new buy points.Broadcom, which has grown its earnings per share by 19%, 29%, 38%, 51% and 46% in the past five quarters, currently holds a 10% gain after breaking out of a fresh flat base at 227.85.Also worth watching closely are new IPO Canada Goose (GOOS), business and videoconferencing software expert LogMeIn (LOGM), Arista Networks (ANET) and Chinese social media giant YY (YY). The latter three are all members of IBD's Sector Leaders screen.Canada Goose (GOOS), which specializes in high-end outerwear, soared nearly 4% to a new high of 22.50. The small-cap new issue, which went public at 12.75 a share in March, has now gained more than 21% since clearing a first-stage IPO base at 18.50.Sales have grown magnificently in recent years (up 44% in fiscal 2015, up 33% in 2016, and up 39% to $404 million in FY 2017 ended in March), but Canada Goose's profit record is less exciting. FY 2017 profit fell nearly 19% to 94 cents a share, and the Street sees profit sinking an additional 62% to 36 cents a share.However, despite the company posting on Friday a net loss of $1.02 a share in the just ended March fiscal fourth quarter, investors bid up the stock sharply.Canada Goose trades on average 697,000 shares a day.LogMeIn, in contrast, is in buy range after Monday's 1.9% decline snapped a five-day winning streak. At 111.85, the stock is up nearly 2% after clearing a 110.10 buy point in a shallow cup-like base on April 24.Given that the provider of ""Go To"" family of web-based conferencing software products has pulled back mildly in recent weeks without touching its 50-day moving average, the post-breakout action for now seems normal.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see second-quarter profit up an outstanding 90% to 93 cents a share, following excellent EPS gains of 40%, 22%, 22% and 143% in the prior four quarters. Top-line growth ranged from 16% to 135% over the same time frame.Arista Networks, up more than 1% to 154.33 and new highs, continues to gain ground after clearing a 135.37 three-weeks-tight entry that became a four-weeks-tight pattern. These extremely narrow patterns allow investors to add a small amount to a winning position. YY edged mildly lower to 59.05 and is feeling some upside resistance near 60. Gains are decent since the stock moved past a 56.31 cup-with-handle entry. The five-day handle began on May 16.Be sure to look at both daily and weekly charts to spot well-formed handles.

210,ADI,"X Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) received a flood of price-target hikes from Wall Street analysts on Friday after it posted fiscal second-quarter results that were better than expected and guided higher for the current quarter. Meanwhile, industry peer Analog Devices (ADI) got a stock-rating downgrade.Broadcom got at least 12 price-target increases from investment banks following its fiscal second-quarter report late Thursday.Among the firms raising their targets on the stock were Barclays, Canaccord Genuity, Cowen, Craig Hallum, Jefferies, JPMorgan, Mizuho, Oppenheimer, Pacific Crest, RBC Capital Markets, Rosenblatt Securities and Susquehanna Financial Group.The most bullish of the bunch were JPMorgan and Susquehanna, which each upped their targets to 300. JPMorgan was previously at 260, while Susquehanna was at 275.Broadcom ended the trading day at an all-time closing high, up 8.5% to 254.53 on the stock market today, just off its intraday high of 255.82. Broadcom shares broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 227.85 on May 9.The company's second-quarter results benefited from chip-content gains in Samsung's Galaxy S8 smartphone. Broadcom also is seen gaining content share in Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 smartphone.Broadcom could see a 40% content gain in the iPhone 8 and might supply close to $15 of content per phone, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report.Management also dismissed concerns that Broadcom could lose share to Qorvo (QRVO) in the 2018 model iPhone.""Broadcom is a leading global diversified semiconductor company with a broad portfolio of category-leading products and a leading customer base addressing the wireless and wired infrastructure, enterprise and data center networking and storage, IP (internet protocol) traffic routing, and industrial verticals,"" Canaccord analyst Michael Walkley said in a report. ""Strong Q3/fiscal 2017 guidance was well above our expectations and supports our thesis the company is positioned for solid long-term sales and earnings growth with industry-leading margins.""Canaccord rates Broadcom stock as buy, with a price target of 272.Nomura Instinet downgraded shares of Analog Devices to reduce from neutral on Friday. It also cut its price target to 72.50 from 80.Instinet analyst Romit Shah said Wall Street is too enamored with Analog, despite its underwhelming fiscal third-quarter earnings guidance.""We agree that Analog Devices is a high-quality franchise; however, the stock appears overvalued,"" Shah said.Analog guided to adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, excluding a tax benefit, on revenue of $1.41 billion, vs. consensus estimates of $1.05 and $1.36 billion for fiscal Q3.The company early Wednesday reported fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings that beat expectations.Analog stock fell 1.6% to close at 80.91, on Friday. Shares have fallen for two straight days after breaking out of a cup base with a buy point of 84.34 on Tuesday and hitting a nearly 17-year high of 90.49 on Wednesday.Chip gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) received a price-target hike on Friday from Cowen.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri reiterated his outperform rating on the stock and upped his price target to 120 from 115.KLA-Tencor stock finished the regular session up 1.1% to 105.88 Friday, a new closing high and just pennies below its intraday high of 105.92.In a report, Arcuri said he thinks Wall Street's earnings estimates for KLA-Tencor in 2018 are too low.RELATED:Hot Chipmaker Broadcom Soars On Strong Earnings Growth, GuidanceThese 4 Chip Stocks Earned Price-Target Hikes

""It makes sense to in-source your manufacturing.""Skyworks Solutions' (SWKS) $2 billion acquisition of PMC-Sierra (PMCS), announced this month, makes sense, Ing says. Skyworks sells chips to Apple for use in its iPhones, while PMC reaps revenue from Cisco, HP and Dell on the equipment side.By combining, the two firms have stretched their portfolios, Ing says, and count at least four big hitters among customers.Layoffs CertainSummit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan says chipmakers must diversify as sales growth slows. ""One company might have Samsung as a customer, and one company might have Apple as a customer, so by joining forces, no matter who wins, (the chipmakers) win,"" Sundararajan told IBD.Some employees, though, will lose their jobs in these big mergers, he says. Avago and Broadcom estimate $750 million in cost synergy savings. Given a hypothetical $200,000 per employee (accounting for salary and benefits), that means 3,750 layoffs could occur.Which companies are on the hunt?Ing sees Intel, Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Avago as among the likeliest suitors.""Look at Avago; they buy a big company like Broadcom, and after some period of time they're acquisitive again,"" he said. ""Companies are going to do these deals, take a breather, reduce the waste they took on, de-lever their debts and then go shopping again.""

But with broader indexes rising moderately Thursday, some regained a little ground.Apple suppliers highly rated by IBD include Avago, with a Composite Rating of 94 out of a possible 99. Those with a CRs in the 80s include Skyworks and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). ARM has a 76, ADI a 75 and Qualcomm a low 36. Several are trading under their key 50-day lines, so they are not ripe for a buy.Apple stock closed up 2.2% Thursday after falling almost 2% Wednesday.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter @IBD_DHowell.RELATED: Tech Stocks Rally Reverses After Apple Announcement

296,ADI,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rose Thursday morning ahead of key U.S. economic data and amid a report showing Chinese manufacturing contracting. Four recent tech breakouts — Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Analog Devices (ADI), Micron Technology (MU), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Paylocity (PCTY) — remain in buy range.X During Wednesday's session, the major averages reversed lower as oil prices fell and bank stocks tumbled. But while financials remained weak, the S&P 500 and other key index closed with slim losses, capping a solid tech-led month of May.Dow industrials futures rose fractionally vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures were up 0.1% while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed climbed 0.3%.Futures briefly pared most of their gains following the private-sector Caixin survey that showed Chinese manufacturing activity contracting for the first time in nearly a year. That follows slow-but-steady growth from official government data, out earlier in the week, that focuses more on state-owned enterprises.China's Shanghai composite slid 0.5% Thursday. Japan's Nikkei advanced 1.1%, ending a recent slide.In the U.S., investors will get the ISM manufacturing index, the ADP employment report and domestic auto sales for May, ahead of Friday's key jobs report.IBD'S TAKE: Chinese regulators, worried about soaring credit growth, are starting to crack down, having an impact on the world's No. 2 economy in short order. That's the focus of our latest cover story: ""Here's Why China's Latest Growth Scare Should Worry You.""Analog shares rose 2.4% to 84.80 on Tuesday, just moving beyond an 84.34 buy point. On Wednesday, the Apple iPhone supplier shares shot up as high as 90.49, but closed at 85.76, just a 1.1% gain and near session lows. That's not great action, and investors should be cautious. However, shares are well within the 5% chase zone from the entry point.What sparked Wednesday's big move? Analog Devices reported strong earnings and bullish guidance before the market open, though revenue was essentially in line.Analog Devices has been touted as a likely big winner from the upcoming Apple iPhone 8, due out later this year.As for Apple itself, shares dipped 0.6% on Wednesday, continuing to trade tightly over the last few weeks, close to record highs. Apple does not have a potential buy point current after a long run.Analog Devices has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 99% of all stocks based on a variety of IBD proprietary fundamental and technical data. Big-time winners tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of their runs.Paylocity, the lone non-chipmaker highlighted here, is a cloud-based human resources software firm.Paylocity cleared a 45.71 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern on May 25, and shares have remained above the entry since then. Shares fell intraday Wednesday but closed up 0.2% to 46.85.Other cloud-based HR software peers include Paycom (PAYC) and Workday (WDAY). Paycom has been hovering around a three-weeks-tight follow-on buy point, while Workday is modestly extended from a breakout. Workday, which competes against Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), is expected to report a 220% EPS gain late Thursday.Paylocity has a 97 Composite Rating.The memory chipmaker cleared a 29.97 flat base buy point on Tuesday, then edged up 0.2% to 30.77 on Wednesday, still well within buy range. Industry demand and pricing is strong, boosting profits of other memory chip players such as Samsung Electronics and Western Digital (WDC).Micron's CR Rating is an 89, reflecting a poor run of earnings until recently. Memory chip makers' fortunes tend to be highly cyclical, so stocks often start to move on indications of improving industry fundamentals before big earnings come in. Micron is reporting strong results now.Marvell cleared a 16.82 buy point on May 25, then reported strong earnings after the closing bell that session. The next day, shares popped to just out of buying range, but shares have come back modestly this week to 17.24 on Wednesday.Marvell has a 92 Composite Rating.RELATED:The Big Picture: Techs Hot, But 2 Broad Sectors Are StrugglingHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key SupportThis Top Software Firm Has Flipped From Losses: 220% EPS Gain Seen ThursdayChip Stocks And Semiconductor Industry News3 Tech Leaders Near Highs As Earnings Loom: Investing Action Plan

297,ADI,"X The market ended May with a dull thud, running losses of 0.1% across the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average.It was the Nasdaq's seventh straight monthly advance, ending up 2.4% for May. The S&P 500 managed a 1.1% gain, while the Dow industrials eked out only the thinnest of fractional advances.Data played a key role in Wednesday's action, with the Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 opening higher, then reversing sharply after the release of the Chicago Purchasing Manager Index for May at 9:45 a.m. ET, although a corrected version of the PMI showed a much stronger report.The first release of the Chicago PMI showed a reading of 55.2, down hard from the prior month's 58.3 tally and below the consensus view for 57.5. The corrected version showed a May reading of 59.4, its highest mark in 2-1/2 years and well above forecasts.Overnight data out of China showed better-than-expected manufacturing growth in May, but the steel, equipment and mining stocks that would normally react positively to such news came under pressure early in the session. In addition, claims from Libya that production had recovered to above its long-term ceiling of 800,900 barrels helped send crude prices down almost 3%, to $48.32 a barrel, leaving it down 2% for the month.Stocks fell, then gradually regained ground after the release of the Federal Reserve's May Beige Book, which showed continued modest growth, but increasing signs that optimism could be flagging. The report was closely watched because it's the last Beige Book report ahead of the Fed's meeting on interest rates in June, when a majority of investors expect another increase in rates.Pfizer (PFE) led the Dow industrials, up 1.6% after announcing that both the Food & Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency had accepted its submissions to expand the approved use of Sutent to include treatment for recurrent renal cell carcinoma in patients following kidney surgery. Pfizer shares are working on their first weekly advance since late April.Pressure on the S&P 500 came from Michael Kors (KORS), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Goldman and JPMorgan (JPM) drove the downside among Dow stocks.  Goldman tumbled 3% and JPMorgan 2% following the revelation by JPMorgan's CFO Marianne Lake, speaking at an investor conference, that the firm's trading revenue was down 15% year over year.Losses were more subdued on the Nasdaq, with O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Baidu (BIDU) hardest hit, down 2% apiece. At the top of the Nasdaq 100, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) rose 2.7%, taking a new high.Analog Devices (ADI) thrashed 7% higher at the open, then backtracked to close 1% higher in big trade. The Norwood, Mass.-company reported a big fiscal Q2 earnings win and delivered Q3 revenue and earnings guidance above analyst expectations. Shares ended in a buy range from an 84.34 buy point in a flat base.IBD 50 stock Control4 (CTRL) roared 8% higher in big trade. Needham upgraded the connected-home software developer to buy, with a 22 price target. The stock is extended after an April rebound from the 10-week moving average.Drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO) led the S&P 500, up 6% after a strong first-quarter report. But the stock remains deep in a 26-month consolidation.RELATED:3 Tech Leaders Near Highs As Earnings Loom: Investing Action Plan Here's Why You Should Look At Semtech, Broadcom Before Earnings

298,ADI,"X The Nasdaq composite led a mild retreat among key indexes in late afternoon trade Wednesday, but the stock market looks poised to wrap up the month with sterling gains.The Nasdaq, down nearly 0.3% as of 3 p.m. ET, is still hanging on to a monthly gain of more than 2.3%.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, both down about 0.2% in the stock market today, are riding gains of nearly 1% and 0.2% since May 1, respectively. Money center bank, superregional, oil and gas, steel and department store retailing stocks led the downside with sharp losses.Volume on both main exchanges is running sharply higher vs. the same time Tuesday, indicating that some fund managers are opting to take profits with more enthusiasm than usual.Market breadth was negative, with losing stocks beating winners by a roughly 16-11 ratio. But on the NYSE, losers were roughly even with winners. Despite the market's pause, the upside is that high-quality stock leaders are mostly showing robust action. Top-ranked techs such as HR software expert and IBD Leaderboard member Workday (WDAY), graphics processor king Nvidia (NVDA), Lam Research (LRCX) and Alibaba (BABA) are up sharply from proper breakout points and hanging close to all-time highs.Analog Devices (ADI) is building upon its nice stretch of gains since its November 2016 breakout from a first-stage base at 67.01. Shares are up more than 2% to 86.92 and reached as high as 90.49 after the diversified semiconductor giant posted strong fiscal Q2 results (EPS up 61%, revenue up 47% to a record $1.15 billion).The stock is still in buy range after clearing a flat-base buy point of 84.34 on Tuesday. Analog's RS line is poking into new high ground, a bullish sign. The RS Rating of 85 and Accumulation/Distribution grade of B+ are positive as well.The proper buy zone goes up to 88.55, or up to 5% above the correct buy point of 84.34. The Norwood, Mass., firm has already seen more than 10 million shares exchange hands, triple its 50-day average turnover of almost 3.3 million shares.As noted in an IBD tech report earlier today, Analog also upended Wall Street's estimates for the current fiscal third quarter that ends in July. It forecast earnings of $1.14 a share in the midpoint of its target range, up 39%, on sales of $1.38 billion, up 55%. Other names to watch closely for potential breakouts and follow-on entries:Five Below (FIVE) , down 2% to 50.67. The discount retailer briefly poked above a long cup entry at 52.80 on May 19 before fading.Q1 results come out after the market close Thursday. The Street sees earnings rising 17% to 14 cents a share on a 20% jump in sales to $230.7 million. In the prior four quarters, Five Below topped the consensus EPS view by a penny to 2 cents.Five Below, which sells all items at $5 or less, holds a Composite Rating of 95 on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, and the company is expected to see double-digit profit growth in the next two years (up 25% to $1.62 a share in FY 2018 ending in January that year, up 18% in FY 2019). HealthEquity (HQY), up 1.3% to 45.80. The HSA account administrator is working on a new cup-type base since late January. A three-week handle, showing a gentle decline in bone-dry turnover, offers a 46.95 buy point for now. The buy point is derived by adding 10 cents to the highest price in the handle, or 46.85.Last year, the small cap broke out at 31.79 and rallied as much 55% before correcting in price.HealthEquity sports a 90 Composite Rating. It has been rangebound in recent months, perhaps due in part to its slowdown in profit increases. Earnings were flat at 7 cents a share in the January-ended fiscal fourth quarter, following a 75% boost in the year-ago period. But Q1 profit is seen accelerating 7% to 16 cents a share, on top of a 50% increase a year ago.Nutrisystem (NTRI) (97 Composite Rating), up 1.7% to 51.40. The diet products firm is close to retaking its 50-day moving average. Shares broke out in late April at 37.95.Concerns over government investigations into the potential ties between White House advisors and Russia are lingering, yet investors appear encouraged by new data showing that Q1 U.S. GDP was mildly better than originally thought. The core PCE price index, watched closely by the Federal Reserve, showed a 0.2% bump higher in April, in line with the Fed's target of 2% annualized inflation.Meanwhile, gold futures continued to strengthen amid a cooling U.S. dollar. The heavily followed SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) bullion-holding ETF rose nearly 0.8% to 121.04 and remains above its 50- and 200-day moving averages in brisk turnover. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) fell more than 2% to 85.38 in heavy turnover. As seen in a daily chart, the megacap bank has likely gone into base-building mode since dropping nearly 3% on March 21 and piercing its 50-day moving average for the first time since it broke out of a first-stage bottoming base last summer.Watch for a potential test of institutional buying support at the stock's rising 200-day moving average near 80.A drop to 80 would not be surprising, given the sector's strong move since the summer of last year. As reported in IBD's Stock Market Today columns at the time, JPMorgan had cleared a bottoming base pattern on Aug. 5 as it jumped out of a well-formed cup with handle at 65.08 in heavy volume.In a bottoming base, a stock has already suffered a big slide but is showing renewed strength. Heavy volume on up days and up weeks points to rising institutional demand and the potential for a breakout to 52-week highs.RELATED:In Investor's Corner: What's The Simple Way To Spot A Major Market Top?Also In Stock Market Today: Chevron, Oil Up; Time To Buy These 4 Top Techs?Inside IBD Weekly: The Case For A New Bull Run In GoldThese Banking Giants Are Breaking Below Buy Points, Key Levels TodayHere's Why Bank Stocks Are Breaking Key Support

""While we believe Apple has slightly reduced its forecast to suppliers, the change is not drastic and is mostly a return to forecasts in place prior to an increase in October.""Pacific Crest, though, lowered its price target on Apple stock to 127 from 129.IBD's TAKE: Apple stock has been below its 50-day moving average, a negative sign, since Nov. 1. More attractive stocks for investors to consider can be found on the IBD 50 list of top growth companies.""We continue to believe Apple is too cheap, but expect the stock to be range-bound in the near term,"" said the Pacific Crest report. ""We see greater potential for upside through 2017 as details about the next iPhone cycle may help address gross margin risks, or new products could emerge.""Apple stock fell 0.7% in the stock market today to 109.10, still below its 50-day line and far far from a possible buy point of 118.79, out of a flat base.Analog Devices shares rose 0.7%, Broadcom 1.1% and InvenSense 2.9%.The iPhone 7 series phones launched on Sept. 16 and benefited from rival Samsung's recall of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. Wireless firms AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) used ""Black Friday"" promotions after Thanksgiving to work down iPhone 7 inventory, says Pacific Crest.President-elect Donald Trump's trade policies and the U.S. relationship with China could also be a factor in Apple stock.""We see more opportunity for upside once investors gain more clarity around trade policy, which hopefully remains accommodating, and Apple's lineup and bill-of-materials in the next iPhone cycle,"" added the Pacific Crest report. ""We believe addressing gross margin risks will be necessary to drive Apple meaningfully higher, which could require a better look at the iPhone 8 lineup.""RELATED: Apple Confirms Self-Driving Car Interest, 'Investing Heavily' In AutomationApple Cuts iPhone 7 Orders As Sales Slump: ReportSmartphone Growth Stalls As Apple iPhone Sales Decline

369,ADI,"Investment bank RBC Capital Markets has come out with its top tech stock picks for 2017 and the list includes such big names as Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA).In a research report Thursday, RBC analysts Amit Daryanani and Mitch Steves chose those companies along with Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Texas Instruments (TXN) as their top large-cap stock ideas for 2017 in the tech sector.They also made five small and midcap picks: Amphenol (APH), Analog Devices (ADI), Arris International (ARRS), CDW (CDW) and Microsemi (MSCC).RBC likes Apple because of the potential for an iPhone 8 supercycle of upgrade activity, as well as its growing services business (Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, etc.) and the possible repatriation of foreign profits.It has a price target on Apple of 125. Apple stock rose 0.2% to 116.52 on the stock market today. Apple is building a cup-shaped base with a 118.79 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Among RBC's top 10 tech stock picks for 2017, two are on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks: Nvidia and Microsemi.Chipmaker Broadcom is likely to benefit from deal integration and an improved capital structure, RBC said. Broadcom merged with Avago Technologies in February. It is in the process of acquiring Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD).RBC has a price target on Broadcom of 200. The stock rose 0.74% Friday, to 181.94. Broadcom broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 179.52 on Dec. 9 and is trading within a buy range.Cisco is attractive because of its mix shift away from switching and routing, continued M&A and the potential for repatriation, the analysts said. RBC has a price target on Cisco of 35. It rose 0.23% to 30.53 on Friday.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia offers the ""cleanest secular growth story"" in the group, enjoying tailwinds from virtual reality, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, RBC said. It has a price target of 115 on Nvidia stock, which jumped 2.5% Friday to 109.78, touching an all-time high for the seventh day in the past eight trading days.Chipmaker Texas Instruments is well positioned for gross-margin upside and sales growth acceleration driven by market share gains, RBC said. It has a price target on TI of 80. The stock rose 0.24% Friday, to 74.38.RBC predicts that ""Trumponomics"" will help many tech companies in 2017. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to push for lower corporate tax rates and a tax holiday on repatriating foreign profits parked overseas. Apple and U.S. semiconductor firms would be key beneficiaries, they said.""Trumponomics should drive the narrative for 2017 given widespread implications for our coverage group,"" Daryanani and Steves said. ""Beyond that, we think fundamentals will enable a better revenue and margin narrative for most companies in 2017 with continued focus on M&A.""The iPhone 8 could trigger a supercycle given the aging installed base of iPhones in use, RBC said. The supercycle also should benefit component suppliers such as Broadcom.Chip suppliers also will be aided by the launch of Samsung's Galaxy S8 handset and growing smartphone sales in India, RBC said.Potential headwinds in the New Year for IT companies include a possible U.S.-China trade war, given Trump's rhetoric about imposing tariffs on imports. Political turmoil in Europe is another possible headwind, RBC said. RELATED:Apple Seen Offering iPhone 7S, iPhone 8 Models In 2017Nvidia Nails Record High, Inphi Gets Price-Target Hike

This screen highlights top-rated stocks that are showing increasing fund ownership in recent quarters.Broadcom stock has been building a flat base for 10 weeks with a possible entry point of 178.12. But the stock is facing some headwinds and is testing its 200-day moving average. The company is slated to report fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close Thursday.

It would be the company's third straight quarter of accelerating sales and earnings growth.In the past three quarters, Broadcom has reported EPS growth of 15%, 19% and 29%, and sales growth of 8%, 116% and 117%. The gains are mostly attributable to Broadcom's merger with Avago, which closed in February.For the current quarter, Broadcom's fiscal Q1, Wall Street is modeling the company to earn $3.18 a share excluding items, up 32%, on sales of $3.96 billion, up 122%.Broadcom makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications, wired infrastructure, enterprise storage and industrial customers. Applications for its chips include data-center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecom gear, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and displays.Loop Capital's Van Hees set a price target of 206 on Broadcom stock. Broadcom was up a fraction, near 165, in morning trading Wednesday.""We believe Broadcom will benefit from 1) strong positioning in a diverse set of end markets, 2) operating synergy from its acquisitions, and 3) accretion from the pending acquisition of Brocade (BRCD),"" she said. RELATED:8 Chip Stocks Rated Buys After Sector Sell-OffAMD Stock Hits Six-Year High On Intel Rumors, Ahead Of Zen PreviewApple Price Target Cut; Broadcom, ADI Still Buys

379,ADI,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone sales will improve next year as more users upgrade to newer handsets, but declining demand in China remains a big concern, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said Monday.Milunovich is forecasting iPhone unit growth of about 6% in fiscal 2017, which began Sept. 25, thanks to the company's iPhone 7 series handsets. In fiscal 2016, Apple's iPhone shipments declined 8% vs. a 4% decrease for the overall premium smartphone market, Milunovich said in a research note Tuesday.He sees double-digit unit-sales growth in fiscal 2018 as a result of the iPhone 8 launch. The iPhone 8 is expected to include a revamped design with an OLED display.""The (Apple) brand and retention rates remain strong, which should set up double-digit growth in fiscal 2018,"" Milunovich said. ""China, however, stands out like a sore thumb, not only for its rate of decline but with a 10-point (market)-share loss.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been below its 50-day moving average, a negative sign, since Nov. 1. More attractive stocks for investors to consider can be found on the IBD 50 list of top growth companies.China fueled much of Apple's iPhone sales growth in fiscal 2015, but became a headwind in fiscal 2016, Milunovich said.Apple's share of the premium smartphone market in China dropped from 60% in fiscal 2015 to 50% in fiscal 2016. Among companies taking market share from Apple were domestic brands Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, he said.""Chinese consumers want more differentiation than provided by the (iPhone) 6S and 7,"" Milunovich said.Apple's iPhone sales in China deteriorated in the June and September quarters, he said. Evidence indicates that the lower-cost iPhone SE was not well-received in China and the iPhone 7 was ""supply constrained or received poorly,"" he said.Milunovich rates Apple stock as a buy with a 12-month price target of 127.Apple shares closed 0.8% higher at 109.94 on the stock market today, with a possible buy point of 118.79 out of a flat base.On Tuesday, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 150.He says the iPhone 7 will drive Apple's smartphone business back to growth ahead of an expected iPhone 8 ""supercycle.""Recent investor concerns about iPhone 8 gross profit margins and a possible shortage of OLED displays are misplaced, he said.Apple might have to raise the price of its OLED iPhone 8 models by about $50 to cover the added cost of the new display and to keep its margin profile, Garcha said. If OLED displays are in short supply, Apple likely will limit the technology to higher-end handsets, he said.Also Tuesday, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um maintained his sector perform rating on Apple stock with a valuation range of 105 to 120.Um said his main concern about Apple involves its iPhone business, which accounted for 63.4% of revenue and over 70% of gross profits in fiscal 2016, he said.RELATED:Apple CEO Tim Cook: Trust Me, Apple Watch Sales Are HotApple, Most FANGs Rated Top Tech Investment PicksApple Price Target Cut; Broadcom, ADI Still BuysApple Confirms Self-Driving Car Interest, 'Investing Heavily' In Automation

383,ADI,"Among the major stock indexes, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is in focus after pushing this week to all-time highs. It's little surprise then that technology ETFs are setting records too.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) made a 52-week high of 47.97 Thursday and was modestly lower on the stock market today. This $13.1 million ETF is the largest in its category and offers broad exposure to the sector. Its holdings span the computer, software, IT services, semiconductor and communication industries.Thirty-two other tech ETFs also set fresh highs Thursday, out of roughly 48 exchange traded funds offering either broad exposure to technology equities or to specific industry segments within the tech sector.XLK is up 13.5% year to date through Sept. 22. That's better than the broad market's 8.2% gain but worse than some peers in the tech sector.For ETF investors, the biggest rewards within technology so far in 2016 have come from the semiconductor space.PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors (PSI) is the year's best-performing tech ETF, up 28.5% through Sept. 22.Larger peer VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH), up 27.2%, gathered more assets though. Investors poured $40.4 million into SMH in the first eight months of 2016.This chip ETF holds a portfolio of 25 chip makers, including Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA) and Analog Devices (ADI).One of its two largest holdings, industry giant Intel (INTC), last week hit its best level in a year after the company raised its Q3 sales outlook, citing improvement in the personal computer market.IBD'S TAKE: VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF taps into many innovative chip companies and is benefiting from new areas of growth within this tech sub-industry.Another top-performing tech ETF this year is Global X Social Media (SOCL), up 25.2% so far in 2016. On Friday, a rumored Twitter (TWTR) deal saw the stock fly as much as 20% higher.Hand in hand with Twitter, SOCL made an all-time high, reaching 25.33. The ETF is up roughly 75% since launch five years ago.The social media industry represents a more pure-play growth opportunity within technology, says Jay Jacobs, director of research for Global X. For ETF investors, that may mean more risk for potentially bigger rewards.Jacobs sees the broad sector increasingly bogged down by lower growth segments such as printing and computer hardware, while the social media industry is enjoying tail winds from internet penetration around the world.In particular, there's more interaction with brands on social media, rather than through traditional advertisements, spurred by greater adoption of mobile phones around the world and spending by digital-savvy millennials, according to Global X.""Going forward, we believe these trends will continue to propel top-line revenue growth, which will continue to make social media companies attractive targets of software and internet companies looking to spur growth,"" Jacobs told IBD in an email.Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are reported to be among companies interested in buying Twitter. The microblog firm has struggled to grow users,  but is seeing success with its live streaming of NFL Thursday Night Football games.Investors yanked $14.4 million from SOCL in 2016 through August. Only a dozen technology ETFs out of 48 saw net inflow over the same period -- a sign of the sector's troubles over the first half of the year.Flow of fresh investor money has recently started to turn around for SOCL, according to Global X.Massive Yahoo Hack Raises Questions, Says CEO Of Cybersecurity ETF

"
387,ADI,"Based on a teardown analysis of the smartwatch, UBS estimates that the product's gross margin initially will be about 34% but could rise to 57% when it hits an annual volume of 40 million to 50 million units. UBS is modeling for 31 million units in fiscal 2016, which starts Sept. 27.

UBS is modeling for 31 million units in fiscal 2016, which starts Sept. 27.Apple said that it expects the Apple Watch's gross margin will be below the corporate average of about 39% in the June quarter. Apple's gross margin was 40.8% in the March quarter.""Over time we expect Watch margins to be accretive and possibly the highest of any hardware offering, even with our analysis excluding likely highly profitable Edition models and band sales,"" the equity research firm said.UBS estimates the initial gross margin on the entry-level Sport version of the Apple Watch to be 21% to 23%, including start-up costs. It estimates the midrange Apple Watch to have a margin above 45%.UBS predicts that Sport models will make up 65% of Apple Watch sales, with midrange watches at 35% and luxury Edition models at a fraction of sales.""CEO Tim Cook has said he has never seen accurate cost estimates for new products, perhaps because many analyses focus on component costs and overlook overhead costs,"" UBS said. ""For example, we estimate non-BoM (bill of materials) costs represent 47% of total unit costs, heavily burdened with startup expenses, yield loss and conservative accrual assumptions.""UBS took apart a midrange Apple Watch with a 1.7-inch display, sapphire cover and stainless steel case, which retails for $599. It determined a bill of materials for the watch to be $134.UBS identified USI Shanghai as the assembler of the main Systems-in-Package, which includes the application processor, memory and connectivity.

425,ADI,"Having matured from the hot 1990s tech boom, today's semiconductor industry is largely cyclical. But advances in car technology, mobile computing, cloud computing and other fields means there's new growth areas in the sector.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) taps into many of the innovative chip companies with a portfolio of 25 stocks. Among those are some key suppliers for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone and iPad products, such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Analog Devices (ADI). Nvidia (NVDA), which made its mark in graphics chips, is now a player in the development of driverless vehicles.The ETF's two largest holdings are industry veterans Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), each accounting for about 13% of the portfolio. Intel shares Friday hit a new high after the company raised its Q3 sales forecast, citing a rebound in the personal computer market.In a dismal second quarter for corporate profits, S&P Global Market Intelligence saw positive trends in the chip industry. Earnings growth was 14.4%, compared with initial expectations of 2.8% and a 2.2% increase for the broader information technology sector.The average semiconductor profit in the second quarter was 13.5% better than expected, according to a report Tuesday from the research group. Strength from the Internet of Things, data center and mobile businesses fueled the quarter's results. Guidance from chipmakers was better than expected, too.""The Apple inventory supply chain issues that caused analysts to cut growth for many semiconductor companies proved to be subsiding as orders increased ahead of the iPhone 7 launch,"" senior analyst Lindsey Bell wrote. ""Semiconductors have played an integral role in driving improved EPS growth projections for technology in Q3 and Q4.""Greater semiconductor content in mobile devices should support rising demand for chips, Bell added.Easier comparisons figure to help the sector in the second half of 2016. Mergers and acquisitions, a catalyst in the first half of 2016, should continue. Back to the cyclical aspect of the industry, Bell noted that an expanding economy also should help the industry outlook.The ETF has already had a productive 2016, up about 25%. Now, shares are finding support at the 50-day moving average, where a rebound underway may propel the ETF even higher. Keep in mind, however, that market risk is higher than normal, so buying any stock or ETF has added risk.Many of the fund's holdings are finding support in pullbacks to the 50-day moving average, mirroring the ETF's behavior.The portfolio is predominantly large-cap, with most of the 25 stocks north of $5 billion in market cap.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

426,ADI,"Broadcom (AVGO) will deliver a $50 million beat over Wall Street's fiscal Q3 views, helped by 20% Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 gains and better-than-expected wired growth, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer predicted Tuesday.Still, Broadcom stock -- which early Tuesday touched a record high for the fifth day in the past seven trading days -- by one measure is cheap relative to its peers. It's up 15% since its fiscal Q2 report on June 2, which is in line with the much-followed Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX). But IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group is up 19% over that same period.For fiscal Q3 ended in July, Pitzer expects Broadcom to top consensus views for $3.76 billion in sales and $2.77 earnings per share ex items by $50 million and 5 cents, respectively. Broadcom is slated to report its fiscal Q3 earnings after the close Thursday.The beat will be ""driven by strong content gains and initial builds for the iPhone 7, a recovery in enterprise storage, better-than-expected growth in wired ... and likely continued operating expenses improvements,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report Tuesday.Pitzer boosted his price target on Broadcom stock to 200 from 180, reiterating an outperform rating on the stock. He's even more bullish on October-quarter sales, modeling a $50 million and 10 cent upside on the same catalysts.He models 20% Apple iPhone 7 gains, but says Broadcom could see content soar by as much as 30%-40%. Broadcom supplies a power amplifier module for the iPhone 6S, which debuted in September 2015, according to a teardown from iFixit.That will come as Apple reportedly cuts component orders for its iPhone 7 by 15%-20%, Pacific Crest analysts predicted last week. Broadcom, Analog Devices (ADI) and InvenSense (INVN) will withstand the haircut, thanks to other trends, the analysts said.Meanwhile, investors are eyeing Broadcom's penchant for accretive M&A.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is two quarters into its $37 billion behemoth combination with the former Avago Technologies. Before that, though, Avago had a strong history of making deals to further its growth.But Pitzer isn't as ready to jump on the Broadcom M&A bandwagon. On Monday, an MKM analyst posited Broadcom could seek a merger with Qualcomm (QCOM), though Xilinx (XLNX), Cavium (CAVM) or Marvell Technology (MRVL) would also fit the bill.""While M&A continues to be a focus for value creation (and management has a strong track record), we believe that a more balanced total returns story (buyback, dividend, debt pay down), would perhaps drive more equity value,"" he wrote.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Broadcom shares edged down 0.2% to 177.

427,ADI,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S demand improved in July, but a shift to the lower-end iPhone SE could pressure Apple's component suppliers such as Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Synaptics (SYNA), Pacific Crest analysts said Friday.Meanwhile, Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom (AVGO) and InvenSense (INVN) will withstand a looming 15%-20% cut on iPhone 7 component orders, but not because of any changes in Apple trends.In July, carriers had six days of iPhone 6S inventory on hand, dropping from a year-high of nine days in April, the investment bank said in a research note. Meanwhile, iPhone SE demand normalized, rising from north of one day in May and June to six days in July.Pacific Crest targets six to 10 days of on-hand inventory for carriers. Inventory rocketed early in the year, as Apple experienced its first dip in iPhone sales.""Carrier store inventory declined month over month to the low end of our target,"" Pacific Crest analysts wrote in a research report. ""We view this as encouraging ahead of the iPhone 7 launch in September.""But that launch, expected next month, comes with a muted forecast. Pacific Crest sees component orders declining 15%-20% for the iPhone 7 vs. its predecessor iPhone 6S in 2015.Many chipmakers, including Apple suppliers Analog Devices, InvenSense, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN), during their most recent earnings calls, predicted slower year-over-year demand for their consumer/mobile units.""We're not expecting ... any outlandish unit growth in the mobile market,"" Cirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode said on the company's fiscal Q1 earnings conference call on July 27. ""We've got something of a content story this year.""IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom ranks No. 1 in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. The group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 65 only 13 weeks ago. Get IBD's Stock Checkup to examine individual chipmakers.Pacific Crest maintained sector weight ratings on Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, Skyworks Solutions and Synaptics. The likely transition to digital headsets is already baked into Cirrus Logic stock, and the more conservative iPhone 7 cycle will offset content gains for Qorvo, analysts wrote.Synaptics, on the other hand, is poised for share loss at Apple, Pacific Crest predicted. Synaptics supplies a touch-chip for Apple iPhones, but that could be at risk as Apple reportedly makes the move to OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screens in 2017.OLED technology allow for thinner and more flexible screens, but they are also double the cost of LCD (liquid crystal diode) screens, which Apple uses now. The switch will likely add $30 to $35 to the total bill of materials for the iPhone 8, analysts say.""We believe there could be risk that Apple looks to squeeze its other component suppliers on price in order to recoup the incremental BOM associated with the OLED display,"" the Pacific Crest analysts wrote.In the meantime, Apple suppliers such as Analog Devices, Broadcom and InvenSense stand to outperform, Pacific Crest said. It has overweight ratings on all three stocks.Broadcom is positioned to benefit from the carrier aggregation trend as more infrastructure is built to support 4G and LTE, says Pacific Crest. Analog Devices recently announced its $14.8 billion plan to acquire Linear Technology (LLTC), a move that cuts its Apple exposure. InvenSense is gaining on augmented reality trends such as with the mobile game ""Pokemon Go,"" they said.On the stock market today, Analog Devices rose 0.4% and Synaptics 0.2%.

"
428,ADI,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 news is seen as positive for Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Intel (INTC), but negative for Qualcomm (QCOM), according to Wall Street analysts.The iPhone 7 supports 25 radio-frequency bands vs. 23 bands in the iPhone 6S series.""Overall the increased RF content should remain a tailwind for RF suppliers as other handset (manufacturers) emulate the iPhone road map,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a research report. The increased bands in the iPhone 7 will be especially positive for Broadcom, he said.The increased bands should benefit all RF suppliers, but Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO) will benefit more than Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said.IBD'S TAKE: Among Apple chip suppliers seen benefiting from the iPhone 7 launch, only Broadcom is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.Audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic will profit from Apple's decision to remove the analog audio jack from the iPhone 7 and include digital earbuds and an adapter with the new handset, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a report.Cirrus Logic also will benefit from Apple adding a second speaker to the iPhone 7 to give it stereo sound, he said.""We anticipate an incremental $2.50 in content associated with the Lightning earpods, Lightning adapter and second stereo speaker,"" Vinh said. ""Despite the significant content increase, we believe much of this has already been built into guidance and stock expectations.""For that reason, he is sector weight, or neutral, on Cirrus Logic stock.It is unclear whether Cirrus Logic has content in Apple's new wireless earbuds called AirPods, Vinh noted. AirPods will go on sale in late October for $159 a pair.His ""favorite Apple-exposed suppliers"" are Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom, InvenSense (INVN) and Skyworks.Suppliers getting content boosts from the iPhone 7 likely include ADI and Broadcom, RBC Capital Markets said in a report.ADI could get about 30% more content in the iPhone 7 vs. the iPhone 6S series after winning a processor for the camera module, RBC said. Analog Devices gets about 13% of its revenue from Apple.Broadcom also could see a 30% boost in content in the iPhone 7, RBC said. Broadcom gets about 15% to 18% of its revenue from Apple.The iPhone 7 is a negative for Qualcomm, because it could lose 20% to 25% of its baseband chip share in the new smartphone to Intel, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report.Qualcomm is supplying CDMA versions of the iPhone 7 and Intel is supplying non-CDMA versions, which is based on the wireless technologies carriers use.Apple's iPhone 7 is seen as positive for memory suppliers Micron Technology (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) because the new handsets feature twice as much Nand flash data storage as last year's models.The iPhone 7 series has data storage from 32 gigabytes to 256 GB vs. the prior 16 GB to 128 GB.""Doubling Nand storage could further tighten Nand supply and set a trend toward 256-GB handset densities,"" Mizuho's Rakesh said. ""The increased Nand storage should drive further pricing and margin stability in an already tight Nand supply chain, which is a clear positive for MU and WDC.""Apple shares finished 2.6% lower on stock market today at 105.52, as its announcement carried few surprises. Broadcom dipped 0.3%, Qualcomm rose 0.4%, Intel was essentially flat, Cirrus Logic eased 0.15%, while Micron gained 1.7%.RELATED:Apple iPhone 7 Launch Not 'Insanely Great,' But 'Good Enough'
"
429,ADI,"Apple's (AAPL) late-2015 implosion on stifled iPhone demand won't be repeated this December when the Cupertino, Calif., giant launches its newest flagship handset, Analog Devices (ADI) CEO Vincent Roche said Wednesday during the Force Touch chipmaker's fiscal Q3 earnings conference call.In January, Analog Devices stock was caught in Apple's iPhone 6S tornado, which saw chip suppliers like Qorvo (QRVO) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) guiding down their December-quarter sales forecasts on weaker-than-expected iPhone demand.""This year, I think we have a closer linkage between supply and demand here on the consumer side,"" Roche told analysts. ""So I would expect us to decline seasonally in the first quarter, but only seasonally.""On Thursday, analysts were mixed on Analog Devices' fiscal Q3, which was largely a blowout but showed some lumpiness in its non-consumer segments (79% of total sales). Non-consumer sales rose 4% vs. last year, outplaying peers' 3.5% growth, analysts said. It was the first time it topped its rivals in five quarters.But, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer noted, fiscal Q4 guidance for 3.5% business-to-business growth is below rivals' average view for 5% growth. Pitzer, though, sees growing opportunities in automotive and share gains in communications infrastructure.Still, Analog Devices pulled in about $120 million in sales to Apple amid the iPhone 7 ramp, up from $30 million in fiscal Q2, Pitzer wrote in a research report. For the current quarter, he expects that segment's sales to jump to $190 million. It sells chips that enable Apple's Force Touch feature, which senses how much pressure a user is putting on a display surface and then reacts based on the level of pressure.Nomura analyst Romit Shah is less bullish on Force Touch than is Credit Suisse's Pitzer. He estimates Force Touch sales hit $99 million in fiscal Q3, but that was well ahead of his earlier $55 million view. For fiscal Q4, he models $168 million in sales to Apple.Shah remained neutral on Analog Devices stock and kept his 70 price target. Pitzer is restricted on the stock, as Credit Suisse is helping with the company's $14.8 billion merger with rival Linear Technology (LLTC).On its earnings conference call Wednesday, Analog Devices confirmed 30% content growth in its consumer segment, widely believed to be comprised solely of Apple. Teardowns show Analog Devices supplies its Force Touch controller for the iPhone 6S.Analog Devices shareholders tend to shy away from the volatile consumer segment, which comprised 21% of sales in fiscal Q3. But Analog Devices' planned merger with Linear Technology should cut that exposure significantly.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts expect Analog Devices to cut its Apple exposure to 5%, or by a third, based on varying estimates. That would appease traders who bet bigger on less-volatile non-consumer sales.Plus, B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis noted, gross margins hit 66%, 20 basis points better than expected despite the consumer mix. Consumer sales grew 131% sequentially in fiscal Q3, but declined 10% vs. the year-earlier quarter. In fiscal Q4, they are expected to fall 20% year over year, Credit Suisse's Pitzer said.""It shows Force Touch revenue quality is better than many perceive,"" Ellis wrote in a research report. ""And it's another sign there's no big change in Apple iPhone component pricing."" Ellis kept his buy rating on Analog Devices stock and boosted his price target to 74 from 73.In morning trading on the stock market today, Analog Devices stock fell 0.1% to 64.13. Apple also dipped 0.1%, to 109.08.

Analysts expected $1.37 and $1.5 billion.For the current quarter, Analog Devices expects to earn an adjusted $1.28 a share on sales of $1.49 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling earnings of $1.17 a share on sales of $1.46 billion.Analog Devices scored price-target hikes from B. Riley FBR, CFRA, Jefferies, KeyBanc, Morgan Stanley and Stifel, all of which have buy ratings on the stock.The most bullish of the bunch was B. Riley FBR analyst Craig Ellis who upped his price target to 113 from 110.Analog Devices shares fell 1.7% to close at 88.65 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Analog Devices stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of 99, but it ranks No. 2 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""Communications base station strength led (the fourth quarter's) positive sales surprise followed by Industrial,"" Ellis said.

He noted that Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Texas Instruments (TXN) also traded down despite solid earnings reports recently.""Clearly, the bar is quite high and the magnitude of beats is shrinking as growth shifts from above seasonal to seasonal,"" Hettenbach said.

473,ADI,"The Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp helped Analog Devices (ADI) crush Wall Street's Q3 expectations, but guidance missed and consumer sales toppled, prompting Analog stock to fall Wednesday following its earnings release.Analog Devices fell 1.05% to 64.20 on the stock market today. But shares are up 16% for the year, and IBD's 39-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group is up 10%. Shares touched a 13-month high of 66.91 last month.For its fiscal Q3 ended July 30, Analog Devices reported $870 million in sales and 82 cents earnings per share minus items, up 1% and 6% respectively, vs. last year. Both metrics topped analysts' views for $851.7 million and 76 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Analog Devices has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it performs in the top quarter of all stocks. But it ranks just No. 15 in its group. Microchip Tech leads that industry group with a CR of 99. Get the Stock Checkup here.Current-quarter guidance was a little softer. Analog Devices expects $910 million to $970 million in sales, beating the consensus of 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters at the midpoint, but missing the $935 million view at the low end.Analog Devices expects to report 84 to 89 cents EPS ex items for Q4, meeting the consensus at the midpoint. But sales and EPS would dip 4% and 14% respectively vs. the year-earlier quarter at the midpoints of guidance.During Q3, Apple's iPhone 7 ramp pushed Analog's consumer segment up 131% sequentially -- the only segment to grow vs. the prior quarter. But $186.1 million in consumer sales was down 10% from the year-earlier quarter.Last month, Analog Devices announced its $14.8 billion plan to acquire longtime rival Linear Technology (LLTC). That deal, analysts say, should significantly cut Analog's Apple exposure. Analog's nonconsumer segments tend to be less volatile.Industrial sales accounted for Analog's bread and butter in Q3, at 43% of total sales, but revenue in that segment fell 3% year over year and sequentially. Automotive and communications sales both dipped sequentially but rose vs. the year-earlier period.Analog Devices also declared a 42-cent cash dividend. The dividend will be paid on Sept. 7 to all shareholders of record at the close on Aug. 26.

474,ADI,"Analog Devices (ADI) grew its Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 content by 30% vs. Wall Street views for a 15% gain, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said Tuesday ahead of Analog's Q2 earnings report slated for early Wednesday.Boosted iPhone content would help chipmaker Analog Devices offset a likely decline in unit shipments. Also outplaying its Apple exposure, last month Analog Devices announced its $14.8 billion plan to acquire longtime rival Linear Technology (LLTC).Investment banks Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer posited that the Linear M&A would cut Analog Devices' Apple exposure by 5% and a third, respectively. After the sale closes in mid-2017, nonconsumer sales will account for 82% of revenue, Stifel Nicolaus said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is looking to bolster its iPhone profits by pressuring its component suppliers, RBC said earlier this month. But single-source suppliers like Broadcom and Analog Devices should be resilient.For Q2 ended in July, the consensus of 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Analog Devices to report $851.7 million in sales and 76 cents earnings per share ex items, both metrics down 1% vs. the year-earlier quarter.That's well below Analog Devices' late July pre-announcement for $865 million in sales and 77-78 cents EPS ex items.""Upside to Q3 estimates was driven by better-than-expected content for Analog Devices in the iPhone 7 of at least 30%,"" Pitzer said. ""Analog Devices has broadened its footprint from two sockets in iPhone 6S to an expected five sockets in iPhone 7.""Wall Street estimates are for $100 million in Apple impact on Q4 growing to $170 million in Q4, Pitzer wrote in a research report. The consensus polled by Thomson Reuters is less bullish, forecasting year-over-year dips of 4% and 14% for sales and EPS, respectively.On the stock market today, Analog Devices fell 0.6% to 64.88. Shares are up 18% this year, while IBD's 39-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group has gained 12%.

"
475,ADI,"Broadcom (AVGO) will likely gain 20% content in Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7, but its fiscal Q3 success will rely on better demand for switching and storage products, Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh predicted Friday.Fiscal Q4 guidance, however, could be ""muted"" on Apple's slower iPhone 7 ramp vs. its iPhone 6S predecessor, Vinh wrote in a research report. But storage and switching will offset that risk, and M&A cost synergies will help the bottom line, he said.The consensus of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Broadcom to report $3.76 billion in sales and $2.77 earnings per share ex items, up a respective 115% and 24% vs. the year-earlier period. Broadcom is slated to report July-quarter results after the close Thursday.Broadcom's massive year-over-year growth follows its $37 billion merger with former Avago Technologies in February. Analysts predict Broadcom is far from finished with M&A activities.Vinh kept his overweight rating and 180 price target on Broadcom stock. He predicts Broadcom won three chips in the iPhone 7 and could benefit from the burgeoning carrier aggregation trend in which infrastructure is built out to support LTE and 5G.Other chipmakers like Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Synaptics (SYNA) won't be as lucky, Pacific Crest analysts wrote in a separate report Friday. Apple is expected to cut component orders 15%-20% year over year, said Pacific Crest.But Broadcom, InvenSense (INVN) and Analog Devices (ADI) will buoy on other trends, analysts say.Vinh sees an in-line to slightly better Q3 and slightly down Q4 guidance for Broadcom, reflecting the muted Apple cycle. But the bottom line will survive as Broadcom digests February's merger.Friday, Broadcom stock touched an all-time high for the fourth day of the week, peaking at 178.65. Shares are up more than 20% this year.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked first in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group.

They include Broadcom (AVGO) and Analog Devices (ADI), he said.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Broadcom is also on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.A consistent trend from the June-quarter earnings season was Apple component suppliers guiding gross margins lower, Daryanani said.""Ten out of 11 suppliers that we tracked saw gross margins head lower for second-half 2016 vs. prior expectations (the only exception was TTM Technologies (TTMI)),"" he said.Daryanani rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 115. Apple stock rose 0.4% to 108.81 on the stock market today. Apple has risen for eight of the last 10 trading sessions, since reporting better-than-expected June quarter results and guiding Wall Street higher for the September quarter.Some chip companies get a majority of their revenue from Apple. And quite a few firms get 10% or more of their sales from supplying Apple. In his report, Daryanani spelled out which companies get the most business from Apple.Companies with the greatest exposure to Apple business include Dialog Semiconductor (75% of revenue), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) (66%), Foxconn (over 50%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) (44%), Qorvo (QRVO) (32%), Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASX) (31%) and InvenSense (INVN) (30%).Companies with less exposure to Apple, but which still get a significant share of sales from the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, include: Knowles (KN) (25%), Jabil Circuit (JBL) (24%), TTM (20%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) (16%), Pegatron (15%-25%), Broadcom (15%-20%), Analog Devices (13%), Qualcomm (QCOM) (13%), Texas Instruments (TXN) (11%) and Amphenol (APH) (10%).Companies with small exposure to Apple business include Intel (INTC) (3%-5%), Flextronics (FLEX) (3%-4%) and Nvidia (NVDA) (3%-4%), Daryanani said.

514,ADI,"Analog Devices' (ADI) $14.8 billion acquisition of longtime rival Linear Technology (LLTC) will cut its Apple (AAPL) exposure to 5%, Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach said Wednesday.The deal also could spur more consolidation in the semiconductor industry, says Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer. Last year, chip sector M&A hit a fever pitch as deals topped $100 billion, including Intel's $16.7 billion Altera buy and Broadcom's $37 billion merger with Avago Technologies.""With structurally slowing supply, rising barriers to entry, consolidation and a mix shift in end demand away from consumer, we continue to see scarcity value in semiconductor IP and assets and except M&A to continue to be a prevalent theme,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report.Hettenbach places Analog Devices among the company of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Broadcom (AVGO) and Microchip Technology (MCHP) as ""playing acquirers who can deliver above average (earnings per share) due to synergies.""But unlike most recent chip M&A, Analog Devices' move to acquire Linear is largely a technology play, he says.Analog Devices leads the data converter market with 40%-50% share, double that of closest rival Texas Instruments (TXN), though that company will remain much larger than the combined Analog Devices-Linear.Linear, meanwhile, is No. 3 in power management chips.""One of the long-standing knocks on Analog Devices was its lack of power management presence, the fastest-growing segment within analog,"" Hettenbach wrote in a report. ""But the Linear deal would clearly change this.""IBD'S TAKE: Analog Devices stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 60, meaning it performs in the top half of stocks in terms of key metrics. But it trails Linear stock, which has a CR of 79. Texas Instruments stock, though, leads the group with a CR of 96.Together, Analog Devices and Linear are expected to bring in $5 billion in annual sales, nearly 11% of the total $45.7 billion analog-chip market, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Tore Svanberg wrote in a report. The companies see $150 million in cost savings from their merger.Hettenbach expects those savings to yield $4.45 EPS ex items in 2018. Rosenblatt analyst Kinngai Chan sees $5 EPS ex items by the end of 2020.The acquisition cuts Analog Devices' Apple exposure by a third, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer wrote in a report. Schafer downgraded Analog Devices in December on its growing exposure to ""the inherent volatility"" associated with Apple.The Linear deal trims Analog Devices' consumer segment to 12% of sales, Schafer says.Non-consumer end markets industrial, automotive and communications have been key to Analog Devices' economic recovery over the past five years, Stifel Nicolaus' Svanberg said.After the acquisition closes, expected in mid-2017, those segments will comprise 82% of total sales, Credit Suisse's Pitzer said.Morgan Stanley's Hettenbach upgraded Analog Devices stock to overweight and boosted his price target to 78 from 56.Svanberg rates Analog Devices stock a buy, and he upped his price target to 78 from 68.

On the stock market today, Linear stock shot up 29% to 62.53.Bloomberg first reported about the pending deal.After the close, Linear reported flat profit of 54 cents and a 1.5% sales drop, both roughly in line with views. Linear Tech fell 1% in late trade to 61.75.Analog Devices stock closed up 3.9% to 62.87, and jumped another 7% after the close. Several Apple suppliers rallied on the iPhone maker's better-than-expected earnings and guidance.IBD'S TAKE: Linear Technology stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 65, meaning it outperforms nearly two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key metrics including Analog Devices stock which has a middling CR of 49.Under the terms, Linear shareholders will receive $46 share in cash and 0.2321 of a share of Analog Devices common stock for each share of Linear stock they hold at the closing of the transaction. The transaction values the combined company near $30 billion, the companies said.At Analog's closing price, the deal would be worth $60.59 a share. Based on Analog's after-hours stock price, the deal is worth $61.67 a share.Both companies make analog chips, which convert real-world senses (touch, sound, temperature, etc.) into electronic signals that machines can read.Analog Devices products are used in mobile phones and cars, among other end markets. Linear's chips go into a plethora of end markets, including networking, industrial, automotive, medical, consumer and military applications.""Our shared focus on engineering excellence and our highly complementary portfolios of industry-leading products will enable us to solve our customers' biggest and most complex challenges at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds,"" Analog Devices CEO Vincent Roche said in a statement.

NXP rose 4.7% on Tuesday, gapping above its 50-day moving average.Auto-related chips are now NXP's top sector thanks to its Freescale buy, 36% of total Q2 revenue. Auto sector demand has surpassed chips for the Apple iPhone and the broader mobile sector.NXP CEO Richard Clemmer said in a statement: ""On a comparable basis, total revenue was down approximately 8 percent year on year, notwithstanding our Automotive operating segment which delivered positive year-on-year comparable growth.  We believe we have begun to see incremental positive trends in a number of our businesses, with comparable sequential revenue up approximately 6 percent into the second quarter.  While we anticipate many of the headwinds experienced in the second half of 2015 should begin to generally subside in the coming quarters, the overall demand environment currently continues to be subdued.""IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is another Apple supplier that has made acquisitions to diversify. Broadcom broke out of a base Wednesday.Apple shares rose 6.5% Wednesday after earnings and iPhone sales fell less than expected, but it was still a sharp decline for both.Another Apple supplier, Texas Instruments (TXN), on Monday reported better-than-expected earnings and guidance, citing strong auto chip demand.

But its shares fell 1.1%.Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $14.8 billion to create a microchip-industry giant. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) said it would buy cloud-services provider NetSuite (N) in a $9.3 billion deal. Oracle's Larry Ellison is the leading shareholder of NetSuite. Meanwhile, Citrix Systems (CTXS) will merge its Go To Meeting unit with LogMeIn (LOGM). Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.

541,ADI,"Investment bank Jefferies pounded the table for four analog chip stocks on Thursday, raising its price targets on Analog Devices (ADI), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Jefferies rates all four stocks as buys.X""The combination of peak earnings, peak margins and stretching lead times in analog look like classic cyclical peak signals, but we think consolidation is the real culprit,"" Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a report. ""We expect more consolidation, and profitability to go even higher.""Analog stocks also are benefiting from secular drivers such as the Internet of Things, he said.""If our Analog Renaissance thesis plays out, the 35%-40% operating margins this group is printing today will look medieval when compared to the 50% (margins) they will be pushing in 2022,"" Lipacis said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes two chipmakers: Nvidia and Microchip Technology.Lipacis raised his price targets as follows: Analog Devices to 105 from 100, Maxim to 58 from 51, Microchip to 106 from 94, and Texas Instruments to 110 from 96.He also raised his price target on hold-rated ON Semiconductor (ON) to 20 from 16.Analog Devices was down 0.2% to close at 88.80 on the stock market today. Maxim was up 0.5% to 50.09. Microchip added 1% to finish at 93.05. Texas Instruments was virtually flat at 93.45.

542,ADI,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp and ""less bad"" PC sales will lead to an in-line second quarter for chipmakers, but Brexit-fostered macro worries could play out in October-quarter earnings, Credit Suisse and MKM analysts said Friday.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer's top picks include Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC), Analog Devices (ADI), Lam Research (LRCX), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX).""Importantly, (the second half of 2016) should be up 2.5% year over year after four quarters of year-over-year declines,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report. But overall he expects 2016 chip sales will be flat vs. earlier expectations for 3.8% growth.IBD's TAKE: IBD's 33-company Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group is currently No. 48 out of 197 groups tracked, having made big moves over the last eight weeks from No. 169. It's led by ASML in market value, but KLA-Tencor tops the group in terms of Composite Rating. KLA has a CR of 92, meaning it outperforms 92% of all stocks in key metrics.Apple iPhone suppliers -- including Broadcom and Analog Devices -- could benefit from a ""lackluster iPhone 7 cycle"" still likely to grow 55%-60% from 80 million units shipped in the first half of the year.""Overall, handsets (are) better,"" he wrote. ""Slowing Samsung Galaxy S7 and weak high-end China (are) offset by mid- to low-end iPhone 7 builds.""More PC-oriented Intel and Microchip could benefit from marginal improvements in shipments, Pitzer wrote. During Q2, units declined 4.5% vs. last year, but topped the four-quarter average of a 12% decline. Still, expectations for PC builds to fall 8% this year would be conservative.Industrial trends improved modestly over the last 90 days, but appear seasonally weaker in the second half of 2016 -- likely impacting Lam. Lam, which is trying to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), competes against ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) in the chip gear-making sector.Mellanox, on the other hand, could benefit in the second-half on infrastructure improvements by Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Mellanox's products are used to connect servers, provide storage and tie hyper-converged infrastructure -- a necessity for major cloud operations.The real risk is in Q3, when the effect of the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union are likely to play out, Pitzer says. Global stock markets toppled on the Brexit vote and Q3 expectations that are already above seasonal quarter-over-quarter growth leave plenty of room for disappointment.MKM analyst Ian Ing sees the Brexit effect slugging Xilinx (XLNX), Texas Instruments (TXN), Intersil (ISIL), ON  Semiconductor (ON) and Analog Devices -- which have high distribution-channel sales ""which are a proxy for European and industrial market exposure.""Xilinx and Texas Instruments derive about 60% of their sales through the channel, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Intersil, ON and Analog Devices take in more than half of their revenue from distribution.""Industrial markets which are served by distributors are expected to have seasonally weaker second half of demand compounded by perceived Brexit risk and uncertainty,"" Ing wrote in a report. ""Q3 and Q4 are expected to be down seasonally and likely further exacerbated by customers' Brexit uncertainties.""The most obvious effect is in currency adjustments. Following the vote, the British pound fell 9.3% vs. the U.S. dollar to its lowest point in decades. The euro fell 1.6%. That could result in some inventory destocking followed by customers scrutinizing order run rates, Ing predicts.Competitively, U.S. semiconductors have a small advantage post-Brexit.""U.K. semiconductor markets were already soft before the Brexit event,"" Ing wrote. ""Longer term, we think Brexit has some offsetting impacts on U.K. semiconductor design and activity.""

544,ADI,"Analog Devices (ADI) racked up $500 million in Force Touch sales, implying a tenfold return on its Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S investment, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said Friday, estimating that the chipmaker will gain 30% content in the iPhone 7.But the Brexit vote Friday prompted stocks to broadly topple, leading Analog Devices stock to plunge 5.3% to 55.04 in the stock market today. It was far from alone. Fellow Apple chipmakers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Broadcom (AVGO) fell, respectively, 8.3%, 8.3%, 7.8% and 6.2%. IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing group dropped 5.9%.Pitzer retained his outperform rating and 72 price target on Analog Devices stock. And while its Apple-related sales gets all the headlines, Pitzer says that Analog Devices' best growth will stem from its core infrastructure, automotive and industrial segments.Since 2012 when competitive pressure from Bosch and STMicroelectronics (STM) prompted it to exit parts of the passive-safety market, Analog Devices' automotive sales have grown at a 4% compound annual growth rate vs. peers at a 12% CAGR, Pitzer says. But other automotive areas have been a boon for Analog Devices. Its sales of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have grown at a 44% CAGR, powertrain at a 9% CAGR and infotainment at an 8% CAGR over three years.Pitzer sees Analog Devices' Apple sales being under-modeled. Apple, which is notorious for swapping components, would be hard-pressed to displace Analog Devices as the Force Touch supplier, he said.He estimates that Analog Devices spent $10 million to $15 million developing Force Touch which, in turn, pulled in $500 million in accumulated sales. That tenfold return on investment compares to the typical seven times ROI, Pitzer wrote in a research note Friday. And unlike other chips, Force Touch is not a commodity, he says.Analog Devices' Apple sales grew from nil in Q1 2015 to $250 million in Q4 2014, representing 25% of total sales, he says. Pitzer expects Analog Devices to add three new applications for a total of five in the iPhone 7.Analog Devices could grow its Apple content by 30%, he said.

545,ADI,"Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) shares nosedived Tuesday after Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell downgraded the stocks and predicted a 15%-20% decline in Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 shipments later this year compared with shipments of the iPhone 6S after that product was released last September.Cirrus Logic stock closed down 6% at 35.76 on the stock market today, and Skyworks Solutions also fell 6%, closing at 58.82. Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qualcomm (QCOM) stocks followed, down a respective 2.2%, 2.3% and 2%.McConnell downgraded Cirrus Logic and Skyworks stocks to sector weight. He cut his price target on Broadcom to 180 from 185, on Analog Devices to 60 from 62, and on Qualcomm to 59 from 61.Cirrus Logic will benefit from Apple's transition to digital headsets, and Skyworks is likely to gain 10%-15% radio frequency content in the iPhone 7, but ""we ultimately don't believe this will be enough to offset a 15%-20% decline in iPhone 7 shipments,"" McConnell wrote in a research note, comparing it with the iPhone 6S.He has a 40 price target on Cirrus Logic stock and a 90 price target on Skyworks stock.Slowing iPhone sales will similarly slug InvenSense (INVN), Qorvo (QRVO), Synaptics (SYNA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), McConnell wrote, also cutting his estimates on these companies. Qualcomm will continue to struggle to re-sign Chinese licensees under new agreements, he said.But No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC), which will reportedly supply a third of the Apple iPhone 7 modems, got a price target boost to 37 from 35 on better-than-seasonal notebook forecasts for Q3, up 7%-10% sequentially vs. typical 6% growth, he said.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) garnered higher estimates on its July GeForce 1060 launch date to compete with rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Coupled with strong demand and higher average sales prices, Nvidia is likely to exceed its Q2 guidance, McConnell wrote.

548,ADI,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) reportedly swiped a third of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 modems from Qualcomm (QCOM), benefiting Qorvo (QRVO) to the potential detriment of Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), but the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union will slug all of them, Mizuho says.On Friday, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh downgraded Skyworks and Qorvo stocks to neutral, matching his neutral rating on Qualcomm stock. He estimates that all three are 75% tied to the smartphone market, unlike radio-frequency chip competitor Broadcom (AVGO), which is 22% exposed.Also, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani cut his price targets and estimates for chipmakers Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), noting the likelihood of stalled IT spending, and industrial and automotive demand in the wake of Brexit.On the stock market today, Qorvo stock fell 1.4% and Qualcomm 1.1%. Broadcom, Skyworks and Texas Instruments were down 0.8%, 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively, while Analog Devices dipped 1 cent to 56.63 and Intel 0.15% to 32.75. Apple rose 0.3%.""While the iPhone 7 is ramping and our checks indicate (China smartphone maker) Huawei is comfortable with its 2016 outlook, the demand uncertainty combined with a seasonally weaker Samsung/China handset market makes for a challenging second half of the year,"" Rakesh wrote.That will impact Qorvo, Qualcomm and Skyworks to a greater degree than Broadcom, he wrote. Since merging with the former Avago, Broadcom has reduced its smartphone exposure, which had accounted for half of its revenue. That lower exposure will be key amid slowing smartphone sales.Rakesh suggested Skyworks tackle M&A again after its failed attempt to buy PMC-Sierra. He cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 68 from 99, but he said the company, a key Huawei supplier, could see strength as that company ramps its newest flagship.Meanwhile, he says, Intel's likelihood of taking 30% of the iPhone 7 mix will boost Qorvo ""given its legacy relationship"" in making chips compatible with Intel chips. And Qorvo will enjoy gains on better-than-expected strength in the Samsung Galaxy S7. Rakesh kept his 55 price target on Qorvo stock.RBC's Daryanani, in his separate report, said Apple likely accounts for 10% of revenue for Texas Instruments and Analog Devices. He cut his price target on Texas Instruments to 66 from 68, and cut his PT on Analog Devices to 63 from 65, to reflect Brexit's impact. But he kept an outperform rating on both stocks.""This could offset some softness in other markets,"" he wrote. ""While it is early to access any sizable impact from Brexit, we think it is prudent to adjust expectations for Europe.""Gartner estimates that global enterprise IT spending will rise 1.2% in 2016 vs. its earlier views for 1.6% growth, Daryanani pointed out, but in the U.K., IT spending will decline 1.5% vs. prior expectations for 1.7% growth. Europe's spending is expected to dive ""modestly.""In automotive chips, RBC sees North American production as flat and European production declining 1.4% in 2017 vs. earlier projections for 2% and 2.9% growth, Daryanani wrote.Texas Instruments' automotive sales have grown at an 11% four-year compound annual growth rate, while Analog Devices has had a 14% five-year CAGR. For both, investors should now expect single-digit growth, Daryanani wrote.

549,ADI,"Broadcom (AVGO) stock rocketed late Thursday after its first post-merger earnings report, topping Wall Street's earnings view by 15 cents and edging revenue views despite Apple's (AAPL) first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales.In after-hours trading, Broadcom stock was up more than 6% following its fiscal Q2 earnings release. Shares rose a fraction in Thursday's regular session, to 154.91, and are up 6% for the year.For its Q2 ended May 1, Broadcom reported $3.56 billion in sales minus items and $2.53 earnings per share ex items, up 117% and 19%, respectively, vs. last year, and leading the consensus estimate of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $3.55 billion and $2.38.Current-quarter guidance for $3.75 billion in sales ex items, plus or minus $75 million, would be up 114% on a year-over-year basis, topping analysts' model for $3.71 billion. The non-GAAP guidance includes $10 million in licensing revenue.The quarter was Broadcom's first reporting combined Broadcom and Avago metrics, while the year-earlier figures were for Avago only. The former Avago bought Broadcom for $37 billion, a deal that closed on Feb. 1, keeping the Broadcom name and Avago's ticker. Now, analysts say Broadcom could deleverage and seek more M&A.Broadcom competes against fellow Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) to provide radio-frequency chips for smartphones, including the iPhone.A UBS analyst was bullish earlier Thursday on RF names vs. analog names like Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), both also Apple suppliers who've seen investors pull back because of the companies' consumer exposure.

550,ADI,"Applied Materials (AMAT) is capable of sourcing 100 million Apple (AAPL) iPhone screens amid its OLED push, a UBS analyst said Thursday as chipmakers Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) got sell ratings from Goldman Sachs on their Apple exposure.Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari initiated coverage of Analog Devices stock with a sell rating, noting the company's 10% Apple exposure, but is neutral on shares of 20%-Samsung-exposed Maxim Integrated Devices (MXIM). Sell-rated Texas Instruments is 30% exposed to consumer sales, Hari said.Investors have ""punished"" analog chipmakers with high mobile exposure, Hari wrote in a research report, as sales of iPhones and other smartphones slow. To that point, Analog Devices stock is in a 253-day period of consolidation, trailing Texas Instruments stock which is now 3% extended beyond its 291-day consolidation period.""The opportunity to take on Apple business is hard for analog companies to turn down given relatively high margins and incremental revenue opportunities, (but) investors have been critical of such moves and we do not expect this trend to reverse in the near future,"" he wrote.Margin expansion, not sales growth, drives analog outperformance, Hari wrote. Texas Instruments has aggressively reduced costs, but Maxim still has some ""juice to squeeze"" and Analog Devices' gross and operating margins have stagnated since 2010, he says.Among chip stocks, Hari prefers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), radio-frequency suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), and ""growth stock"" Nvidia (NVDA), a Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner. The four buy-rated stocks have weathered volatile consumer sales better than analog chipmakers, he says.Hari boosted his price target on Applied Materials stock to 27 from 25 and kept his buy rating, noting the company's OLED (organic light-emitting diode) and 3D Nand (flash memory) push and Chinese business could drive earnings per share minus items to $1.81 and $2.10 in calendar years 2016 and 2017. For its fiscal 2015 ended Oct. 25, Applied reported EPS minus items of $1.19.UBS analyst Stephen Chin sees Applied Materials bolstering its EPS by 80 cents annually, assuming the TV market, like the smartphone market, also adopts OLED screens. OLED screens are thinner and more flexible than other display screens, and is expected to be a feature in Apple's iPhone 8, expected to be released in the fall of 2017. So far, Apple uses OLEDs on just one product, the Apple Watch.Chin has a buy rating and 28.50 price target on Applied Materials stock.In total, Applied Materials could pump out 33 million OLED screens for the iPhone each month, Chin estimates.""We estimate Applied can generate incremental EPS of 15 cents next year just from selling its OLED equipment to Apple iPhone,"" Chin wrote in a report. ""We estimate this base case OLED EPS impact from smartphones is sustainable for a few years as more customers possibly adopt OLED screens.""Applied Materials stock finished 0.5% higher on the stock market today. Analog Devices stock dipped 0.65%.

551,ADI,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 demand could falter, but 3D Touch supplier Analog Devices (ADI) expects a strong fiscal Q4 on boosted dollar-content in Apple's newest flagship smartphone, likely to be released in September.But that ramp won't be apparent in Q3. Wednesday, Analog Devices reported sales fell 5% year over year for its fiscal Q2 ended April 30, and guided to another 5% dip in Q3. Over the past two years, Analog Devices has grown an average 13.5% during its July quarter.This year, Analog Devices' second-generation 3D Touch will ramp in timing with chips from other Apple suppliers, Analog Devices CFO Dave Zinsner told analysts during the company's Q2 earnings conference call.""And really that means that we really don't see the demand pick up until the July time frame,"" he said. ""So, it's probably going to be more of the end of Q3 and more into Q4 this time vs. last year where it was more of a ramp in Q3.""Analog Devices’ Q3 will be back-end loaded on Apple’s iPhone 7, Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher told IBD. More encouraging, the company is seeing stable demand within its automotive and industrial segments, he says.“The outlook suggests the company is weathering the near-term softness in Apple,” he said. “And, as it relates to Apple, the company indicated this would be a trough in terms of orders. They expect to see sequential growth, and from that perspective it is encouraging because there will be a ramping in orders.”MKM analyst Ian Ing reiterated a neutral rating and 56 price target on Analog Devices stock. In morning trading on the stock market today, Analog Devices stock was down more than 1%, near 55, after rising nearly 1% on Wednesday.Despite Zinsner's expectations for boosted dollar-content in the iPhone 7, Ing sees average sales prices for the second-generation 3D to fall 10% from $1.75. Consumer sales account for 10% of Analog Devices' revenue and fell 27% vs. the year-earlier quarter in Q2.But Ing doesn't expect much of a Q3 boost for Analog Devices' bread-and-butter business-to-business segments, which account for the other 90% of sales. Those segments grew 9% sequentially in Q2 to $698.7 million, but fell 2% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Analog Devices guided to mid-to-high single-digit year-over-year growth for those segments in Q3. For Q4, the company expects greater operating leverage, a full quarter of portables shipments, higher factory utilizations and better automotive seasonality, Ing wrote.But lower factory utilizations in Q3 suggests ""little visibility or confidence in the overall demand environment,"" Ing wrote. Analog Devices guided down to 60%-range utilizations for Q3 vs. 70% in the year-earlier quarter.

552,ADI,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO) likely gained another 20% in iPhone 7 content on top of continued increases in Samsung Galaxy smartphones, giving investors ""multiple ways to win,"" Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said Thursday.Broadcom is slated to report Q2 earnings on June 2 after the market close. Pitzer expects in-line Q2 sales, but he sees a ""significant EPS cushion"" on cost-cutting and synergies related to Broadcom's merger with the former Avago. In February, Avago completed its $37 billion acquisition of Broadcom, with the merged company taking the Broadcom name, in a deal the companies said gives the combined entity an enterprise value of $77 billion.For Q2, the consensus of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Broadcom to report $3.55 billion in sales and $2.38 earnings per share minus items, up 116% and 12%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.On Wednesday, fellow Apple supplier Analog Devices (ADI) reported year-over-year sales declines for fiscal Q2 and guided to another 5% sales dip for its July quarter. Pitzer expects Broadcom's July-quarter sales view to likewise disappoint.But, like Analog Devices, Broadcom expects to grow its iPhone 7 content. Three months ago, CEO Hock Tan said Broadcom's radio-frequency (RF) content in smartphones has increased by 20% every year, and that this year will be no exception.Tan's view came before Apple reported its first-ever decline in iPhone sales, occurring in the March quarter.Pitzer sees Broadcom guiding to $3.39 billion in fiscal Q3 sales, below the consensus view for $3.72 billion. But he boosted his EPS-minus-items view to $2.64 from $2.51, matching the consensus model. For 2016 and 2017, he expects $11.16 and $12.86 EPS ex items, respectively.Wireless sales -- including sales to Apple -- have declined to 25% of total revenue from 50%. Less volatile data center sales now account for half of Broadcom's revenue, he wrote.""Broadcom's portfolio of businesses is significantly dampening the impact of any single headwind,"" he wrote in a research report. ""Broadcom can weather 'isolated storms' while maintaining the integrity of EPS upside.""Pitzer reiterated an outperform rating and a 180 price target on Broadcom stock. Broadcom shares fell a fraction, to 142.74, on the stock market today. RF rivals Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) fell 1.2% and a fraction, respectively.The trio fell amid fresh reports examining the effect slowing smartphone sales will have on chipmakers.

553,ADI,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 expectations might have dug into guidance provided Wednesday by Analog Devices (ADI), as the 3D Touch supplier topped Q2 expectations but guided to current-quarter sales that would dip 5% year over year.In early trading on the stock market today, Analog Devices shares were up a fraction, near 55.50. Fellow Apple suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) were up all by close to 2% or more.For its fiscal Q2 ended April 30, Analog Devices reported $779 million in sales and 64 cents earnings per share ex items, down a respective 5% and 12% vs. the year-earlier quarter. It was the first quarter in nine that Analog Devices' sales have fallen and the second period of declining EPS.But both metrics beat the consensus of 29 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $777.6 million and 62 cents, as well as Analog Devices' own guidance issued three months ago.Consumer sales toppled 27% year over year, leading a 3% fall in communications sales, Analog Devices said. Industrial and automotive sales -- Analog Devices' bread-and-butter segments -- fell 1% apiece.For fiscal Q3, Analog Devices CEO Vincent Roche sees a return to consumer market growth and mid- to high-single-digit growth in the company's business-to-business segments. But the high point of ADI's Q3 sales and EPS guidance lagged Wall Street consensus.Analog Devices guided to $800 million to $840 million in sales and 66-74 cents, down a respective 5% and 9% vs. the year-earlier quarter, missing analysts' model for $846.6 million and 75 cents.On average, Analog Devices' Q3 sales have grown 13.5% year over year, trailing 20% growth in Q4. But recent reports indicate Apple might have cut its component orders for the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September.

554,ADI,"Apple's (AAPL) lukewarm iPhone 7 ramp may slug Analog Devices (ADI) early Wednesday, when the chipmaker is expected to report a 5% year-over-year revenue dip on a 40% sequential plunge in sales to Apple.But a ""bright spot"" of industrial and automotive sales will show a seasonal boost, outplaying rival Xilinx (XLNX), and wireless communication revenue will come off a trough to top competitors Nokia (NOK) and Cavium (CAVM), MKM analyst Ian Ing said Tuesday.In morning trading on the stock market today, Analog Devices stock was up a fraction, near 55.50. Shares are flat for the year vs. a 6% fall in IBD's 38-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group.Analog Devices stock hit a 2016 high on April 27 at 59.87, but it's down 7% in the three weeks since then. In late April, Apple reported its first-ever year-over-year decline in iPhone shipments, in its March-quarter results.Analog Devices is expected to post $777.6 million in sales and 62 cents earnings per share ex items, down a respective 5% and 15% vs. the year-earlier quarter, for its fiscal Q2 ended on or near April 30, according to the consensus of 29 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.That would follow flat Q1 sales and Analog Devices' first EPS decline in 11 quarters. Wall Street expects typically strong Q3 and Q4 sales to also decline -- by 2% and 6%, respectively. Over the past two years, Q3 had risen an average 13.5%, and Q4 sales had gained an average 20%.Recent reports indicate Apple suppliers are getting fewer orders compared with the year-ago period.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer expects Analog Devices to report $30 million in Q2 sales to Apple, down 40% sequentially. For Q3, he models $80 million in sales to Apple vs. consensus views for $110 million.""We suspect modest downside to our Apple revenue estimate for (the second half of the year) offset by upside to (industrial, automotive and communications),"" he wrote in a research report.Apple accounts for about 10% of Analog Devices' sales, Pitzer estimated. Views for $200 million in Apple sales for the latter half of 2016 would be down 15% year over year, but they still ""might be $20 million to $30 million too high,"" he said.But $1.33 billion views for automotive, industrial and communications sales, up 2% vs. the year-earlier period, doesn't reflect accelerating advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and communications infrastructure opportunities, he wrote.Pitzer retained his outperform rating and 72 price target on Analog Devices stock. Ing kept his neutral rating and 56 price target.Analog Devices' messaging has tilted in favor of ""analog utility"" investors vs. momentum growth investors, Ing wrote in a report. Analog utility investors prefer business-to-business ventures over ""volatile"" portables exposure.

555,ADI,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's pledge to make 1 million electric cars by 2020 could be a boon for chipmakers clobbered by the first decline in sales of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone, a major hit product that fueled growth for many Apple suppliers since 2007.Now, hunger for the next growth vector has many chipmakers eyeing the automotive and Internet of Things markets, even as smartphones will remain a key profit center for some semiconductor companies.""I view the IoT market as a massive opportunity, and the autonomous vehicle is a part of that,"" Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher told IBD. ""Over time, this market will experience widespread adoption. Simply, the promise of greater productivity will drive demand over the long run.""The deck is always reshuffled every few years and always to the most innovative technology. We think the IoT is the next battleground.""Kreher expects the IoT industry overall, including automotive, to grow 10% to 15% annually in the next three years.Sensor makers like Analog Devices (ADI), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Texas Instruments (TXN); analog chipmakers like MaxLinear (MXL) and Maxim Integrated Devices (MXIM); and graphics-chip companies like Nvidia (NVDA) are among those seen as especially primed in these fields.But not everyone is as hot on the Internet of Things. Robert Maire, president of tech research and consulting firm Semiconductor Advisers, calls today's cars ""PCs on wheels"" and ""smartphones on steroids,"" but he says other IoT fields typically use cheaper chips than the higher-end chips powering smartphones.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) CEO David Aldrich said in April that the IoT opportunity is ""measured in the tens of billions of units,"" but Maire says that doesn't mean huge revenue growth.""It won't be the Internet of Things (replacing smartphones), because Internet of Things is based on typically trailing-edge semiconductor technology,"" Maire told IBD. ""About $5 worth of semiconductors go into an Internet-connected thermostat that sells for $75-$100.""The Qualcomm (QCOM) chip content alone in Apple's iPhone 6 has been estimated at $20 to $22 per unit by teardown specialist iFixit.But companies such as Qualcomm and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) are looking beyond the smartphone era to a future dominated by smarter cities, smarter devices and smarter cars -- and are eagerly watching efforts by tech heavyweights Tesla, Apple and Google (GOOGL) to make it happen.Still, estimating the size of the IoT chip market is like a game of pin the tail on the donkey. The numbers are high but cover a lot of ground.Last year, research firm McKinsey pegged revenue for the total IoT market at $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion a year by 2025. At the highest end, that means IoT could account for more than 10% of the total world economy.In April, Business Insider estimated there will be 24 billion IoT-connected devices by 2020. More than $6 trillion will be invested in IoT solutions over the next five years, the online news site's Business Intelligence research unit estimates.Many of Apple's chip suppliers want a bite of IoT, but not all. Broadcom (AVGO) in April sold its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) for $550 million. The unit generated just $189 million in revenue in the past 12 months, 3% of Broadcom's total sales.Broadcom declined to comment on the IoT unit's sale or on slowing smartphone sales. In its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, Broadcom reported that its wireless business (which includes smartphone sales) pulled in $578 million in sales, about a third of total revenue. MKM analyst Ian Ing estimates 10% of Broadcom's mobile sales stem from smartphone-saturated China.Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks, Broadcom's rival makers of the radio-frequency chips that go inside smartphones, are buying into the IoT market -- Qorvo doing so literally with its April acquisition of IoT supplier GreenPeak. GreenPeak makes ultra-low-power, short-range wireless chips for smart homes.The acquisition should help Qorvo diversify. Qorvo didn't return requests for comment about slowing smartphone sales. For its fiscal Q4 ended April 2, Qorvo's mobile product sales accounted for $465 million, or about 76%, of total revenue.As for Skyworks, its integrated mobile systems and power amplifiers segments accounted for 73% of its total sales last quarter. Apple's iPhone 6S uses two Skyworks power amplifier modules, teardowns show.But Skyworks' broad markets division, which includes IoT-related sales, grew 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and made up 25% of sales, Aldrich said on the company's earnings conference call in April. He estimated the IoT opportunity growing at an 83% compound annual growth rate through 2020.Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy supplier Integrated Device Technology acknowledges the smartphone slowdown but says its future is in wireless charging. IDT's chips are used inside portable devices to enable wireless charging, which will become ever more important as Apple reportedly prepares to eliminate wired charging entirely from the iPhone 8 in 2017.IDT is about 17% exposed to the mobile market, CTO Sailesh Chittipeddi told IBD.Smartphones have reached a saturation point. But not every piece of accompanying technology has peaked, Chittipeddi said. RF suppliers Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks also say that while unit shipments might stagnate, dollar content will grow. In January, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said RF content has grown 20%-plus every year regardless the number of units shipped.Qualcomm -- doubly exposed through its chip sales and licensing business -- is also bullish on continued growth of its smartphone business. The breadth of technology on a smartphone will only continue to grow, CEO Steven Mollenkopf told analysts during the company's February analyst day.""The smartphone ecosystem is going to continue to grow, as wireless charging penetration of that market continues to increase,"" Chittipeddi told IBD. ""People still sell over 1.2 billion smartphones per year and not every one of them today has wireless charging.""And there are other demands for wireless charging. In March, IDT hosted a Hackster challenge, instructing participants to come up with new uses for wireless charging. Er Bharath Ram came up with an on-the-go coffee maker, beating out oddities like a tiny remote-controlled tank, a ""magic toothbrush"" and shoes for Alzheimer's sufferers.""Furniture, automotive applications, headsets, warmers, drones ... will provide growth,"" Chittipeddi said, though he concedes not as much growth as a new, high-volume smartphone.Last year, IDT expanded into sensors with the $310 million acquisition of ZMDI, Chittipeddi said. IDT plans to leverage that sensor business within the burgeoning automotive and infotainment market competing against NXP Semiconductors.About the same time IDT wrapped its ZMDI acquisition, NXP finished up its nearly $13 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductors. NXP now boasts a $28.5 billion market cap to IDT's $2.7 billion. NXP CEO Rick Clemmer estimates 40% of his company's sales stem from the automotive segment.Clemmer says NXP spotted the smartphone's deceleration well ahead of time. Although, like Chittipeddi, he still sees growth for specialized smartphone tech. NXP chips are used to encrypt mobile payments for systems like Apple Pay, Samsung Wallet or Google Wallet.""Maybe 15% to 20% of smartphones have mobile wallets (and) we think that can go up to 60%,"" he said. ""We see a tripling of our volume because of the increased share that has the mobile wallet technology.""Buying Freescale helped de-emphasize mobile. In Q1, NXP's $471 million in secure connected devices (mobile) accounted for 21% of sales. But Clemmer says that exposure, on average, is about 15%. It also allowed the combined company to become the top automotive chip player, he says.NXP is also working with Tesla, Google, Apple and  Ford (F) as they work to develop self-driving cars, Clemmer says, another key push for NXP.That automotive opportunity will be huge, says Nvidia's director of automotive, Danny Shapiro. In April, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang unveiled a trio of autonomous cars code-named BB8, C3PO and R2D2 -- a riff on the popular ""Star Wars"" franchise.Like NXP, Nvidia has developed an autonomous-driving platform for carmakers. Unlike NXP, Nvidia only briefly dabbled in smartphones for which graphics only need to be ""good enough,"" Shapiro told IBD. Nvidia, he says, is angling for the bleeding edge of tech.So, no smartphone chips from Nvidia. ""There's no value there for us,"" Shapiro said. But ""I believe the car will be the most powerful computer you will ever own. ... We've moved beyond the graphics in your vehicles to being able to process the data. And for that, you need a supercomputer.""

556,ADI,"Major averages ended sharply lower Thursday as a market under mild distribution showed more of it, at least on the Nasdaq.The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq each lost 1.2%. The S&P 500 gave up 0.9%. Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volume coming in higher than Wednesday's levels in the stock market today.Stocks were pressured early after the Bank of Japan surprisingly held its monetary policy unchanged. That sent the yen soaring against the euro and the U.S. dollar and also sent Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 to a 3.6% loss.On the home front, the Labor Department estimated Q1 GDP growth at 0.5%, sharply below Q4 growth and below the consensus view for 0.7%.Amazon (AMZN) headlined Thursday's after-hours session with a big Q1 beat. Shares surged 12%. Amazon is a member of the Leaderboard portfolio at Investors.com. Other after-hours movers included LinkedIn (LNKD), up 4.5% and Baidu (BIDU), up 2%.During the regular session, Facebook (FB) easily led the Nasdaq 100 with a 7% advance. Facebook’s Q1 earnings report late Wednesday triggered a handful of analyst price target increases Thursday morning. Nasdaq 100 chip stocks lagged, including Xilinx (XLNX), NXP (NXPI), Lam Research (LRCX) and Analog Devices (ADI).Earnings reports also lifted shares of PayPal (PYPL) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), but both stocks ended near session lows after early strength.In M&A news, Abbott Labs (ABT) announced plans to buy St. Jude Medical (STJ) in a $25 billion cash and stock deal.

557,ADI,"Petering Apple (AAPL) and Samsung demand prodded a Raymond James analyst to downgrade suppliers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and others, even with the iPhone 7 launch expected in September.Apple suppliers broadly fell in morning trading on the stock market today. Radio-frequency chip companies Qorvo and Skyworks were down 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively, on the downgrade, tugging rival Broadcom (AVGO) down 1.3%.Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) stock was down more than 1%, while Apple suppliers Analog Devices (ADI), NXP and Texas Instruments (TXN) stocks were all down roughly 1%.In all, Raymond James analyst Steven Smigie downgraded six semiconductor stocks to outperform from strong buy, citing likely in-line earnings and minimal upside to June guidance.Following a January drop in the stocks, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has rebounded 20% since mid-February, Smigie wrote in a research report. Some stocks have run up 40%, he noted.But ""with only modest signs that there is the potential for near-term upside to (earnings per share), and some signs of modest downside, we worry that shares have a limited upside, with reasonable downside risk,"" he wrote.Confidence could improve in the seasonally stronger second half of 2016, when Apple typically launches its newest iPhone flagship. But ""Apple is seeing modestly lower demand,"" said Smigie, who questioned the likelihood of a positive June guide by Apple. He also noted some pain points for radio-frequency suppliers that have more than 45% exposure to Apple.""Even if the Apple guide is healthy, we think skepticism will remain until the summer when we start to get evidence of the iPhone 7 ramp and questions about iPhone SE cannibalizing other iPhone models get resolved,"" he wrote.Samsung sales zoomed on its Galaxy S7 flagship, but pre-orders were likely influenced by free Gear VR (virtual reality) giveaways, Smigie wrote. Huawei, on the other hand, is a ""bright spot"" and recently guided to 120 million to 140 million units in 2016. The lion's share of those units will be high-end smartphones, Huawei said.Outside mobile, PC and industrial results have been weak, offsetting some strength in the growing automotive and infotainment arenas -- the latter being NXP's bailiwick following its acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor.But even in the automotive segment, ""we have heard concerns from a number of investors on subprime lending,"" Smigie wrote. Until those fears level out, automotive-exposed semiconductors could face some headwinds.Respective estimates from industry trackers Gartner and IDC show the PC segment saw 9.6% and 11.5% year-over-year declines in Q1 shipments. And March industrial production fell 0.6% vs. expectations for a 0.1% decline, says Smigie.Smigie notes positively, ""we still like many of the stories, however, so all else being equal, on a pullback we could look to get more aggressive again.""

558,ADI,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) ought to acquire Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) to diversify from the slowing smartphone and radio-frequency market, Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell suggested Thursday.Maxim has long been takeover bait with sharks Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) reportedly eyeing the $10.5 billion-market-cap chipmaker in October. But sources told Bloomberg that Maxim might not sell without a high premium.Skyworks could provide that premium, McConnell wrote in a research report. Maxim stock rose a fraction Thursday, to 36.78. Skyworks was flat. An offer of $44 per share would be a 20% premium to Maxim stock, McConnell points out.Acquiring Maxim would help Skyworks diversify beyond its 80% exposure to the struggling mobile market, McConnell wrote. Maxim has ties to the data center and automotive markets.Though Maxim makes the most sense -- McConnell rates both a buy -- Skyworks could also diversify by acquiring Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) or Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), McConnell wrote.RF, Skyworks' bread and butter, is slated for a compound annual growth rate of 11% over the next several years vs. historical 18% growth, McConnell wrote. Skyworks competes in the RF ring with Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO), both Apple suppliers.The number of bands -- a spectrum of RF -- rocketed between 2005 and 2015, Brent Dietz, Qorvo director of corporate communications, told IBD. In 2005, there were two bands. By 2015, there were 43.McConnell sees little opportunity for continued band acceleration. And Dietz offered a similar growth view for the RF market -- a $10 billion market opportunity with a 10%-15% growth rate.But Dietz notes that the RF content in smartphones has gapped up this century. Less complex 2G phones had about 80 cents worth of RF content. Today, most smartphones have about $16 worth of RF.To that point, Broadcom's mobile RF content grows in excess of 20% every year, CEO Hock Tan said during the company's Q1 earnings conference call. He expects 2016 to be no different.This year, Qorvo and Skyworks offered similar views of growing dollar content in marquee smartphones. Recent teardowns show that Samsung completely replaced three Skyworks chips in its Galaxy S7 and that Qorvo twice replaced Broadcom.

559,ADI,"Apple (AAPL) suppliers Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Analog Devices (ADI) are lapping up foundry capacity in the back half of 2016 in anticipation of the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September, according to a report.The duo recently requested that foundry and back-end service providers reserve a significant portion of production capacity in Q2 and Q3, industry insiders told Digitimes.com.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Cirrus Logic stock was up nearly 4%, and Analog Devices stock was up a fraction.Cirrus Logic and Analog Devices are expected to have a big impact on the design of Apple's iPhone 7, which is widely expected to be the name of the next phone in Apple's smartphone line. Audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic began touting its noise-canceling headphones in January.""There are definitely people considering putting that (noise-canceling headphones) in the (mobile) box,"" Cirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode said during the company's earnings conference call. But Rhode didn't specifically mention the iPhone. Apple generally encourages suppliers to refrain from any such comments.Apple's iPhone 7 is expected to be thinner, ditching the headphone jack in favor of a Lightning cord connection.The iPhone 7 will also likely include Force Touch -- a feature introduced in the iPhone 6S, which was released last September. Analog Devices is the rumored provider for the Force Touch technology, but tear-downs don't make the supplier apparent.And it appears that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) will manufacture the lion's share, if not all, of Apple's A10 processors, insiders told Digitimes. Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung both sourced the A9 inside the iPhone 6S series.That was the first time that the two companies shared this job. Previously, the pair had battled for Apple's processor-supply manufacturing contract, leapfrogging each other from year to year. In December, Wall Street began whispering that Samsung wouldn't pursue the A10.

560,ADI,"FAA and NOAA demand for weather applications will drive approximately $500 million in additional annual revenue over the upcoming five years for IBD Leaderboard stock Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), a Needham analyst said Friday following the chipmaker's ""upbeat"" analyst day.Macom stock rose 5.8% on the stock market today, to 43.79 -- nearing its all-time high of 44.15, achieved Monday -- and extended 5.7% from a 41.42 buy point.IBD's 41-company Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group jumped 2.3% Friday, spurred by Macom. Shares of chip rivals Analog Devices (ADI), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) -- all Apple (AAPL) suppliers -- rose 1.2%, 2.2% and 3.5%, respectively.Needham analyst N. Quinn Bolton reiterated his buy rating and 46 price target on Macom stock. Barclays boosted its price target on Macom stock to 44 from 41 and maintained an overweight rating.Optical, gallium nitride (GaN) and active antenna radar could each double Macom's approximately $500 million revenue over the next three to five years, ""potentially driving up to $2 billion of annual revenue by 2020,"" Bolton wrote in a research report.""While management was clear the team may not bat 1,000 and that timing of specific product ramps was difficult to accurately forecast, management has clearly set an objective to become a much larger company,"" he wrote.Macom’s $2.3 billion market cap puts it distantly behind industry leader Intel (INTC) and Intel’s $150 billion market cap. Unlike its Apple-supplying rivals, Macom’s chips aren't focused on consumer products but instead are used in commercial and industrial applications like cellphone base stations, military radar and lasers.Macom also is developing GaN-on-silicon chips, squaring off with privately held Transform, Infineon Technologies and Efficient Power Conversion (EPC). GaN transistors can turn on and off faster than silicon, can withstand a higher voltage and are markedly smaller.Last year, EPC figured out how to make them cheaper, too, EPC CEO Alex Lidow told IBD in February. Lidow used to head up International Rectifier, which Infineon acquired in 2014. Companies like EPC aim to use GaN in electronic components such as transistors.EPC grows a thin layer of gallium nitride on silicon wafers and, like Macom, it uses the chips in cellphone base stations.""GaN is being used in base stations, going up in Google balloons and Facebook (FB) drones,"" Lidow said. Other applications include a swallowable colonoscopy pill, autonomous cars (Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) are among the competitors) and wireless charging.Lidow estimates a $370 billion total addressable market -- $30 billion in power, $40 billion in analog and $300 billion in digital.Macom is trying to grab some of it. The company has been in talks with smartphone makers Huawei, Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERIC) for over a year and just recently completed customer validation, Bolton wrote.""If the commercial contract negotiations go well, management believes the company could generate first production revenue for GaN-on-Si (GaN-on-silicon power amplifiers) by year-end 2016,"" he wrote.Macom estimates that it can scoop 40%-60% of the base station power amplifier market over the next three to five years.RELATED: 5 Chip Stocks To Watch, Moving Up, With Apple's Big Event March 21

561,ADI,"Sony (SNE) aims to broaden its SmartWear line and Internet of Things offerings with its pending $212 million acquisition of LTE and modem chipmaker Altair, announced Tuesday.The announcement forced a small reverse in Sony stock. Shares rebounded a fraction after falling as much as 1.6% in the stock market today. The PlayStation maker's shares have fallen 14% so far this month.Israel-based Altair makes low-power, high-performance modem chips and related LTE technology, a 4G smartphone standard.""LTE is already widely used in data communication for mobile phones, and is also expected to play a pivotal role in the interconnection of the Internet of Things,"" Sony noted.With the Altair acquisition, Sony expects to invest hefty R&D into developing new sensor chips to work in conjunction with Sony's global navigation satellite system and image sensors.The combination will be ""a new breed of cellular-connected, sensing component devices,"" according to Sony. The acquisition is expected to close early next month.By acquiring Altair and delving further into the sensor market, Sony is taking direct aim at Apple (AAPL) suppliers like InvenSense (INVN), Analog Devices (ADI) and Bosch, which create sensors used in the iPhone 6S series.On the wearable side, Sony's SmartWear competes with other smartwatches such as the Apple Watch and Samsung Gear series.

687,ADI,"Catwalks from New York to Milan confirmed the trend this spring: sneakers have arrived.Models during the spring shows trotted out the latest designer fashions footed in all manner of sneaker styles, from basic white to colorful high-tops.A look around the office, mall or line at your local coffee spot says as much. Sneakers are entrenched fashion accessories. Of course, teens are still the early and most active adopters, coveting the latest fanciful launches from top brands — from flat Converse All Stars to high-tech performance athletic shoes.Teens' penchant for the next new sneaker has been powering strong results at athletic footwear retailer Foot Locker (FL), an IBD 50 stock.Its core ""sweet-spot"" customer base skews to people ages 12 to 20, and heavily male, analysts say.""Teens want brands other kids are wearing,"" said analyst Christopher Svezia of Susquehanna Financial Group.And Foot Locker is delivering. Quarterly earnings have notched up in double or triple digits on a year-over-year basis for all but one of the last 15 quarters. Per-share earnings in the first quarter ending May 3 jumped 22% to $1.11 a share, beating analyst views.Same-store sales in the quarter advanced 7.6%, while total revenue was up 14% to nearly $1.9 billion, also above views.Slam-Dunk SalesFoot Locker's customers are going especially wild for colorful basketball shoes, the fastest growing category in the athletic footwear market.Nike (NKE)-branded footwear, including the hot-selling Jordan basketball brand, accounts for about 60% of Foot Locker's sales, analysts say.New York-based Foot Locker carries a number of other footwear brands with sneaker offerings, including Adidas, Reebok, Under Armour (UA) and Puma.Nike and the Nike-affiliate Jordan Brand are the top two basketball brands in the U.S., with Jordan No. 1, according to the NPD Group.The research firm reported that U.S. basketball footwear sales jumped 21% in the 12 months ending in April, making the category the fastest growing in athletic footwear. The next most popular basketball brands were Germany-based Adidas and its affiliate Reebok.Deutsche Bank Securities estimates that basketball footwear makes up 40% to 50% of Foot Locker's product mix.""Think about all those fancy sneakers, whether running shoes or basketball shoes from Nike or Adidas or whoever. That is why Foot Locker has been outperforming most of its peers,"" said Svezia.Foot Locker competes with Finish Line (FINL) and to a lesser extent Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Sports Authority, among others.The company's core customer, Svezia said, ""is looking for what's next and what's hot — and having it in stock.""Basketball is especially ""critical"" for Foot Locker, Svezia said, adding that the category comes with ""some of the highest prices in footwear,"" at $125 to $250 a pair.Foot Locker's ties with Nike and other brands include brand shop-within-shops such as House of Hoops, Yardline, Fly Zone and Jordan 23 on the Nike side plus Adi Collective and Originals shops for Adidas. As of May 3, the firm boasted 1,041 Foot Locker stores in the U.S., 604 in Europe, 128 in Canada and 92 in the Asia-Pacific region. It also operated 345 Kids Foot Locker stores and 241 Lady Foot Lockers, plus 544 Champs Sports and 276 Footaction locations.Sneakers have also been fueling sales at Kids Foot Locker, which has shown mid-teen to 20% growth the past few quarters, said Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell in a June 13 research note.That suggests the ""sneaker culture is no fad and likely here to stay for years to come,"" he wrote, ""as feet grow.""In a recent phone interview, analyst Sam Poser of Sterne Agee said he expects the largely mall-based Foot Locker to continue to benefit from the ""very strong sneaker trend"" through at least mid-2016 ""as a lot of brands continue to innovate and build up to the (Summer) Olympics.""""Foot Locker has done a great job over the years positioning itself in basketball,"" Poser said in a June 11 report on Foot Locker, which came with a buy rating.""Arguably, Foot Locker globally owns mind share for basketball retail,"" he wrote.Basketball Beyond BordersAccording to Poser, Nike's launch this spring of the Air Jordan 6 ""Carmine"" basketball shoe logged $44 million in sales in the first eight days it was out. He cited data from SportScanInfo.Foot Locker's management has told analysts that passion for basketball is even spreading to soccer-obsessed Europe. They expect that newfound passion to trickle down to basketball footwear sales over time. The company did not respond to an interview request.Foot Locker sales in Europe have been strong, thanks in part to sales of select Nike brands, analysts say.More Stores PlannedThe company is eyeing expansion in Europe. Last year's acquisition of German athletic retail chain Runners Point Group gives it more than 200 Runners Point stores and a related e-commerce site.Foot Locker also plans to expand its children's business through new Kids Foot Locker stores and additional space in Foot Locker locations.But Foot Locker's women's and apparel businesses have been sore spots. Apparel fell to 23% of sales last year from as much as 30% a decade ago, Trussell noted.The company aims to get apparel back to that level in part through the sale of more premium branded products. Apparel has been doing better in stores that have been part of the firm's ongoing remodeling program, he said.On the women's side, Foot Locker is testing a fitness concept called Six:02, which carries yoga pants, work-out wear and other related apparel.Six:02 now has nine stores open and an e-commerce site. Many more stores could roll out as early as next year, Trussell predicted.

691,ADI,"Leading semiconductor company Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) acquired a privately held company, Symeo GmbH, for an undisclosed amount.Based in Munich, Germany, Symeo GmbH develops and manufactures Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) hardware and software, used in automotive and industrial applications. The company’s RF and sensor technology enables real-time position detection, distance measurement and telemetry.Following the acquisition, the Symeo team will join ADI's Autonomous Transportation and Safety (ATS) business unit.However, the stock has underperformed the industry it belongs to on a 12-month basis. The company’s shares have gained 15.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 24.9%. What’s Retaining Analog Devices’ Interest?Analog found the deal appealing because Symeo's signal processing algorithms offer high precision RADAR solutions. These solutions enable system integrators and original equipment manufacturers to work with great precision in rough industrial environments. The deal provides Analog’s customers a RADAR platform with improvements in angular accuracy and resolution.Also, the acquisition will expand the company’s share in the autonomous automotive segment. RADAR and cameras are sensor technologies that today’s ADAS systems are increasingly using to provide advanced safety features like forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, blind spot detection and autonomous driving mode.In the last reported first-quarter fiscal 2018, the Industrial segment accounted for 49% of total revenues, which soared 87.4% year over year and 4% sequentially to $743.6 million. Also, Automotive accounted for 16.6% of total revenues and jumped 76.4% from the year-ago quarter and 5.1% from the previous quarter to $252.2 million.The deal will help the company gain a greater share in both the growing automotive and industrial markets.Our TakeWe see this acquisition as part of Analog Devices’ ongoing investments in products for the industrial, automotive and aerospace markets.Management is making continuous collaborations with innovative brands to expand its RADAR offerings. Last year, the company collaborated with Renesas Electronics Corporation on a system-level 77/79-GHz RADAR sensor. The new sensor was designed especially for applications in the automotive space that are safer and more connected.We believe, the development of new technology along with a stronger foothold in Europe and China should benefit the company. We expect the company to leverage its already strong market position to penetrate deeper into these growing markets.Analog Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus  Analog Devices, Inc.

The company’s shares have gained only 14.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 24.9%. Analog Devices’ Cash PositionAt the end of fiscal first-quarter 2018, cash and short-term investments totaled $827.6 million, down from $1.05 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Long-term debt was approximately $7.38 billion, down from $7.55 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Net cash provided by operations was $388.7 million in the reported quarter.We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it to capitalize on investment opportunities and pursue strategic acquisitions, further improving its growth prospects. The senior notes’ offering will bring down the company’s cost of capital, in our view, thus strengthening its balance sheet and supporting growth.Moody's RatingAnalog Devices’debt issue was assigned a Baa1 rating by a leading credit rating agency Moody's, along with a positive outlook.The rating has been assigned based on its optimism on Analog’s sustained strong operating performance of the analog segment. The rating agency further believes that the acquisition of Linear Technology has further enhanced Analog’s business profile. Moreover, it expects profitability to improve over the long term, driven by broad geographic, customer and end-market diversification. As a result, for fiscal 2018, Moody expects Analog to generate over $6 billion of revenues and $3 billion of EBITDA.Moody’s assigned a positive outlook on the rating based on its belief that Analog will continue to reduce its debt in the near term and sustain operating performance.Analog Devices, Inc.

695,ADI,"In this week’s video I discuss two companies that recently reported better than expected earnings results, and that have continued upside going into the next quarter.  They are Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), and Dine Brands Global (DIN  -  Free Report).Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report) is a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of a broad portfolio of high performance analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits (ICs) used in virtually all types of electronic equipment. Since their inception in 1965, they have focused on solving the engineering challenges associated with signal processing in electronic equipment. Used by over 100,000 customers worldwide, their signal processing products play a fundamental role in converting, conditioning, and processing real-world phenomena such as temperature, pressure, sound, light, speed, and motion into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic devices.ADI announced earnings on February 28th, where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the 14th consecutive quarter.  On a year over year basis, the company posted +51.1% earnings growth and +54.4% revenue growth.  During the quarter the company saw continued strong demand for analog semiconductors which helped all segments post revenues above expectations. Further, the Linear Technology acquisition in March of 2017 has helped reduce overall costs, and aided the bottom line results during the quarter.Due to the continued success in the semiconductor sector, and the strong outlook for the sector going forward, management gave better than expected guidance for Q2 18; they now expect revenues to come in between $1.43-1.51 billion, above the previous expectation of $1.43 billion, and EPS to be between $1.30-1.44, ahead of the previous expectation of $1.24. To add to the impressive earnings report, the Board of Directors approved a +7% increase in its quarterly dividend bringing the quarterly payment to $0.48, or $1.92 on an annual basis for an annual dividend yield of +2.1%. These positive announcements caused B. Riley FBR Inc. to raise its target price from $113 to $122.As you can see in the Price and Earnings Consensus graph below, ADI has been on an upwards trend since the beginning of 2016.Analog Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus Analog Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus | Analog Devices, Inc. QuoteDue to the earnings report being so recent, there have not been any analysts estimate revisions, but this should change over the next several days. Dine Brands Global (DIN  -  Free Report), previously known as DineEquity, Inc., was created from a foundation established by IHOP - an American icon to their guests and a franchising company focused on providing strategic, visionary leadership for their franchisees, unparalleled opportunities for our team members, and enhancing value for their shareholders. By bringing Applebee's together with IHOP, they made a bold, new commitment to their brand-revitalization abilities and to the power of franchising. DineEquity has successfully made their two businesses more powerful and more successful than either brand could have been apart.Dine Brands Global also recently reported earnings where they beat both top and bottom line expectations.  The big take away from the report was the improved success in the Applebee’s segment which was due to its value offerings, and advertising strategies that have progressed faster than expected.  This operational execution turnaround saw comparable same restaurant sales improve by +1.3%, and caused management to increase FY 18 comp sales expectations (flat to +3.0%).   The success of Applebee’s is also expected to improve royalty collections in 2018. Further, the long term outlook has significantly improved under new CEO Steve Joyce who has a solid track record of operating multi-brand companies, and franchise models.  He and his management team introduced a 5 year plan which includes; sustaining positive comparable same restaurant sales, unit growth domestically for the IHOP franchise (expected to open between 85-100 restaurants in 2018), cost management measures, dividend payments with a 35-45% payout ratio of adjusted free cash flows, and new acquisitions. The earnings report and future goals set by management caused the stock price to jump up by over +16%.  The graph below shows the huge improvement in the stock price and future earnings estimates.DineEquity, Inc Price and Consensus DineEquity, Inc Price and Consensus | DineEquity, Inc QuoteTo add to the positive news, the company also pays a big +5.1% annual dividend yield.  So we have a solid turnaround story, with a very nice dividend. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.67%.Adjusted earnings of 7 cents per share were significantly better than 1 cent delivered in the year-ago quarter.

698,ADI,"Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report) recently announced that its executive vice president and chief financial officer, Mark Garrett will step down this year.Adobe also announced the retirement of its executive vice president and general counsel, Mike Dillon, which will happen this year.However, both of them will stay with the company until their suitable successors are appointed.Garrett, 60, joined Adobe in 2007 and has played an instrumental role in the transformation of the cloud-based software provider to a subscription-focused business. During his term at the company, recurring revenues have grown to more than 85% from 5% in a span of 10 years.Guidance UpdatedAdobe also updated its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2018.The company said that owing to the latest changes in United States tax laws related to repatriation of foreign earnings, re-measurement of deferred tax assets and revision in the tax rate to 17% compared with its previous target of about 9%, it will incur a one-time charge of roughly $85 million in the first quarter.Adobe now expects to earn $1.05 a share, or $1.43 on an adjusted basis, in the first quarter compared to the previously estimated profit of $1.15 a share or $1.27 on an adjusted basis.However, these changes are going to benefit Adobe over the long haul. These will significantly boost fiscal 2018 earnings due to lower corporate tax rate.Adobe now expects to earn $4.72 a share, or $6.20 a share on an adjusted basis, up from the previously forecast $4.40 a share or $5.50 on an adjusted basis for fiscal 2018. Revenues are expected to be around $8.73 billion.Shares of Adobe rose 1.08% on Monday following the news.

As of Dec 1, roughly 89% of the cash held by the company or $5.82 billion was parked offshore.Adobe is expanding its campuses in the Bay Area and Utah to accommodate its growing employee base.

699,ADI,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is ADTRAN, Inc. (ADTN  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in ADTN.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen four estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 94 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 30 cents.Also, for the current quarter, ADTRAN has seen three downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 17 cents a share from earnings of 16 cents over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 28.1% in the past month.ADTRAN, Inc.

700,ADI,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently signed a memorandum of understanding with four leading Chinese handset developers, namely, Lenovo Mobile Communication Technology, Ltd., Guangdong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp., Ltd., vivo Communication Technology Co., Ltd. and Xiaomi Communications Co., Ltd., for a multi-year sale of RF Front-End solutions. The value of the deal is more than $2 billion. Notably, China is the most important market for Qualcomm after the United States.However, the company also received a bad news. The EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, has slapped a fine of €997 million (approximately $1.24 billion) on Qualcomm over anticompetitive practices related to mobile chipset sale. The EC claims that an iPhone/iPad modem exclusivity deal between Qualcomm and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which lasted from 2011 to the end of 2016, amounted to anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm abused its dominant market position for 4G LTE chipset and payed significantly to Apple to secure modem exclusivity.Another Major Recent DevelopmentOnly a week ago, in a major relief to Qualcomm, the EC gave its nod to the company for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) with some restrictive conditions. At the same time, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission also gave its nod for the deal. Notably, the deal has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities. Only China is left to give its approval, which Qualcomm believes it will get very soon.The major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market for smartphones and tablets. NXP, on the other hand, manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, its acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Likely Effect on Broadcom’s Hostile BidOn Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom submitted a bid to acquire Qualcomm for a consideration of $130 billion (including $25 billion in net debt). On Nov 13, Qualcomm’s board of directors turned down the offer on grounds of inadequacy, as it is currently the largest mobile chipset maker globally. Notably, Qualcomm has a market cap of around $95.4 billion against which Broadcom’s paltry $105 billion offer is quite disappointing. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.Broadcom has since proposed replacing Qualcomm's board of directors and the matter will be put to a shareholder vote in March 2018. With NXP almost in its kitty, the enlarged Qualcomm could make it more difficult for Broadcom to take over the company.Moreover, the EC’s decision to fine Qualcomm $1.24 billion on charges that it offered discounts in exchange for chip purchase commitments will also raise questions on its business practices. The EC's ruling comes 13 months after South Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $853 million for alleged antitrust violations. The largest mobile chipset maker is also facing $1 billion lawsuit from Apple in the United States related to royalty and rebate payments.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

705,ADI,"In a major relief to Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), the EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, gave its nod for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) with some restrictive conditions. At the same time, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission has also given its nod for the deal. Notably, the deal has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities. Only China is left to give its approval, which Qualcomm believes it will get very soon.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm had entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the latter’s acquisition. Per the deal, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP.In June 2017, the EC had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The regulator had conducted an in-depth probe to see if the deal leads to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command a strong market position with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications.Concessions Offered by QualcommQualcomm agreed to grant rivals licenses to NXP's transport fare collection technology for eight years. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) and secure element patents except for defensive purposes as well as for its own baseband chipset. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable smartphones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.Qualcomm has told the EC that it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents as well as some nonessential patents for near-field communications services, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer. These third-party buyers would be obliged for three years to grant others royalty-free licenses to use those patents. Qualcomm will acquire a few of NXP's other nonstandard essential NFC patents though it would also be obliged to grant royalty-free licenses to others for use of those patents.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Additionally, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. In fact, the company’s business has remained stagnant for the last couple of years.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, its acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Likely Effect on Broadcom’s Hostile BidOn Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom submitted a bid to acquire Qualcomm for a consideration of $130 billion (including $25 billion in net debt). On Nov 13, Qualcomm’s board of directors turned down the offer on grounds of inadequacy as it is currently the largest mobile chipset maker globally. Notably, Qualcomm has a market cap of around $95.4 billion against which Broadcom’s paltry $105 billion offer is quite disappointing. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.Broadcom has since proposed replacing Qualcomm's board of directors and the matter will be put to a shareholder vote in March 2018. With NXP almost in its kitty, the enlarged Qualcomm could make it more difficult for Broadcom to take over the company.NXP is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and a global network of distribution channel partners.The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Also, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the transaction’s closure.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have gained 31.9%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 13.6% over the past 90 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

709,ADI,"Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) division Google recently signed a patent licensing deal with Tencent Holdings Ltd in an attempt to find ways to grow in China, the second largest economy, where many of its products have been discontinued.The cross licensing deal with Chinese social media and gaming firm, Tencent will allow the companies to come together and create new technologies. Though Google hasn’t disclosed the scope and financial terms of the patent deal but it covers a wide range of products.Google has entered into similar agreements before with companies like Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Cisco Systems.  However, this is the first time that it has collaborated with a large Chinese technology firm. According to Google, such agreements reduce the possibility of litigation on patent infringement.Google's head of patents, Mike Lee said, ""By working together on agreements such as this, tech companies can focus on building better products and services for their users.""Notably, shares of Alphabet have gained 37.1% in the past 12 months, outperforming the 26.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Why this Deal?Despite a strict Chinese policy that imposes restrictions on foreign firms, including censorship, the search giant has been trying to rebuild its presence in the market.Google has undertaken many initiatives like sharing its artificial intelligence software, investing in local projects like AI research lab and introducing a version of its translation app to get back to business with China.We believe Tencent will turn out to be a key ally for Google as it operates China’s widely used social media and payments app, WeChat and its most famous app store. Tencent is also quite famous for hosting the largest gaming and livestream platforms in the country. With Tencent’s push, the tech giant can make its way into China.Why is China Important for Google?Google has had a bad history with China. Since 2010, Google’s search engine has been banned in the Chinese market along with its app store, email and cloud storage services. The company is losing a lot of revenues because of these restrictions.When Google exited China back in 2010, the company had 36% share of search advertising and online ad spending was $3.7 billion. During that period, the company used to generate roughly $300 million every year from China. Since its exit, total ad spending in China has skyrocketed. Last year, ad spending in China was $84.4 billion, according to WPP's GroupM.Owing to the ban on Google Play, the company is missing out on potential revenues too. According to App Annie, Chinese consumer spending on applications is ballooning up. People spent nearly $35 billion on apps in 2017 and this aggressive growth is expected to continue in the upcoming years.Clearly, Google doesn’t want to miss out this opportunity. The Information reported that the company has plans to introduce a censored version of Play Store in China by partnering with a Chinese company, Netease. This shows how keen the search giant is to get back to China.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAlphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are SMART Global Holdings, Inc.

InfiniBand-based products contributed 43% of total revenues during the quarter, Mellanox was selected by a tier 1 U.S. (Original Equipment Manufacturer) OEM in order to supply 25 gigabit per second Ethernet adapters. Users are selecting Mellanox due to the robustness and feature advantages of its ConnectX solutions over its peers’ products.Ethernet revenues grew 73% on a year-over-year basis and sequentially 11%, driven by significant increase in customer demand for the company’s 2550 and 100 gigabit per second Ethernet Solutions.The transition to 25 gigabit, 50 gigabit and 100 gigabit Ethernet will help Mellanox to post multi-year growth across various sectors such as cloud, storage, hyperscale and machine learning.However, management decided to discontinue its 1550 nanometer silicon photonics development activities as the business did not generate profits. Moreover it believes that this decision will not have an impact on the company’s revenues going forward.The company started shipping BlueField chips during the quarter, resulting from EZchip acquisition, which has been experiencing increased market traction.Operating ResultsNon-GAAP gross margin was 68.8%, which declined 310 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to lower margin product.Non-GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at $125.4 million, up 9% year over year.

Moreover, Non-GAAP operating margin is to be in the range of 18% to 19%.Our TakeMellanox reported stellar fourth-quarter results, and provided an encouraging first-quarter and fiscal 2018 revenue guidance. We believe the transition from 40 gigabit to 50 gigabit and 100 gigabit and introduction of 200 gigabit Ethernet solutions augur well for the company given growing demand for such products.Also, new design wins for Spectrum products is likely to benefit the company.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderMellanox sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include IntriCon Corporation (IIN  -  Free Report), Analog Devices, Inc.

712,ADI,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is going great guns with global expansion of its media services. Recently, the company announced that it’ll begin pushing Amazon Music service to Australia and New Zealand from Feb 1. The new subscribers will get a 90-day free trial and it will be available on all widely used platforms. The service will be later charged $5 a month.Also, Amazon announced that it has started accepting pre-orders in Australia for Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Plus devices for $149 AUD, $220 AUD and $79 AUD, respectively. To attract customers, the company has also discounted all three devices by $30 AUD for a limited period. The shipment of these devices will begin early next month.The smart speakers will come with a regional version of Alexa, featuring Australian and New Zealand accent. This along with local knowledge offerings and skills were created by developers in the region.Notably, shares of Amazon have gained 60.3% in the past 12 months, substantially outperforming the 23.7% rally of the S&P 500.  Alexa! Let's Discover New MarketsApparently, Amazon has been putting in a lot of effort to search for new markets for its Alexa powered devices and its services like Music and Prime. The rate at which the company is penetrating new markets makes us optimistic. In December, the company had announced that it’s expanding in 28 new countries.This growing presence will help Amazon maintain its dominance in the smart speakers market. It already holds almost 70% share in the market, per eMarketer.Our TakeAmazon Alexa powered Echo devices have been one its best performing products so far, evident from their performance in the holiday season. Per the company’s statement, Echo Dot was the top-selling product on Amazon.com during the holiday season. Also, Per TechCrunch, which quoted Voicebot, it is estimated that Amazon sold more than 20 million Alexa devices and 1 million non-Echo smart speakers with Alexa built-in through the third quarter of 2017.These devices support Amazon’s bottom line even after sale by complementing Amazon’s other services. Per Cowen & Co. consumer tracking survey, 84% of the Echo users in the United States use it for listening to music.  Expanding in new countries will help in increasing its Music Unlimited user base. Consequently, its recurring revenue base will improve.Moreover, we believe that the expansion will not only help Amazon to sell products in these countries  but also help it to get a lot of user data that it can utilize to provide more customer-oriented services in these countries. This will bode well for the company’s top line in the long haul.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAmazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices, Inc.

713,ADI,"Coupa Software Inc. (COUP  -  Free Report) concluded the earlier announced offering of $230 million of convertible unsecured senior notes to enhance liquidity. The unsecured, senior notes would pay interest at a rate of 0.35% semi-annually per annum. The notes are slated to mature on Jan 15, 2023, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.The notes were offered to qualified institutional buyers only and in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The gross proceeds of $230 million include an option of additional $30 million aggregate principal amount given to the initial purchasers.The conversion rate for the notes will remain at 22.4685 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes initially, and subject to adjustments in certain cases. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 32.5% to the closing price of Coupa’s commonstock on Jan 11, 2018, which was $33.59 per share.The company’s estimates state that the net proceeds from this offering of notes will be approximately $223 million, after the initial purchasers optimally exercise their option and deducted discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses.It used nearly $23.3 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. It also intends to use the remaining of the net proceeds for the general corporate purposes, strategic acquisitions and working capital.Upon conversion, the notes are most likely to be settled in cash, shares of Coupa’s common stock or combination of the two. The notes will be redeemable, at the company’s option at any time on or after Jan 20, 2021 at a price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, added with the accrued and unpaid interest. This choice of redemption will apply only if the last reported sale price per share of Coupa’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on each of at least 20 trading days.Notably, the stock has returned 42.2% in a year, slightly better than the 25.9% rally of its industry.We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it in capitalizing on investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions, further improving growth prospects.

714,ADI,"ADTRAN Inc. (ADTN  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 results with both the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s earnings (excluding 28 cents from non-recurring items) of 5 cents per share compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. The figure excludes the $11.9 million charge pertaining to tax expense from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Earnings however, declined 68.7% year over year.Total revenues of $126.5 million came in marginally above the consensus mark of $125.9 million. The metric declined 22.4% year over year. Both Product and Service sales decreased 24.2% and 15.8%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.As expected, results in the quarter were greatly affected by a merger-related review and a slowdown in its spending at a domestic Tier 1 customer. The massive year-over-year fall in earnings and revenues seemed to have displeased investors. Consequently, the stock fell 3.3% since the earnings release on Jan 16.Quarterly gross margin came in at 46.5% compared with 43.4% in the prior-year period. Operating loss in the reported quarter totaled $4,068 million compared with operating income of $4,272 million in the year-ago quarter.At the end of the fourth quarter, ADTRAN reported $42,370 million of cash used in operations compared with $42,002 million cash generated from operations a year ago.

715,ADI,"Nutanix Inc. (NTNX  -  Free Report) is looking to offer $400 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes in a private placement. The notes are slated to mature in 2023. The notes will be offered to institutional buyers qualifying under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The offering is subject to certain market conditions.Notably, the company is looking to grant preliminary buyers the privilege of buying another $60 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes within a period of 13 days (from and including) of the date of first issuance of the notes.These notes, once placed, will be an unsecured senior liability of Nutanix, interest for which will be paid in arrears semi-annually.

With the U.S. treasuries offering low rates, corporate bonds and borrowings from banks are now witnessing elevated demand. We believe these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth.Nonetheless, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability.

716,ADI,"Zacks Investment Research downgraded FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (FUJIY  -  Free Report) to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on Jan 15, 2018. Going by the Zacks model, stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #4 are likely to perform weaker than the broader market in the next one to three months.Why the Downgrade?Fujifilm conducts its business in a highly competitive market. Extensive business rivalry makes consumers’ demand highly elastic and hence exposes the company to risks to market share loss. In order to boost up brand recognition within the competitive industry, Fujifilm stays under constant pressure to make newfangled research and development investments. However, lofty innovation expenses often weighs on the company’s aggregate margins, and proves to be futile if an innovation becomes obsolete.The company’s overseas businesses are exposed to risks of adverse foreign currency translations. For instance, in second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues of Fujifilm’s Documents Solutions segment were hurt due to negative foreign exchange translation impact.Moreover, Fujifilm predicts that uncertain geopolitical environment in the overseas market (like unclear impact of the Brexit referendum in Europe) might weigh over its near-term profitability.We also notice that revenues of Fujifilm’s graphic systems business had dipped in second-quarter on account of reduced demand of major product categories such as CTP plates and graphic arts film. We fear that weaker demand might continue to hurt the company’s graphics business and hence depress revenues of its Information Solutions segment.Revenues of Fujifilm’s Documents Solution segment had dipped by almost 1% in second-quarter fiscal 2018 due to weaker sales generated from the Oceania end-markets. Sales of office printing business had dipped in Oceania, Japan and Asia; on account of an upward shift in price mix. Moreover, lower production services business in the United States and Europe has also weighed over the segment’s performance. Also, revenues of the company’s solutions and services business was also lower in the Asia and Oceania end-markets during the reported quarter. We fear that further downfall inOceania revenues might depress Fujifilm’s aggregate revenues in the upcoming quarters.The stock’s projected sales growth is 2.1% and EPS growth is 7% for fiscal 2018 compared to the respective tallies of 5.6% and 58.8% estimated for the industry. Notably, over the last 7 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fujifilm has moved south for both fiscal 2018 and 2019, reflective negative market sentiments.   Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the sector are listed below:Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has pulled of an average positive earnings surprise of 16.34% for the last four quarters.

717,ADI,"Technology stocks had a prolific run in 2017, courtesy of the rapid adoption of cloud-based platforms, increasing demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and significant progress in developing advanced driver assisted system (ADAS) solutions.Moreover, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices became part of the mainstream technology market driven by significant investments from tech bigwigs — Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook.Further, Internet of Things (IoT) technology made rapid strides in 2017. Consumer as well as industrial products and machines were embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.According to latest Earnings Trend, technology sector’s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to improve 14% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues.Semiconductors Biggest GainersSemiconductors are primarily gaining from strong demand for power-efficient and high-performance chips. These are essential to run cloud-data centers and process massive data by using IoT analytics, machine learning and deep learning applications.Moreover, the rapidly expanding IoT market is driving growth for chip components to power applications, particularly ADAS, medical/healthcare and smart devices. Further, rapid development of 5G platform and technology has evolved as another catalyst for semiconductor providers.We believe that these emerging trends have provided much needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to offset loss of business due to the shrinking PC market which still consumes bulk of chips.According to Gartner’s latest data, PC shipments in the quarter were down 2% year over year to 71.6 million units. The downside marked the 13th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.However, IDC’s data contradicted Gartner’s figures due to different techniques used for tracking PC sales as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. According to IDC, PC shipments touched 70.6 million units, marking year-over-year growth of 0.7% and outperforming the research firm’s previous prediction of a fall of 1.7%.Cyber Security Stocks in Focus2017 witnessed a plethora of cyber attacks. Two back-to-back ransomware attacks were reported — WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June — followed by the massive data breach at Equifax in September.In addition to these, the data theft and ransom paid by Uber disclosed in November fueled the bullish momentum of the stocks in this space. Notable companies like Mondelez, FedEx, Merck & Co. suffered from cyber attacks during the year, which may have a material impact on their financial performances.The frequency and severity of attacks have exposed the loopholes of the security systems deployed by enterprises worldwide. Further, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the “bring your own device” (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.These factors increased demand for advanced cyber security solutions that drove stock prices of cyber security companies in 2017.How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right technology stocks that have the potential to beat earnings can be a daunting task. However, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for investors.You can narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement.

The company will also utilize it to pay the cost of the capped call transactions.Notably, the stock has returned 28.7% in a year, slightly better than the 25.2% rally of its industry.Coupa’s Cash PositionThe enhanced capital deployment reflects Coupa’s strong balance sheet and confidence in long-term business prospects.

Cash flow provided from operating activities for the nine months ended Oct 31, 2017 came in at $21.5 million.We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it in capitalizing on investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions, further improving growth prospects.

720,ADI,"A successful investor understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Notably, indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.Mellanox Technologies Inc. (MLNX  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. The company’s shares have returned 57.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 34.3% rally of the industry.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at some of the factors aiding the performance.What’s Working in Favor of Mellanox?In the last reported quarter, Mellanox has delivered a positive earnings surprise 10.9%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 16%.In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mellanox’s next quarter witnessed upward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next quarter is currently pegged at 47 cents per share compared with 46 cents per share projected 30 days ago. Notably, none of the estimates moved downward.The company recently announced collaboration with NEC Corporation to provide support to NEC’s newly announced SX-Aurora TSUBASA systems with its InfiniBand adapters. InfiniBand is highly scalable and its off-loading capabilities that reduce load on CPUs are attracting artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning providers. These design wins are likely to aid top-line growth.Apart from strong demand for Mellanox’s InfiniBand solutions, collaborations with the likes of Atos, VMware and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have helped it expand footprint in the cloud and datacenter market.Mellanox is winning contracts from the likes of NetApp. Additionally, the company’s collaboration with Microsemi Corporation is also anticipated to reinforce its footprint in the high performance computing market going forward.Market research firm IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes), which is ten times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. This exponential growth bodes well for Mellanox’s interconnect solutions owing to growing demand for higher network speeds for fast processing of data.Bottom LineLooking at these positives, we believe that Mellanox is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio. Consequently, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksMellanox sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc.

All the three companies flaunt the same Zacks Rank as Mellanox.NVIDIA, DXC and Analog Devices have a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%, 10.5% and 10.4%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

722,ADI,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has partnered with HomeLab to create a healthy home environment. The partnership will leverage Philips Air Purifier tool along with professional grade AeraSense technology to automatically monitor, react, as well as purify indoor air, capturing 99.97% of particles. In fact, incorporating Philips Air Purifier into HomeLab’s Healthy Home Program will make it easier to track and control air quality in home, facilitating healthier homes.Combining HEPA and VOC purifier with a professional grade PM2.5 monitor, the Philips 2000i Smart Air Purifier tracks pollution trends as well as decrease allergens simultaneously. The active carbon filter aids in trapping toxic gases (VOCs), while the HEPA filter traps minute particles as small as 0.3 microns, including dust mites, pet dander, pollen and mold.Philips Air Purifier’s unique numerical index, connected app and corresponding color ring, alerts users even if there is a minor change in indoor air conditions, supporting HomeLab’s analysis. The collaboration will enable users to visualize allergen levels with the color coded ring and watch air improvement simultaneously as the purifier is set to work. It will also allow users to control the device from smart phones as well as view both indoor as well as outdoor pollution.Our TakeIn the past couple of years, Philips has successfully morphed from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider. However, the company’s near-term profitability is likely to be hurt by sluggish growth prospects of the healthcare market on a global scale. In light of uncertainties like slowing government spending and events surrounding the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) legislation, the company expects the United States to witness low-single digit growth in the healthcare industry.Moreover, country-specific risks for China like anti-corruption initiatives, slow GDP growth and centralized tendering are likely to dampen the prospects of the healthcare industry, thwarting growth. Also, in the HealthTech Other vertical, the company anticipates incurring approximately EUR 80 million of net cost, higher than previous guidance. These costs are likely to negatively impact margins in the quarters ahead.

The company anticipates revenues at the high end of the previous guidance of $130-$136 million issued on Oct 27, 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $133.2 million.The revenue guidance originally reflected a 2-7% increase on a sequential basis, driven by the comeback of the Client SSD Controller segment and stable SSD Solutions segment.Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin is now expected to be near the mid-point of the company's original range of 45.5-47.5%.The company is scheduled to release full fourth-quarter 2017 financial results on Feb 6, 2018.Silicon Motion OutperformsSilicon Motion shares have gained 25.8% in the past six months, massively outperforming the industry’s growth of 13.4%.Last WordsSilicon Motion remains well-poised for growth, driven by synergies from acquisitions and improving NAND supply environment.Management expects the increase in the availability of 64 layer 3D NAND to bring down the high NAND prices, which will eventually improve the financial results. Enhanced supply of NAND flash is projected to drive growth of Ferri and Shannon SSD solutions. Additionally, as the company’s pipelined product, 2nd generation PCIe NVMe client SSD controllers, enter into production, Client SSD Controller sales are anticipated to increase.Silicon Motion is active on the acquisitions front too. The company’s buyouts include FCI, Centronix mobile tv and Shannon systems. These acquisitions have helped it to augment foothold in the mobile communications market.Moreover, the company outshines peers in providing resources for research and development.

725,ADI,"Shares of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) have been performing well of late. If you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Shares of Cadence have returned 69.9% in a year, substantially outperforming the industry's growth of 34.9%.What's Going in Favor of Cadence?Cadence is benefiting from ongoing adoption of its digital and signoff, custom-analog and IP solutions as well as expanding customer base.Further, increasing investments on emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunity for the company in the long haul.Market research firm IDC estimates global IoT spending to grow at a CAGR of 15.6% over 2015-2020 time frame to hit $1.29 trillion in 2020. Moreover, the firm estimates AR/VR spending to accelerate at a CAGR of 198% over the same period to reach $143.3 billion in 2020. This presents significant growth opportunity for semiconductor chip makers as well as electronics sensor developers. We note that these two industries make the majority of customer base. We believe that the company’s expanding product portfolio will help it to win frequent orders as well as new customers from these emerging markets going ahead.The company has also introduced a broad portfolio of interface and memory design IP solutions for automotive applications using TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET Compact process. We note that the expansion of Renesas agreement reflects the company’s growing influence in the autonomous vehicle market. Of late, the company has won orders from well-known companies like MobilEye and Infineon who are developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) related technologies. This is a prudent step given the significant growth prospect of the ADAS market, which is estimated to be worth $42.40 billion by 2021, according to data from MarketAndMarkets.We also note that the company is focused on augmenting footprint in the aerospace and defense segment. Apart from having a dedicated team for the sector, Cadence has expanded systems business through partnerships with established sector players like Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and GE Aviation. We believe that these partnerships will help in driving the company’s market position in the long run.Notably, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.9% in the last quarter. Further, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 12%.Risks PersistHowever, intensifying competition, currency volatility, leveraged balance sheet and stretched valuation remain major headwinds.We note that Cadence currently has a trailing 12 month P/B ratio of 12.17, which compares unfavorably with what the industry observed to some extent, in the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 11.38 and is closer to the high end of the valuation range. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/B perspective.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock at the moment.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCadence carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc.

726,ADI,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with its recent earnings streak, as the company’s earnings have trumped estimates in the four trailing quarters. We believe steady demand from pharmaceutical business, solid recurring revenues, strength in Asia as well as modest recovery in industrial markets will continue to be growth drivers, going forward.Driven by impressive growth drivers, the company’s stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past three months. It has appreciated 6.5%, ahead of the industry’s average growth of 2.3%. We believe that the company’s impressive traction across markets and strong product portfolio will drive growth.Read on to find out the key catalysts for the company right now.Factors at PlayWaters Corp’s key strengths include leading positions in the pharmaceutical market, broad global customer base and an impressive lineup of products. Over the past few quarters, the company has delivered strong organic growth on the back of continuous operational improvement and judicious use of shareholder capital. Going forward, the company remains confident that modest recovery of industrial markets as well as recurring revenue growth will accelerate growth momentum. In terms of geography, impressive growth of recurring revenues is expected to fuel growth in Asia, which is contributing strongly to the overall top line.Being one of the leading players in the mass spectrometry market, the company has been gaining significantly from the sale of its advanced mass spectrometry instruments. Further, the company’s global pharmaceuticals business is gaining traction over the last few quarters and fueling growth of Waters Division. Moreover, the company’s Industrial business is proving to be a major profit churner on the back of increasing regulation around food safety and quality, strict conditions for food testing, along with environmental and fine chemical applications.Moreover, an increased demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions, is a positive. Moreover, the company is benefiting significantly from both of its LC and LC/MS platforms. This apart, its sound financial health adds to strength.Despite these positives, the company’s high-debt levels and the consequent interest expenses remain a burden. In recent times, slower budgetary releases in the United States have hurt the pharmaceutical business in the country. Also, during the reported quarter, the company’s sales were limited due to macroeconomic and government policy uncertainties, which seem to be affecting general business activity in the United States.Moreover, the company is grappling with high R&D expenses and stiff competition, which is hurting revenues as well as margins. This apart, recently, the negative impact of currency translation has reduced sales growth, and this remains a risk for future quarters as well, posing a risk to the company’s financials.Considering growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on Waters Corp.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report), Avid Technology, Inc. (AVID  -  Free Report) and Nutanix Inc. (NTNX  -  Free Report).

727,ADI,"Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (SIMO  -  Free Report) remains well-poised for growth, driven by synergies from acquisitions and improving NAND supply environment. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock bears immense potential owing to a few good growth drivers. However, growth momentum might get hindered by stiff competition and macroeconomic risks like political, economic and social instability.Shares of Silicon Motionhave gained 14.9% in the past three months, significantly outperforming the industry’s 5.2% rally.Let’s now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company’s performance.Key DriversSilicon Motion is a leading developer of microcontroller ICs for NAND flash storage devices and specialty RF ICs for mobile devices.The company is anticipated to benefit from an improving NAND supply environment. Management expects the increase in the availability of 64 layer 3D NAND to bring down the high NAND prices, which will eventually improve the financial results.

This level compares unfavorably with what the industry witnessed over the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 3.41.

728,ADI,"A successful investor understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Notably, indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.Genpact Limited (G  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. The company’s shares have returned 32.9% in a year, substantially outperforming the 9.1% rally of the industry.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at some of the factors aiding the performance.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryGenpact has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 10.4%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10%.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Genpact’s fiscal 2017 witnessed upward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is pegged at $1.60 per share compared with $1.56 per share projected 60 days ago.Valuation Looks ImpressiveOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 21.7x, significantly lower than the Zacks industry’s average of 29.2x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Consequently, the lower the P/E of a stock, the better it is for a value investor.Other Driving FactorsGenpact’s domain expertise in business analytics, digital and consulting sectors is a key catalyst for growth.Notably, management is positive about the growing pipeline on the back of increasing adoption of the company’s transformation services. The enthusiastic approach of the C-level of different companies in transforming business models through digital, data and analytics is turning out to be a positive.Additionally, supply chain management is another sector where the company has growth opportunities. Being recognized as one of the top three leaders in supply chain management by The Everest Group is another positive.We believe its diverse portfolio, enhanced by the offerings of the acquired organizations, will provide Genpact with a competitive advantage against peers like Cognizant Technology Solutions and Accenture.Bottom LineLooking at these positives, we believe that Genpact is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio.Thus, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksGenpact carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc.

729,ADI,"Are you still holding shares of Infineon Technologies AG (IFNNY  -  Free Report) in your portfolio? If yes, then it’s the best time to dump the stock as chances of favorable returns in the near term are slim.The stock has underperformed the industry in the past three months. Infineon’s shares have registered a return of 5.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.9%.Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what is taking this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company down.Growth ImpedimentsInfineon designs, develops, manufactures and markets semiconductors as well as complete systems solutions. The company reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel. Although, revenues increased 8.7% year over year to $2.15 billion in the quarter, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 billion.Moreover, management guidance was disappointing as first-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to decline.The company continues to encounter difficulties with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry that witnesses price erosion and evolving standards. Further, Infineon faces strong seasonal fluctuations in product supply and demand, and any adversity in seasonal conditions may affect sales, going forward.Further, intensifying competition in the automotive and power market segments is a major concern. Additionally, weak Chip Card & Security (“CCS”) revenues will continue to hurt top-line in the near term.Estimates Moving SouthEstimates for the current year have moved south in the past 60 days. The company’s current year earnings estimates moved down by 11 cents to $1.15 per share. Given its weak fundamentals and an unfavorable Zacks Rank, it is likely to keep underperforming in the quarters ahead.Low ReturnGiven the other unattractive attributes like low return on equity (“ROE”), low return on capital (“ROC”) and low return on assets (“ROA”) the stock looks very unappealing. Infineon currently trades at a ROE of 18%, much lower than the industry’s average of 22.3%. Moreover, the company has a ROA of 10.2%, much lower than the industry’s average of 12.4%. Notably, the company has an ROC of 13.5% compared with the industry’s average of 16.2%.Negative Earnings Surprise HistoryInfineon has an unimpressive earnings surprise history. The company underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a negative average earnings surprise of 9.1%.Bottom LineWe expect the aforementioned factors to hurt the company’s near-term profitability. Hence, we recommend investors to stay away from Infineon shares until its Zacks Rank and estimates improve.Stocks to ConsiderNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc.

731,ADI,"A successful investor understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Notably, indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.Microchip Technology Inc. (MCHP  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. The company’s shares have returned 42.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 27.3% rally of the industry.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the performance.Upbeat Q2 ResultsThe company reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.41 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents. The figure improved 50% year over year and 7.6% sequentially.The upside was driven by higher net sales, which increased 15.8% from the year-ago quarter and 4.1% sequentially to $1.01 billion. This marked the first quarter in which the company recorded more than $1 billion in sales.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryMicrochiphas an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 9.3%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 12.2%.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microchip’s current quarter and current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.35 per share, up from earnings of $1.31 per share earlier. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year is currently pegged at $5.45 per share compared with $5.29 projected 60 days ago.Other Driving FactorsMicrochip stated that microcontroller revenues (almost 66% of total revenues) have increased more than $500 million in the last five quarters on the back of strong demand. The company’s major product lines — 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit — were up significantly in the last quarter. We believe that Microchip's expanding product portfolio driven by new launches will continue to expand customer base.Moreover, the company is winning market share as reflected by SIA numbers. It had a market share of 15.84% in the third quarter, which expanded 138 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Management noted that design win funnel continues to be and will increase organic growth. Moreover, acquisitions like SMSC, ISSC, Micrel and Atmel have expanded product portfolio, which is positive for top-line growth.Bottom LineLooking at these positives, we believe that Microchip is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio.Microchip is currently trading at a lower price/earnings (P/E) multiple than the industry average. Therefore, we believe that Microchip with its lower forward P/E valuation of 16.3x compared with the industry average of 27.5x may be a great bet.Thus, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksMicrochip carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) are some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector. All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

734,ADI,"Badger Meter, Inc. (BMI  -  Free Report) has been disappointing investors of late. Is it time for investors to offload this stock from their portfolio? Let’s delve deeper and find out.Estimates Moving SouthThe stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings as well as for 2018 being revised downward over the past 90 days, thus reflecting a negative outlook of analysts. For 2017, the consensus mark has dropped 7.1% to $1.18 per share and for 2018, declined 8.5% to $1.30.Price PerformanceShares of Badger Meter underperformed the industry over the past three months. The stock has gained only 2.8% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.4%.Negative Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters. Further, it recorded an average negative earnings surprise of 3.33% over the last four quarters.Badger Meter, Inc. Price and Consensus  Badger Meter, Inc. Price and Consensus | Badger Meter, Inc. QuoteUnfavorable Zacks Rank and ScoreBadger Meter carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has an unimpressive VGM Score of D. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of these three scores (Value: B, Growth: A, Momentum: B). Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of a stock and select winners.Expensive ValuationBadger Meter's trailing 12-month price to earnings (P/E) ratio is 41.7, above the industry's average trailing 12-month P/E ratio at 21.4. This implies that the stock is overvalued.Disappointing Q3Badger Meter’s third-quarter 2017 earnings declined 10% year over year, affected by elevated brass and other costs. The bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although sales in the quarter increased 3.9% year over year, the metric fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Municipal water sales, which represent around 75% of total third-quarter sales, were impacted by lower sales of residential meters and related technologies.Persistent HeadwindsBadger Meter continues to bear the brunt of rising copper prices, which will hurt its margin performance. Further, delayed orders of the ORION Cellular LTE endpoint will likely dent its municipal water sales in the next quarter. Also, the company noted that sales from the Middle East continue to be irregular in nature. Moreover, higher debt to total capitalization, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality-control costs remains concerns for the company.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Applied Materials, Inc.

735,ADI,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 23.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 by 1.7%. Overall, Waters Corp. outpaced estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWaters Corp.’s key strengths include leading positions in the pharmaceutical market, broad global customer base and an impressive lineup of products. Particularly, Global pharmaceuticals business, which is the company’s largest single market and has been a major profit churner for the Waters Division in the past few quarters. We believe stable demand from pharmaceutical business, modest recovery of industrial markets as well as growth in recurring revenues will benefit the fourth-quarter results.Moreover, the company remains bullish on its Industrial business backed by increasing regulation around food safety and quality, strict conditions for food testing, along with environmental and fine chemical applications. Additionally, an increased demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions, is a positive for its business and is likely to bolster the fourth-quarter sales.During the last reported quarter, the company benefited largely from both of its LC and LC/MS platforms. The company’s liquid chromatography benefited from the ACQUITY Arc System, while mass spectrometry grew impressively, driven by ACQUITY QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole. We believe robust traction of ACQUITY and CORTECS line of products along with strength in end markets are likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.However, the fact remains that rising R&D expenses and high interest expenses remain a burden, consequently eroding profitability for the upcoming results. A significant portion of the company’s revenues is generated from non-U.S. markets. This makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. We believe currency fluctuations to put pressure on top-line growth and margins for the quarter under review.Further, the company grapples with stiff competition from several international instrument manufacturers as well as other companies in both domestic and foreign markets. The company’s key technologies like HPLC, UPLC, MS, LC-MS, thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines are part of a highly competitive industry and are subject to rapid changes in technology.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Waters Corp. this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

The segment accounted for 10% of total revenues in the last quarter. Moreover, segment revenues surged 48.8% from the year-ago quarter to $12.9 million.

739,ADI,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.(MTSI  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in MTSI.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen seven estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $2.55 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.47.Also, for the current quarter, MACOM Technology has seen five downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 13 cents a share from 45 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 16.1 % in the past month.MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.

744,ADI,"Shares of ADTRAN (ADTN  -  Free Report) have struggled for quite some time now due to multiple headwinds. Consequently, the stock declined 21.1% in the last three months, significantly underperforming its industry’s rally of 6.9%. Dismal Q4 LikelyHigh costs are limiting bottom-line growth at ADTRAN for quite some time and the scenario is unlikely to change in fourth-quarter 2017. Detailed results should be out later this month.The below-par guidance issued by the company for the fourth quarter is in line with ADTRAN’s recent struggles. Revenues for the quarter are estimated to be around $125 million (previous guidance: $155-$165 million). The top line is projected to shrink 22.8% on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, the company expects revenues for the first quarter of 2018 at around the same range of its fourth-quarter 2017 revenues.In the final quarter of 2017, earnings per share (adjusted) are anticipated at around a penny. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 earnings are projected to decline 125% and 5.6% year over year, respectively. The negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has declined 24.4% over the last 90 days.The company’s performance in the fourth quarter is likely to be significantly hindered by a merger-related review and slowdown in its spending at a domestic Tier 1 customer.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Construction & Forestry equipment sales is pegged at $2.58 billion for the quarter, reflecting year-over-year jump of 76%.

Improved operational performance resulting from disciplined cost management, and continued investment in innovative technology and solutions will drive the company’s performance.However, China's response in retaliation to Trump's tariff plans by proposing duties on key U.S. imports, including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals remains a concern for Deere. The tit-for-tat retaliatory policies are feared to hit U.S. farm exports and in turn, escalate the troubles of farm-equipment makers like Deere. Further, elevated expenses will impact its results.Share Price PerformanceThe company’s price performance has been impressive over the past year.

759,ADI,"Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 14, after the closing bell. Notably, the company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the past four quarters. Vipshop has been gaining from rising consumer base, driven by increasing preference for online transactions. However, higher promotional costs have been a drag. With these aspects in mind, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly results.Widening Consumer Base to Aid PerformanceVipshop has been consistently gaining from a growing consumer base. In fact, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the company’s revenues surged 27.1% year over year, owing to a 4% rise in the number of active consumers. Moreover, to keep widening operations and consumer reach, the company actively undertook strategic investments, evident from its partnership with Tencent and JD.com.Apart from this, the company made investments in upgrading its technology to enhance the shopping experience of online customers. In this respect, the company launched programs such as the WeChat Mini Program in 2017 and released the trial version of WeChat Wallet in February. Additionally, to serve consumers efficiently, the company has undertaken warehouse expansion efforts, especially on the international front. Moreover, Vipshop continues to bolster its last-mile delivery services. Encouraged by such efforts, analysts polled by Zacks expect the company’s revenues to surge 29.5% during first-quarter 2018 to reach $3,001 million.Vipshop Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Vipshop Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vipshop Holdings Limited QuotePromotional Expenses a WorryVipshop has long been grappling with rising promotional costs, amid a highly competitive online retail market. This has led to lower gross margin in the past few quarters, which has affected the company’s profits. In the last reported quarter, gross margin declined 180 basis points. Although Vipshop has been trying to compensate rising promotional spending’s with reductions in other marketing efforts, it is likely to continue hurting profitability. Additionally, the company’s performance is expected to be dampened by costs associated with investments toward the expansion of the internet finance business, witnessed in the fourth quarter.Thanks to such deterrents, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the impending quarter is currently pegged at 13 cents per share, which depicts a decline of 31.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. The current estimate has been stable over the last 30 days.All said, lets see what the Zacks Model reveals about Vipshop’s upcoming quarterly release.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Vipshop is likely to beat estimates this quarter This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

760,ADI,"Shares of Pure Storage Inc. (PSTG  -  Free Report) have been performing well of late. If you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Shares of Pure Storage, which provides software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers, have returned 40.7% in a year, substantially outperforming the industry's growth of 20.9%.What's Going in Favor of Pure Storage?Pure Storage is rapidly gaining traction in the flash storage market, as evident from its expanding customer base. In the third quarter, the company added more than 300 customers, bringing the total base to 4,000 organizations and reflecting an increase of 54% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, the company’s cloud customers contributed around 25% to business while existing customers contributed 70%. The company’s strong product portfolio with the likes of FlashArray and FlashBlade business segments was the key catalyst. Additionally, its data platform for cloud is gaining traction.Management is optimistic about its scalable storage solutions in an era where the world is typically being driven by big-data, artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics based information. The company is currently focusing on three major aspects, namely increasing cloud customer base, solidifying the position of its next generation workload related core data infrastructure and tapping large enterprises as they “cloudify” their on-premise IT infrastructure.Management is also positive about the company’s partner ecosystem, which assisted it in winning a multimillion dollar deal with a prominent financial services institution.The company stated that the storage market for AI is likely to witness CAGR of 78% over the next five years. Pure Storage is well poised to grab the opportunity. Further, its partnership with NVIDIA, which is a dominant player in AI related computation, is anticipated to be a positive.Notably, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 66.7% in the last quarter.Risks PrevailHowever, Pure Storage faces intensifying competition in the flash-based storage market from the likes of Hitachi, NetApp, Dell EMC, HP Enterprise, Lenovo and IBM.The competition has resulted in a decline in the average selling price (“ASP”). Any decline in ASP will impact the results if shipments do not improve considerably. This will eventually hurt top-line growth going forward.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat in difficult times.

764,ADI,"Yelp Inc. (YELP  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 10. The company beat the Zack Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 576.3%.In the last reported quarter, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 19 cents per share, which declined 29.6% year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents.Revenues increased 12% year over year to $218.2 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $215 million.For the first quarter of 2018, Yelp expects revenues between $218 million and $221 million.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayAdvertising is the primary source of revenues for Yelp. In the last reported quarter, ad revenues, which accounted for 95.5% of total revenues, increased 18.1% from the year-ago quarter to $208.4 million. This was driven by the fastest growing self-serve channel, followed by national and local. Paying advertiser accounts grew 7600 sequentially to reach 163K and increased 21% year over year.Moreover, Yelp is benefiting from its partnership with GrubHub Inc. (GRUB  -  Free Report). Higher-than-expected revenue per order from Eat24, which was divested to Grubhub in October 2017, drove results in the last reported quarter.The collaboration provides users with access to a significant number of restaurants available for food ordering on the platform, which is expected to boost transaction revenues.Further, expansion in customer base of Yelp Reservations, Nowait and Yelp Wi-Fi marketing is a positive. Increasing adoption of Request to Quote is expected to improve advertising revenues in the home and local category.Moreover, accelerating consumer traffic across app and mobile is a positive for the company.  App unique devices grew 20% year over year to approximately 29 million on a monthly average basis in the December quarter. Significant improvement in cumulative reviews is also encouraging.However, increase in operating expenses driven by an expected increase in headcount, product development and sales & marketing expenses will remain an overhang on the bottom line.Yelp Inc.

765,ADI,"TripAdvisor, Inc. (TRIP  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 9.Notably, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, while missing the same in the remaining two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 10.44%.In the last reported quarter, TripAdvisor reported a negative earnings surprise of 60%. Earnings of 6 cents per share declined 63% on a year-over-year basis and 84% sequentially.Revenues of $321 million were also down 26.9% on a sequential basis but increased 1.6% year over year. The company’s year-over-year top line growth was benefited from strong growth in its non-hotel segment. However, it was adversely impacted by the sluggish performance of the hotel segment.Coming to the price performance, shares of TripAdvisor have returned 16.6% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the industry’s rally of 21.8%.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $360.8 million and that for earnings is projected at 16 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.  HeadwindsThe company’s growing marketing investments pose a risk. TripAdvisor’s strategy of taking out online marketing spending from its investment bucket is denting online channel growth which happens to be an important growth driver. This is likely to lower revenue generation.Also, mounting expenses due to new initiatives and investments are hurting the company’s profits. TripAdvisor’s selling and marketing expenditure in 2017 was $849 million, which increased 12% year over year.TripAdvisor’s Hotel segment revenues of $244 million decreased 3% from the year-ago quarter and massively 21.8% on a sequential basis. However, this happens to be the company’s main revenue contributor.Further, tough competition from major tech companies also remains a concern for the market position of the company.Factors to ConsiderThe company has revamped its website to provide travellers a site through which they can book hotels directly and not read reviews only. The move is expected to boost the company’s clicked-based advertising and transaction revenues.TripAdvisor’s strong customer base which includes major players of travel industry like Priceline and Expedia will continue to strengthen the company’s hotel business by boosting traffic.Moreover, regular investment in hotel segment has been helping the company in improving the user experience in regard to price comparison.Further, with the ongoing shift from offline to online system in the market place, the non-hotel segment of the company is poised to reap benefits from the increasing demand.Additionally, TripAdvisor’s mobile monetization initiative bode well for its increasing revenue per shopper on phone which is likely to continue in the going-to-be reported quarter as well. Also, efforts on improving the site design and to offer better products on phone will improve the shopper experience. This will improve the shopper base which will in turn aid the top-line growth.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

766,ADI,"TrueCar, Inc. (TRUE  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8.The company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 112.5%.In the last reported quarter, TrueCar delivered a positive earnings surprise of 400%. Non-Gaap earnings were 5 cents per share as against a loss of 1 cent in the year-ago quarter. The figure grew 150% sequentially.Total revenues increased 12.1% year over year and 0.8% sequentially to $83.1 million. The top-line growth came on the back of higher number of dealers on the company’s platform, especially, independent dealers whose count grew 15% and revenues from these dealers were up 23% year over year in the fourth quarter.Notably, shares of TrueCar have lost 9.3% on a year-to-date basis compared to the industry’s loss of 8.2%.For the first quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $80-$82 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderTrueCar continues to benefit from its strong focus toward improvement of USAA channel, pricing and monetization and OEM business.USAA channel which started gaining traction in the fourth quarter with proper planning is likely to drive the number of units purchased in the quarter under review. This will in turn drive revenues.In fourth quarter, total number of units purchased was 239.5 million, up 9.4% year over year. For the quarter-to-be reported, units are expected to lie in the range of 230-235 million.Further, TrueCar’s continued efforts to improvise its franchise dealer business with the help of effective price alignment will boost the franchise dealer base of the company.Also, the company’s existing OEM incentive programs are running well and are likely to benefit TrueCar’s revenues in the going-to-be reported quarter. Additionally, the ongoing progress in the company’s Capsella project will help the OEM business and trade products to gain momentum with the addition of new features to TrueCar’s consumer site.Moreover, TrueCar trade-in tool’s strong performance is evident from its growing demand among both consumers and dealers mainly in the Northeast and in Florida. The trend is likely to continue in the quarter under review as well.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.

767,ADI,"Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 20, after the closing bell.While the company has been gaining from an expanding online consumer base, its performance is challenged due to higher promotional spending. Notably, Vipshop has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the past four quarters. Its earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding quarter.With these aspects in mind, let’s delve deeper on how things are shaping up for Vipshop’s upcoming results.What to Expect? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at 15 cents and has been stable in the past 30 days. Estimated earnings are in line with the prior-year figure. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,230 million in the said quarter, depicting a growth of 23.9% from the year-ago quarter.Vipshop Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vipshop Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vipshop Holdings Limited Quote Factors Influencing the Quarter Vipshop has been struggling with higher promotional spending to attract customers amid a highly competitive online retail market. This has led to lower gross margin in the past few quarters, thereby affecting the company’s profits. As a result, the company’s shares have underperformed the industry in the past six months. Its shares have lost 39.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.4%.  Vipshop expects this trend of increased promotion spending to linger in the third quarter as well, which is a threat to its bottom-line performance. Further, the company’s performance is expected to be hurt by costs associated with investments in improving delivery operations and expanding the internet finance business.Nonetheless, we expect Vipshop’s top line to benefit from consistent efforts to add customers in the third quarter. The company has been dedicatedly adding strategic units, warehouses and delivery stations to augment customer base. Also, Vipshop has been investing in upgrading its technology to enhance the shopping experience of online customers. While these endeavors bode well for the company’s quarterly results, the aforementioned factors pose significant concerns.What does the Zacks Model Unveils? Our proven model does not show that Vipshop is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although Vipshop carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.SMART Global Holdings, Inc.

The company had a market share of 15.84% in the third quarter, which expanded 138 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter. Microchip Technology Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Microchip Technology Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Microchip Technology Incorporated Quote Analog sales (23.6% of net sales) were almost flat on a sequential basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by capacity constraint at Atmel. Moreover, the company’s intent to offer total system solutions that combines microcontroller cores with analog products and connectivity firmware negatively impacted sales. Revenue recognition for these products were shifted from analog business to the microcontroller business.However, management believes that the higher margin total system solutions will help Microchip retain customers and win new designs in the long haul.

769,ADI,"Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents in third-quarter 2017. Further, adjusted earnings fell 25% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings per share of 31 cents, down 11.4% compared with the year-ago figure. A rise in total costs, along with cost of investment in new business areas proved to be a drag on the earnings performance.Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenues in the quarter was $842,820 million, up 0.5% year over year on a reported basis. However, revenues were flat, when adjusted for currency impact.As for the segments, on a reported basis, Small and Medium Business (“SMB”) Solutions revenues dipped 7.4% year over year to $ 414 million. The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business (down 8.6%) and International Mailing Business (down 3%). Lower recurring revenue streams and lower sales in the top of the line products led to the lackluster performance of the North American Mailing business. Additionally, decline in recurring revenues proved to be a drag on the International Mailing Business.Enterprise Business Solutions (“EBS”) revenues increased 1.4% year over year to $223.5 million. Decent performance form Presort Services (up 4%), partially offset by the production mail business (down 1.9%) drove the top-line growth of this segment. Higher print equipment sales bolstered performance of the production mail business. Higher support services revenues also proved conducive to the growth of this segment.Digital Commerce Solutions reported 19% year-over-year growth in sales to $205.6 million, on the back of strong Global e-commerce (up 28%) as well as Software Solutions businesses (up 12%). Impressive performance in all cross-border geographies and growth in domestic shipping acted as tailwinds for the Global e-commerce business. Growth in the Software Solutions business was primarily driven by higher license revenue, mainly in Location Intelligence and Customer Information Management.Pitney Bowes Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pitney Bowes Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pitney Bowes Inc. QuoteLiquidity and Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2017, free cash flow was $108.9 million compared with $119.9 million as of Sep 30, 2016.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,697 million compared with $764.5 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2017, was $3,562.7 million, down from $2,750.4 million as of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceThe company tweaked guidance for full-year 2017. It expects earnings per share to lie in the range of $1.38-$1.46, compared with the earlier guided range of $1.70-$1.78. Revenues, on a reported basis, are expected to grow in the range of 3-5% year over year compared with the previous guidance of flat to 1% growth.Pitney Bowes believes that new products and digital capabilities of SMB, expansion of the Presort Services network and robust e-commerce volume growth will act as major catalysts, stoking top-line growth for full-year 2017. Moreover, the company’s focus on operational excellence will help it trim costs and expenses, consequently supplementing growth.Our TakePitney Bowes’ concerted efforts to transform business have started to show results as evident from growth across most business lines. The transformation initiatives and constant introduction of new products have also provided a boost to performance. This apart, the company’s prolonged effort to enhance and optimize new enterprise business platform also bode well for the company.Moreover, the company’s Global e-commerce business is proving to be one of the strongest profit churners, and is anticipated to boost top-line growth in the upcoming quarters as well. In less than five years, Global e-commerce has grown from $20 million business to a worth of over $400 million. The company also anticipates segment’s growth rate to accelerate going forward, in light of growth in overall retail volumes and customer wins.However, continued softness in the mailing business is likely to affect Pitney Bowes’ growth momentum for the quarter under review. Lower recurring supplies revenues are expected to adversely affect the mailing business in the upcoming quarter. Additionally, currency fluctuation remains a headwind.Pitney Bowes currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report), Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report).

770,ADI,"Synaptics Inc. (SYNA  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal third-quarter 2018 results on May 9.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.89%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.11 per share, down 25.5% from the year-ago quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenues of $430 million also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $433 million and declined 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.For fiscal third-quarter 2018, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $380-–$420 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors at Play    Synaptic is likely to benefit from its diversification strategy. In the last reported quarter, consumer IoT business, which accounted for nearly 25% of total revenues, was a breather.Notably, the acquisitions of Conexant Systems and Multimedia Solutions Business of Marvell Technology Group are helping it expand its customer base.In the IoT space, AudioSmart, ImagingSmart and VideoSmart are gaining wide scale adoption. New design wins in IoT are expected to provide further impetus.Synaptics’ focus on enhancing in-display fingerprint sensing, Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) and OLED DDIC portfolio will help it counter the growing headwinds. The company expects the introduction of chip-on-film to provide new growth opportunity.However, declining revenues from mobile and PC products continue to hurt. Significant weakness in the China smartphone market coupled with loss of share in Samsung Galaxy S9 devices is an overhang. The company anticipates a 3% sequential decline in mobile revenues in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Synaptics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Synaptics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Synaptics Incorporated QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

771,ADI,"Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 10.Notably, Symantec has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, matched it once and fell short of the same on one occasion. It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderSymantec’s continuous efforts to strengthen its product suite are likely to benefit its top line, given the surge in demand for cybersecurity-related products. Recently, the company announced that it is enhancing security for Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure and Office 365 products.Additionally, the company has been gaining from its acquisition initiatives, which are broadening its customer base and enhancing its capabilities in identity protection, a huge concern for almost every sector, be it financials, retail or technology. The buyouts have helped it reduce its dependency on the PC market and strengthen position in the enterprise security market.However, we remain slightly cautious about the company’s lower-than-expected revenues in the last reported quarter due to a faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition.” This might impact financials in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Symantec is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

778,ADI,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) reported modest third-quarter 2017 results, driven by robust sales growth particularly in China and in its Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses.

Increase of income from continuing operations drove the year-over-year improvement in operating income.Inside the HeadlinesTotal sales in the quarter came in at €4,148 million ($4,875 million), relatively flat (inching down 0.2%) from the year-ago tally. The year-over-year decline can primarily be attributed to fall in sales of Personal Health businesses and HealthTech Other segment, partially mitigated by impressive performances from Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses and Diagnosis & Treatment businesses.Philips’ adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) – the company’s preferred measure of operational performance – rose 12.2% year over year to €532 million ($625.1 million), benefiting from higher volumes, procurement savings as well as cost productivity.Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Koninklijke Philips N.V. QuoteMeanwhile, net cash provided by operating activities came in at €295 million ($346.6 million) compared with year-ago quarter figure €259 million. The company’s comparable order intake rose 5% year over year, driven by strong growth in Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses.Segmental RevenuesDuring the reported quarter, Personal Health sales fell 0.8% year over year to €1,650 million ($1,938.8 million). This segment reported a 1% decline in nominal sales and a 5% hike in comparable sales. The upside in comparable sales came on the back of high-single digit growth in Health & Wellness as well as Sleep & Respiratory Care, while Domestic Appliances recorded growth in mid-single-digit. On a geographic basis, double-digit growth in Middle East & Turkey and India, high-single digit growth in China, bolstered revenues in the quarter.Diagnosis & Treatment revenues rose 0.2% in the quarter to €1,638 million ($1,924.7 million). While nominal sales were flat, comparable sales grew 2% for the quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in Image-Guided Therapy and low-single-digit growth in Ultrasound and Diagnostic Imaging drove this segment’s sales. On a geographic basis, double-digit growth in China, Latin America and India acted as catalysts.Connected Care & Health Informatics revenues inched up 1.2% in the quarter to €751 million ($882.5 million). On a nominal basis, segmental revenues climbed 1% year over year and comparable sales grew 8% for the quarter. Sales improvement was primarily driven by double-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions as well as mid-single digit growth in Healthcare Informatics.On a geographic basis, while growth geographies witnessed mid-single-digit growth, mature geographies posted a low-single-digit decline. Double-digit growth in China, Middle East & Turkey and Latin acted as catalysts.Revenues in the HealthTech & Other segment continued to show weakness, shrinking 7.7% to €108 million ($127 million). The decline in this segment can mainly be attributed to higher restructuring charges incurred during the quarter.With effect from this quarter, Philips is reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations.Liquidity & Share RepurchaseExiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2017, Philips’ cash and cash equivalents rose to €999 million ($1,180.2 million) from €1,859 million a year back. The company’s long-term debt fell to €4,441 million ($5,246.2 million) compared with €4,860 million a year ago.Diligent Cost-Savings ProgramsPhilips has been gaining significantly from its DfX program, along with other productivity and savings programs. These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company, while accelerating growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution.Thanks to these initiatives, in the reported quarter, the company achieved procurement savings of €77 million, powered by the DfX program, while other productivity programs also resulted in a savings of €69 million. The company now is well on track to generate an impressive annual savings of €400 million.Notable Developments During the QuarterThe quarter was marked by a string of acquisitions which the company had identified over the past two years. Philips announced the acquisition of Health & Parenting to strengthen its offerings in pregnancy and parenting. Health & Parenting is a London-based developer of healthcare and family-related mobile applications for expectant and new parents.The company also inked an agreement to buy image-analysis software provider, TomTec Imaging Systems GmbH. This acquisition is likely to enhance the former’s image-guided therapy portfolio.Further, earlier this month, the company obtained the 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing its new eL18-4 transducer for ‘small parts’ assessment. The company is anticipated to launch the newest solution at the 16th World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (“WFUMB”) Congress in Taipei.Update on Lighting DealAt the end of the third-quarter 2017, Philips holds 41.27% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Philips Lighting shares. Philips aims to sale the business completely over the next few years.GuidanceBased on the present market scenario and accounting for the macroeconomic headwinds, Philips continues to project full-year sales growth of 4-6%. The company also anticipates its Adjusted EBITA margin to improve around 100 basis points this year.Our TakeIn the past couple of years, Philips has successfully evolved from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider. Moreover, the company's transformation from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business, with a higher-margin and recurring-revenue model, bodes well for investors. The company also believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will drive future growth.Further, the company is highly optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis & Treatment vertical on account of positive industry trends, with the Image-Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment segments acting as major profit churners. This apart, the company’s Connected Care & Health Informatics vertical is progressing well, and is experiencing strength in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions.Though, healthcare markets hold solid prospects in the long run, lackluster performance in key end markets, including the Western Europe and North America are thwarting the growth momentum of the Dutch multinational. Also, higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges are proving to be a drag on the company’s financials.Philips currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering in the same space include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report).

783,ADI,"SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 IFRS earnings per share of €0.82 (95 cents), reflecting a surge of 35% on a year-over-year basis. This improvement was primarily attributable to growth in the cloud subscriptions as well as software license order entry. The bottom line, however, misses the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share.Total IFRS revenues for the third quarter were €5,590 million ($6,497.3 million), up 4% year over year. Also, the figure marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,470 million. A flourishing cloud business along with strong growth of support revenues, aided the top-line growth during the third quarter.Also, new cloud bookings — a key indicator of sales success in cloud business — were significantly up 14% to €302 million ($351 million) in the reported quarter.Inside/Behind the HeadlinesCloud and Software business, which includes Cloud Subscriptions & Support and Software licenses & support, reported third-quarter revenues of €4,657 million ($5,412.8 million), up 4.5% year over year. IFRS Cloud Subscriptions & Support garnered revenues of €937 million ($1,089.1 million) in the quarter, up 21.8% year over year; while non-IFRS Cloud Subscriptions & Support garnered revenues of €938 million ($1,090.2 million) in the quarter.Software licenses & support reported revenues of €3,720 million ($4,323.8 million), up 0.9% on a year-over-year basis. Also, for third-quarter 2017, Services revenues inched up 1.3% year over year to €932 million ($1,083.3 million). Overall, IFRS Cloud and software revenues witnessed growth, mainly driven by strong IFRS Cloud Subscriptions and support revenue.The EMEA region observed double-digit software license revenues rise in majority of the end markets, including Germany, Russia and the Middle East & North Africa region. For the APJ region, SAP witnessed a strong performance in both cloud and software revenue plus cloud subscriptions, along with robust performances in Australia and China, acting as key catalysts.The company reported IFRS operating margin of 23.5%, up 300 basis points from the figure recorded in third-quarter 2016. Also, the company recorded a 19.1% rally in operating profit amounting to €1,314 million ($1,527.3 million).SAP SE Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SAP SE Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SAP SE QuoteQuarter in DetailSAP’s human capital management (‘‘HCM’’) applications continue to act as a key growth-driver with SuccessFactors Employee Central surpassing the 2,000-customer base at the end of the third quarter. In addition, SAP’s Customer Engagement and Commerce solutions once again achieved double-digit growth in new cloud bookings as well as software revenue.Additionally, consistent strong market traction of the SAP S/4HANA platform is proving to be a strong profit-churner. During the reported quarter, the company gained 600 additional customers with more than 40% being entirely new. This uptrend hugely drove the company’s revenues. With little competition in its core market, the software and service provider experienced strong results in the third quarter in the aforesaid segment.This apart, SAP’s business networks (which it manages through three main players namely, Ariba, Fieldglass and Concur) burgeoned 19% during the reported quarter. Currently, the Ariba network handles trading worth around $1 trillion of 3 million connected companies. This upside hugely drove the company’s revenues. While Concur manages travel and expenses of more than 50 million end users, Fieldglass helps managing 3.9 million flexible workers.Other Financial DetailsFor the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, the company’s operating cash flow came in at €4.1 billion ($4.8 billion), up 14% on a year-over-year basis. While free cash flow was €3.2 billion ($3.8 billion), up 7% compared with the year-ago tally.Guidance ImprovedFueled by continued strong momentum of the cloud business, SAP raised its view for full-year 2017 non-IFRS total revenue projection from €23.3-€23.7 billion to €23.4-€23.8 billion at constant currency (cc).The company believes the non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue to lie in the €3.8-€4.0 billion range at constant currencies. Also, non-IFRS cloud and software revenue outlook has been revised upward. It is expected to grow in the band of 7-8.5% instead of the previous 6.5-8.5% view at cc. Also, non-IFRS operating profit forecast for 2017 has been tweaked at the lower end of the earlier guided range. It is now estimated to be in the range of €6.85-€7 billion compared with the former €6.80-€7 billion band  at cc.Our TakeSAP’s resilient Cloud and Software business, an enviable business network spread and dominance over critical client demand areas continue to act as staple growth-drivers. The company’s S/4HANA has proved to be a solid profit-yielder, fueled by an increase in cloud subscriptions as well as support-revenue rise in recent times.Also, SAP’s new class of solutions that power the next generation of business applications — SAP HANA — has been its biggest top-line driver ever since its introduction. The company’s latest offering from the SAP HANA family, S/4HANA, has established itself as a mission critical control center for businesses pursuing digital transformation. This apart, the company constantly upgrades the existing products and launches new ones to expand its customer base, thereby offering a competitive edge over peers.However, dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters along with flat customer spending projections have affected the company’s performances. Also, over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances besides general economic slowdowns, which have adversely impacted the consumers’ purchasing power. Currency fluctuations in many of the company’s key markets are also hurting its financial performance.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSAP currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report), Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and Nutanix Inc. (NTNX  -  Free Report).

Management believes that total automotive SAM (serviceable available market) is worth almost $6 billion and growing dollar content is beneficial for the company. We also note that the company has a strong clientele in the automotive market, which includes Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH  -  Free Report), Mitsubishi, Magna and others.MPS is now focused on expanding beyond infotainment applications into body electronics, LED lighting applications and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). These are the key catalysts in the long term.Moreover, we believe MPS is well positioned to benefit from the launch of Intel Corporation’s (INTC  -  Free Report) Purley server platform. The shift from Intel’s Grantley to Purley boosts MPS’ dollar content. Management stated that dollar content for 2 CPU servers has increased from $35 (in Grantley) to $49 (in Parley). For 4 CPU configurations, this further improves from $53 to $85.Management expects that the recently initiated conversion cycle (Grantley to Purley) and the higher dollar content will definitely boost top-line growth.We believe the strong growth prospects at the Automotive and benefits from the Purley conversion will help MPS to achieve revenue growth target of 20% per year with expanding margins.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has remained steady at $2.88 over the last 30 days.

785,ADI,"Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) second-quarter fiscal 2018 results are scheduled to be released on May 1.The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety over lackluster sales of the premium iPhone X, leading to decline in sales estimates. Lack of demand compelled Apple to lower shipment target.iPhone in the SpotlightiPhone, since its launch in 2007, has been the mainstay of the tech giant’s revenues. In the first quarter, iPhone revenues increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $61.58 billion.However, lower-than-expected sales of iPhone X have prompted analysts to slash sales estimates for the product. Goldman Sachs, in its Mar 27 note, announced trimming of iPhone sales expectations by a whopping 1.7 million units to 53 million for the March quarter. Jun Zhang of Rosenblatt Securities lowered his estimate for total iPhone shipments in the March quarter by 2 million units to 50 million units.Nonetheless, Apple’s focus on “aggressive pricing” that resulted in a higher average selling price (ASP) from premium models — iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus — is likely to boost the top line, despite lower shipments. This is evident from the fact that expected growth of revenues from iPhone is way higher than growth of its shipments for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Notably, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total iPhone units sold is pegged at 52.94 million, up almost 4% from the actual figure reported in second-quarter 2017.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iPhone and related products and services is $39.2 billion, up 18% from the actual figure in the year-ago quarter.However, the expensive price tag might prove an impediment in countries like China, which remains an important market for Apple, given the growing number of middle-class customers. Also, intensifying competition from regional players, who are offering feature-rich smartphones at a much cheaper price, remains a major headwind.iPad and Mac Losing SteamApple’s iPad business has been sluggish for quite some time. However, with the launch of a low cost iPad in the second quarter of 2017, the company witnessed an uptick in iPad sales.Apple sold 13.2 million iPads in the first quarter, up 1% year over year, while revenues of $5.7 billion increased 6%.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iPad business is pegged at roughly $3.98 billion, up 2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total iPad units sold is around 9 million, up 1% year over year.However, Mac sales don’t hold promise. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Mac is pegged at $5.71 billion, down 2.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total Mac units sold is 4.2 million, down 1% year over year.Will Diversification Yield Results?Apple’s focus on developing innovative products in order to generate new revenue streams is a key growth driver. Fast growing Services and wearables (mainly Watch) segments are emerging as big growth catalysts.Notably, Apple’s Other Product segment, which includes Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats headphones, iPod touch and other accessories witnessed a 36% increase year over year in the last reported quarter, the highest among all its segments. In fact, the segment recorded a new all-time high with revenues of more than $5 billion for the first time in a quarter.Apple’s Services segment, which includes revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, continues to grow rapidly. At the end of the first quarter, the Services segment had more than 240 million subscribers. Revenues surged 18% year over year to nearly $8.5 billion.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iTunes, Software and Services is $8.33 billion, up 18.3% year over year.Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Apple Inc. QuoteA Look at the Earnings TrendApple beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 5.72%.The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of $3.89 per share and revenues of $88.29 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.82 and $86.29 billion, respectively.   For second-quarter fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $61.1 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of almost 15.5%.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings declined by a penny to $2.69 over the last seven days.What Does Our Model SayAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

During the last reported quarter, management was particularly optimistic about the operations of its sales force, with senior sales people outperforming expectations. Pertaining to the stellar performance of the sales team, the company opened its 47th sales office in Rochester, NY during the first quarter.Following the company’s shift to ASC 606, effective Jan 1, 2018, margins are expected to improve significantly. This is because, per the new standard, the commission expense will be recognized ratably over the period till the contract is valid and not upfront.Notably, Paycom also announced an increase in its stock repurchase plan. It added $100 million to the ongoing share repurchase program, which has been extended till Feb 12, 2020. This also indicates a strong balance sheet.

In the last reported quarter, the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up this time.Factors to ConsiderNCR’s growing exposure in the self-service kiosk space is encouraging.

The figure surged 31.8% from the year-ago quarter but declined 19.4% sequentially.Strong earnings growth was driven by better-than-expected top-line performance, operating margin expansion and lower effective tax-rate.Revenues totaled $16.07 billion, up 8.6% year over year but down 5.8% quarter over quarter.

789,ADI,"The technology sector has lately been spooked by a spate of negative news from some of its key companies. Among the worst hit were FANG stocks as Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) data scandal raised concerns over stringent regulations for the social media space, and a series of allegations from Donald Trump via Twitter on its business practices spurred Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) sell-off.The attack from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM  -  Free Report) and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) added to the latest chaos. Taiwan Semiconductor warned of waning mobile demand for the second quarter and thus reduced its sales growth target for this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year.Notably, TSM is Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) biggest supplier and the negative news has taken a toll on shares of the technology giant. Apple shed $60 billion in two days following the news. Several global chipmakers also lost market value, including Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Qorvo (QRVO  -  Free Report).While a number of these headwinds have spread negative sentiments in the space, the rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology and solid corporate earnings are expected to fuel growth. In particular, Q1 earnings from 29.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are up 36.3% on 13.7% higher revenues, with 100% of the companies beating on earnings and 85.7% exceeding top-line estimates. Overall, earnings and revenues for Q1 are expected to grow 22.6% and 11.9%, respectively.Given the optimism, a number of stocks in the sector have seen their Rank surging to the top-most rung in a couple of days. These are also backed by strong fundamentals compared to many others. Any of these could be a compelling choice to beat the ongoing tech turmoil and make for great picks this earnings season.

791,ADI,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently revised its proposed deal to takeover NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report) in order to get regulatory nod from the European Commission (EC), which is a major part of the European Union. Notably, Qualcomm’s proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors is facing a few problems.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017, subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.In June 2017, the EC had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in depth to see if the deal will lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. The EC has time till Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision. The EC has already halted its review twice -- once in June and again in August. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.On October 5, 2017, the U.S. mobile chipset giant submitted its new proposal to the EC. According to Reuters, “Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data”.Importantly, in September 2017, Qualcomm extended the offering period of its previously announced cash tender offer of purchasing all the outstanding common shares of NXP. The tender offer will now expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Oct. 20, 2017.Meanwhile, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August 2017, Elliot Management disclosed that it had accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP’s outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March 2017 to 3.2% in September. Notably, at least 70% of NXP’s total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for the deal to go through. Hence, the deal looks quite unlikely unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Moreover, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the closure of the transaction.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Moreover, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company’s business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm in diversifying into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have decreased 4.15% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.25% in the last three months.

793,ADI,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI recently announced a hike in dividend along with a share repurchase program. This time, the company plans to raise the quarterly dividend by 12 cents to 62 cents per share. This translates into a 24% increase from the prior dividend of 50 cents. The new dividend will be paid on Nov 13, 2017, to stockholders of record as of Oct 31, contingent upon a formal declaration by the board of directors at its regular meeting in October.    Moreover, Texas Instruments approved a share repurchase program worth $6.0 billion, in addition to approximately $4.8 billion already available. TI’s Cash position TI’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility for further dividend, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions.  Cash and cash equivalents were $3.0 billion at the end of second-quarter 2017. TI exited the quarter with $3.1 billion in long-term debt and $499 million in short-term debt.  Also, the company generated $917 million in cash from operations, spending $151 million on capex, $650 million on share repurchases and $498 million on cash dividends. Texas Instruments is one of the few chip making companies that returns a significant amount of cash to its investors. Over the trailing 12 months, the company returned $4.1 billion of cash through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Bottom Line Texas Instruments is one of the largest suppliers of analog and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company’s compelling product line-up, increasing differentiation in its business and low-cost 300-mm capacity should drive earnings over the long term.  Also, the company’s margins should continue to expand because of the secular strength in the auto and industrial markets, a stronger mix of analog and embedded processing products, benefits of restructuring actions and more 300mm capacity coming online. Moreover, the semiconductor giant is poised to gain from the growing market for Internet of Things.  We believe the increase in dividend and share buyback indicates that the company is confident about its steady cash flows. However, increasing competition from Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) remains a concern.      Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider.

In August 2017, Elliot Management disclosed that it had accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP’s outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March 2017 to just 3.2% in September. Notably, at least 70% of NXP’s total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for the deal to go through. Hence, the deal looks quite unlikely unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.Meanwhile, in June 2017, the telecom regulatory body of the European Union, the European Commission (EC), launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in depth to see if the deal will lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry.The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. The EC has a time limit of 90 working days, till Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Further, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Moreover, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company’s business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm in diversifying into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

795,ADI,"Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI recently took the wraps off a buck converter, which it claims to be the industry’s first 16-V input, 40-A synchronous DC/DC buck converter.Known as TPS543C20 SWIFT, it features an internally compensated advanced-current-mode (ACM) control topology that supports frequency synchronization. The converter offers improved efficiency by integrating low resistance high- and low-side MOSFETs into small-footprint package that is thermally efficient.Two converters can be stacked side by side for handling loads up to 80 A for processors in power dense and space constrained applications.How is TI Poised?The new buck converter finds use in several markets such as communications, cloud computing and enterprise and thus should strengthen the company’s presence in these markets.As the company continues to leverage on its expertise in analog and embedded products and systems to launch compelling products for different markets, we believe the move is intended to boost TI’s Analog segment revenues.In the last reported quarter, the segment was up 6.9% sequentially and 18% from the year-ago quarter. It generated 65% of quarterly revenues. (Read more: Texas Instruments Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenue Estimates)Wrapping UpThe move highlights Texas Instruments’ R&D investments in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.The company has been integrating different functionalities into single devices, encouraging customers to go for the simpler, more power efficient and smaller form factor products that could potentially lower the cost of ownership and could be used in the smallest of applications. For TI, this increases the dollar content per device, helping share gains and margin expansion. It also helps to fend off tough competition from the likes of Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

797,ADI,"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) were down more than 4% through early afternoon trading hours Tuesday after the chipmaker lost its legal bid to postpone changes to its cellular patent licensing process in South Korea.The semiconductor manufacturing giant confirmed on Monday night that the Seoul High Court had denied its application to put a stay on a remedial order by the Korea Fair Trade Commission over the way it licenses cellular patents.Qualcomm was seeking to delay the Fair Trade Commission’s order while the company appeals the regulator body’s findings in court. Nevertheless, South Korea denied the request and ruled that Qualcomm’s business would not suffer irreparable harm if the order took effect during the appeals process.Qualcomm shares dropped about 4% to $50.08 by early afternoon. However, at least one analyst argued that the ruling wouldn’t really have a major effect on the company’s results.“While this is interesting, we do not believe it affects QCOM treatment in other countries,” said JPMorgan’s Rod Hall in a note. “We also point out that the smartphone volumes in Korea are tiny relative to global volume and have little impact on Qualcomm’s licensing revenue stream.”Indeed, Qualcomm’s slump appears to be coming on a weak day throughout the semiconductor industry. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor Sector ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) was down more than 1.5%, while major chipmakers like AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) were down more than 3%.Other industry giants, including Micron Technology (MU), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), also fell on Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down over 1.3% through Tuesday afternoon trading.Tech’s rough day was mirrored by nearly all major sectors, as several major international stories, as well as the onset of the market’s historic worst month, helped drag stocks down on Tuesday (also read: Stocks Dip To Start September, The Market's Traditional Worst Month).Want more stock market analysis from this author?

808,ADI,"ON Semiconductor (ON  -  Free Report) recently unveiled its first CMOS image sensors, namely AR0522 and AR0431, which leverage its Near Infra Red+ (“NIR+”) technology. With a view to ensure an effective low light performance, the NIR+ technology complements High Dynamic Range (“HDR”) imaging capability. This makes the high resolution sensors an ideal choice for surveillance and high-end security cameras as it enhances low light vision.Product InformationAR0522 and AR0431 are based on 2.2μm and 2.0μm Back Side Illuminated (“BSI”) pixel technology platform, respectively. While AR0522 features a 1/2.5-inch 5.1 MP image sensor, AR0431 has a 1/3.2-inch 4 MP image sensor.Notably, AR0522’s sensitivity performance boasts 2 times when compared with the company’s existing AR0521 considering the near Infra-Red wavelength.Frame rate of up to 120 frames per second (fps) and various low power modes enable AR0431 to capture a bright and sharp slow motion video despite poor light conditions. The low powered sensor can find application in security cameras which are battery-operated, in-car DVRs and action/sports cameras.Currently, AR0522 samples are available, while AR0431samples will be made available by later half of April, this year. Mass production is anticipated to kick off from May and July, this year, for AR0522 and AR0431, respectively.What the Investors Need to Know?Shares of On Semi have outperformed the industry’s rally of 16.3% in the past year by returning 61.3%.

The market valuation in 2014 was $8.8 billion.Furthermore, per a Technavio report, as revealed by The Economic Times, the global autonomous vehicle sensors market, where company’s AR0431 finds ample application, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 115% by 2021 to reach 196.07 million units.The aforementioned reports strengthen the prospects of investment opportunities in night vision/ low light imaging sensors. We believe the product launch will bode well for the company’s top-line.ON Semi has been making efforts to ensure its sensors deliver high quality images and videos in the NIR region while maintaining color accuracy of visible spectrum. Quantum Efficiency (“QE”) technique of the company renders the practice of using more IR LEDs in security cameras redundant, consequently simplifying the security management system.To ConcludeON Semi has traditionally been known as a power management and commodity chip maker but the company has started to carve out a budding Internet of Things (IoT) division. The company is now heavily involved with automotive solutions, and its IoT offerings also include products catering to wearables, smart city development, and industrial automation.However, despite stellar last quarter results, investors remain disappointed by the company’s guidance.

Earnings of $1.45 per share went up 15.1% sequentially and 38.1% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues also increased 7.5% sequentially and 53.6% year over year to $1.54 billion.

Non-GAAP earnings are expected between $1.20 and $1.36 per share.The first-quarter that ended on Jan 31, 2018 was a 14-week quarter.

However, revenues were expected to increase on a year-over-year basis due to strength in the industrial end-market.   Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Analog Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Analog Devices, Inc. QuoteStrong End Markets, Portfolio: Key CatalystsWe expect strength across all the four end-markets — Industrial, Consumer, Communications and Automotive — to drive the soon-to-be reported quarter results. Moreover, ongoing investments are likely to strengthen product portfolio as well as competitive position, which will boost the top line.We believe that top-line growth is likely to be driven by Analog Devices’ diversified product portfolio and expanding customer base. Moreover, higher contribution from Linear Technology acquisition remains a tailwind.Further, Analog Devices is likely to benefit from increasing demand for autonomous driving solutions. Additionally, continuing demand for high value signal processing & power management applications, software-defined radio solutions and portable applications are anticipated to drive the top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Industrial, Automotive, Communication and Consumer segment revenues are currently pegged at $704 million, $231 million, $272 million and $234 million, respectively.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

815,ADI,"Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 26. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this cybersecurity company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.5%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 79 cents, representing year-over-year growth of 25.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $524.4 million, up 24.3% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s take a look at the driving factors this quarter. Factors to ConsiderPalo Alto is growing rapidly in the cybersecurity space on the back of its innovative next-generation security platforms. The company’s security platforms have innovative traffic classification engine which helps it identify network traffic by application, user and content. As a result, organizations have in-depth visibility into all traffic and applications, helping the firms control usage, content, risks and cyber threats at the user level.Therefore, Palo Alto’s security platforms simplify security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone security appliances and software products. This reduces the total cost of ownership, in turn, giving a competitive edge to the organization.Furthermore, over the last two years, the company has launched several subscription-based products, including WildFire, AutoFocus, Aperture, Traps and Virtual, which have been witnessing strong adoption among organizations.The company’s innovative product portfolio and continued efforts to enhance the same with advanced features helps Palo Alto win new deals. Notably, during first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company added more than 2,500 customers, bringing the total to more than 45,000 worldwide. It should be noted that in each of the last 23 quarters, Palo Alto has added at least 1,000 customers.The company’s to-be-reported quarterly result is likely to add a sizable number of new customers, which, in turn, will drive Palo Alto’s top line.Furthermore, acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of Palo Alto to enhance its product portfolio as well as expand the company’s global reach. Last year, the company acquired LightCyber for $105 million, which expanded its Next-Generation Security Platform. Over the past few years, the company has completed three important buyouts — Morta Security, Cyvera and CirroSecure.Analysts covering the stock believe the diversity of its products and increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will attract customers. This will again bolster its top line, the benefit of which will trickle down to the bottom line.Additionally, the company is keen on expanding its cloud exposure through partnerships. It has existing cloud partnerships with companies like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services and Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Cloud. In August 2017, the company expanded ties with VMware, Inc. Through the new collaboration, Palo Alto will combine its security platform with VMware’s software platform, which provides private cloud-based service to make the cloud-computing environment more secure, simple, flexible, and efficient.This deal will better equip organizations to handle private cloud technology and control business applications securely. As VMware remains one of the leading companies in the virtualization and cloud computing space, Palo Alto is likely to gain significantly from this alliance and we might witness a glimpse of the same in the quarter under review.Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Palo Alto Networks, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that Palo Alto Networks is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chance of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

816,ADI,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 22. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this IT solution-providing company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last two quarters. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe acquisition of EMC Corporation (stylized as EMC) by Dell has been posing new challenges for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. With this acquisition, Dell has become one of the major players in the cloud services and data-storage market. EMC offers data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing, and other products and services that enable businesses to store, manage, protect, and analyze data.Additionally, VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) was EMC’s subsidiary that focuses on cloud and virtualization software and services for its parent company. Therefore, the acquisition of EMC, along with its privately-controlled structure, will provide Dell an unmatched scale, strength and flexibility to deepen its relationships with customers of all sizes.Apart from this, it also seems that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is losing market share to Dell in the server shipment. Notably, according to IDC, during third-quarter 2017, Dell managed to drastically narrow down the server shipment market-share difference with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, chiefly benefiting from “the strong synergy between its server team and the storage team incorporated from the EMC acquisition”.This happened mainly because Hewlett Packard Enterprise is now focusing on enterprise market and “pivoting away” from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which has been denting its short-term revenues. We believe this strategy will hurt Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.Since its split from HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been focusing on restructuring and realigning the company’s businesses to drive long-term sustainable growth and improvise margins. In doing so, the company has spun-off its Software and Enterprise Services business. The spin-offs will surely result in an unfavorable year-over-year comparison, which means disappointing top- as well bottom-line results for the fiscal first quarter.Moreover, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, in its previous earnings conference calls, had hinted that the company might continue to shrink with spin-offs. However, in our opinion, the company’s contrarian strategy might be in the right direction but the turnaround is still far behind as we haven’t seen any significant improvement in the recently-reported financial results. We also consider that the company is still struggling to determine its true business focus.Also, we consider that the company’s to-be-reported quarterly results will bear the brunt of the three main challenges it is currently facing — competitive pricing, heightened commodities pricing pressure and some dilution from M&A. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Hewlett Packard Enterprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 23 cents, representing a year-over-year plunge of 48.9%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $7.03 billion, down a massive 38.4% from the year-ago quarter.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteA Stock With Favorable CombinationHere is a company which, as per our model, has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc.

817,ADI,"Castlight Health, Inc. (CSLT  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 21.Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate is the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 40.54%. Last quarter, the company came up with a positive surprise of 28.57%.Loss of 5 cents per share was in line with the year-ago quarter figure. Revenues increased 35.6% year over year to $34.6 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34 million. Castlight stated that increasing rate of adoption, broadening product portfolio and operating efficiencies were the key catalysts.Factors to ConsiderCastlight’s software platform that assists organizations in gaining control over their health care costs is witnessing rapid adoption. This was evident from the top-line growth. Moreover, Castlight expects renewals to boost its annualized recurring revenues (“ARR”).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Professional Services segment revenues is around $3.2 million while that for Subscription revenues is about $33.1 million. Castlight Health, inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Castlight Health, inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Castlight Health, inc. Quote The company’s strategic acquisition of Jiff has strengthened its product portfolio. Cross-selling of products is also expanding customer base.Moreover, partnerships with the likes of Livongo, Big Health, Hinge Health, Retrofit and Kurbo are likely to help the company rapidly penetrate a number of health markets. Additionally, integration of Castlight's comprehensive health navigation platform with Washington Health Alliance will expand customer base.We believe all these factors to be key catalysts for the company’s fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are $36 million and negative 4 cents per share, respectively.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

818,ADI,"ANSYS Inc (ANSS  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 21.Notably, the company has a positive record of earnings beats in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 6.27%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.25%.Non-GAAP earnings of $1.05 per share increased 10.5% year over year. Moreover, revenues increased 12.6% (12% in constant currency) from the year-ago quarter to $276.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $264 million.For fourth-quarter 2017, ANSYS expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of 99 cents to $1.05 per share. Net revenues are anticipated in the range of $284-$293 million. The company expects gross margin of 90% and operating margin between 44% and 45%.ANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise ANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ANSYS, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings shows an increase of 6.1% year over year to $1.04 per share for the soon-to-be reported quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $290.5 million, up 7.3% year over year.Notably, the stock has returned 8.5% in the last three months, better than the 6.5% rally of the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Portfolio Strength to Drive GrowthANSYS is a dominant player in the high-end design simulation software market. Robust adoption of the company’s products, portfolio strength, and expanding partner base are key catalysts.ANSYS’ strong simulation portfolio is helping it to rapidly grow total addressable market (“TAM”). The solutions are in demand owing to the rising complexity in product design and wide scale adoption by major manufacturing companies.Moreover, collaborations with major CAD vendors — Autodesk, PTC and Siemens as well as companies like NVIDIA, Ferrari, Taiwan Semiconductor, Synopsys and Grundfos are expanding product portfolio. These have helped the company offer varied range of products ranging from automotive reliability solutions, live simulation software, and high performance steering wheels.Moreover, these partnerships have strengthened the company’s competitive position in the simulations market.Declining Perpetual License to HurtANSYS expects the transition from perpetual license contracts to longer term, time-based licenses at some of the company’s largest customers (in mature markets like the United States and Japan) to affect software license and maintenance revenues growth in the near term.Further, ANSYS expects to incur additional charges of $2 million ($1.3 million, net of tax), primarily in the quarter, related to additional realignment charges. This is likely to drag profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total perpetual revenues is currently pegged at $73 million, which is expected to decline 6.4% on a year-over-year basis.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

820,ADI,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017) results, after the closing bell on Jan 31.The company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters. Earnings met the consensus estimate in the remaining two, resulting in an average beat of 6.31%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayQualcomm operates in a highly competitive global mobile semiconductor market with incumbents like Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report). Stiff competition in the wireless baseband chipset market has forced the largest mobile chipset manufacturer in diversifying into the lucrative IoT market.In August 2017, Qualcomm announced the acquisition of Scyfer B.V., a company affiliated with the University of Amsterdam and which focuses on cutting-edge machine learning techniques. It specializes in building Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions for companies worldwide and in a number of different industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare and finance. The acquisition of Scyfer will aid Qualcomm to advance its AI research and development.In July 2017, the company made available the Qualcomm Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine software development kit for developers from multiple industries—mobile, automotive, healthcare, security and imaging—to acquire tools for delivering on-device neural network-driven user experiences. With such booming prospects and strategic ideas, Qualcomm visualizes a world where AI would make devices, machines, automobiles and make things more intelligent, simplifying and enriching people’s daily lives.2017 has been a mixed year for Qualcomm. The company has been trying to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with, multiple technological achievements and launches. Management has taken significant steps to reduce cost by $1 billion per annum.Buoyed by such tailwinds, Qualcomm’s shares have gained 26.42%, outpacing the industry’s growth of 16.05% over the past three months.  On the other hand, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market may hurt Qualcomm’s profits in the future. The company is facing severe competitive threat from its closest rival, Intel, which has been redesigning its chipsets for the mobile computing market. Intel started delivering multi-mode LTE baseband modem. Competition is also likely to emanate from formidable rivals like Broadcom and Nvidia.Broadcom already introduced its LTE baseband chipset in the market, while Nvidia launched Tegra 4i, its LTE-integrated application processor. Also, opposition from low-cost chip suppliers like Mediatek of Taiwan, VIA Technologies of China and Spreadtrum Communications is a concern. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum in the next 4–5 years, major part of this growth is likely to come from the low-cost emerging markets, which may exert pressure on Qualcomm’s margins.The $1-billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments, filed by tech giant Apple Inc. (in January 2017) against Qualcomm with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, is getting uglier day by day. Since January 2017, there had been a number of counter attacks from either side. Initially, Apple had accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.Meanwhile, Apple has garnered the support of Silicon Valley biggies and its suppliers in its nasty legal spat with Qualcomm. Apple’s suppliers have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, accusing Qualcomm of “violating” the U.S Antitrust Law. They have claimed that Qualcomm continues to extract additional licensing money over assembling of iPhones. With so many twists and turns, we remain eager to see how this dispute actually pans out in the coming days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Qualcomm is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Qualcomm has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 90 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company has not witnessed any estimate revisions.QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | QUALCOMM Incorporated Quote Key PickAnalog Devices has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat.

Modem revenues surged 37% on a year-over-year basis.However, intense competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) based on an expanding product portfolio is a concern.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the CCG segment is currently pegged at $8.745 billion.DCG — Purley Upgrade to Drive GrowthData Center Group (30.2% of revenues) — Revenues increased 7.4% year over year and 11.6% sequentially to $4.88 billion.The company shipped Xeon Scalable (formerly known as Skylake) to more than 200 original equipment manufacturer (OEM) systems in the quarter.The company recently announced Intel Stratix, the industry’s first field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated with high bandwidth memory to accelerate workloads and keep pace with data explosion.The newly added product will expand the onboard memory pool and add more bandwidth.

822,ADI,"TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 24.TE Connectivity has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 9.7% in the trailing four quarters. The company recorded its eight consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, surpassing estimates by 7.8%. In the quarter to be reported, the company is expected to report strong revenues in Transportation Solutions business, which constitutes more than half of its total revenues.We expect TE Connectivity to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that TE Connectivity has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: TE Connectivity has an Earnings ESP of +0.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | TE Connectivity Ltd. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsTE Connectivity is now poised to grow on the back of strong demand in end markets, along with its overarching business model and continued progress on strategic priorities. The company’s Commercial transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress, driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in China. Growth in electronic content and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for its transportation business. Additionally, the sensor business is anticipated to see strong design win momentum, fueled by the growth of automotive space, which is likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Transportation Solutions segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $1,867 million compared with fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $1,844 million. However, revenues from Industrial Solutions segment are anticipated to be low sequentially, with an estimate of $869 million compared with reported revenues of $954 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, being a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, the company is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength. About 80% of the company’s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. Over the past five years, its harsh business applications have experienced mid-single digit growth, driving top-line growth. Going forward, we believe that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion.This apart, the company’s ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to be conducive to core business, going forward. The company’s buyout of MicroGroup and agreement to acquire Hirschmann Car Communication enhanced its harsh environment portfolio and are expected to drive first-quarter fiscal sales as well.However, primarily dependent on end market dynamics the company’s business is subject to cyclical risks that the end markets suffer. Though the company has witnessed some stability in direct business with OEMs, poor sales through distribution channels are taking longer-than-expected recovery time, consequently hurting segmental performance. Additionally, the company’s weakness in commercial transportation market due to weak global construction and agriculture markets, along with weakness in the North America heavy truck markets, have been adding to woesFurther, sluggishness in oil and gas markets and its derivative impact on other industrial markets will likely act as strong headwinds for the company. Also, helicopter demand has also been impacted adversely, which can prove to be a drag on the company’s aerospace business. This apart, the company believes the supply chain inefficiencies can prove to be a drag on the earnings in the quarter under review.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc.
