27,WEC,"Five exchange traded funds in utilities stocks made new highs last week or are near new highs, as the sector emerges as a tempting alternative during the stock market's slump.With some of these ETFs in buy areas on their charts, investors have opportunities to invest in one of the few areas showing solid price action.Utility stocks weakened in April, as bond yields spiked. That was an unwelcome development for utilities because higher rates increase capital costs for an industry that constantly has to spend on plants and equipment. Also, higher bond yields can make utilities' dividends less attractive by comparison.But as Treasury yields started falling, utility ETFs reacted with gains in the past two weeks.The profit outlook for utilities is relatively favorable. The sector's combined profit is expected to drop 2% for the first quarter but rise about 4% for the full year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. By both measures, earnings will be well above the S&P's total but below better-performing sectors such as consumer discretionary and health care.The sector's most popular ETF is Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), which trades an average of more than 17 million shares a day. It has climbed back above its 50-day moving average and is near a new high. IShares U.S. Utilities (IDU) has traced a similar chart.Thinly traded PowerShares DWA Utilities Momentum (PUI) broke out of a flat base Wednesday and is in buy range from a 25.63 entry. The fund, which is diversified among various types of utility companies, is based on an index that emphasizes utility stocks showing relative strength, which helps explain its move to new highs.Some of DWA Utilities' top components hit new highs in the past week, including DTE Energy (DTE), WEC Energy (WEC) and American Water Works (AWK). Also, Westar Energy (WR) made a new closing high.Vanguard Utilities (VPU) touched a new high Thursday after finding support around the 50-day moving average. Investors can use that support to purchase shares. But ideally, investors would use the March breakout past a 102.68 buy point to buy the bulk of shares and use the pullback to add a smaller amount.Vanguard Utilities and Fidelity MSCI Utilities (FUTY) are both based on the same index: The MSCI U.S. Investable Market Utilities 25/50 Index.The index is more heavily weighted on Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE) and Southern Co. (SO), with each representing 6% to 7% of the total fund. In fact, Utilities Select Sector SPDR and iShares U.S. Utilities (based on the Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Index) also have the same companies as top components. NextEra broke out Wednesday but is back below the 119.47 buy point.                   The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

31,WEC,"It’s a simple fact of life: Larger conveyances offer smoother rides, be they cars, horses, ships, motorcycles or aircraft.The same tends to hold true for stocks. Hefty market capitalizations, big floats and deep-pocketed shareholders tend to provide shock absorbers for a stock during tumultuous markets.This is one of the driving reasons for IBD’s Big Cap 20 list.The feature appears every Tuesday in IBD and can be found daily under Investors.com’s Stock Lists menu.Stocks on the list must have market capitalizations of at least $15 billion. They must also pass muster with regard to EPS and Relative Strength ratings, the Sales + Margins + Return On Equity Rating, and other factors related to their chart status and balance sheet.Most Big Cap 20 names are ""low beta"" stocks. This means they tend to swing less than the S&P 500 on a day-to-day basis. At the top of the current Big Cap 20 list (see Feb. 23 edition), the IBD Stock Quote for Verizon (VZ) shows a Beta of 0.73. That marks it 27% less volatile than the overall market.In short, Verizon is not likely to become a hyperactive growth stock. But it still may produce solid gains during periods when the market struggles, and it is less likely to shake shareholders out with volatile action. Take this year, for instance: When the S&P 500 ended Wednesday down 4.6% for the year, Verizon showed a 9.9% gain.Here's one added perk: Many Big Cap 20 stocks also offer dividends. In Verizon’s case, the current dividend yields an annualized 4.5%.Not all Big Cap 20 stocks have low betas. No. 2 on the current list, Nvidia (NVDA), shows a beta of 1.19. It's definitely more volatile.But further down the list you’ll find AT&T (T) with a beta of 0.67, Tyson Foods (TSN) with a 0.66 beta and WEC Energy Group (WEC) with a beta of 0.56. These three big-cap stocks are up 8%, 23% and 10%, respectively, and offer dividend yields of 5.1%, 0.9% and 3.1% this year.And that’s just a quick scan through the first eight stocks on the list.Remember, you don’t just jump into any stock on the list. As with any leading stock, big-cap leaders must be passing valid buy points in strong volume, and the market must be in an uptrend. Be more cautious if you see IBD's Big Picture column noting that the uptrend is under pressure.
"
32,WEC,"Oil's decline and China's woes have pushed the equities market into a deep freeze.Hardly a day passes without negative stock market news that adds ice to the market chill. The S&P 500 is down nearly 8% so far this year. Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index -- a widely followed cross-section of the U.S. investment grade bond market -- is up about 1.6%.Investors fear for the health of their investment strategies in general and their retirement planning in particular.But stock investors should take heart in history. Stocks rarely lag bonds for a full calendar year.In the 25 years since 1990, stocks in the form of the S&P 500 have outperformed the Barclays Agg, as it's often referred to, in 19 calendar years prior to 2016.In those 25 year plus the beginning of this year through Feb. 1, the S&P 500 has enjoyed a 9.56% average annual gain vs. only 6.18% for the Barclays Agg, according to T. Rowe Price.If you had invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 on Dec. 31, 1990, by Feb. 2 it would have ballooned into nearly $100,000. In the Barclays Agg it would have grown less than half as much, to less than $45,000.Still, when stocks lagged during that quarter century, they tended to underperform for more than a year at a time.They lagged the Barclays Agg in the years 2000 through 2002, then again in 2007 and 2008. The also underperformed in the single calendar year of 2011.Yet even this year, while the S&P 500 is trailing the Barclays Agg, some stocks in the index are outperforming. Several are decent -- not dramatic -- dividend yielders.Newmont Mining (NEM) is up 40% for the year. Gold is serving its traditional role as a safe haven from equities while stocks are down.Newmont has a robust 89 Composite Rating from IBD. It also pays a 0.4% dividend yield. Earnings per share grew 109% and 30% for two quarters before declining 54% in the third quarter.The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Telecom giant AT&T (T), which sports a 99 Comp Rating, is up 7% this year. Its dividend yield is 5.2%.EPS grew 11%, 14% and 25% the past three stanzas.WEC Energy Group (WEC), a utility, is up nearly 11% this year. The stock, which has a 99 Comp Rating, has a dividend yield of 3.2%.EPS grew 0%, 7% and 12% the past three quarters.AT&T and WEC are members of IBD's Big Cap 20.Image provided by Shutterstock.

All started climbing back…
"
35,WEC,"It was another bad day in the stock market Monday, but a few hearty stocks held up. Utility stocks continue to lead the market.Utility stocks are defensive in nature. Many mutual funds and hedge funds turn to them in hard times on the theory they will decline less than other stocks. Also, a healthy dividend could soften blows to stock price.The two big telcos, Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) were holding up with only minor declines in Monday's selling. Right now, Verizon is talking up its plans for a faster 5G network.AT&T was still near a 36.55 buy point of saucer base. But individual investors would do well to think twice during a correction. A money manager might be required to hold stocks or be fully invested. An individual has a big advantage. He or she can ride out a bear market in the safety of cash, and ready to jump in once a new bull market.Once a new uptrend begins, utilities usually underperform.Verizon is in a similar position. A cheery earnings report Jan. 21 kicked off a rally that has brought the stock near a 50.96 buy point from long consolidation.Of the two, Verizon has shown the better growth with a five-year annualized growth rate of 15%. But AT&T has put up decent numbers the past few quarters. Verizon has a 4.4% annualized yield, but AT&T has 5.2%.WEC Energy (WEC) remained above a 53.98 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, and its outperformance over the past few weeks has caused its relative strength line to go nearly vertical, a bullish sign.WEC provides electricity to customers in Wisconsin and Michigan. The stock briefly made a marginal new high Monday, but a falling market pushed it lower.It pays an annualized yield of 3.2%. Its relative strength line is also bolting sharply higher.Southern Co. (SO) is forming the right side of a new base and might now be forming a handle. The company provides electricity states in the South and Southeast. Its annualized yield is 4.5%, although its five-year annualized growth rate is just 4%, south of some of the faster growing utilities.NextEra Energy (NEE) operates in two units. Florida Power & Light provides electricity in Florida, where it's one of the nation's largest regulated electric utilities. NextEra Energy Resources produces wholesale electricity from clean sources, such as natural gas, solar, wind and nuclear.It's extended from 105.95 early entry and also sports a very strong relative strength line. The annualized dividend yield is 2.7% and the five-year annualized growth rate is 6%.

"
38,WEC,"The market is back in an uptrend, but the S&P 500 is still trading below its high from May. It is easy to see eight months of a struggling market reflected in IBD’s blue chip Big Cap 20 list. Fully 14 stocks on the current list qualify as defensive names.Utilities including Southern Energy (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED) and WEC Energy Group (WEC) are defensive because their prices to consumers are generally locked, and customers have little choice but to use the product. Also, the stocks typically offer healthy dividends.Another factor: Utilities are a segment into which mutual funds working to maintain minimum levels of investment rotate into during choppy markets. This demand can hold share prices steady or even drive them higher while the general market corrects.On the other hand, four stocks on the list qualify as solid growth stocks: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH),  Equinix (EQIX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).McDonald’s (MCD) carries some combined traits of defensive and growth stocks, giving it an interesting leg up in the current market. The fast-food chain’s turnaround under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made the stock a growth contender with regard to a number of fundamental and technical attributes: earnings growth, same-store-sales, relative strength and accumulation/distribution.McDonald’s still falls short on the standard punch list of CAN SLIM elements. But the turnaround has made the stock much more attractive for investors looking for healthy dividend names and/or double-threat defensive plays.McDonald’s, which fell off the list Monday, was extended after last week’s bounce off its 10-week moving average, and from a breakout in October.Dollar General (DG) was a double-threat growth/defensive stock from its re-entry to public markets in November 2009 through July 2012. It and its now-merged competitors Family Dollar and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were grabbing market share from Wal-Mart (WMT) and buying up smaller, regional chains across the U.S. Dollar General’s EPS growth is forecast at a healthy 13% for the year ended in January, and 15% in 2017. Revenue growth has slowed to high single digits.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) torqued up nearly 1290% from October 2008 to October 2015. During that period, when the market was choppy or in a correction, auto parts chains were seen as dual growth/defensive plays because they were consolidating and gaining market share while benefiting from consumers holding on to their cars longer than they had in the past.O’Reilly, which announces its Q4 results on Feb. 10, is forecast to remain in the camp through 2015 with full EPS growth forecasts of 24%. Revenue growth is seen slowing to 8%. For 2016, analyst consensus puts EPS growth at 14% and sales growth at 7%.Big Cap 20 stocks tend to be stable, healthy performers, but they are not a list of pick-and-play buy opportunities. Investors need to look carefully at the fundamentals and make sure they understand both the company and its value proposition. Sudden changes in market direction can generate significant changes in the companies on the list.

39,WEC,"It's been a rough start for the stock market in 2016, so it's not surprising to see defensive areas of the market like utilities and real estate investment trusts setting up for possible upside moves.Both groups are known for delivering solid yields, and with growth stocks generally out of favor for now, institutional money has been quietly flowing into each group.Bullish setups abound in the utility group from the likes of American Electric Power (AEP), Scana (SCG) and WEC Energy (WEC).But the REIT group is home to compelling setups as well. Digital Realty (DLR) has emerged as the leader in the REIT group and already has cleared a buy point, but plenty of other names are attracting interest.Institutional investors were accumulating shares of DuPont Fabros Technology (DFT) late last year as it worked on the right side of a cup-shaped base. A handle area has been forming that shows a 33.72 buy point.Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the company operates 12 multi-tenant wholesale data centers in four major markets. Data centers remain in high demand as companies like Internet content providers, health care and financial firms outsource their data-management needs. Annual pretax margin (29.8%) and return on equity (8.9%) at DuPont hit multiyear highs in 2014. It currently yields around 6%.Elsewhere in the group, Realty Income (O) is holding its own as it sits just above a 52.70 buy point. Its specialty is triple-net leases, in which the tenant is responsible for paying a building's property taxes, building insurance and maintenance costs. Realty Income currently yields 4.4%.Finally, Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) is trading tightly and still in a buy range from a 145.68 entry. The company operates retail and mixed-used properties in the Northwest, Mid-Atlantic and California.

75,WEC,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) recently provided an updated 2017 guidance, which hints at an improvement in full-year earnings. The company currently expects earnings per share to exceed the range of $1.25-$1.33 in 2017, compared to its prior guidance of earnings at or near the high end of this range.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.31, higher than the mid-point of the company-provided range.Details of the Updated OutlookPer management, recent adjustments made in CenterPoint Energy’s bottom line, including a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities and a credit to income tax expenses, primarily led to the raised earnings projection. This updated guidance also takes into account the company’s midstream investments as well as amortization of CenterPoint Energy's basis difference in Enable Midstream.The guidance is also takes factors like Enable Midstream's most recent public outlook for 2017 provided on Nov 1, 2017, and projected effective tax rates. However, it excludes potential impacts such as any change in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items. The outlook also excluded one-time items like changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and related stocks, or the timing effects of market-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business.What Led to the Upbeat Guidance?The recently passed $1.5-trillion tax bill by the U.S. Senate, which includes a deep tax cut for corporates, seems to have played a major role in the lifting of the guidance. In fact, during the third-quarter earnings call, the company did give an indication that a favorable tax reform might result in a lower tax rate for CenterPoint Energy. So, shelling out less in form of tax will boost the bottom line.Moreover, the company had earlier projected income tax rate at 36% for 2017 despite witnessing a slightly higher rate of 37% in the third quarter. The latest tax reform might have pulled down the rate further for the company, thereby leading to the raised outlook.Moreover, CenterPoint Energy’s venture in Enable Midstream has been consistently boosting the bottom line. Considering the fact that Enable Midstream continues to see a strong level of activity on their system with 40, it must have also contributed to this raised bottom line guidance.What Lies Ahead?CenterPoint Energy has been investing substantially to expand its operations to cope with increasing utility demand. The company is currently focused on upgrading infrastructure and improving reliability. Toward this end, the company maintains its capital outlay of $7 billion from 2017 through 2021. With respect to bottom-line growth, CenterPoint Energy expects to witness 4-6% annual EPS growth or exceeding the high end of the range through 2018, inclusive of Midstream Investments.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.41 for 2018, reflecting year-over-year improvement of 7.8%.Price MovementCenterPoint Energy’s stock has moved up about 10.4% in the last 12 months compared with the broader industry’s gain of 4.7%. This outperformance must have been led by significant customer growth as well as investments to upgrade infrastructure.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksCenterPoint Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Efficient management and skillful execution of plans have culminated in robust results, the best part being better-than-guided earnings for 12 years nonstop.The average positive earnings surprise of 3.08% for the trailing four quarters should encourage investors as would a 1.5% upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 to 66 cents, in the last 30 days.WEC Energy projects capital expenditure of nearly $11.8 billion over 2018-2022. Of this, $5,514 million is allotted for Gas Delivery, $2,707 million for Electric Delivery, $2,691 million for Generation and $911 million for Energy Infrastructure. Since, more than 99% of the company’s earnings are generated from regulated operations, rate hikes give it the confidence to spend on infrastructure development and power to boost earnings.More good news comes from a swelling customer base thanks to the economy, which is gaining health. In third-quarter 2017, WEC Energy served 9,000 more electric and 18,000 more natural gas customers than it did in the year-ago quarter. Strong investment-grade credit ratings between A and A-, allows WEC Energy to enjoy superior credit worthiness.

77,WEC,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.‘s (CNP  -  Free Report) board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend hike of approximately 3.7% for the company’s common stocks.Notably, the revised quarterly stock dividend of 27.75 cents per share, up from 26.75 cents per share distributed earlier, will be payable on Mar 8, 2018, to shareholders at the close of business on Feb 15, 2018. Post the hike, the company’s new annualized dividend will amount to $1.11 per share of common stock, up from $1.07 per share of common stock distributed previously.Consequently, the company’s current annual dividend yield is 3.9% based on the closing share price of $28.40 on Dec 13, 2017, significantly higher than the yield of 1.74% recorded by S&P 500 as well as that of industry average of 3.04%.Dividend Hike is Common for UtilitiesUtility operators generate more or less stable earnings, owing to endless need for electricity and utility services. This helps the stocks in the utility space to enjoy a steady flow of revenues. A steady flow of uninterrupted income in turn encourages the operators to reward shareholders from time to time, with notable dividend hikes.Toward this, we have witnessed a few utilities reward their shareholders with incremental dividends in the past few weeks. Evidently, PNM Resources, Inc. (PNM  -  Free Report) has raised its annual dividend by 9.3%, while another utility operator – WEC Energy Group (WEC  -  Free Report) decided to raise its dividend by 6.3%. Most recently, The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) hiked its dividend by 8.3%.What led to Dividend Hike for Company?CenterPoint Energy has been more or less a steady performer in the past, as evidenced by its performance in the last four quarters. Notably the utility was successful in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.4%.Further, the company maintains a stable cash flow financial position. As of Sep 30, 2017, it had cash and cash equivalents of $201 million. Such stability in financial position has supported the company’s practice of returning value to shareholders with regular dividend hikes. In the nine months of 2017, the company paid $346 million as dividends to shareholders, up from $332 million paid in the year-ago period. The latest dividend hike marks the 13th in a row in as many years, following the 4% hike that CenterPoint Energy made this January.Going AheadCenterPoint Energy aims to invest approximately $4.1 billion through the 2017-2021 period toward its Electric Transmission & Distribution division, for conducting system modernization initiatives, maintenance projects and installation of meter-reading technology. Additionally, it intends to spend $2.7 billion in natural gas utilities for replacing aging infrastructure, development of the Minnesota Belt Line Project and public improvement requirements. These investments are expected to collectively aid the company in achieving 4-6% annual EPS growth, or exceeding the upper end of its range through 2018. Notably, this will aid the company in making dividend hikes in future.Price MovementShares of CenterPoint Energy have outperformed the industry in the last one year. The company’s shares gained 22%, compared with the industry’s growth of 15.9%.The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s solid cash flow generating capability.Zacks RankCenterPoint Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

PNM Resources is an energy holding company that provides electricity services to more than 761,000 customers in New Mexico and Texas through regulated units, (PNM  -  Free Report) and TNMP. Toward this, it aims to invest approximately $866 million toward TNPM and nearly $856 million for PNM transmission and distribution.Fresh Investment & Customer Growth HelpsThe company witnessed year-to-date customer growth of 0.7%. At the TNMP division, performance in the third quarter of 2017 can be attributed to better revenues driven by customer additions that grew by almost 1.3% for the quarter compared with the prior quarter. We expect the increased demand driven by higher customers to be reflected going forward as well.Overall, we believe that the company is poised to benefit on the back of customer additions and robust capital expenditure planning. Notably, capital expenditure toward energy efficiency programs will aid it to support increased demand in service territories.We believe that these factors will aid the company to fulfill its targeted 6% ongoing earnings growth through 2021.Steady Performer & Dividend GrowthPNM Resources has been a consistent performer with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 10%.At the end of the third quarter, the company generated cash and cash equivalents worth $43.1 million, substantially up from the 2016-end figure of $4.5 million. The strong cash flow position of the company, will it aid to meet ongoing capital expenditure and upcoming investments in operations. The company’s net cash flows from operating activities during the first nine months of 2017 amounted to $417.3 million.Additionally we believe that such robust cash flow generating capability encouraged the company to increase annual dividend and reward investors with a dividend hike of 9.3%, recently in the month of December. (Read more: PNM Resources Rewards Investors, Ups Annual Dividend by 9.3%).Notably we witnessed Ameren Corp (AEE  -  Free Report), another utility that recently decided to reward shareholders with a higher dividend.

This represents an increase of 3.25 cents per share or 6.25% over the current quarterly rate.Post the hike, the company’s new annualized dividend will amount to $2.21 per share of common stock, up from 52 cents of common stock distributed earlier. This revised quarterly stock dividend is expected to be payable Mar 1, 2018, to stockholders of record on Feb 14, 2018.WEC Energy’s Regular Dividends HikesPer management, this plan to raise the quarterly dividend is in line with the company's long-term earnings growth objective. Notably, the company expects to witness long-term earnings per share growth at an average annual rate of 5-7%.WEC Energy has been a consistent performer with its earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.08%. Meanwhile, this utility has been gaining steadily from increased customers in the last few quarters, which in turn has been boosting its revenue growth. Evidently, at the end of third-quarter 2017, the company gained from an additional of 9,000 electric and 18,000 natural gas customers compared with the year-ago quarter.Consequently, these gains got translated into substantial earnings growth, which have encouraged it to reward its shareholders by consistent dividend hike  at regular intervals. In this line ,the company hiked annual dividend rate to $2.08 from fourth-quarter 2015 level of $1.98 in Jan 2017, reflecting an increase of 5.1% return value to shareholders.

We anticipate these factors to contribute significantly toward the company’s performance and bode well with its long term strategies as well.Why are Dividend Hikes Regular for Utilities?Utilities like WEC Energy, Ameren Corp (AEE  -  Free Report) and Atlantic Power Corporation (AT  -  Free Report) enjoy more or less stable earnings, owing to endless need for electricity and utility services, which primarily drives the revenues of the Utility sector.

86,WEC,"The third-quarter earnings season is fast approaching its peak. As of Oct 20, 87 S&P 500 members came up with their quarterly earnings. By end of Oct 27, nearly 267 members of the index are expected to release their numbers.Total earnings for these 87 S&P 500 members are up 9.4% year over year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating earnings per share estimates and 70.1% surpassing revenue estimates.Amid this positive performance so far let us focus on the Zacks Utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 4% this season. Notably, at present, nine out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season. Read more details in our weekly Earnings Preview.Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve raised the rates twice in this year — in March and June. This will definitely hurt the sector’s stocks. In addition, the hurricanes also adversely impacted the utilities operating in Texas and Florida.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for investors.Let us take a sneak peek at few utility stocks that are scheduled to release third-quarter earnings on Oct 26.NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.7% in the previous quarter. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NextEra Energy’s revenues is pegged at $4,893 million, indicating 4.01% year over year and 12.4% sequential increase. We expect the increase in total revenues to be driven by higher contribution from its FPL segment.However, Hurricane Irma is likely to adversely impact the company’s earnings. NextEra Energy’s earnings are projected to be $1.75 per share, reflecting a sequential drop by a penny.NextEra Energy’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.75.

(AEP  -  Free Report) reported a negative earnings surprise of 8.54% in the previous quarter. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.American Electric Power is expected to benefit from the improving economic conditions in its service territories and its efficient cost-management initiatives.Ohio and Texas operations contributes a major share of company's utility revenues. Power generation from these states is deregulated, consequently leading to the current lower price environment. This, in turn, is expected to hurt earnings of American Electric Power.Hurricane Harvey that hit the coasts of Texas last month, hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines leading to widespread outages in the state. American Electric Power’s subsidiary, AEP Texas, is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1 million retail customers. Therefore, we expect the company’s third-quarter bottom line to be affected due to outages.American Electric Power Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  American Electric Power Company, Inc.

87,WEC,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) recently announced that its subsidiary Duke Energy Carolinas (“DEC”) is set to sell five hydroelectric plants to Northbrook Energy. These small plants are located in the Western Carolinas region and have a cumulative hydroelectricity generation capacity of 18.7 megawatt.The deal, struck through a competitive bidding process, is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019. While the financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps, its closure is subject to approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other state regulatory authorities.Details of the DealThese Green/Broad River Basin and Nantahala area–based hydro stations are serving Duke Energy’s customers for a long time in Carolina. However, the company has been incurring higher operations and maintenance cost for these plants.Per the terms, DEC is going to purchase hydroelectricity generated by these plants for next five years from Northbrook Energy. Therefore, customers will continue to receive electricity from Duke Energy at a lower rate, since Duke Energy will no longer have to bear the cost of operation after the closure of the deal.  Shareholders may also enjoy the benefits from this long-term cost-saving initiative undertaken by the company in the form of increased dividend payouts and stock repurchases.Will This Deal Benefit Duke Energy?Hydro, being the first technology used to generate electricity, has been the largest source of renewable electricity in the United States. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), hydro generated more than 7% energy in 2017 and is expected to serve more than 35 million U.S. homes in average by 2050.It goes without saying that hydroelectricity has immense prospects in the Unites States. Evidently, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hydropower Vision analysis finds that U.S. hydropower can rise from 101 GW of capacity in 2015 to nearly 150 GW by 2050.Therefore, to make most of the growing opportunities of hydropower, utilities are also shifting to renewables from coal. Duke Energy, being no exception, has also been expanding its renewable asset base. In sync with the afore-mentioned strategy and to meet customers’ power demand at lower rates, the company agreed to sell the plants. This decision will maintain the environmental balance and will lower the company’s cost of operations.Price MovementShares of Duke Energy have lost 7.7% in the last 12 months, against the Zacks Electric Power industry’s rise of 2.1%. The downside may have been caused by the significant environmental compliance cost that the company bears.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry include Ameren Corp. (AEE  -  Free Report), Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT  -  Free Report) and WEC Energy Group, Inc. (WEC  -  Free Report), all of which carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

90,WEC,"WEC Energy Group (WEC  -  Free Report) has recently signed an agreement to acquire majority stake at the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center of Henry County, Illinois. Per the terms, WEC Energy will purchase 80% ownership of the wind farm for $148 million.Developed by Invenergy, the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center has a capacity to generate 132 megawatt (MW) of electricity and been in service since May 2018.  Utility’s Shift to RenewablesRising level of air pollution along with global climate change has prompted consumers to rapidly increase the adoption of alternative energy sources, nay renewables, over the last decade. Buoyed by declining costs of solar and wind technologies as well as rising demand for more carbon-constrained practices, utilities and corporations are shifting to renewables. Consequently, many electric utilities are investing or making agreements to increase the usage of alternative energy sources to generate power.Why Investment in Wind Power is Profitable?While utilities are shifting focus toward renewables, solar and wind are gaining significant traction in the renewable industry. The adoption of wind energy has increased, courtesy of lower cost of turbines. In this regard, the Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017 stated that wind turbine costs have declined by around half since 2010.This, in turn, has made the construction and maintenance of wind power projects cheaper, setting the stage for utility providers like WEC Energy to make valuable investments in wind projects like the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center. Also, demand for wind energy isimpressive, with the Renewable Energy: United States report estimating a rise in of 7.2% in demand by 2021.Moreover, the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) offered by the government have made investments in new wind project more productive. With these tax credits being extended through 2019, rising demand and declining turbine costs, we may expect to witness similar wind investments in the United States over the near term.This spectacular outlook for the U.S. wind energy space has prompted other utility providers to make notable investments in wind energy for expanding their clean energy portfolio. For instance, NextEra Energy, Inc’s (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary — NextEra Energy Resources — recently announced a renewable energy partnership program with AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report). Per the power purchase agreement (PPA), the partnership will acquire 300 MW of wind energy from two new wind farms in Wilbarger and Hardeman Counties, Texas.Similarly, to cater to the increasing demand for wind energy, NRG Energy Inc (NRG  -  Free Report) and Cypress Creek Renewables are set to develop a 25 MW solar project in Texas.Price MovementThe shares of WEC Energy have gained 5.0%, against the industry’s decline of 2.2% in last 12 months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksWEC Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

93,WEC,"Electric utility firm Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is set to release its first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Wednesday, May 2. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 82 cents on revenues of $5,700 million.In the preceding three-month period, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider reported stronger-than-expected earnings due to strength of its retail unit and lower operations and maintenance costs.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the utility is on a firm footing, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Southern Company (The) QuoteInvestors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Southern Company surpasses earnings estimate this time too. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Factors to Consider This QuarterA leading utility holding entity in the U.S., Southern Company dominates the power business across the Southeast. With a strong rate base growth and constructive regulation, we expect the firm to generate steady earnings.Also, with operations in a stable and growing industry, Southern Company has a steady stream of cash flow. The utility’s history of consistent dividend payments indicates its confidence in itself.We further believe that the AGL Resources acquisition will be accretive to Southern Company earnings.However, with customer growth tepid and likely to remain so for some time, sales might be affected. This together with a large base, might make it difficult for Southern Company to manage rates. Higher operating and maintenance expenses is another concern.The utility is also bearing the brunt of continued delays and cost overruns over two of its large construction projects — Vogtle and Kemper — which are again expected to weigh on Southern Company's fortunes.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for Southern Company stands at -0.40%.Zacks Rank: Southern Company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP, making us less confident of an earnings surprise call.As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some utilities you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:South Jersey Industries, Inc.

94,WEC,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the sale of its 17% equity stake in Eletropaulo, the company’s utility unit in Brazil. The transaction came in at a total consideration of BRL 1.27 billion ($310 million approximately) and the proceeds are expected to be used for lower outstanding debts of the parent company within next 60 days.Reason for Sell-OffDuring the first half of 2016, the company had decided to undertake a strategic move to decrease its exposure to Brazilian utility distribution market. Last November, the company converted its preferred stock stake in Eletropaulo to equity share with 17% holding interest.The Brazilian distribution business has been persistently suffering loss for the past three years. As of 31 Dec, 2017, the company reported an after-tax loss of $611 million on deconsolidation. Of the total loss, $455 million was on account of cumulative translation loss and $243 million related to pension loss.AES’ Focus on RenewableWith the strategic move of selling its interest in Eletropaulo, the company exited the electric distribution business in Brazil. It is now poised to focus on the growing need for renewables and looking forward to bring in new technologies such as, energy storage, digitalization and drone applications to the Brazilian electric sector.As of May 8, 2018, the company had a generation mix consisting of 37% gas, 32% coal, 27% renewable and 4% oil, diesel & pet coke. In addition, the company had a gross megawatt (MW) in operation of 33,965 MW.The company is rapidly expanding its renewable footprint in overseas. In this context, the company’s subsidiary, AES Gener, entered into a new contract during the first quarter of 2018 with Strabag for its Chile-based Alto Maipo hydroelectric project.Also, due to increased electricity tariff by the Argentinian government, the company evaluates this transaction as an opportunity and is looking forward to take advantage of the same by expanding renewable energy in the country. Moreover, AES Argentina agreed to acquire a 100 MW wind development project with 20 years of U.S. dollar-denominated Power Purchase Agreement. The company expects to see more such contracts in days ahead.Importance of RenewableRenewable Energy source has been gaining momentum globally. Wind and solar power have been two of the fastest growing sources of electricity generation on the international front over the past decade. In 2017, global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11%, thus bringing the global total to 540 GW. Projections by the International Energy Agency indicate that renewable energy will continue to grow at a faster rate than fossil fuels over the next two decades.Per U.S. Energy Information Administration report, during the 2014-2017 time period, renewable sources accounted for more than 50% of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States. In 2018, 9 GW of new solar and wind assets will be installed, reflecting the rising popularity and importance of renewable resources in the United States.Price PerformanceShares of AES Corporation have outperformed its industry over the past year.

The company would add nearly 140 new patent rights to its existing portfolio via this acquisition.Solar Industry OutlookPer U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the source of energy from renewables has increased over the years. Around 55% of the total energy, nearly 21 gigawatt (GW) added in the United States last year, was from a renewable source. Also, as of February 2018, 22% of the country’s total electricity generation comes from a renewable source.By 2018 end, EIA expects an additional 5,067 MW of solar power to come online. According to the forecast, solar capacity is anticipated to grow by 127 gigawatt (GW) from 2020 to 2050. Also, electricity generation through solar will likely account for nearly 14% of the total energy output to be generated during the same period.Per Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), some renewable energy sources have grown over the years owing to federal policies in the United States. Electricity generation via wind and solar enjoys a special federal tax credit. This tax credit is one of the key growth-drivers for solar power generation companies as the credit allowed to power generator is transferred to end users through lower solar prices.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Enphase Energy have gained significantly by 465% compared with its industry’s surge of 36%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEnphase Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

99,WEC,"Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market? You should consider the VictoryShares US EQ Income Enhanced Volatility Wtd ETF (CDC  -  Free Report), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 07/01/2014.The fund is sponsored by Victory Capital. It has amassed assets over $698.29 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.91%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Utilities sector--about 25.60% of the portfolio.

100,WEC,"Perennial demand for electricity and utility services has made the Utility Sector a safe haven for investors. Consistent demand enables a smooth flow of cash to utility operators. They in turn use this cash to reward shareholders by paying stable dividends.In fact, for income investors, this sector has always been a lucrative one with utility stocks generating strong dividend yields. As we near the end of 2017, it seems to be a good time for investors to review the prospects of utility stocks and accordingly reshuffle their portfolios.Rising Prices Boost Growth ProspectsIn a recent release, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that the annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 3.4% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2018. This will surely benefit electric utility operators. Electricity prices are also projected to increase in commercial and industrial sector. Undoubtedly, such price increases will boost earnings of the utilities and enhance dividend payouts.Regular Dividends: A Major PositiveA major positive for utility stocks has been their regular dividend payout strategy. Even during times of recession, households and communities still need power, water, heat and telecommunications. This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008-2009, when utilities continued to pay dividends uninterruptedly.We have a long list of companies that are sharing profits consistently with shareholders. Notable among them are CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report), which have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now.Trump Administration: A Boon Stringent regulations implemented by President Obama prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels. Although for environmental protection Clean Power Plan was an apt decision, it was putting pressures on utilities.  President Trump’s repeal of these stipulations on economic growth grounds are expected to give a new lease of life to utilities that produce a major part of their electricity from coal. After all, Coal still accounts for nearly 30% of the electricity produced in the United States.Trump’s promises to deregulate the sector and remove environmental hurdles will be beneficial for utilities. Fewer regulations will help to lower operating costs and increase the lives of power production facilities.Key BetsUtility operators are currently undergoing a transition as the primary fuel source, coal, is gradually being replaced by natural gas and other alternative energy resources like solar power as is evident from increased usage of clean energy to produce electricity.May be realizing that fact that our ultimate future lies in renewable resources, large utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy continue to take initiatives to produce electricity from natural gas and alternative sources, even when Trump is against the Clean Power Plan.With only a month or so remaining before we step into 2018, let’s take a look at the utility stocks which continued with their dividend payout strategy amidst this transition.With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we have narrowed down our search to the following utility stocks each of which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a dividend yield of more than 3%.

117,WEC,"NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) is gaining from investments made toward strengthening infrastructure and ongoing capital projects. Upon completion, these projects will aid the company to serve its expanding customer base more efficiently. Additionally, its focus on clean energy has helped it lower carbon emissions from previous levels.However, the company's nature of business, subject to comprehensive federal and state regulations, as well as the impact of unpredictable weather conditions may derail normal operations and impact profitability to some extent.The company’s primary subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (“FPL”) reached another milestone in support of its ongoing strategy of providing clean affordable energy services. The unit has got the official nod from the Florida Public Service Commission to shut down operations of the St. Johns River Power Park coal-fired plant and has recently closed operations in the plant, This initiative is projected to prevent 5.6 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually and save an estimated $183 million, for FPL customers.With the shutting down of the plant, it also inaugurated four new solar power plants. The new solar plants came online on Jan 1, 2018. Further, it aims to bring online another four solar plants by Mar 1, 2018. Notably, the plants will encompass approximately 2.6 million solar panels in total, and have the capacity of generating 74.5 megawatts (MW). This reflects the company’s further progress in clean energy space.Further, NextEra Energy and FPL continue to work progressively toward increasing customer base. In the third quarter of 2017, earnings came in at $1.19 per share, up 7.2% from the prior-year quarter figure driven mainly by 62,000 customer additions during the quarter.On the flip side, FPL depends on the Florida Public Service Commission for timely rate relief and cost recovery approvals, denials of which could affect the company’s operational results. These factors along with delay in completion of projects may cause cost overruns and adversely impact profitability.Price MovementNextEra Energy returned 29.9% in the last 12 months, outperforming the 6.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank & Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the same space include Pampa Energia S.A.

120,WEC,"Pattern Energy Group Inc. (PEGI  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its 81 MW interest in 115 MW El Arrayán Wind project in Chile for $67 million in cash and the divestment is expected to close within 90 days, subject to customary closing conditions.Pattern Energy expects to reduce $1 million annual overhead cost in relation to business management in Chile.The company’s decision to discontinue its wind operation in Chile was strategic as the operational hub was located far from the company’s remaining business activities. The wind operation was located nearly 400 km north of Santiago on the Chilean coast, due to which, the company had to incur higher fleet operation cost, different legal, tax and regulatory environments. The sale proceeds will either be utilized to make further accretive investments, clearing debts, share buyback or for other corporate purposes.Future Plans of Pattern EnergyPattern Energy is currently working on Pattern 2020 initiative, which sets out targets for its growth into the next decade and beyond. Under this initiative, the company aims to double its existing capability by end of 2020.Pattern Energy has utility scale renewable operations in U.S., Chile, Japan and Canada. The company is presently focused on expanding its renewable operation in Japan through acquisitions.The company bought 206 MW of solar and wind portfolio in Japan, of which, four projects with a total of 84MW are in operation and immediately accretive to the company’s business. The remaining 122 MW of solar and wind project is under constructionExpansion in Japan is a very profitable venture for the company as in Japan, the average power contract price is $230 per megawatt hour. So the 206 MW that the company acquired in Japan is equivalent to 400-600 MW in North America. Given the profitability and scope, we expect the company to further widen its scope of operations in Japan.Importance of RenewableRenewable Energy source has been gaining momentum globally. Wind and solar power have been two of the fastest growing sources of electricity generation on the international front over the past decade. In 2017, global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11%, thus bringing the global total to 540 GW. Projections by the International Energy Agency indicate that renewable energy will continue to grow at a faster rate than fossil fuels over the next two decades.Per U.S. Energy Information Administration report, during the 2014 to 2017 time period, renewable sources accounted for more than 50% of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States. In 2018 9 GW of new solar and wind assets will be added, which shows the rising popularity and importance of renewable sources in the United States.Price PerformanceShares of Pattern Energy have outperformed its industry in the past 30 days. The stock has gained 0.7% against the 1.8% decline of its industry. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPattern Energy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

121,WEC,"Edison International’s (EIX  -  Free Report) unit Southern California Edison (“SCE”) has received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission to begin four electric transportation pilot projects that will help increase usage of electric in transportation. The primary objective of these transportation pilots is to lower emission levels and meet California’s 2030 greenhouse gas and air pollution reduction goals.California aims to lower its 2030 greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels. SCE, through its transportation pilot projects, will expand the usage of electricity in cars, buses, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and industrial vehicles and equipment.Emission Reduction BenefitsSouthern California is the gateway for nearly 40% of the goods entering the United States, which move through the region’s ports and  highways. It is evident that the goods movement through the heavy vehicles is major source of emission in this region.The pilot projects primarily aim to promote development of more electric charging points that will assist in charging the electric vehicles and work on electrification of the equipment used in ports. The projects are part of the $550 million investment program, which the commission is yet to approve.Reduction of pollution from the transportation space, which is the major contributor to emission levels in California will help to achieve the pollution reduction goals. Also, several utility scale renewable energy projects are coming up in the state, which will help in achieving the target.Road Ahead SCE serves nearly 15 million people in its 50,000 square miles of service area. To efficiently serve the growing population of California, the company aims to invest $14.7 billion in next few years to strengthen and expand its existing electricity infrastructure.Also, energy efficiency programs of SCE have helped customers save enough energy to power 1.2 million homes for a year.SCE’s massive asset base and expertise will allow it to develop the transportation electrification market in California and these pilot projects are means to achieve the same.Price MovementEdison International’s shares have lost 13.6% in a year against the industry’s gain of 2.8%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEdison International currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

122,WEC,"Consolidated Edison, Inc.’s (ED  -  Free Report) regulated utilities help to generate earnings regularly. These utilities offer transmission and distribution with limited commodity exposure as most electric and gas supply costs are passed on to customers.Moreover, the company is investing strategically for developing infrastructure. To this end, the company plans to invest approximately $11.1 billion in the 2017-2019 time frame. Roughly 84% of the investment has been allocated for regulated utility operations.Consolidated Edison is also spending prudently to enhance renewable generation assets. The company is gradually converting some of its operations to gas, which is environmental friendly. As of Sep 30, 2017, Consolidated Edison had renewable generating capacity of 1,291 megawatts (MW), up from 2016-end level of 1,098 MW.Coming to its earnings performance, Consolidated Edison delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.06%. Notably, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings is $4.26, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.3%.Further, the company maintains a stable liquidity level backed by a strong cash generation capacity, which in turn enables it to follow a disciplined capital spending program. Buoyed by the solid cash balance position, the company's shares have outperformed the broader industry over a year. Evidently, Consolidated Edison’s share price has rallied 9.9% compared with its industry’s gain of 3.8%.  On the flip side, Consolidate Edison faces interest rate risk owing to variable rate debt and new debt financing which is needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Management estimates that as of Sep 30, 2017, the company witnessed a 10% increase in interest rates due to variable rate debt which might result in an increase in annual interest expense of $2 million.Moreover, Consolidated Edison is overvalued compared to its broader industry in terms of EV/EBITDA multiple. Evidently, the EV/EBITDA multiple for the company stands at 10.52, while that for the broader industry is 10.43. The company also faces commodity price risk related to the purchase and sale of its electricity, gas and related derivative instruments.Zacks Rank & Key PicksConsolidated Edison carriesa Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report), Atlantic Power Corporation (AT  -  Free Report) and WEC Energy Group, Inc.

123,WEC,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) follows a disciplined capital spending program to maintain and upgrade the reliability of its electric utility systems with $6.5-billion investment planned over the next 10 years. Notably, DTE Electric’s total investment is expected to be $18 billion over the next 10 years.Moreover, the company is investing steadily to enhance its renewable generation assets. Over the next 15 years, DTE Electric plans to withdraw a portion of its coal-fired generation and boost the natural gas-fired generation and renewables mix.Further, the company aims at constructing natural gas turbine plants to provide approximately 1,100 megawatts of energy from the beginning of 2022. Apart from natural gas, the company plans to continue investing in wind and solar to maintain a balanced portfolio. In September 2016, MPSC approved DTE Energy’s two 150 megawatt wind projects. These projects are expected to come online during 2018-2020.Coming to its earnings performance, DTE Energy delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.8%. Notably, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings per share is $5.54, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.9%.Meanwhile, DTE Energy operates in Michigan, which has witnessed a gradual economic recovery due to an improvement in employment rates and housing and auto markets. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, which in turn is expected to bolster the company’s growth.The company’s focus on improving its cost structure and directing capital investments toward renewable generation, utility infrastructure and environmental compliance assets have led it to outperform its broader market. Evidently, DTE Energy’s share price increased 9.8% over a year compared with the industry’s 6.4% growth.  On the flip side, despite investing substantially in renewable projects, increasingly stringent government regulations for curbing emissions remains a major cause of concern for DTE Energy.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksDTE Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same space are NextEra Energy, Inc.

127,WEC,"The Q2 earnings season is gradually unfolding, with nearly 800 companies – including 183 S&P 500 members – expected to come up with earnings results this week. As of Jul 21, 97 S&P 500 members came up with earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.Combining results of the reported index members (97 members) with the remaining 403 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.6% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.9% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest-rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.However, the U.S. coal-based utilities did get a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Five out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

131,WEC,"The first four months of 2018 have been eventful, with a Fed rate hike, U.S.-China tariff war threats and tensions in Syria wiping out yearly gains from all the major indexes. The S&P 500 index is off its highs for the year and currently remains barely in positive territory, while the Technology-heavy Nasdaq composite is up +2.1% in the year-to-date period.Stock market investing is no doubt a risky venture, and even well-thought out investment strategies at times fail to generate desired returns. Against this backdrop, let us focus on the domestic-focused, capital-intensive utility stocks that assure investors steady performance and regular dividend yields. Utility stocks are subject to heavy regulation, both at the federal and state levels. Utilities are known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow.Utilities, aside from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amounts of emissions, are also focused in improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. They are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity. We expect more battery storage units to be installed across the U.S. due to increasing production of electricity from renewable sources and support to the power grid.Utilities are also undertaking long-term plans to shift transmission lines underground in weather-sensitive areas to lower chances of power outages. The introduction of smart meters are helping users make efficient use of electricity.Natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver their product to end users. Water utilities are also required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains. The utilities are using the latest technology to upgrade and maintain their existing infrastructure to increase reliability of their services. Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) received approval from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to use drones beyond their operators’ vision to survey transmission lines and perform other operations that require consistent monitoring.So, to upgrade and strengthen the existing infrastructure, utilities depend on capital markets. Though regulated utilities are cash generators, the funds generated from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long-term projects. The rate-sensitive, capital-intensive utility stocks also had to accommodate the Fed rate hike.The rise in interest cost will no doubt increase cost of capital for utilities and might limit their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares. These developments could lower the attractiveness of utilities, and investors might turn to bonds as an alternative source of investment.However, utilities across the United States have gained from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from January 2018. Utility operators decided to pass on the benefits to their customers, and the majority of them have enjoyed a decline in monthly bills.The unemployment rate in the United States was static at a historical low of 4.1% for the last six months. In addition, the United States Building Permits increased 4.4% in March 2018 to 1,379 thousand. The new permits had exceeded the U.S. building permit average of 1355.99 thousand from 1960 to 2018. All these factors indicate an increase in demand for residential utility services.All other industries depend on utilities for the basic requirements of electricity, gas and water. The ongoing growth will result in higher demand from industrial, commercial and residential space for utility services and boost its performance.Utilities TransformingIn August 2015, President Obama introduced the Clean Power Plan to lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions levels from electricity generation by around 32% by 2030 from the 2005 levels. President Trump has taken steps toward repealing the Clean Power Plan. Trump believes that such plans will make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive in the global markets. This new development will help in running the coal-fired electricity generation units for a longer period than previously expected.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) estimates that U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions declined by 861 million metric tons or nearly 14% from 2005 to 2017. EIA now projects that carbon dioxide emissions will rise 1.8% from 5,143 million metric tons in 2017 to 5,237 million metric tons in 2018, primarily due to an increase in coal usage in power plants. In 2019, energy-related CO2 emissions will be about 13% lower than 2005 levels.However, utilities are focusing overall on sources of fuel that help to lower emission levels. Large solar power plants and extensive development of wind farms are indicating a shift in preferences relating to fuel sources among utilities. We notice that utility operators like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) have already invested and plan to spend more on creating green energy generation portfolio.Zacks Industry Rank - PositiveWithin the Zacks Sector classification, utilities are a stand-alone sector, one of 16 Zacks sectors. The rural wire-line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector, but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power, Gas Distribution and Water Supply.We rank the 265 sub-industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries in two groups — the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)Two out of three industries related to the utility sector — Gas Distribution, Electric Power and Water Supply — fall into the first group, having the Zacks Industry Rank of #81, #110 and #232, respectively.Our present outlook for the utility sector is positive, with two major industries placed in the first group of the Zacks Industry Rank.Utilities Trading at Mid-RangeThe valuation of the sector (Considering Gas Distribution, Water Supply and Electric Power industry) looks attractive at present. The Water Supply industry is currently trading at 19.4X forward 12-month EPS estimates, the Gas Distribution industry is trading at 20.7X while the Electric Power industry is trading at 13.4X compared with the S&P 500 trading average of 17.5X.The current 20.7x multiple for Gas Distribution companies compares to the five-year range of 17.2X to 24.6X (median of 20.5X) while the 19.4X multiple for Water Utilities compares to the five-year multiple range from a low of 12.4X to a high of 23.3X (median of 18.7X). The current 13.4X multiple for Electric Utilities compares to a five-year range of 11.4X to 16.2X (median of 13.5X).The above study shows that the current multiples are within the five-year ranges, but trading above their historic median level (except Electric Power), offering some room for an increase from the current levels.Earnings Review & OutlookFirst-quarter earnings in the utility space (till Apr 25, 2018) were up 7.7%. Utilities gained from favorable weather in the first quarter, while tax reforms and ongoing infrastructure spending helped the utilities.We expect cost control, new electric rates and customer growth will help the utility sector to come up with earnings growth in the first-quarter reporting cycle. First-quarter earnings from the utility sector are expected to improve 12.5% on the back of revenue growth of 0.4%.The defensive Utility sector’s earnings for first quarter 2018 are expected to improve 13.9%, on the back of revenue growth of 1.4%. Read more in the latest Earnings Preview.Utilities Worth BuyingThe first quarter is expected to be the sector’s best in the last seven years. Last year was profitable for investors, and we expect the major indices to maintain the momentum in 2018.Investors may keep an eye on utilities that witnessed positive estimate revisions, paid regular dividend and returned higher than the market.IDACORP Inc.

132,WEC,"The Q1 earnings season has already crossed the halfway mark with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported quarterly results as of Apr 27.  Going by the positive trends, this quarter is likely to record strongest earnings and revenue growth in seven years. Earnings for the reported S&P 500 members are up 25.1% from the same period last year, on 10.0% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating EPS estimates and 73.8% surpassing revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview, combining the reported results with estimates for the yet-to-release companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index is anticipated to be up 22.6% from the same period last year, driven by 8.4% growth in revenues.Amid the positive earnings outlook for the first quarter, let’s delve into the domestic-focused matured Utility sector. This sector, along with another 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to come up with a positive year-over-year earnings. Currently, only Autos sector is likely to register an earnings decline.The Zacks Utility sector’s earnings are expected to increase 13.9% year over year on 1.4% growth in revenues, thanks to stable performance by most of the utilities. The need for heating stemming from cold weather conditions and increased demand for electricity will aid the utilities. Additionally, tax reforms also helped the utilities in lowering their tax burden substantially.This sector, apart from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amounts of emissions, are also focused in improving and upgrading transmission as well as distribution networks. Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors to efficient usage of electricity.The focus on expanding regulated operations and lower wholesale operation exposure is noticeable. This, in a way, gives further visibility to the utilities forward earnings and makes their operation more stable. Additionally, consistent dividend payment and share buybacks makes utilities a good investment choice for all seasons.However, the rate-sensitive capital-intensive utility stocks also accommodating the Fed rate hike. Notably, the Fed rate has now been raised for the sixth time (latest on March 2018) since the first hike in December 2015.How to Pick the Right Utility Stocks?With a wide array of companies in the Utility space, picking up the right one could be daunting task.

153,WEC,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.’s (PEG  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Public Service Electric and Gas Co. (PSE&G) — recently requested the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (“BPU”) to increase its electric and gas base delivery rates. If approved, the new rates will boost the company’s revenues by 1%.This filing comes as a mandate of the company’s Energy Strong program worth $1.2 billion that got approved by the New Jersey BPU in 2014.Other Details Once approved, the combined residential electric and natural gas customers' annual bill will witness a nominal rise of 1%. The company has assured customers that even after this proposed increase, residential customer bills are expected to be more than 15% lower than they were in 2010.Per management, this rate hike will enable Public Service Enterprise to recover costs that the company incurred to strengthen its electric and gas distribution systems, thereby making them more reliable. Moreover, this proposal reflects the company’s first regulatory rate review in more than eight years.Through this rate filing, Public Service Enterprise has also sought BPU approval for a rate design change, called the Green Enabling Mechanism (GEM). This new rate structure aims at separating the company’s revenues from sales volumes and thereby encourages energy efficiency.  If approved, the GEM will remove the incentive to sell more energy and will instead encourage utility investments in energy efficiency, renewables and other clean energy technologies that will benefit customers by bringing down bills and reducing carbon emissions.The company expects the new base rates as well as the GEM to come into effect from Oct 1, 2018.Our ViewIn May 2014, Public Service Enterprise announced that the New Jersey BPU approved its Energy Strong proposal to proactively protect and strengthen its electric and gas systems to withstand severe weather conditions. Per this proposal, the company aimed at significantly upgrading its infrastructure, which included adding intelligence to its system to help speed restoration during outages.Under the agreement, it was announced that PSE&G will earn an authorized return on equity of 9.75% on the first $1 billion of investment based on an accelerated recovery mechanism.  The impact of the $1-billion investment on the typical residential customer bill is expected to be approximately 2% in 2018 which will be more than offset by transitional charges stemming from deregulation that are expiring in the same time frame.For the remaining $220 million, the company aimed at filling a base rate case after Nov 1, 2017. We believe the latest rate review proposal has been filed by the company to recover this $220 million of the Energy Strong program.Notably, in March 2017, Public Service Enterprise announced plans to spend $12.3 billion for PSE&G’s baseline infrastructure program, which in turn reflects 7% CAGR growth in rate base. The latest rate reform request, if approved, will allow the company to achieve this target.Moreover, Public Service Enterprise continues to undertake several initiatives to support New Jersey Senate’s bill that requires utilities in the state to source 80% of their electricity from renewable energy by 2050. We believe to further comply with this bill, the company has included the GEM clause in the latest rate filing.Notably, in the clean energy space, the company is currently pursuing two solar initiatives, namely, the Solar Loan Program and the Solar 4 All and Solar 4 All Extension programs. In November 2016, the BPU approved a settlement providing for an extension of PSE&G’s existing solar program to construct up to 33 MW of grid-connected facilities with projected investment of approximately $80 million through May 2020.Also, the projected addition of 1,858 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity over 2017 through 2019 will help the company transform itself. Banking on these recently adopted initiatives, management expects nuclear and gas-fired generation facilities to provide more than 90% of the company’s electric output, by the end of this decade.Price PerformanceBuoyed by the solid investment plans, the company's shares have outperformed the broader industry over a year. Evidently, Public Service Enterprise’s share price has rallied 13.7% compared with its industry’s gain of 2.2%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPublic Service Enterprise carriesa Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Pampa Energia S.A.
