0,AGN,"Volatility is the word of the day in the stock market, and drugmakers with strong growth prospects and proven long-term stability, such as IBD 50 member Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), may be good stock watch list candidates.

2,AGN,"Shareholders of generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) on Friday voted in favor of continuing the firm's hostile bid for Perrigo (PRGO), launching what could be a protracted battle. Mylan said two-thirds of shareholders had approved both the transaction and the issuance of shares to Perrigo shareholders for the cash-and-stock bid, which as of Mylan's last formal proposal in April was worth…
"
3,AGN,"To be sold or not to be sold? That is, of course, the question that lies before generic-drug maker Perrigo (PRGO). But regardless of the answer, analysts say there is plenty of reason for investors to take interest in the Dublin-based company, owing to its ability to capitalize on trends in generic prescription drugs and over-the-counter sales.First things first: On Friday, stockholders of drugmaker Mylan (MYL) are scheduled to vote on whether to approve a $30-billion-plus hostile takeover bid for Perrigo and move ahead with a tender offer. Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa, speaking this month with analysts during the company's latest quarterly earnings call, reiterated his own opposition to the offer and the unanimous rejection by Perrigo's board.""I make no prediction on how the Mylan shareholders will vote, but I want to remind everyone, including the Mylan shareholders, that if they proceed with a tender offer for Perrigo, this will not be the easy path that some are painting it to be,"" Papa said, expressing confidence that Perrigo investors support his stand-alone ambitions.Mylan began pursuing Perrigo earlier this year. Following several refusals, Mylan recently offered $75 a share in cash and 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share. Mylan needs both the approval of its own shareholders and support from 50% of Perrigo's investors, plus one more share to seal a deal.If Mylan Insists, A New DecisionIn letters to shareholders, public statements and his most recent earnings call, Papa has said that Mylan has undervalued Perrigo. ""If Mylan does win their shareholder vote and initiate a tender process, we'll make a strategic decision with the board about what's the right thing to do for the company,"" he said.Expecting a close vote, analysts and observers say that, whether a deal ever gets done or not, the M&A talk surrounding Perrigo has attracted some positive attention. ""We are sticking with our buy rating on Perrigo as we see paths to upside in the shares either on a stand-alone basis (hopefully supplemented by acquisitions) or in a large-scale M&A context (e.g., sale to Mylan or another party),"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.Perhaps deal talks will lead to an even stronger bid from Mylan or another suitor — a potential win for investors. Sam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a veteran health care industry investor, told IBD that many pharma companies are hunting acquisitions, so it would not surprise him if more buyers show serious interest in Perrigo. ""It's about building up the pipelines,"" he said. ""And M&A can be an efficient way to do that.""On the other hand, if Mylan's takeover attempt falters and other suitors do not immediately enter the fray, Perrigo would be freed from a months-long distraction and could focus anew on both organic growth and acquisitions of its own.Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business and a long-time observer of M&A markets, told IBD that in the pharma industry, bigger players often can capitalize on their scale to more efficiently distribute the medications manufactured by a takeout target.But that is not always the case, he added, saying that some fast-growth companies have such robust pipelines and proven growth that a sale may simply interfere with already solid expansion paths. If Perrigo can establish that it is indeed the case, and if its own shareholders back it via a vote against a Mylan takeover, it could add an important dose of confidence for investors to feed upon.Biggest Isn't Always Best""There are a lot of moving parts to address when it comes to distributing pharmaceuticals, and that tends to favor the larger companies,"" White said. ""But it is not like there is a 'biggest is always best' rule here.""Analysts say that Perrigo is indeed well-positioned for growth should it remain a stand-alone entity. The company is a leading maker and distributor of private-label over-the-counter and generic prescription drugs, and analysts say that frugal consumers are increasingly moving away from national brands to store brands and away from expensive prescriptions to OTC alternatives. ""M&A outcomes aside, we continue to like the fundamental Perrigo story, given its global leadership position in store-brand OTC and ability to capitalize on (the) Rx-to-OTC switch,"" William Blair analysts said in an August report.Perrigo, which spent 2014 absorbing its own acquisition of Dublin-based Elan, sells treatments for everything from smoking cessation to pain relief. Its stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 in IBD's Medical-General Drugs industry group, which itself ranks 31st out of 197 industry groups. Perrigo is ranked No. 2 behind Allergan (AGN).For the quarter that ended in June, Perrigo reported earnings of $56.4 million, or 38 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, it generated EPS of $2.18, up 25%, on revenue up 34% to $1.53 billion. The firm cited strength in its new branded consumer health care line, which includes its recent acquisition of Omega Pharma, and expansion of pharmaceuticals revenue. Branded consumer health care generated sales of $401 million, while sales in Perrigo's prescription-pharmaceuticals segment increased 10% to $278 million.More Bolt-Ons ExpectedThe company also recently inked deals to buy Patheon's operations in Mexico, as well as a portfolio of OTC drugs from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Analysts anticipate that Perrigo will pursue more such bolt-on deals should it remain a stand-alone operation.After posting the quarterly results earlier in August, Perrigo executives projected 2015 EPS of $7.50 to $8, a 24% increase at the midpoint, on sales of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion, ahead 33% at the midpoint.Executives say that, in addition to company-specific trends, Perrigo also stands to benefit from general and ongoing demographic and health care developments.""Given the megatrends that I have talked about for many years, including an aging population, increased use of medication as individuals get older and rising health care costs, Perrigo is well-positioned to meet the future needs for the global health care community,"" Papa, the chief executive, said on the earnings call.

It pulled back later, however, possibly because word got out that its sole marketed drug is being excluded from CVS' (CVS) preferred formulary next year.Sucampo reported earnings of 21 cents a share, up from just 4 cents in the year-earlier quarter and 6 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue grew 45% to $34.9 million, about $3 million more than analysts expected.The company raised its full-year EPS guidance to 65-75 cents, topping the Street's estimate of 62 cents.Sucampo's revenue all comes from constipation drug Amitiza, which is still growing even though it's been on the market for nine years. In the U.S., prescriptions grew 10%, while Sucampo's royalty revenue through its marketing partner Takeda grew 15%. In Japan, royalty revenue from marketing partner Mylan (MYL) doubled.""In the second quarter, we delivered outstanding earnings growth, driven mainly by Amitiza's continued growth in the U.S. and Japan,"" Sucampo CEO Peter Greenleaf said in a statement. ""Our financial strength will fuel the continued transformation of our business.""That transformation includes the launch of a second drug, cobiprostone, which is in midstage testing for oral mucositis. Many on the Street have been waiting for Sucampo to acquire a company or drug to help fill out its thin pipeline. Greenleaf has told IBD that he's actively looking for opportunities, but for now the company still depends on the one product.That became a greater issue when pharmacy giant CVS' 2016 preferred formulary list leaked online, and Amitiza wasn't on it. It had been on this year's formulary, but CVS knocked it off in favor of Allergan's (AGN) Linzess.Nonetheless, Guggenheim analyst Louise Chen raised her price target on Sucampo to 27 from 23 and affirmed her buy rating.""Sucampo still expects mid-to-high single-digit growth for Amitiza despite Amitiza being put on CVS exclusion list; Amitiza has also had some formulary wins and the negotiations on reimbursement are still ongoing,"" Chen wrote in a research note Wednesday.Sucampo stock has been volatile since emerging from a cup base in mid-July, and the volatility continued on the stock market today. Shares shot up 19% to a new high of 25.70 early, then reversed to fall as low as 20.02. The stock is up 0.7% to 21.73 at midday. The stock boasts a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning Sucampo tops 99% of all other stocks based on a range of key fundamental and technical factors.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

The biotech revival began prior to Celgene's (CELG) 7% jump Wednesday on its $7.2 billion buy of Receptos (RCPT). Celgene is extended past a 121.57 cup-with-handle buy point.But Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still in play from a 116.93 entry after finding support at its 10-week moving average. The move didn't create a new buy opportunity, since it occurred below the buy point. But the stock is within the 5% buy zone.Also in buy range is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), trading just above a 554.10 flat-base buy point. The pattern is late stage, which is not surprising given the eye drug maker's 76% advance the past year.United Therapeutics (UTHR) hasn't yet broken out, but it's nearing a 190.39 buy point of a late-stage flat base.

152,AGN,"Shares of generic-drug giant Allergan (AGN), formerly know as Actavis, cleared a 315.10 cup-with-handle entry Monday. Volume was modestly above average. Allergan's latest base corrected a mild 12%, but is late stage. The stock's relative strength line touched a new high as it broke out, which adds confirmation to the move.
"
153,AGN,"Allergan will report Q2 earnings before the open on Aug. 6. Analysts are looking for per-share earnings to climb 28% to $4.39 on sales of $5.72 billion, up 117%. Sales estimates are boosted by the recent Allergan acquisition.
"
154,AGN,"Also from the generic-drug camp, Mallinckrodt (MNK) is tracking sideways in a consolidation that dates back to March. In May the stock cleared a short handle buy point at 130.35, but reversed lower and triggered an 8% loss sell signal a few weeks later. The handle can only be seen on a daily chart. For now, Mallinckrodt faces a test of resistance at its 50-day moving average.
"
155,AGN,"From the biotech group, Celgene (CELG) briefly cleared a 121.57 handle buy point intraday, but retreated by the close. Volume was light.

163,AGN,"While drugs for treating and curing hepatitis C have made one biotech company the envy of the industry, another biotech — Celgene — is poised to break ahead of its peer pack over the next few years.
"
164,AGN,"Celgene's (CELG) sales and profit growth is seen rising in double digits through at least 2019 from multiple drugs for multiple disorders.
"
165,AGN,"Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the biotech firm behind hepatitis C drug Harvoni and its predecessor Sovaldi — is expected to see earnings slow to low single digits over that time starting in 2016 as patients cure out of the liver virus.
"
166,AGN,"Other big-cap biotechs, such as Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), will also fall far short of Celgene's expected growth rate, analysts say.
"
167,AGN,"""Celgene has the best top-line growth in all of large biotech right now and will have the fastest revenue and earnings growth over the next five years,"" said Michael Yee, managing director and analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
"
168,AGN,"'Next Major Mover'?
"
169,AGN,"Piper Jaffray analysts told clients in a recent research report that Celgene is ""positioned to be a next major mover among large-cap biotech stocks.""
"
170,AGN,"They noted that Celgene is a returning name ""as a top large-cap pick for us."" Its shares have climbed 19% this year.
"
171,AGN,"Celgene has been especially active in developing drugs for various cancers and immune-inflammatory diseases.
"
172,AGN,"Two drugs that fight at least one common disease, multiple myeloma, are among its fastest growing.
"
173,AGN,"The first, Revlimid, is Celgene's top-selling drug, with $1.44 billion in sales in the second quarter, 19% higher than a year earlier. The oral drug is used to treat anemia and multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood that affects plasma cells.
"
174,AGN,"Sales of Pomalyst, similar to Revlimid but more potent, increased 46% over last year to $235 million, making it the fastest growing of the company's current lineup. The drug launched in Japan in June.
"
175,AGN,"Other drugs currently generating revenue for Celgene include Abraxane, which treats advanced cancers in the breast, lungs and pancreas; Vidaza, which helps bone marrow produce healthier blood cells; and Otezla, a pill for treating psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis.
"
176,AGN,"With sales in the second quarter up 13% from the prior year, to $244 million, Abraxane is one of Celgene's slower-growing drugs.
"
177,AGN,"Goldman Sachs analyst Terence Flynn noted that it ""continues to face competition in breast and lung cancer,"" though its share in treating pancreatic cancer in the U.S., now at 50%, has been growing.
"
178,AGN,"Analysts expect new indications and geographic expansion to keep Abraxane from petering out.
"
179,AGN,"Sales of Otezla, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in March 2014, totaled $90 million in Q2, up 49% from Q1.
"
180,AGN,"Total revenue in the quarter rose 22% to $2.28 billion. Analysts expect full-year revenue to rise 21% to $9.3 billion. Earnings are seen growing 29% to $4.78 per share and rising another 24% in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
181,AGN,"But there's a lot more to come from other drugs percolating in the wings. In Celgene's Q2 report in late July, CEO Bob Hugin said that new transactions with AstraZeneca (AZN), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Receptos (RCPT) would likely speed up earnings growth, starting in 2019.
"
182,AGN,"The biggest deal, announced mid-July and valued at $7.2 billion, is Celgene's pending acquisition of Receptos, a biotech firm whose lead drug, Ozanimod, has shown good results in treating ulcerative colitis and relapsing multiple sclerosis.
"
183,AGN,"Biggest Biotech Mergers
"
184,AGN,"If a higher bid doesn't thwart the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter, it would be one of the largest mergers and acquisitions in the biotech/drug industry this year, after AbbVie's (ABBV) $21 billion bid for Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Alexion 's (ALXN) $8.4 billion agreement to merge with Synageva BioPharma (GEVA).
"
185,AGN,"Celgene's offer for Receptos, amounting to $232 per share, expires August 24.
"
186,AGN,"Receptos' oral pill Ozanimod could generate around $2 billion in annual revenue for ulcerative colitis alone, plus another $1 billion for MS, Yee says. He puts peak sales in total at $5 billion.
"
187,AGN,"Phase three data for MS is expected in 2017 and for ulcerative colitis in 2018.
"
188,AGN,"Another oral drug, which Celgene acquired last year in a $710 million licensing deal with Dublin, Ireland-based Nogra Pharma, could generate $1 billion as well, Yee says. Known as GED-0301, it treats Crohn's disease. Phase three trials are expected to start in Q3, later than initially planned.
"
189,AGN,"""They have a very robust pipeline of partnerships and new growth drivers, with multiple billion-dollar opportunities over the next five years,"" Yee said.
"
190,AGN,"Earlier this summer, Celgene announced a 10-year collaboration with Juno to develop and commercialize immunotherapies for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases.
"
191,AGN,"Celgene will pay $150 million upfront and buy 9.1 million shares of Juno's stock, at $93 per share. It also has the right to take up to a 30% stake in Juno.
"
192,AGN,"But it's not all full speed ahead. One ""overhang"" on Celgene's stock, notes Flynn, remains the potentially negative impact of a patent dispute that could shave off some of the years when Revlimid is patent-protected.
"
193,AGN,"Celgene is in litigation with Allergan (AGN) over some Revlimid patents that extend through 2019 and 2026. A key challenge is on a patent that now expires in 2026. Pretrial hearings are underway.

Allergan (AGN), which Actavis acquired in March before taking its name, was best known for its anti-wrinkle injection Botox, which it supplemented with a line of facial-aesthetics products, including Juvederm and SkinMedica.
"
198,AGN,"""Kybella is an exciting new product that offers patients the first and only clinically proven, nonsurgical treatment for submental fullness,"" Allergan CEO Brent Saunders said in a statement. ""Kybella is also a pivotal entry point for expanding the use of facial aesthetic products in men, while Kythera's setipiprant (anti-hair-loss) development program can drive additional long-term value.""
"
199,AGN,"Allergan is paying $75 a share for Kythera, a 24% premium on Tuesday's closing price and double Kythera's stock price at the start of the year. Under the terms, 80% will be paid in cash. Kythera stock rose 22% Wednesday, while Allergan stock rose a fraction.

229,AGN,"Eagle Pharmaceuticals has soared to new heights on Wall Street after signing a key licensing pact that enhances the company's prospects to hit the market soon with a big money-making drug.Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) stock has leapt 207% since Feb. 17, when the company announced that it had inked an exclusive license agreement with Cephalon, a wholly owned subsidiary of Israeli drug giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), for Eagle's bendamustine hydrochloride (HCl) rapid-infusion product. It treats patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).What's In The Teva DealTeva will be responsible for all of the product's U.S. commercial activities, including promotion and distribution. Eagle is responsible for obtaining all regulatory approvals, conducting post-approval clinical studies, if required, and initially supplying the drug product to Teva.Under terms of the pact, Eagle received an upfront cash payment of $30 million, which was recognized as income, and is eligible to receive up to $90 million in additional milestone payments.Besides the milestone payments, Eagle says it will get ""double-digit"" (percentage) royalties on the net sales of the product, assuming Food and Drug Administration approval.""The draw for investors is Eagle has a very credible partner in Teva, and it has the ability to deliver over $100 million in royalties in 2016,"" William Blair analyst Tim Lugo told IBD.Lugo estimates the royalty payments Eagle will get from Teva to start at 20% of the product's sales.Eagle is focused on developing and commercializing injectable drug products, primarily in the critical care and oncology areas, that improve on existing drugs.""We go out and speak to stakeholders like physicians, nurses and doctors, and find out where the gaps are in products and what needs to be improved,"" CEO and founder Scott Tarriff told IBD. ""We reformulate the drugs, and hopefully we bring drugs to the market our customers are asking for, and hopefully we're improving patients' outcomes.""Drug Introduction StrategyEagle's strategy is to introduce its products no later than the first generic competitor of the branded reference product, says a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Eagle's bendamustine rapid-infusion product is an improved formulation of Teva's bendamustine HCl product, Treanda.""We expect that Teva will convert nearly all the (Treanda) products in the market to our Eagle formulation,"" Tarriff said.How is Eagle's product better than Treanda? Eagle's product can be administered in approximately 10 minutes in a low-volume, 50-milliliter admixture vs. Treanda's 500-milliliter admixture, which requires an infusion that lasts 30 to 60 minutes, Tarriff says.Among the benefits of Eagle's product is less ""chair time"" for the patient and less nursing time required, Tarriff adds.The FDA accepted a New Drug Application, or NDA, filing with a Dec. 13, 2015, expected decision date on whether to approve the rapid-infusion bendamustine product to treat patients with CLL and patients with indolent B-cell NHL that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen.Eagle uses the FDA's NDA regulatory pathway Section 505(b)(2), which ""expressly permits the FDA to rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant such as published literature or the agency's finding of safety and/or effectiveness of a previously approved drug product,"" according to the FDA website.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted a new patent pertaining to the rapid-infusion bendamustine product, Eagle announced last month. The patent expires in March 2033.The product has received orphan drug designations for both CLL and indolent B-cell NHL, and therefore may be eligible for seven years of exclusivity upon approval, Eagle said in a press release.Tarriff estimates that the U.S. market for Treanda is $750 million.Tarriff says that since its founding in 2007, Eagle has been developing drugs. That has changed with the agreement with Teva, which Tarriff calls a ""big breakthrough.""""We are transitioning from a development company to a commercial company,"" said Tarriff. ""Teva will use (Eagle's bendamustine rapid-infusion product) as their own life cycle for their product.""Using A Capital InfusionLugo says that the agreement with Teva is a ""game changer"" for Eagle.""The company should have significant royalties, starting in 2016,"" he said. ""The question on the Street is: How is the company going to deploy that capital?""Eagle, which went public in February 2014, turned its first profit in 2015's first quarter. The company earned $1.31 a share vs. a loss of 36 cents a year earlier. Revenue jumped 625% to $36.3 million.Lugo says that the $30 million upfront cash payment from Teva drove Eagle's profit.However, he adds, ""the profit won't be sustainable"" until the company gains FDA approval for its bendamustine rapid-infusion product. The approval should come in the 2015 fourth quarter and drive profitability in 2016, Lugo says.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to show full-year 2015 earnings of 75 cents a share. They expect 2016 earnings to increase 653% and see a 9% rise in 2017.Eagle's Treatment PortfolioEagle has a portfolio of six drugs. It has three drugs on the market, one of which — Ryanodex, for injectable suspension to treat a rare, life-threatening condition called malignant hyperthermia — the FDA approved last summer.The FDA designated Ryanodex an orphan drug for malignant hyperthermia in 2013. The FDA has granted seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S. to Ryanodex for treating this condition, Eagle announced in February.First quarter Ryanodex sales of $1.6 million were $1 million higher than the prior quarter, ""which reflects the successful execution of the product launch last fall and the ongoing efforts of our sales force,"" said Tarriff in a press release.Eagle is researching the potential for Ryanodex to be applied to exertional heat stroke.Eagle also has filed three NDAs with the FDA for other drugs and is working on a clinical trial for yet another drug.Lugo says that while Eagle's bendamustine rapid-infusion product is a ""key drug,"" the company has several other drugs in its pipeline ""which could be as promising.""Eagle is a part of IBD's Medical-Generic Drugs industry group. It has an 85 Composite Rating out of a possible 99. Other members of the group include Allergan (AGN), which leads the group with a Composite Rating of 99, and Mylan (MYL), which has a 96 Composite Rating.

256,AGN,"When the major stock indexes around the world get woozy, how should stock leaders act? Expect the declines to be a lot sharper. One reason: They usually have a lot of gains to give back.When an international market is falling hard, however, the keen speculator gains an opportunity.The opportunity is to see which stocks fall less than their peers, get buying support at important price levels, and conduct quieter trading on down days and down weeks in price.Once a market correction has ended and a fresh rally has begun, the stronger stocks are in much better position to complete bases and break out.The swift decline in Chinese stock markets has placed them in bear market territory. By Tuesday's close, the Shanghai composite has fallen as much as 31% below its 52-week peak of 5178.19.The Shenzhen composite index, viewed by many as China's tech-heavy Nasdaq, finished Tuesday's trade at 1932.83, 39% below its June 12 high of 3156.96.With those kinds of declines, one would not be surprised to see an e-commerce powerhouse like Alibaba (BABA) down a lot. The stock made a nice reversal Tuesday and closed down just 0.61 at 79.62, but only after poking at new lows following its IPO last year at 68.It's now 33% below a 120 peak.Will it take months for Alibaba to recover near its highs and possibly break out again? Of course.Baozun (BZUN), featured here in June, got trampled Tuesday. The online retail service expert for Chinese websites dropped 22% in heavy trade to 7.42, well below its May 21 Nasdaq debut at 10.Baozun has posted five straight quarters of earnings. This year, the Street sees full-year profit up 62% to 13 cents a share.Vipshop (VIPS), one of the biggest winners on the U.S. market in 2013, is trying to bottom. The online flash sale champ is 33% below a 30.72 peak. If it can limit the decline to 33%-35%, the odds of a solid base to form go up.Israel's inverter system maker SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) has collapsed below its recently formed 50-day moving average. Watch for a potential new base to emerge. In fiscal 2015 ended in June, SolarEdge is seen posting its first-ever profit of 54 cents a share, then boost it by 120% to $1.19 in fiscal 2016.Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), France's Criteo (CRTO) and Allergan (AGN) of Ireland have shown far milder declines.

Valeant shares shot up to a new high last week after it gave upbeat preliminary results.
"
458,AGN,"Generic and specialty drugmaker Actavis agreed to acquire Allergan for more than $66 billion on Monday, potentially creating a pharmaceutical giant with $23 billion in annual sales and a market cap around $147 billion.
"
459,AGN,"Actavis (ACT) will pay $129.22 plus 0.3683 Actavis share for each share of Allergan (AGN). That's equal to $220.54 based on Monday's closing price. It is appreciably above the hostile bid that Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) put out in June, which, based on Valeant's current valuation, would be worth about $180 a share.
"
460,AGN,"Actavis stock rose 2% to 247.94. Allergan climbed 5% to 209.
"
461,AGN,"Allergan's board maintained all along that Valeant's offer ""grossly undervalues"" the company, which has achieved a strong IBD EPS Rank of 93 with its sales of its flagship Botox and various other aesthetic, dermatologic and opthalmic products. The board also said that Valeant would slash Allergan's research and development budget, destroying its longer-term value.
"
462,AGN,"Although Valeant recently hinted that it might raise its offer for Allergan, Valeant's statement on the deal Monday seemed to raise the white flag.
"
463,AGN,"Valeant Can't Justify Price
"
464,AGN,"""We have seen the announcement that Allergan and Actavis have made, and while we will review any such agreement in determining our course of action, Valeant cannot justify to its own shareholders paying a price of $219 or more per share for Allergan,"" Valeant CEO Michael Pearson said.
"
465,AGN,"Valeant stock rose 2% 136.65.
"
466,AGN,"Although Actavis says that it expects to realize $1.8 billion in annual cost savings from the deal, just $400 million of it is slated to come from R&D — less than half of the cuts that Valeant had proposed. On the conference call discussing the merger, Allergan CEO David Pyott said that the planned $1.7 billion in annual R&D spending is ""real money"" and that he believes Actavis is committed to it.
"
467,AGN,"""Historically, if you look at the spend by Actavis on its specialty-brand business, their R&D intensity has been pretty close to ours,"" Pyott said. He added that while Actavis has no opthalmology business at present, he'd admired CEO Brent Saunders' leadership at contact-lens giant Bausch & Lomb, which Saunders headed from 2010 to 2013.
"
468,AGN,"For Actavis, the deal offers double-digit earnings accretion in the first 12 months after the deal closes, expected in Q2 2015. Saunders expects 10% annual organic revenue growth in the foreseeable future, with added revenue from small acquisitions like its recent deals for Furiex Pharmaceuticals and Durata Therapeutics (DRTX). He set an ""aspirational"" earnings target of $25 a share in 2017, up from analysts' consensus of $13.55 for this year.
"
469,AGN,"Overlaps And Synergies
"
470,AGN,"Saunders said on the call that the two firms overlap in the areas of dermatology, neurology and urology. The latter two lately have been providing new revenues for Botox, which has been approved to treat migraines and overactive bladder. He also believes that Actavis' formidable primary-care salesforce can broaden the market for some of Allergan's opthalmology drugs, such as Restasis for dry-eye syndrome.
"
471,AGN,"Another source of efficiency will be the tax rate. Allergan is based in Irvine, Calif., while Actavis is domiciled in Dublin, thanks to a tax-inversion deal last year. Saunders says that Actavis will also move some of Allergan's intellectual property offshore, which should keep the overall tax rate down at 15%.
"

474,AGN,"Leerink's Jason Gerberry agreed, though he was less convinced by the $25 EPS in 2017. His own estimate is $23.27.Generic and specialty drugmaker Actavis agreed to acquire Allergan for more than $66 billion on Monday, potentially creating a pharmaceutical giant with $23 billion in annual sales and a market cap around $147 billion.Actavis (ACT) will pay $129.22 plus 0.3683 Actavis share for each share of Allergan (AGN). That's equal to $220.54 based on Monday's closing price. It is appreciably above the hostile bid that Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) put out in June, which, based on Valeant's current valuation, would be worth about $180 a share.Actavis stock rose 2% to 247.94. Allergan climbed 5% to 209.Allergan's board maintained all along that Valeant's offer ""grossly undervalues"" the company, which has achieved a strong IBD EPS Rank of 93 with its sales of its flagship Botox and various other aesthetic, dermatologic and opthalmic products. The board also said that Valeant would slash Allergan's research and development budget, destroying its longer-term value.Although Valeant recently hinted that it might raise its offer for Allergan, Valeant's statement on the deal Monday seemed to raise the white flag.Valeant Can't Justify Price""We have seen the announcement that Allergan and Actavis have made, and while we will review any such agreement in determining our course of action, Valeant cannot justify to its own shareholders paying a price of $219 or more per share for Allergan,"" Valeant CEO Michael Pearson said.Valeant stock rose 2% 136.65.Although Actavis says that it expects to realize $1.8 billion in annual cost savings from the deal, just $400 million of it is slated to come from R&D — less than half of the cuts that Valeant had proposed. On the conference call discussing the merger, Allergan CEO David Pyott said that the planned $1.7 billion in annual R&D spending is ""real money"" and that he believes Actavis is committed to it.""Historically, if you look at the spend by Actavis on its specialty-brand business, their R&D intensity has been pretty close to ours,"" Pyott said. He added that while Actavis has no opthalmology business at present, he'd admired CEO Brent Saunders' leadership at contact-lens giant Bausch & Lomb, which Saunders headed from 2010 to 2013.For Actavis, the deal offers double-digit earnings accretion in the first 12 months after the deal closes, expected in Q2 2015. Saunders expects 10% annual organic revenue growth in the foreseeable future, with added revenue from small acquisitions like its recent deals for Furiex Pharmaceuticals and Durata Therapeutics (DRTX). He set an ""aspirational"" earnings target of $25 a share in 2017, up from analysts' consensus of $13.55 for this year.Overlaps And SynergiesSaunders said on the call that the two firms overlap in the areas of dermatology, neurology and urology. The latter two lately have been providing new revenues for Botox, which has been approved to treat migraines and overactive bladder. He also believes that Actavis' formidable primary-care salesforce can broaden the market for some of Allergan's opthalmology drugs, such as Restasis for dry-eye syndrome.Another source of efficiency will be the tax rate. Allergan is based in Irvine, Calif., while Actavis is domiciled in Dublin, thanks to a tax-inversion deal last year. Saunders says that Actavis will also move some of Allergan's intellectual property offshore, which should keep the overall tax rate down at 15%.Rumors of a deal had been circulating on Wall Street for a couple of months, with most analysts speculating a price more than Valeant's but less than the final offer.""We estimated a deal for Allergan would be meaningfully accretive to ACT shareholders at a $215 price with synergies of (about) $1 billion,"" wrote Sterne Agee analyst Shibani Malhotra in a note Monday.

"
520,AGN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) continues to grow at a steady clip on its blockbuster drug Soliris, a so-called orphan drug used to treat a rare blood disease. At $400 a dose, it's pricey but effective and widely used. Alexion's stock jumped more than 7% on Oct. 23 to 185.92 as it broke out of an eight-month base on strong third-quarter results.
"
521,AGN,"On an earnings call, CEO Leonard Bell said that Alexion had completed the last phase of its rolling FDA submission for approval of a second drug, asfotase alfa, a treatment for genetic bone disease. Alexion rose fractionally in Tuesday trading on the stock market today.

"
525,AGN,"The company lifted its full-year profit outlook above consensus views. The beat and the raised forecast came largely from strong performance of Defitelio, a specialty drug that treats a rare condition afflicting people undergoing stem-cell transplantation.

"
528,AGN,"The biotech guided full-year revenue at $7.6 billion, up 17% from the prior year and in line with analyst views. But it trimmed its 2014 outlook for its flagship cancer drug Abraxane to $850 million, up 31%. Investors weren't worried and took Celgene's stock up 6% for the day. Celgene, whose stock is on the IBD Leaderboard list of top-rated stocks, fell 1.6% Tuesday.

"
530,AGN,"Allergan shares rose 1% to 195.12 on Tuesday, hitting a new high, as investors see a greater chance of a Valeant takeover.

539,AGN,"Mylan (MYL) and company President Rajiv Malik were among those named in a sweeping lawsuit Tuesday, in which 46 state attorneys general expanded a complaint charging 18 drugmakers with what prosecutors called a ""mind-blowing"" scheme to fix generic drug prices.XThe newly expanded complaint alleges that the drugmakers colluded to fix the prices of pharmaceuticals by communicating at trade shows, conferences and other events, as well as through email, phone and text messages.All together, the 18 companies worked together to falsely inflate the prices of 15 drugs to treat glaucoma, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, anxiety and asthma as well as several other conditions, the attorneys general allege.""We allege in this complaint that the defendant companies' collusion was so pervasive that it essentially eliminated competition from the market for these 15 drugs in its entirety,"" Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said in a prepared statement.Jepsen, who is leading the charge, described the conspiracies alleged as ""mind-blowing.""Mylan says it stands by Malik and has ""found no evidence of price fixing on the part of Mylan or its employees."" Mylan said it's still waiting for the attorneys general to share the information intended to substantiate the new allegations.""Mylan has deep faith in the integrity of its president, Rajiv Malik, and stands behind him fully,"" the firm said in a prepared statement. ""Mylan and Rajiv Malik both intend to defend this case vigorously, and we look forward to the opportunity to present a full defense.""IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have largely had mixed reports this quarter, though Celgene's sales miss on lower-than-expected sales of Otezla caused the stock to slide hard. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at earnings season thus far.In 2015, generic drug sales in the U.S. were estimated at $74.5 billion and, today, the generic drug industry accounts for about 88% of all prescriptions written in the U.S.Along with Mylan, the lawsuit also includes generic giant Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA). The new complaint added Actavis Pharma — acquired by Teva from Allergan (AGN) — Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz unit.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Mylan toppled 6.6%, near 35.10, as the broad generic drugs group plunged a collective 1.7%. Another generic firm named in the complaint, Lannett (LCI), led the downward slide, falling 13.7% to close at 19.90.Along with Mylan's Malik, Satish Mehta, chief executive and managing director of privately held Emcure Pharmaceuticals, the parent company of Heritage Pharmaceuticals, was the other individual named in the complaint.Earlier this year, two former Heritage executives admitted to a price-fixing scheme between April 2013 and December 2015 involving a generic antibiotic and a diabetes drug. Heritage was among six drugmakers named in the initial lawsuit in late 2016.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat expects a series of settlements. He had originally expected Teva to pay $300 million to $700 million in damages if it ultimately settles and Mylan to pay $380 million to $770 million.RELATED:Generic Drugmakers Crash After Perrigo Searched In Antitrust ProbeCelgene CEO: Drug-Pricing Debate Hinges On Incentives For InnovationDOJ Charges Pharma Execs With Price-Fixing; Teva, Mylan Stocks Fall

540,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) is advancing a hepatitis drug into Phase 3 testing that likely won't get Food and Drug Administration approval, an analyst predicted Friday.XBut Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler is still constructive on Allergan stock on which she has a buy rating and 267 price target. At the close on the stock market today, Allergan lifted 1% to finish at 204.65 despite disappointing data for its drug called cenicriviroc to treat what is known as NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.In a Phase 2 trial, cenicriviroc missed its key goal. Over the course of two years, patients treated with cenicriviroc failed to achieve a statistically significant improvement in fibrosis of the liver as compared with patients who received a placebo.The data included patients treated for two years with cenicriviroc and those who switched to Allergan's drug after a year on a placebo. Patients with higher fibrosis before starting cenicriviroc ultimately ""had better outcomes during the two-year treatment period.""Allergan plans to release full results during an upcoming medical conference. Cenicriviroc proved to be safe compared with the placebo, the firm said in a news release. The most common side effects were diarrhea, headache and fatigue.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has an IBD Composite Rating of 48 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it trades in the bottom half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated drugmakers.Patients being enrolled in a Phase 3 trial have more serious fibrosis of their livers, Koffler said. Allergan plans to follow patients over a five-year period. The goal is a reduction in fibrosis without worsening of NASH at one year.""But we don't see how this is realistic because the trial requires a liver biopsy at five years, which may at this point be deemed unethical by local institutional review boards,"" Koffler wrote in a note to clients.Koffler expects the cenicriviroc disappointment was already baked into Allergan stock which has toppled more than 20% since hitting a 2017 high in late July. Allergan has traded well below its 50-day moving average since early August.""To us, the bottom line here is that this molecule (cenicriviroc) is unlikely to make it to approval,"" she said. ""The only upside is we had very little in the model for NASH so there is minimal impact to our valuation.""Allergan still has a promising portfolio in migraine and depression, she wrote. Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted Allergan is expected to provide data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials for drugs to treat chronic and acute migraines in the first half of 2018.RELATED:Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues Unlike Other Pharma CompaniesTeva And Mylan Under Pressure As Rivalries Loom For Key DrugsWhy Allergan Is Stagnant Despite Beating Views, Raising Outlook

541,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) stock tanked Monday after a federal judge invalidated patents covering eye-drug Restasis, in a dispute pitting Allergan against a group of generic drugmakers led by Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL).XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan toppled 3.5% to finish at 198.41. Teva fell 1.8% to close at 14.71, as Mylan lifted a fraction to end the regular trading session at 38.18.Judge William Bryson said the ideas covered by the Restasis patents were too obvious to protect, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. Bryson tended to agree with Allergan that there would be a case for infringement if the patents were held to be valid.Allergan pledged in a news release to appeal the decision. The ruling invalidates four patents on Restasis. To date, none of the proposed generic versions of Restasis have received approval and none are able to launch in the market, the firm noted.""Allergan remains committed to vigorously defending the intellectual property of our products, which allows us to continue to invest in developing and bringing forward new medicines for millions of patients,"" Chief Legal Officer Robert Bailey said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has an IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it outperforms just over half of all stocks tracked in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of better-performing drugmakers.This followed Allergan's move last month to transfer the rights to these patents to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe — a legal play that's been called creative and controversial as it takes advantage of the Native American tribe's sovereign status.Bryson had ""serious concerns about the legitimacy of the tactic,"" Raffat said.""Allergan purports to have sold the patents to the tribe, but in reality it has paid the tribe to allow Allergan to purchase — or perhaps more precisely, to rent — the tribe's sovereign immunity,"" he said. If successful, this method could give patent defendants a new method of defeating challenges.Raffat expects a final decision based on Allergan's appeal late into 2018. He suggests that Allergan could seek an injunction against rival generics.RELATED:Why Allergan's Hepatitis Drug Likely Won't Get FDA ApprovalGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tTeva And Mylan Under Pressure As Rivalries Loom For Key Drugs

542,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) was already facing a ""public relations backlash"" after transferring patent rights for its Restasis eye medication to a Native American tribe, when a judge on Monday then invalidated four of those patents.XNow, Allergan faces an uphill battle in regaining credibility on Wall Street, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a note to clients. He cut his price target on Allergan to 243 from 266, but kept his outperform rating.""We generally have been fans of the Allergan management team, but find it challenging to defend the steps that were taken with the patent agreement,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""We believe it will take some time for the management team to regain the credibility it has lost through this process.""The process involved transferring the rights to its Restasis patents to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in September to avoid a patent challenge. As a Native American tribe, St. Regis Mohawk has sovereign immunity. But the play has been called both creative as well as controversial.On Monday, a judge invalidated four patents covering Restasis. Judge William Bryson said the ideas covered by the patents were too obvious to protect. He also expressed serious concerns regarding the legitimacy of the transfer to St. Regis Mohawk.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has an IBD Composite Rating of 54 out of a best-possible 99. It lags top players like AbbVie with a CR of 98, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other high-ranking drug stocks.Even before Monday, Allergan stock had lost 12% of its value following the agreement, Divan wrote. The loss in district court also does nothing to ""erase the public-relations backlash the company has suffered from going through with the agreement in the first place.""Combined with a push by the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic drugs at a faster clip, Divan assumes a generic launch of a Restasis drug by mid-2018, up from his earlier view for 2022. Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) are among those working on generic versions of the drug.For longer-term investors, Divan sees 198 as an attractive entry point to the stock. In the short term, catalysts include third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1 and the potential for a guidance update with and without generic Restasis competition.""If guidance is not provided on the Nov. 1 call (at least at a high level), investors will likely have to wait until the January time frame for the company's 2018 guidance,"" Divan said.Data readouts include a late-stage trial in treating acute migraines and a midstage trial of a drug to prevent migraines in the first half of 2018. Both belong to a class of drugs called anti-CGRPs. Teva, Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) are also working in this arena.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan slipped 0.3% to close at 197.78, after ending Monday trades down 3.5%.RELATED:Allergan Tanks After Judge Invalidates Restasis PatentsWhy Allergan's Hepatitis Drug Likely Won't Get FDA ApprovalGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

544,AGN,"Everyone knows high prescription drug prices are a problem, but except for pharma stockholders, few people may realize that price cuts are rippling through the generic side of the industry.Take a look at recent events: Tumbling U.S. generic drug prices wiped out billions of dollars in market value in August for the likes of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Mylan (MYL) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY). That compounded the industry's woes after a brutal second-quarter earnings season.The relatively small contingent of pharma companies that produce cheaper versions of brand-name drugs is getting broadsided by players in the distribution chain. For one, leading wholesalers are squeezing drugmakers for lower prices to undercut one another in the battle for pharmacy contracts. Meanwhile, group-purchasing organizations are consolidating and grabbing onto more negotiating power, representing a hurdle for generics which comprise a large chunk of those purchases.Analysts say it could be six to nine months before prices stabilize — if they ever recover at all. While that means lower prices for patients, drugmakers are taking the brunt of the battle. Prices have clearly deteriorated in the aftermath of contract negotiations, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an Aug. 12 audio report.""And the question really is: What does that mean going forward?,"" he said. ""Because if you look at the way Mylan and Teva stocks have behaved and you look at the way their estimates have been revised, it clearly suggests a material worsening in business.""Teva stock lost 50.7% in August, though it has recovered 7.9% this month, and the No. 1 drugmaker by market cap is close to losing that status. Since July 31, Teva's market value has fallen by nearly half to $17.56 billion. Comparatively, Mylan trails at a $16.85 billion cap.Teva isn't the only one feeling the pain. Selling pressures shaved $4 billion off Mylan's market capitalization in August, and its shares have toppled 19% since the beginning of August after particularly disheartening quarterly reports. As a whole, Investor's Business Daily's Generic Drugs industry group is down 6.6% year to date after nearing a four-year low in August. It's ranked No. 160 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.The underlying cause of the price erosion stems back to 2013-14, when drugmakers spiked prices based on shortages, monopolies and other opportunities, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan told IBD.""If something was $10 per day, you would see it up to $15 per day because you're the only one making it and there was no competition,"" he said. ""If there's no one else producing it, you have more flexibility (in how you price a drug).""""Now that card is gone,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 5 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom 5% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. The top-ranked generic drugmaker is Ani Pharmaceuticals, which has a middling CR of 61. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a look at the stocks.That's not only because competition is more fierce, it's also that generics face another adversary: heavy scrutiny from the media and in Washington. In January, then President-elect Donald Trump accused drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" in their pricing. Now, he's aiming to use competition to undercut prices.Complicating matters, some drugmakers — Teva, Mylan and Perrigo (PRGO) included — are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for alleged generic drug price fixing. Last month, two members of Congress sent letters to makers of multiple sclerosis drugs to probe rising drug prices.That's yet another wrench in the generic story, Divan says.""Investors are looking for cleaner stories,"" he said. ""And there's too much unknown here.""Teva and Mylan, on their second-quarter earnings calls, projected price erosion in the high-single digits for the rest of 2017. Mylan specified that erosion would take place in its North American generics unit. That followed lackluster quarterly reports from both. Mylan's North American sales declined 9%, while Teva's numbers were helped by the acquisition of Actavis Generics.Both Teva and Mylan cut their 2017 forecasts. On their calls, executives from the two companies acknowledged an increase in generic approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was champing at sales. New FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is looking to speed up generic approvals even more to help ease drug prices, which is in line with Trump's vision.""During the quarter we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth generics,"" Mylan President Rajiv Malik said. ""Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first generics nor for more complex and niche products.""As a result, Mylan said it would delay launching generic versions of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) asthma drug Advair and Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone amid the ""uncertain U.S. regulatory environment.""Teva's former interim chief executive, Yitzhak Peterburg, cited customer consolidation, an increase in FDA generic-drug approvals and products that were either delayed or subject to more competition for ""accelerated price erosion and decreased volume"" in the second quarter.FDA approval complications were cited across second-quarter reports, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in an Aug. 17 report to clients. Though generic approvals are catching some wind under the FDA's new goal, complex generics — a molecular copy that also has a complex active ingredient, formulation, route or device combination — have been subject to administrative delays.Koffler sees Mylan as best-positioned to rebound despite its tie to the challenged generics sector. The firm has a pipeline of complex generics and biosimilars, guidance is now more realistic and it's less levered than its peers, meaning it could pursue acquisitions of companies whose stocks have dropped.""The risks are that pricing pressure in the U.S. may not abate, and the overall profitability of the company is declining as it expands into lower-margin international markets that now comprise a greater percentage of its revenue,"" she said.A few drugmakers seemingly escaped the second-quarter malaise. But those reports were somewhat misleading, CFRA analyst Jeffrey Loo told IBD.Perrigo issued a beat-and-raise that helped its stock fly 16% in a day. Though Perrigo's generic drug sales toppled 13% year over year, its separate consumer health segments had smaller 4% and 9% declines in the U.S. and internationally, respectively.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) crushed second-quarter profit views, though sales came in a hair light. The firm also cut its 2017 revenue target, but kept its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization forecast.""A lot of people consider Valeant as a generic play, but the bulk of the business is now Bausch & Lomb"" eye-care products, Loo said. In the quarter, revenue from Bausch & Lomb as well as Salix, its gastrointestinal-drugs division, represented 73% of total sales. Its smaller generics unit, on the other hand, fell by 33%.""If you exclude Valeant from the generic space and Perrigo, none of these generic drugmakers really bucked the trend in the second quarter,"" Loo said. ""I think that it (pressure on the group) will likely continue going forward for the next two quarters.""Teva leads the U.S. generic drugs sector, but it's also under the most pressure, Steven Schoenfeld, chief information officer of BlueStar Indexes, told IBD. BlueStar Indexes tracks Israeli equities. Cybersecurity play Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) is now bigger than Teva in terms of market cap, at $18.18 billion.Former Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman stepped down in February amid a bribery investigation. Since then, management has been shaky and the firm's strategy has been out of kilter, Schoenfeld says. This followed its loss of several key patents protecting MS drug Copaxone in January. In September, Teva named former Lundbeck and Novo Nordisk (NVO) veteran Kare Schultz as its new chief executive officer.Still, Teva is splitting its focus between generic and branded drugs, Schoenfeld says.""They need a strategy,"" he said. ""They need to see if they want to expand or continue to invest in blockbuster drugs. They've now got some early-stage Alzheimer's assets and other drugs. They have to decide if they're going to be X percentage generic and, if so, do the profits go into innovation?""Meanwhile, debt has rocketed and investors are no longer sure the $40.5 billion Teva paid to acquire Actavis Generics from Allergan (AGN) was a good price, he says. As of June 30, Teva had $35.1 billion in debt, rising from $34.6 billion at the end of March.Under Schultz, Teva recently avoided a covenant violation on its debt. On Sept. 19, Teva said it amended several term loans and revolving credit facilities, ""providing Teva greater flexibility in its financial leverage ratio covenants.""The question at the forefront now is whether the U.S. generic drugs sector has hit a bottom.In recent history, Mylan has come under scrutiny for the pricing of its emergency allergy injection, EpiPen. Turing Pharmaceuticals' former chief executive, Martin Shkreli, drew criticism for spiking the price of a decades-old HIV drug. Teva is among those being looked at for MS drug prices.""Popular culture has turned against it,"" BlueStar's Schoenfeld said. ""Secular trends aren't going to go away. The market sees pricing pressure. Have these stocks priced in the worst? Teva is trading where it had major support in the 2001-03 time frame. But I wouldn't recommend anyone plunge into Teva.""Most firms are now trading at four to five times their earnings, CFRA's Loo says. Amid continuing price erosion, he sees the stocks trading sideways for the next six months. He notes there aren't many drugs going off patent in the near future, causing somewhat of a roadblock for new generics.""I would like to hope they've hit a bottom,"" he said. ""There are not that many catalysts for them going forward. You might see some buyers step in and buy shares of these companies. Four to five times earnings is an awfully attractive valuation.""RELATED:Biogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeThis Toppling Generic Drugmaker Could Be Poised For A Rebound: AnalystHow A Falling Generic Drugmaker Got An Analyst's UpgradeGeneric Drugs Are Rebound Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

545,AGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL) stocks rose Tuesday despite sustaining a price-target cut and a downgrade, respectively, following their lackluster second-quarter reports and resulting haircuts to 2017 guidance.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva inched down 0.2% to 17.01. Mylan gained 1% 30.73. Still, both stocks have traded well below their 50-day moving average this month as U.S. generic-drug makers face pressure.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler slashed her price target on Teva nearly in half to 16 from 30, though she kept a neutral rating. She sees Teva struggling to bring gross debt below $30 billion by year's end and facing upcoming competition for multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.Teva ended its second quarter with $35.1 billion in debt. It's likely struggling to ""patch together a combination of asset sales,"" operating cash flow, an Allergan (AGN) working capital settlement and a full dividend cut to bring gross debt below $30 billion this year.If that initial $5 billion debt hurdle is cleared, Teva indicated it should be able to push out the maturities on $6 billion in bank debt by refinancing, Koffler wrote in a note to clients. This may help shares, though it wouldn't solve all of Teva's problems.Generic versions of Copaxone are likely to come to the market in 2018, eroding already weak earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation, she wrote.""Longer term, we expect a decline in the remaining business and don't see anything in the branded pipeline to change this trajectory,"" she wrote. ""Teva may eventually lose its investment-grade rating as a result and further share deterioration is a possibility longer-term.""Argus analyst Jasper Hellweg downgraded Mylan to a hold rating from buy, citing its weak outlook. Mylan's guidance for adjusted income of $4.30-$4.70 per share implies a decline of 8% at the midpoint in 2017. The firm also lowered its sales view to $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion.IBD'S TAKE: One of these two top U.S. generic-drug makers could be poised for a rebound, one analyst said last week. Head to IBD's Technology page for a deep dive on which drugmaker looks stronger and why.Still, Mylan stock has been under pressure for over a year ""due to the controversy surrounding EpiPen pricing,"" Hellweg wrote in a note to clients. Earlier this month, Mylan finalized a $465 million settlement with the Justice Department over EpiPen pricing under Medicaid.The Justice Department alleged ""the company had overcharged Medicaid by classifying the EpiPen as a generic rather than a branded product,"" he wrote. ""Drugmakers are able to pay lower rebates to the government for generic drugs than for branded drugs.""Recently, the Justice Department revealed the source of its information was Sanofi (SNY). In a separate antitrust suit, Sanofi alleges that Mylan offered discounts to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers that made it more difficult for Sanofi's rival drug to get Medicaid reimbursement.The New York attorney general also is investigating Mylan's practice of selling EpiPens to schools at discounted prices in exchange for exclusive contracts, Hellweg said. Mylan has since eliminated the exclusivity provisions from these deals.Adamis Pharmaceuticals (ADMP) also is likely to take some share from Mylan's EpiPen after gaining approval for its drug Symjepi, ""which will be marketed as a low-cost alternative to the EpiPen,"" Hellweg wrote. It's also preparing a ""junior"" dose of Symjepi to compete with low-dose EpiPen.""Symjepi is smaller than the EpiPen, a potential advantage for a product that is often carried at all times by people with life-threatening allergies,"" he wrote. ""We look for the EpiPen to benefit from its established reputation.""Many consumers are likely to prefer EpiPen as an auto-injector vs. Symjepi, which is a self-administered injection, Hellweg wrote.RELATED:How A Falling Generic Drugmaker Got An Analyst's UpgradeGeneric Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

546,AGN,"Theravance Biopharma (TBPH) and Exelixis (EXEL) tick off most of the acquisition boxes for Big Pharma in an overview of the biotech merger picture, an analyst said Friday.X""Acquisition of biotech companies by pharma is an important theme for the space,"" Needham analyst Alan Carr said in a note to clients. ""We believe late development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets, in part due to reduced risk.""Of the companies Carr covers, Theravance could attract big pharmas like Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). In total, Carr counts 21 companies that could be interested in buying Theravance based on research areas, business development interest and past acquisitions.Theravance has one approved drug, an antibiotic for hard-to-treat infections. Beyond that, Exelixis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Bavarian Nordic, Biohaven Pharmaceutical (BHVN) and Progenics Pharmaceuticals (PGNX) may be attracting the interest of 18 pharmaceuticals apiece.AbbVie, AstraZeneca (AZN), Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY) and Dow stocks Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) could be the most acquisitive, based on Carr's criteria. Each has at least 20 potential targets.But some biotechs may stand a better chance of being acquired vs. others, Carr said. Since January 2014, there have been 37 acquisitions of public biotech companies involving a payment of more than $250 million upfront.More than half already had an approved drug and 78% had at least some Phase 3 data, Carr wrote. Oncology was a key target for U.S. and Japanese pharmas, while rare-disease plays are likely to be acquired at later stages.IBD'S TAKE: Last month, one of these potential acquisition targets jumped to an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 92 out of a best-possible 99. Today, it still has a rating of 90. Head to IBD Data Stories for a closer look at the stock and its catalysts.Rare diseases tend to be of interest to mid-specialty pharmas and biotechs, as traditional drugmakers are likely to avoid the drug-pricing controversy. Since January 2014, the only rare-disease firm snatched up was Actelion Pharmaceuticals by J&J.U.S. and European pharma acquired more later-stage biotechs vs. the less risk-adverse Japanese pharmas and Allergan (AGN). Big areas of interest included central nervous system, rare diseases and oncology which accounted for 22%, 19% and 16% of acquisitions, respectively.Since January 2011, there have been 235 new chemical entry approvals by the Food and Drug Administration. Of the 65 small-to-midsize biotechs which gained this type of approval, 20 (31%) have been acquired. All of them already had a drug on the market at the time of the acquisition.""Many oncology companies, but few rare disease companies were acquired,"" he said.Gilead Sciences' (GILD) acquisition of Kite Pharma (KITE) could break that approval rule. Gilead announced its plan to spend $11.9 billion to buy Kite months ahead of the expected approval date of its first drug in a blood cancer. Novartis' rival treatment was approved days later.RELATED:This Small Biotech Launched To A 9-Month High Today — Here's WhyExelixis Recovers From Bristol-Inspired Pitfall In Kidney CancerBristol Dives But 'Still Has A Chance' In Kidney Cancer: Analyst

547,AGN,"Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) remains Credit Suisse's top pick heading into the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in October, but drugmakers Allergan (AGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) also look strong, the brokerage said Monday.Around that time, Merck is expected to unveil the results of its trial, dubbed Keynote-189, testing immuno-oncology drug Keytruda plus chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer. The combo received accelerated approval in May.""We expect continued discussions around the potential uses of Keytruda while awaiting the top-line data from the confirmatory Keynote-189 study in the September/October time frame, which we expect to be positive,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said.On its second-quarter conference call in July, Merck confirmed a cyberattack could delay some products this year, saying ""full recovery from the cyberattack will take some time."" Still, Merck is best-positioned for the remainder of 2017, Divan said in a note to client.Merck shares ended the regular trading session up 0.5% to 62.67.Though investors seem to prefer AbbVie (ABBV) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Divan is placing his bets on Allergan and Lilly. Still, there are several months until Allergan is expected to unveil data in a migraine trial, he said.And though Lilly offers a diverse pipeline, more interest is on Novo Nordisk's (NVO) trial known as Sustain-7, which is looking at its diabetes drug semaglutide vs. Lilly's Trulicity. Divan sees Trulicity as safer than Novo's drug.Lilly is expected to unveil data from a trial of its drug abemaciclib in breast cancer during an upcoming oncology conference, Divan said. Lilly is also planning to file applications for a migraine drug and is driving adoption of new drugs in cancer and plaque psoriasis.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have struggled lately and are now ranked seventh out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, down from fifth last week. The sector hit a seven-week low Thursday after hitting an 18-month high in July. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what happened.Meanwhile, Divan isn't as bullish on the commercial potential of drugs from AbbVie in inflammatory diseases and immuno-oncology. He also calls for ""relatively rapid erosion"" of sales from key drug Humira in the U.S. once generics enter the market, likely in 2022.In Bristol's case, rumors it could become a takeover target have limited its stock in the near term. But early assets in immuno-oncology and potential approvals in kidney and liver cancers could drive upside over time, Divan argued.Credit Suisse also reinstated coverage of Dow stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in July, but Divan noted its valuation may be limiting investor interest. This will likely change after J&J's release of data from its Compass trial during the European Society of Cardiology meeting.That meeting is set later this month. J&J is looking at the ability of its anticoagulant, Xarelto, to prevent major adverse cardiac events including cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in patients with some heart diseases.""We expect Compass to be the star of the meeting and has the potential to dramatically increase uptake of Xarelto in the coming quarters, something that can move the needle even for a company J&J's size,"" Divan wrote.But Divan also noted he downgraded Pfizer (PFE) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) to neutral ratings from outperform during the quarter. Dow stock Pfizer is struggling with near-term catalysts and a lacking acquisitive appetite amid the potential for tax reform.Teva, on the other hand, is range-bound ""until a new leadership team is in place, a strategy to reduce their debt is more certain and more clarity on the potential of generic versions of Copaxone (a multiple sclerosis drug) 40-milligrams is obtained,"" he wrote.RELATED:Will Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?Generic Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

548,AGN,"Botox-maker Allergan (AGN) topped Wall Street's second-quarter model Thursday, but stock reaction was muted on light sales of eye drug Restasis and stagnant revenue from fat-stripping drug Kybella.XFor the second quarter ended June 30, Allergan reported adjusted income of $4.02 per share on $4.01 billion in sales, up a respective 20% and 8.7% vs. the year-earlier period. The consensus expected adjusted earnings of $3.95 a share on $3.95 billion in sales.Allergan also raised its 2017 guidance to $15.85 billion to $16.05 billion in revenue and adjusted income of $16.05-$16.45 per share. Previously, Allergan had guided to $15.8 billion to $16 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $15.85-$16.35 a share.""This raise was unexpected in our view,"" Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in a note to clients. Koffler kept her 267 price target and buy rating on Allergan stock. ""The stock may be held back by some mixed performance in key products.""Botox cosmetic revenue of $210.3 million in the U.S. missed Koffler's estimate for $212.7 million, though it grew 10.7% year over year. But Botox as a therapeutic in the U.S. brought in $346.9 million, topping Koffler's view for $325.6 million and grew 17.2%.Allergan cited ""trade buying patterns"" despite stable volume demand for a 9.4% decrease in sales of eye drug Restasis to $336.4 million. That number also missed consensus views for $359 million, Koffler said.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan leads the medical aesthetics market, but rivals like Hologic (HOLX), Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have pieces of the sector. Head to Industry Snapshot for a closer look at the layout.In its gastrointestinal unit, sales of Linzess increased 11.5% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $167.8 million but widely missed Street expectations for $186 million to $188 million, Koffler said. This follows a $20 million destocking in the first quarter.Sales of Kybella, an injection used to improve the appearance of fat under the chin, were flat at $12.7 million. Juvederm collection sales climbed 7.3% to $126.2 million. CoolSculpting sales were $78.9 million, following the close of the Zeltiq acquisition in late April.On the stock market today, Allergan inched up less than 0.1% to close at 250.36.

550,AGN,"Generic drug maker Mylan (MYL) continued its free-fall Friday while rival Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) managed to briefly arrest its slide, but broader generics led by Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) defied the trend and spiked higher for the third straight day.XIn afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group popped 3.3% to its highest point since Aug. 3, the day Teva reported second-quarter earnings and sales that missed, and cut guidance.Generic drug stocks broadly traded down for 12 consecutive days, but began to recover earlier this week. Eagle and Aclaris Therapeutics (ACRS) led the group midday Friday, rising a respective 11.1% and9%. Perrigo (PRGO), which offered a quarterly beat-and-raise this week, popped 2.2%, near 78.90.Analysts expected Perrigo's generic drugs business to topple in the quarter following disappointments from Teva and Mylan. Its generics business did decline 13%, but strength in its consumer-driven business was enough to help Perrigo top expectations.Perrigo shot up 15.8% Thursday on its second-quarter report. It's ""amazing what one good quarter can do,"" UBS analyst Marc Goodman wrote in a research report. He has a buy rating and an 84 price target on Perrigo.Goodman noted Perrigo did the unexpected — it increased its net sales guidance for 2017 in its generic drugs unit. Perrigo bumped its expected generics sales to $950 million, from earlier views for $925 million, due to earlier-than-expected launches of new products.""But the significant move in the stock was also due to solid upside from both consumer businesses in combination with cost-cutting execution, which is driving margin improvement, which appears to be sustainable,"" Goodman said.IBD'S TAKE: Inflation could have had a part to play in some earnings misses. Head to IBD's Economy page to see how Teva and others could have been impacted.Perrigo boosted its generics guide despite calling for 9%-11% year-over-year erosion in generic drug prices for the second half of the year.In a separate report, Goodman nearly halved his price target on Teva to 19 from 34, though he kept a neutral rating. He expects Teva to see generic competition to its multiple-sclerosis drug Copaxone in the first quarter of 2018 after losing several key patents earlier this year.""More importantly, we have significantly lowered the U.S. generics numbers, both topline and margins, based on how management sees the new generics landscape,"" he wrote. ""Our analysis suggest this is not a buying opportunity; hence, we remain neutral on the stock.""Goodman assumes Teva's U.S. generics business will likely decline 3%-4% on average from 2017-21, decreasing from $5.4 billion to $4.7 billion. This will be ""driven by a base erosion of about 11% that would be partially offset by new product launches,"" he said.Teva expects U.S. generics revenue will decline in 2018-19. It's looking to save money by closing down manufacturing facilities, as well as synergies through the Allergan (AGN) generics deal. Teva acquired Allergan's generics business last August.RELATED:Perrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendHow Teva's 40% Crash Over Three Days Is Hurting Generic DrugmakersAstraZeneca Pops On Report Its CEO Won't Jump Ship For Teva Pharma

551,AGN,"Pfizer (PFE) is awaiting clarification on tax reform before embarking on a merger deal, the Dow component said Tuesday, amid investors' push for an acquisition after second-quarter sales declined again.XInvestors have been clamoring for Pfizer, the No. 3 drugmaker by market cap, to make more acquisitions as sales have fallen over the past three consecutive quarters. Early Tuesday, Pfizer said its second-quarter revenue slipped 2%.On the conference call following its report, Pfizer reaffirmed that there are ""short-term events in the marketplace such as tax reform that may change asset values,"" Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients.The Trump administration has made lofty promises regarding tax reform, including a proposal to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, helping U.S.-domiciled companies and rendering corporate inversions less desirable.Until Washington acts on tax reform, business development like acquisitions is ""somewhat delayed,"" Pfizer reportedly said. ""We need to see tax reform or absence of tax reform, then look at business development activities.""IBD'S TAKE: President Donald Trump's tax vision would benefit some biotechs and drugmakers more than others. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown on who looks likely to benefit most.Over the years, Pfizer's chief method of growing its topline has been making big deals. It acquired Medivation last year in a $14 billion deal. Earlier in the year, it bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Bind Therapeutics and Bamboo Therapeutics.But in 2016 it also walked away from a $160 billion deal to acquire Allergan (AGN) amid political controversy linked to Allergan's Ireland tax domicile. The deal would have let Pfizer change its tax domicile to Ireland, thus paying less in taxes.Legacy drugs weighed on Pfizer in the quarter. Its pneumonia drug, Prevnar 13, saw sales decline 8%. Pristiq, a depression drug, lost market exclusivity in the U.S. and toppled 76%. Sales of erectile dysfunction drug Viagra fell 13%.In the meantime, Pfizer is putting its efforts behind further developing an immuno-oncology drug called Bavencio. It's approved to treat a form of skin cancer and bladder cancer. The drug was developed with Germany's Merck KGaA.Bavencio is a PD-L1 inhibitor and competes with rival drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY). Like its competitors in the space, Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) — which have PD-1 inhibitors — Pfizer is looking to combine Bavencio with other drugs.But Pfizer acknowledged Tuesday on the call that AstraZeneca's recent failure in combining two immuno-oncology drugs, Imfinzi and tremelimumab to treat lung cancer, doesn't bode well for similar combinations.The trial indicates ""immuno-oncology/immuno-oncology (combinations) may be more problematic in the near-term,"" Pfizer reportedly said. But Pfizer noted the value of having a PD-L1 inhibitor in its purview. Still others are ""ahead.""On the stock market today, Pfizer fell 0.2% to 33.08. Shares are in a yearlong consolidation with a 37.49 buy point.RELATED:Generics Chip Away At Dow Stock Pfizer, But Cancer Unit Is 'Stabilizing'How AstraZeneca Failed Not Once — But Twice — In Cancer DrugsWhy Clovis, Regeneron Are Leading A Biotech Deluge TodayHow Dow's Merck Is Benefiting On The Backs Of AstraZeneca, Bristol

553,AGN,"Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) stock popped for a time Thursday on speculation the biotech could be on the auction block after announcing the hiring of a new M&A savvy chief executive.XDouglas Ingram will succeed Ed Kaye as chief executive of Sarepta, the biotech said late Wednesday. Ingram was Allergan's (AGN) president — and front runner for chief executive — before its $66 billion takeover by Actavis in 2015. Kaye will remain on as an advisor.Ingram also is credited with a corporate turnaround at Allergan that included reducing costs by $500 million and increasing earnings growth from 15% to north of 20%, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in a note to clients. That helped fend off a takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX).In 2016, Ingram was the chief executive of privately held Chase Pharmaceuticals before Allergan, formerly Actavis, acquired it in a $125 billion deal that also includes regulatory and sales milestones.""His corporate success across biotech and pharma companies, and knowledge and expertise in the neurodegenerative diseases make him an ideal appointment for Sarepta which is seeking to solidify its leadership in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy space,"" Schwartz said.IBD'S TAKE: Sarepta stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 62, meaning it underperforms more than a third of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at the strongest-rated biotechs.Ingram's hiring also spikes the potential for a takeover, analysts said. Rumors that the biotech is on the auction block have circulated since its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Exondys 51, was approved last year and following Kaye's announcement in the first quarter that he would step down.French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY) has often been cited a potential acquirer for Sarepta. Takeover speculation could ""layer on some M&A premium to the company's valuation,"" Schwartz said.Schwartz previously upgraded Sarepta stock to an outperform rating on the likelihood of commercial success for Exondys 51. Sarepta is set to announce its second-quarter earnings on July 19. The prior two quarters show Exondys 51 is gaining momentum, he said.RBC analyst Matthew Eckler sees Ingram benefiting Sarepta with his background in neurology drug development as Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a neurological disorder. His prior dealmaking experience could also help Sarepta to in-license the drug.Eckler has an outperform rating on Sarepta stock. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young also kept her outperform rating and 64 price target on Sarepta stock. She called Ingram a ""strong fit"" for Sarepta.At one point on the stock market today, Sarepta stock lifted as much as 4.4%. But the general market sellloff brought shares down at the close by 1.5% to 33.37.RELATED:Sarepta Pops On Consensus-Topping Revenue, Boosts 2017 GuidanceAnthem, Humana, United Push Back On Sarepta's FDA-Approved DMD DrugSarepta's Costly Muscular Dystrophy Drug Flirts With Big Pharma M&A

554,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter early Tuesday on strong demand for aesthetic and eye care products.Adjusted income rose to $3.35 a share on revenue of $3.57 billion, up 10% vs. the year-earlier quarter and beating expectations by 5 cents for the quarter ended March 31. Sales grew 5% year over year, and topped the $3.54 billion view.Allergan credited the increase in sales to higher demand in facial aesthetics, Botox as a therapeutic, eye care, birth control Lo Loestrin and the addition of LifeCell, a regenerative medicines business, for 5% sales growth.Total medical aesthetics advanced 31% in the quarter, including facial aesthetic sales which grew 14% vs. the year-ago period. Regenerative medicine from LifeCell added on a $75.5 million chunk of revenue. Medical dermatology sales were up 25.5%.Sales of Juvederm advanced 23% to $122.2 million. Juvederm is an injectable filler to smooth facial lines and folds.Meanwhile, Allergan's generic medicine unit fell 7% as sales of dementia drug Namenda toppled 30% year over year to $122 million. Allergan blamed promotional support and conversion to Namzaric for the decline in Namenda sales. Namzaric sales grew 129%.Birth control Lo Loestrin grew 12% to $99.8 million, though that wasn't enough to offset a 48% decline in sales of birth control Minastrin which lost exclusivity in March. Sales of women's hormone cream Estrace fell 9% on lower net pricing and trade buying patterns.Gastrointestinal revenue was led by Linzess, a drug approved to treat constipation, which grew 8% to $147.6 million. But sales of Asacol/Delzicol, approved to treat ulcerative colitis, fell 46% to $57.6 million. Asacol was impacted by generic entry and demand declined for Delzicol.Allergan sees full-year revenue of $15.8 billion to $16 billion and adjusted EPS of $15.85 to $16.35, with a $16.10 midpoint. Wall Street expects revenue of $15.73 billion and EPS of $16.05.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has a dominating presence in the medical aesthetics space. It's looking unlikely anyone can keep up, but a few are trying. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a deeper look at Botox, breast implants and ear-pinning.The new forecast includes fat-freeze firm Zeltiq Aesthetics, which Allergan agreed to buy for $2.8 billion in February. Chief Executive Brent Saunders called 2017 ""a pivotal year for Allergan.""""We started with a solid, well-executed first quarter,"" he said in a statement. ""Many of our key brands continued to deliver significant year-over-year growth, led by Botox, our Juvederm collection of fillers, our regenerative medicine business, Linzess and Lo Loestrin.""Allergan shares rose as high as 246.50 but reversed lower to close down 1.3% at 238.60 on the stock market today.

555,AGN,"Hologic (HOLX) stock toppled to near a three-week low Thursday after the firm beat fiscal second-quarter sales and profit views, but reported lagging breast-screening revenue and noted ""significant disruption"" in its Cynosure unit.In late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, Hologic stock was down 5.4%, near 43.50, after earlier falling as much as 6.4%. As of Wednesday's close, Hologic shares are up 50% year to date following its acquisition of body-sculpting firm Cynosure.But Cynosure sales fell 19% year over year to $77 million for the full quarter. Under Hologic, Cynosure brought in $16 million. That beat the view of Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro who modeled $13 million.The ""blip"" in Cynosure sales was due to turnover around the time of Hologic's acquisition, the company said, citing a leak of the deal that created ""significant distraction."" Since then, Hologic has filled the vacancies and is looking to add skin tightening in the future.Hologic's Cynosure unit is expected to be ""huge,"" Massaro said. In a recent survey of 154 doctors, 22% of non-core doctors are performing non-invasive aesthetic procedures today with another 34% saying they might offer those procedures in the future.IBD'S TAKE: Hologic's acquisition of Cynosure followed Allergan's (AGN) acquisition of Zeltiq by a day. Cynosure and Zeltiq are rivals in the aesthetics business. But Allergan is pulling ahead of the market, analysts say. Head to Industry Snapshot for more on why Allergan is dominating the market.""Management won't quantify the opportunity other than to state it is 'huge,'"" he wrote in a note. Massaro kept his buy rating and 53 price target on Hologic stock. He noted the breast health unit, though stifled during the quarter, ""holds up better than feared.""Revenue from breast health grew 1.7% to $280.5 million, but that missed the consensus view for $286.3 million. Breast imaging, using a technique called tomosynthesis, slowed in the quarter. Hologic cited political unease for the decline.""Management noted that some U.S. hospitals have slowed spending based on concerns about the potential repeal of healthcare reform,"" Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a note to clients. U.S. breast health sales declined to 1.5% growth from 5.5% in the year-earlier quarter while international sales accelerated to 5.1% growth from 0.3%.Matson has a buy rating and 50 price target on Hologic stock.RELATED:Hologic Smashes Fiscal Q2 Sales Views, Beats On Profits By 4 Cents

556,AGN,"Hologic (HOLX) crushed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter revenue and profit expectations late Wednesday, led by double-digit growth in its molecular diagnostics and gynecological surgery units.In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Hologic stock popped 2.1% after closing up less than 1%, at 45.96. Shares are up 50% for the year following Hologic's acquisition of body-sculpting firm Cynosure. Cynosure is a rival of Zeltiq, which was recently acquired by Allergan (AGN).For the second quarter ended April 1, Hologic reported adjusted income of 50 cents a share on revenue of $715.4 million. Earnings grew 6.4% on a year-over-year basis and topped by 4 cents. Sales were up 3.8% and beat the $685.4 million view.Hologic's molecular-diagnostics segment led the quarter, growing 12.6% to $142.1 million, comprising about 20% of total sales. Gynecological surgery revenue followed, up 11.2% to $101.1 million. But sales from skeletal health fell 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan holds a dominant position in the medical aesthetics market. Can Hologic make a dent with its Cynosure acquisition? Head to IBD's Industry Snapshot for a closer look at the setup.This quarter, Hologic sold its blood-screening business to Grifols (GRFS). For part of the quarter before its sale, the blood-screening business brought in $38.3 million.

557,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) are expected Tuesday to report growing first-quarter profits, but Allergan is likely to see sales decline for the first time in nine periods.Despite sunnier views for Jazz, shares of both Allergan and Jazz dipped. Allergan lost 1.2%, to 241.95, while Jazz fell 1.5%, to 156.67 on the stock market today. Shares of Allergan, the No. 1 player in so-called medical aesthetics, have been forming a flat base since February. Jazz stock hit a 155.70 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation on April 24.For the first quarter, analysts expect Allergan to report adjusted income of $3.30 a share on sales of $3.54 billion, up 8.6% and down 6.9%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, profits fell in two of the past three quarters, but sales have grown since March 2015.Wall Street will likely be keyed in early Tuesday during Allergan's conference call for more on the company's nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or steatohepatitis, program. Last month, Allergan announced a team-up with Novartis (NVS) in that arena following several acquisitions in 2016.Jazz is expected after the close Tuesday to report $376.9 million in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.34 a share for its first quarter. Sales would be up 12.2% and earnings per share would grow 9.9% vs. the year-earlier period.IBD'S TAKE: Can anyone catch Allergan in medical aesthetics? It's not looking likely. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look on why Allergan is dominating the space.Analysts will be looking for strong sales of Xyrem, a narcolepsy drug and Jazz's biggest moneymaker, bringing in 74% of total sales in 2016. Revenue in 2016 increased 12% due to strong sales of Xyrem and Defitelio, an anticoagulant, Jazz said.Investors will keep a close eye on other narcolepsy meds, like Jazz's drug known as JZP-110. Last month, Jazz said the drug had promising results in a study of patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy.Jazz plans to submit an application to the FDA late this year for JZP-110 in obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy.RELATED:Could Lilly Outperform These Bigger Rivals On Strong Diabetes Meds?This Rival Might Swipe 20% Of Jazz's Sleep Business, But Stock Perks UpJazz Pharma Isn't Dozing; Stock Breaks Out On Sleep Apnea Trial

559,AGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) would benefit the most among biotechs under President Trump's proposed tax reform, a measure that would cut the corporate tax rate by 20%.Under Trump's proposal ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,"" making corporate inversions unnecessary."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35%.That means Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen — all of which have guided to adjusted tax rates at or above 25% in 2017 — could see a serious boost in cash if Trump's proposal passes. Though, analysts say, it's all about compromise inside the Beltway, so that 15% rate is still up in the air.Trump's approval rating jumped to 39% in May from 34% in April, and he gained 7% in the IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index after unveiling his tax reform proposal. It was the first month-over-month increase since Trump became president.But that doesn't mean Big Pharma and biotech are totally sold on Trump's proposal — a four-page document released April 26. Shares of biotechs and drugmakers collectively lifted less than 1% that day, though generic drug stocks popped 2.8%.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted uncertainty in Washington is the norm.""So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company,"" he said on Gilead's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. ""There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation. But you can't count on it and you can't wait for it, either.""Trump's plan would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, benefiting companies whose consolidated tax rates remain well above that level. Consolidating taxes allows a firm to treat a group of wholly- or majority-owned companies as a single entity for tax purposes.U.S.-domiciled drugmakers typically pay 37%-40% in consolidated taxes, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman told Investor's Business Daily. But companies that acquire a foreign firm can move their tax domicile outside the U.S. to the acquired company's often lower-tax homeland.When Mylan (MYL) acquired a generics manufacturer from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 2014, it kept its operational headquarters in Pennsylvania, but reincorporated in the Netherlands. In March, Mylan said it expected to pay a 16.5%-18.5% tax rate in 2017.Similarly, Allergan (AGN) guided in February to a 13.5% adjusted tax rate in 2017. Allergan's corporate headquarters are in Ireland. In April 2016, Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion attempt to acquire Allergan a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.Former President Barack Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to close the loophole for good. Trump, on the other hand, says his tax reform proposal would make inversions unnecessary ""by making America's tax rate one of the best in the world.""Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen would be among the biggest winners of this cut, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an April 26 report. Regeneron has guided to an effective tax rate of 32%-38% in 2017. Gilead sees 25%-28%. In the first quarter, Biogen paid 23% in adjusted taxes.Among drugmakers, Pfizer, Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) all guided to effective tax rates between 20%-25% for 2017. Canaccord's Steadman and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD everything in politics is subject to negotiation.""Smaller biotechs say it's obviously positive for the future, but everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach,"" Steadman said. ""A 20%-22% rate is probably what's going to happen, but they're not changing their capital expenditures or organizational structure in the meantime.""IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest on biotech and drug news? Be sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.A second facet of Trump's plan would allow the one-time repatriation of corporate cash parked overseas at a discounted 10% tax rate. This would be followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Evercore's Raffat says Amgen (AMGN) would benefit the most among drugmakers under this provision. Amgen has $34.4 billion in cash stashed overseas. That's money Amgen could use to help boost its war chest amid generic rivalries and a battle with Regeneron/Sanofi (SNY) on the cholesterol front.The same could be said for Gilead — $27.4 billion in overseas cash — which is facing dwindling sales in its hepatitis C drug franchise. Gilead had been under pressure for months amid analyst chatter that it should buy something to bolster sales. Incyte (INCY) is a likely candidate, analysts say.According to Raffat, Merck and Pfizer have a respective $21.9 billion and $15 billion in cash outside the U.S. Lilly, Bristol, Celgene (CELG), Biogen and AbbVie (ABBV) each have under $10 billion parked overseas. That cash could be repatriated for research and development, or used to fuel M&A.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read offered a similar view as Gilead's Milligan on the company's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. Though he expects industry consolidation to continue over time, the political atmosphere remains a major deterrent.""I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets.""Canaccord's Steadman doesn't expect a wave of M&A even if Trump's tax reform passes muster with Congress. There's no need to attempt Pfizer-Allergan-like mergers for inversion purposes, he said. Though the appetite for U.S. biotechs looks healthy.""We'd see a decline in those big inversion-type mergers that were not necessarily strategic, but you could see an appetite for U.S. biotech assets just because the tax picture looks better,"" he said. ""The net result is actually a decrease in large mergers but maybe an increase in valuations for biotech, but I don't think it drives much more M&A.""There's much that's still murky in Trump's tax proposal, analysts say.""The general theme is tax reform would be a good thing for biotech,"" Mizuho's Syed told IBD. ""But we don't exactly know what tax reform is going to be. There are still a lot of pieces moving around. Repatriation? A border tax? We don't have all the components of it.""A border tax, though, could be an extreme drawback for U.S. companies with manufacturing in less expensive countries. Such an adjustment could exempt exports from taxation, while taxing imports, PwC analysts Doug Strang and Kathy Michael wrote in a Feb. 6 report.In a January speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said a tax would eliminate the tax incentives for U.S. companies to move their manufacturing overseas.""Coupled with the new lower GOP tax rates on local businesses and ending double-taxation of U.S. earnings overseas, this establishes America as a 21st century magnet for new jobs, technology breakthroughs and headquarters,"" he said. ""The GOP tax plan is already driving companies to ask themselves, 'How soon can we bring our suppliers back to the U.S.?'""For most companies, relocating their operations back to the U.S. would be a ""paperwork nightmare,"" Canaccord's Steadman said. In the current plan — which doesn't include a border tax provision — there's nothing to incentivize companies to bring operations back to the U.S.But it could be enough to keep newer and smaller companies from re-domiciling overseas, he said.""It's probably enticing future companies to not leave the U.S., I think that's the core goal of what they're trying to do,"" he said. ""If they were U.S.-domiciled at a lower rate, they wouldn't have to leave cash in a foreign subsidiary and that cash would be based in the U.S. which would encourage investment in the U.S.""RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Dow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views But Sales Come Up ShortHow Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry With Pfizer, Novartis

560,AGN,"Generic drug stocks crashed Wednesday on news the Department of Justice has conducted a search at Perrigo's (PRGO) offices related to a widespread price-fixing investigation that is also looking at Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL).In early trading on the stock market today, IBD's 17-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group fell a collective 4.5% to a two-week low. Lannett Company (LCI) and Perrigo stocks lost the most, down 18.6% and 5.1%, respectively. Lannett missed third-quarter earnings estimates late Tuesday.Perrigo declined to comment beyond a press release, which confirmed authorities executed the search warrants at Perrigo's corporate offices.""As has been previously disclosed by a number of companies, the (Justice Department's) antitrust division has been looking at industrywide pricing practices,"" Perrigo's release said. ""The company is taking this investigation seriously and is cooperating with the appropriate authorities.""The investigation centers on potential price collusion among a dozen companies. It's illegal for companies to agree on a set price or corporate discounts.

561,AGN,"Oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as a slew of energy companies are gushing their best profits in years, yet crude prices are plunging again to levels last seen in November, clouding the outlook for dividends.Will glimmers of a profit recovery in the troubled energy sector mean a rush to plow money back to shareholders? Or will weakness in oil prices keep shareholder returns muted?""First and foremost, oil prices need to improve"" before the energy sector's dividends and buybacks return to historical levels, said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""Energy earnings are very highly correlated to energy prices. With oil prices at $45 a barrel, it will be very hard for those stocks to perform.""Grant Engelbart, a portfolio manager at CLS Investments, agrees that rebounding oil prices will be key to energy companies' profitability — and therefore their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares.At the same time, he notes that no energy company has actually cut dividends this earnings season and a few — including Exxon, Phillips 66 (PSX) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) — actually raised dividends.""We think dividend cuts have probably come to an end, and companies that have mandates to raise dividends will continue to do so,"" Engelbart said in a phone call.The latest reports reveal energy companies have done a good job navigating the new landscape by cutting back expenditures during the price bust and holding off on massive outlays with the rebound, he added.Helped by cost cuts, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) pumped out $9.5 billion in cash flow, which the Anglo-Dutch giant used to cover dividends for a third straight quarter and reduce debt in Q1.Yellow flags remain. Revenue for Exxon was worse than expected in the first quarter, and Chevron kept its dividend unchanged even as Exxon raised its payout. The two companies alone account for nearly 40% of the S&P 500 energy sector's market cap.The energy sector will also face tougher year-over-year comparisons over the course of 2017, making earnings growth less dramatic.Oil and gas companies floundered in the ugly commodity collapse of 2014-15. By early 2016, with a hoped-for rebound yet to materialize and their profits cratering, the likes of ConocoPhillips (COP), Kinder Morgan (KMI), Anadarko Petroleum (APC)  and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) were forced to slash dividend payouts.  In some cases, as stock prices plunged, dividend yields spiked as much as 12%.Even Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, was forced to borrow money to pay out dividends. Smaller-cap energy companies struggled the most to increase or maintain their dividend payments.Share buybacks, a form of shareholder returns that is easier for companies to turn on and off than dividends, were pared back even more.For 2016 as a whole, the energy sector represented 1.1% of all S&P 500 buybacks vs. 2.7% in 2015 and 7.4% in 2014, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. It contributed 9.1% to S&P 500 dividends  in 2016 vs. 10.56% the previous year.In the fourth quarter of 2016, the combined dividend yield and buyback yield for the energy sector was 3.19% — the lowest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors.Exxon, which has grown dividends for 35 years in a row, is now no longer the biggest dividend payer in the S&P 500.Apple (AAPL), which started paying dividends in 2012 and has been hiking payouts aggressively, is the new king. The iPhone maker on May 2 hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to 63 cents, taking its annual dividends to $13.22 billion vs. $12.77 billion for Exxon.Still, dividend yields for energy stocks are more attractive. With Apple stock hitting new highs, the dividend yield is just 1.6%, less than half of Exxon's 3.7% and Chevron's 4%.Apple also has replaced Exxon as ""the poster child for buybacks"" in recent years, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple buybacks in 2016 totaled $33.71 billion, making it the second largest S&P 500 company for buybacks, behind Allergan (AGN).Meanwhile, Exxon did not even rank among the top 20 and ""has done very little in the way of buybacks of late,"" Silverblatt wrote recently.Despite some recent good news for shareholders, current prices don't bode well for revenue or payouts.U.S. crude prices settled 3.2% higher Wednesday at $47.33 a barrel, on data showing a sharp drawdown in U.S. inventories. Meanwhile, OPEC and top non-OPEC producers have suggested they will extend production cuts through the end of this year and possibly into 2018.Prices could get a bump from new, aggressive moves by the oil group and its partners to further reduce the global glut of inventories. But that would likely be offset by increased production from U.S. companies.Still, while the top line remains challenged, companies could improve their bottom lines — and their cash flow — by focusing on lower-cost regions like the Permian Basin. U.S. producers have also been using new technologies and techniques that allow them to extract oil profitably, even at lower prices.RELATED:Uh-Oh, OPEC: Top Shale Play Vows Big Output Boost Even With Sub-$50 OilEOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, DataEven This Latest Idea From OPEC May Not Lift Oil Prices As Shale Looms

563,AGN,"It was just a year ago that the formula seemed right for Biogen (BIIB), the fourth-largest company in its industry, to mix up a biotechnology megamerger.Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise — a lineup of six drugs that includes Tecfidera and Tysabri — was growing. Tecfidera, Biogen's most important drug, brought in $3.97 billion in 2016, up 9%.Further, hemophilia sales, though small, grew 53% in 2016 to $847 million between just two brand-name drugs, Eloctate and Alprolix. And Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, grabbed FDA approval just days before Christmas.The plot thickened when Biogen's chief executive, George Scangos, resigned in July, leaving the company susceptible to takeout by the likes of Merck (MRK), Allergan (AGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Pfizer (PFE). Takeout rumors abounded, and Biogen stock ended 2016 down 6.2%, making it a cheaper asset to buy.""I thought last year was really the time for it to happen,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. ""What Biogen offered last year was a relatively stable MS business that was still growing, a robust cash flow scheme, the opportunity for Spinraza and the hemophilia franchise. So an acquirer could say, 'I get all of that.' ""Fast-forward to today, and the picture is entirely different. Biogen is seeing increasing competition in the MS market, payers are balking at Spinraza prices, and the company has already taken its hemophilia drugs out of the equation.Now, only 24% of Wall Street sees Biogen as a potential takeout candidate in 2017, according to a Mizuho survey. And Porges says Biogen will probably have to wait until 2020 to see the deals roll in, if ever.""I think it has become significantly less likely,"" Porges said.So, what happened?After an incredibly successful 2016 in multiple sclerosis — including the launch of Zinbryta with AbbVie (ABBV) — Biogen's MS unit is facing looming competition from the likes of Roche (RHHBY) and Celgene (CELG), Porges told Investor's Business Daily.In a note to clients on April 7, Porges called Roche's Ocrevus a ""game-changer."" Ocrevus was approved in late March to treat both relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS, separating itself from the pack that is only approved for the relapsing-remitting form.""Both the MS physician and patient communities have been eagerly awaiting the Ocrevus launch,"" Porges said. ""The drug's high efficacy, reasonable safety profile and convenient six-month dosing schedule are all major factors in the drug's positive reception.""That spells trouble for Biogen, as Tecfidera had comprised 40% of total product sales as well as 76% of the MS unit. Biogen is actually partnered with Roche on Ocrevus, but the royalty won't be enough to offset erosion to its own MS franchise, analysts say.Porges expects Ocrevus to get 60% of the primary progressive MS market within three to four years. In the relapsing-remitting MS market, Porges sees 40%-50% erosion of Tysabri, and 30%-40% erosion of Tecfidera and Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya sales.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on an MS drug called ozanimod in Phase 3 testing. In function, ozanimod is closest to Novartis' Gilenya, though it could also rival Tecfidera or Sanofi's (SNY) Aubagio. Tecfidera, Gilenya and Aubagio, respectively, lead the MS market in terms of sales.""If Celgene wanted to buy a sales force and have something overnight to help sell ozanimod, Biogen could be that company,"" Porges told IBD. But with Biogen likely to suffer erosion from Roche competition in MS, that's looking less probable.The silver lining? Biogen won a patent and an interference case against Forward Pharma (FWP) over Tecfidera, though it was out a $1.25 billion settlement fee. Forward stock toppled 22.5% on the decision as it now loses out on a major royalty.Biogen's Spinraza has a different set of troubles. Developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), Spinraza is the first and only drug approved for the rare neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting in infants and children.Wall Street largely thought of Spinraza as a slam dunk. It had ""profound efficacy"" in two August 2016 studies in infants and children. The drug was so effective that Biogen and Ionis ended the studies early, Ionis Chief Executive Stanley Crooke told IBD in December.Spinraza was approved Dec. 23 with a fairly broad label. It's approved for use in children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy and remains the only drug approved for the disease that Crooke called ""catastrophic.""""This drug, of all things, should be rapidly adopted and widely reimbursed,"" Porges said. ""And what may have happened was what appeared to be good fortune with the label may have turned into a liability because payers became concerned too many patients would start on the drug so they restricted access.""Mizuho analyst Salim Syed calls 2017 ""largely a Spinraza story."" Biogen is set to report its first-quarter earnings on April 25. That will be particularly telling following the launch of Spinraza earlier this year. Analysts say, though, that payers are pushing back hard on reimbursements of the drug.Insurers Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM) are only reimbursing patients on Spinraza with the most severe form of the disease, Type 1. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has a broader policy, covering Type 1, 2 and 3 patients. That could be because Spinraza costs $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year, and $375,000 in subsequent years, making it a pricey drug.The consensus is projecting $15 million in first-quarter Spinraza sales, Syed said.Porges lowered his expectations for Spinraza for 2017 to $266 million from $400 million. Sales results for the first quarter will be especially telling, he told IBD. North of 100 patients on the drug would be ""pretty good — as long as they're seeing continued starts.""Then there's Biogen's hemophilia drug lineup.In February, Biogen spun off its hemophilia franchise into Bioverativ (BIVV). Since then, Bioverativ shares are up 27%, which is great — for Bioverativ. But any company considering a Biogen takeover might think again without that unit, Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ isn't your standard biotech startup. Head to The New America to find out why.Bioverativ has yet to announce any quarterly results, having only been public since early February. The company is set to release its first-quarter earnings results on May 3. In its last full quarter with Biogen, that hemophilia unit brought in $242 million, up 11.5% year over year.Now, Porges says it would be smart for Biogen to also spin off its multiple sclerosis unit and turn its focus toward Alzheimer's. In Alzheimer's Biogen is following Eli Lilly and Merck, both of which had notable failures in December and February.Biogen's Alzheimer's play is the strongest in the sector, analysts say.In March, RBC analyst Michael Yee told IBD that Pfizer and Merck are the likeliest players to make a bid on Biogen. They would be ""interested in more branded drugs and particularly the Alzheimer's pipeline.""Biogen is working on two classes of Alzheimer's drugs — one that works to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's and another called a BACE inhibitor with Eisai. BACE inhibitors aim to prevent the plaque buildup.Porges says Biogen will likely have to wait until 2020 to see renewed takeover interest. In 2020, Biogen is expected to release the results of two Phase 3 trials of aducanumab. Its BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat, is also in a Phase 3 trial with results expected after September 2020.Eli Lilly's solanezumab worked on the theory that it would remove plaque buildup — called beta amyloid — in the brain. Merck's verubecestat was a BACE inhibitor. But both failed, and there are only a handful of potential Alzheimer's drugs in development now.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) is working on a different theory of treatment that doesn't involve beta amyloid. It expects to have Phase 3 data of its drug, intepirdine, later this year. That, too, could change the Alzheimer's landscape and potentially further dent Biogen's chances of a merger.Still, Biogen's board will place a high premium on its Alzheimer's pipeline if it ever comes to the acquisition table, Porges said. That's because everything else has failed and development costs for aducanumab and elenbecestat have headed toward the billions of dollars, Porges said.""If you're willing to take the risk on Alzheimer's, it still makes some sense as an acquisition, but what I've heard from people in and around the industry is they're struggling to bridge the gap,"" he said. ""The board wants to be paid for Alzheimer's as if it's going to work.""RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisBiogen Dives As Takeover Buzz Fades, Drugs Hit SnagsCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

564,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) and Paratek Pharmaceuticals (PRTK) stocks popped Tuesday after announcing strong results of a late-stage trial for an acne drug with plans to file for FDA approval by year's end.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan was up 0.5% to 240.53. Paratek climbed 1.5% to 17.55. Deutsche Bank analyst Gregg Gilbert upped his price target on Allergan stock to 265 from 262.Gilbert expects the companies' acne drug sarecycline to hit $250 million in peak sales by year five, slightly below Allergan's view for $250 million to $300 million in peak sales. Now, he models $3.29 earnings per share, down from $3.37, for the first quarter.For the full year, Gilbert still sees Allergan earnings at $16.03 a share, a penny below the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Gilbert's model is unchanged for the year despite his view for boosted spending in the first quarter amid sarecycline testing.IBD'S TAKE: Can anyone catch Allergan in medical-aesthetics? It's not looking likely. But there could be an outside chance for a few nontraditional players. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a look inside the fat-freezing, ear-pinning market.Sarecycline is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic which means it could avoid the gastrointestinal tract issues associated with older oral medications for acne, Gilbert said in a note to clients. Allergan expects to file for FDA approval by the end of 2017.In two phase-three trials, sarecycline at 1.5-milligram doses daily for 12 weeks was superior to non-drug placebos, Allergan said in a news release. The most common side effects were nausea, colds and headaches. But only 1.4% of patients discontinued use.Gilbert kept his buy rating on Allergan stock.""We continue to view Allergan as a reasonably valued stock with an attractive growth profile, solid and diverse franchises, shareholder-driven management team and potentially underappreciated pipeline,"" he wrote.RELATED:Lilly, Merck, Allergan Top Analyst's View For 2017 Pharma

565,AGN,"When Peter Gassner launched Veeva Systems (VEEV) in 2007, he didn't expect to outstrip $500 million in revenue, watch its stock triple in a span of less than three years or expand its arsenal of products to 23 applications.Instead, Gassner was in ""survival mode.""""In the beginning you have nothing — you have no products, no customers, no people, nothing,"" said Gassner, a one-time alum of Salesforce.com (CRM). ""You have exactly zero. So, then you have to start hiring some people, you have to make a product and get your first customer.""He added: ""Grand plans are sort of interesting, but it doesn't mean anything until you can hire your first developer or get your first customer.""Today, Veeva provides the cloud backbone for the $1.7 trillion life sciences industry where it rivals the likes of Medidata Solutions (MDSO), and counts companies like Pfizer (PFE), Novartis (NVS), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) among its customers.As drugmakers tackle the challenge of developing, testing and manufacturing lifesaving drugs, Veeva operates the cloud system in the background. Its dual roles include organizing doctor information for pharmaceutical reps and clinical trial data/graphs for companies.Gassner calls the latter point ""Veeva's second act."" In total, Veeva estimates its total addressable market at $7 billion, though Gassner expects its nascent third act could add another $1 billion onto that. After all, becoming bigger and better is exactly what companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) did, he said.""The important thing in a company is, if you want to keep it going, your second act should probably end up being as big or bigger than your first act,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""A company that can make its second act bigger than its first act has some long-term ability to reinvent itself.""Veeva launched 10 years ago with a single application to help pharmaceutical reps organize drug data to make stronger doctor pitches. Today, 60% of the globe's pharma sales reps use what's called Veeva CRM — customer relationship management — an iPad application.Getting drug company managers to buy in early on wasn't difficult, Gassner says.IBD'S TAKE: Veeva Systems stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms 97% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of strong software leaders.""I think the life sciences industry is more business-outcome oriented,"" he said. ""There's important things the CEOs focus on: 'Can I get my drug approved? Can I get it to market effectively before the patent expires?' If there's a tool, cloud or not cloud, that can help them, that's generally what they want.""Fast forward to 2017, Veeva CRM is part of the company's Commercial Cloud business. Commercial Cloud grew in fiscal 2017 on major CRM wins and amid expansions at top 20 pharmaceutical firms, Veeva said in its earnings news release. The business accounts for two-thirds of Veeva's sales, Gassner estimates.But it's Veeva's second act that really has Wall Street keyed up, he said.Veeva Vault was launched in 2011 with a single customer and the goal of organizing all content involved in clinical trials — documents, videos, images and data records. Vault represents about a third of Veeva's total sales and targets a $4 billion total-addressable market, Gassner said.He sees Vault as the reason for recent excitement around Veeva stock. Shares are up 29% since January and, on March 13, burst out of a cup-with-handle formation that began in November, topping a 45.95 buy point on a deeper Salesforce partnership. The stock is now more than 14% extended from that point.From a bottom of 17.11 in May 2014 — seven months after Veeva's IPO — to an all-time intraday high of 53.37 reached Friday, shares gained nearly 212%. Shares ultimately retreated by Friday's close, but were up again Monday, gaining 1.4% to close at 52.55.In 2011, Vault brought in under $10 million in sales, Gassner said. Today, Vault's annualized run rate is north of $220 million.As a whole, Veeva is aiming to top a $1 billion annualized run rate in 2020, and Veeva is already tracking ahead of that, says Cornelio Ash, analyst at William O'Neil & Co., an affiliate of Investor's Business Daily.Now, Vault is prepping for a potential third act by looking for opportunities outside life sciences — a first for Veeva. Gassner says Veeva could see an additional $1 billion opportunity in taking Vault to other manufacturing-heavy industries like chemicals and consumer packaging.O'Neil's Ash says success in that venture will be a ""game-changer"" for Veeva.""What that would be saying is they've got a lockdown on the steps,"" he told IBD. ""Then it just becomes, what door do they want to knock down? The potential is there. That's probably why (Veeva stock) continues to trade at a premium.""Gassner says Veeva will gain traction outside life sciences using the same method it employed in 2007 and 2011 when it launched its major Commercial Cloud and Vault divisions. Inside the company it's called ""the Veeva way.""The method worked in life sciences, after all. Veeva has an estimated 50%-60% of the CRM market. And though its sales in clinical trials and regulatory processes match Medidata's, that's 100% of Medidata's sales vs. a small — and growing — chunk of Veeva's.""Your brand becomes what you're good at,"" Gassner said. ""If we become good at delivering this value outside life sciences, then I think over time we'll become known for that.""To that end, Veeva is part of a collaboration that includes AstraZeneca (AZN), Allergan (AGN), Biogen (BIIB), Lilly, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Pfizer and others called Align Biopharma. Align is aiming to iron out the technological standards for the life sciences world.Veeva could do the same in a sector outside of the life sciences, Ash said.""That's literally getting feedback from the horse's mouth of how they should develop the platform,"" he said. ""To me, to be successful outside that, they're going to need that same kind of feedback in other sectors.""RELATED:IBD 50 Company Breaks Out After Deepening Salesforce Tie-UpVeeva Helps The Medicine Go Down For Drug Giants

566,AGN,"Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) could be on the cusp of being acquired, an analyst said Friday as he examined historical merger patterns in Big Pharma.""Small to midsize biotech companies with approved drugs may be attractive acquisition targets due to reduced development and regulatory risk,"" Needham analyst Alan Carr wrote in a research report.The trio just grabbed their first FDA approvals. Acadia's Nuplazid was approved in April 2016 for psychosis associated with Parkinson's. Ocaliva, from Intercept, was approved in May 2016 for a liver disease. Lexicon's Xermelo got approval in February for carcinoid syndrome.Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) looks likely to get approval next month for Ingrezza, a drug that aims to treat involuntary movements associated with long-term use of certain medicines. The disorder is known as tardive dyskinesia.Though there was ""a disproportionate number"" of earlier-stage companies bought last year, that doesn't tend to be the trend. A third of the 60 small-to-midsize companies with approvals in 2011 have since been acquired, Carr wrote.""However, each of these acquired companies had previously launched a drug somewhere, which we interpret as risk mitigation by the acquiring company,"" he said. Of those 60, 11 were acquired shortly after their first FDA approval and nearly all within two years of that.IBD'S TAKE: Can anyone catch this beauty giant in medical-aesthetics? At least one company is trying. Read on in IBD's Industry Snapshot.Among biotechs, about half of the 41 companies acquired since January 2014 for more than $250 million in upfront cash had at least one approved or marketed drug. Some 74% had Phase 3 data or a drug under FDA review at the time of the announcement.Drugmakers targeting oncology and infectious diseases were ripest for takeover between 2011-17. Since then, 45% of infection and 42% of oncology outfits have been acquired. Most rare disease companies, 80%, remain independent today.Allergan (AGN) and Japanese pharmaceutical firms were most likely to acquire earlier-stage firms, Carr said. Overall, Allergan, Astellas Pharma, Daiichi Sankyo and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma collectively acquired six companies between January 2014 and today.In the U.S. and Europe, AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Novartis (NVS) have each acquired one earlier-stage company since January 2014.RELATED:Did This Beauty Giant Just Solve The Acne Challenge?Lilly, Merck, Allergan Top Analyst's View For 2017 Pharma

567,AGN,"Conviction is vital to the managers of Parnassus Fund (PARNX). Ian Sexsmith and Robert Klaber, along with lead portfolio manager Jerome Dodson, have guided the fund into the upper echelon of large-cap growth funds by taking big stakes in relatively few stocks.They take above-average bets on each stock, particularly in their top 10 holdings. So they better have done their homework and have high confidence that their picks will pan out. Top holdings as of Jan. 31 include Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Micron Technology (MU).The Parnassus approach is working fine. The average annual returns of Parnassus and its stablemate Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) have surpassed the S&P 500's in the past year, as well as the past three years, five years and 10 years -- by enough to earn them both IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards.Parnassus Endeavor took top honors for being among the top five winners ranked by 10-year average annual return in three categories: overall U.S. diversified equity, as well as growth and large-cap funds. Parnassus Fund was among the top five in growth and large cap.The $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor owns just 26 stocks, while its $950 million stablemate Parnassus Fund holds 36 stocks. The larger fund, which Dodson has managed alone since 2005, has 48% of its assets invested in its top 10 holdings. Parnassus, which has been around since 1984, has 38% embedded in the top 10.Many growth funds hold 50 to 100 stocks in smaller position, seeking to control volatility with greater diversification. Not Parnassus.""We are a high-conviction fund,"" Klaber said. ""We have high active share and are bottom-up stock pickers."" Active share is a measure of how much a portfolio's holdings differ from its benchmark index.Aside from its focused approach, another way the funds stand out is their mandate to invest in good corporate citizens. ""We have no exposure to the energy or utility sectors,"" Sexsmith said. ""We are looking for companies that are best-in-class from an environmental perspective, a social perspective and a governance perspective."" In addition, Parnassus Endeavor's holdings must offer outstanding workplaces.As a multicap fund, the Parnassus team has the flexibility to invest wherever it sees opportunity. ""It is a go-anywhere domestic stock fund,"" Klaber said. ""We have no market-cap restrictions, so it gives us a pretty broad playing field."" Though Parnassus does have more than Endeavor in small and midcaps, 29% vs. 25%, Parnassus still favors large caps with 64% of its assets. Meanwhile, large-cap-oriented Endeavor has 86% in big caps.Some funds aim to control risk by veering only so far from benchmark-index sector weightings. Parnassus' conviction-investing results in some heavy over- and underweighting in sectors. As of Jan. 31, Parnassus Fund had 23% in financials vs. the S&P 500's 16%. Parnassus Endeavor was close to the benchmark in tech with 18%, but had outsize bets of 38% in tech vs. 19%, and 31% in health care vs. 14%.Klaber notes that a long-term focus has been key to the fund's success. Both funds have turnover rates 42% or lower. ""We are a bit more contrarian than other Parnassus funds,"" he said. ""We're willing to accept a wider range of outcomes in the short term.""Indeed, a direct line between top holdings and current fund performance isn't always clear. Some of the two funds' recent top holdings show signs of struggling, including Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Allergan (AGN), off 33% and 14% from their 52-week highs.Parnassus screens all potential holdings for relevance. ""We are looking for companies that are becoming increasingly relevant for the products or services they offer,"" Klaber said. ""We want to own companies that are gaining share in their sector or industry. The focus on relevance helps us to avoid value traps."" In value traps, investors are attracted to a stock by its low valuations, but after investors buy, the stock fails to rise.Wide moats are a hallmark of portfolio holdings. ""We seek companies with sustainable competitive advantages,"" Klaber said. ""We feel that provides protection during down markets because there is stored value.""Another important consideration for Parnassus is efficient capital allocation by companies it invests in. ""We go back five years and analyze how management has allocated capital in the past,"" Klaber said. ""We then project how we think they will allocate capital in the future to understand whether they are good stewards of capital.""The Parnassus team creates a three-year forecast with base, bull and bear scenario analyses for potential new stock buys. ""We are looking for asymmetry,"" Klaber said. ""We want companies with moderate to low downside risk and significant upside. An asymmetric risk to reward ratio is a common feature across all of our holdings.""""Historically, the Endeavor Fund has had a tech bias,"" Klaber said. ""As of the end of last year, more than 40% of the fund was invested in tech.""As of the end of January, two sectors accounted for approximately half of the Parnassus Fund. ""From a sector perspective, one of the sectors we have been most overweight is financials,"" Sexsmith said. ""The pro-growth agenda of the new administration has been a tailwind for these firms.""Parnassus is weighted 22.9% in financial service stocks. It added Progressive (PGR) in the first-quarter of 2015. Endeavor also has a stake in the auto insurance company. Sexsmith sees the company's online sales strategy as a disruptive force. ""There aren't many companies that are going to gain market share for as long as we can see,"" he said. ""When we see opportunities like that we are going to invest in them. Every year, Progressive chips away and gains market share. Its market share now is around 9% of the U.S. auto insurance market. That's going to keep going up over time.""Progressive shares have gained 11.4% since the beginning of the year and 19.1% from a year ago.Parnassus is weighted 27.3 in technology. ""In technology, we own a collection of wide-moat businesses with strong growth profiles that trade at attractive valuations,"" Klaber said.Klaber cites eBay (EBAY) as a prime example of a company with a wide moat. It is owned by both Parnassus and Endeavor. ""The source of its moat is a strong network effect where more sellers bring more buyers and vice versa,"" he said.Shares of eBay are up 12% year-to-date and 37.9% over the past year. They broke out of a cup-with-handle base in February, ran up 4%, but have since eased to near the breakout point.IBM (IBM) is a top tech holding in both portfolios. ""It is trading at 13 times earnings, about a 25% discount to the market, with a 3% dividend yield, so expectations are low,"" Klaber said. ""We think its server business will do better than expectations and its strategic initiatives group will continue to see growth accelerate.""IBM has climbed 7.1% so far this year and 24.9% over the last 52 weeks.The Parnassus team sees a lengthy runway for Allergan. The pharmaceutical company is the top holding of Parnassus and a top five holding of Endeavor. ""It has a dominant position in many therapeutic areas,"" Klaber said. ""It's a stock we have owned as a firm since the end of 2013, when it was in the high 80s. We were also buying it aggressively toward the end of last year. This is a company that has six drugs either in phase three or entering phase three in 2017.""Allergan shares have jumped 14.8% in 2017.The Parnassus crew exhibit the kind of patience with Allergan that many growth investors do not. While the company's earnings have grown at a 24% annual rate the past three years, Wall Street analysts see growth slowing to 19% this year and 11% next year. The stock's Relative Price Strength Rating from IBD is just 50.RELATED:Contrarian Pin Oak Equity Rises To The Top

569,AGN,"Pershing Square Capital Management, the activist fund run by Bill Ackman, sold its entire stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) and said the billionaire would leave the board.Ackman and fellow Pershing Square representative Steve Fraidin will stay at the company until the annual meeting but not stand for re-election, according to a statement released Monday.The investment, which represents about 1.5% to 3% of Pershing Square's funds, required ""a disproportionately large amount of time and resources,"" the statement said.Valeant shares ended trading Monday down 1.1% to 12.11, then plunged nearly 10% after the close to 10.95. Jefferies Group offered Pershing Square's 27.23 million Valeant shares for 11.10 to 11.40 apiece, according to a person familiar with the process who asked not to be identified as discussing private information.Pershing Square first disclosed its investment in Valeant in March 2015. Earlier, Ackman's fund had teamed up with Valeant in a hostile bid for Allergan (AGN), which was thwarted when Allergan agreed to be acquired by Actavis. Valeant and Ackman are facing a shareholder lawsuit over alleged insider trading involving the failed deal for Allergan.

570,AGN,"Drugmaker Allergan (AGN) and smartphone king Apple (AAPL), a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, were the two leaders in stock buybacks for the fourth quarter of 2016, followed by Citigroup (C) and Microsoft (MSFT), says a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices.Overall, companies in the S&P 500 index spent $135.3 billion on stock buybacks during the period, up 21% from the third quarter but down 7% year over year. The all-time high is $172 billion from the third quarter of 2007.For the year, companies in the S&P 500 spent $536.4 billion on buybacks, down 6.3% from 2015, while buybacks in 2014 fell 3%. The press release noted that the last time S&P 500 issues reduced buyback payments in consecutive years was in 2008 and 2009.Buybacks remained concentrated, as the top 20 issues accounted for 46.7% of the total fourth-quarter 2016 expenditures.Share repurchases are a popular way to return capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings, while dividends put cash in shareholders' hands.Allergan spent $12.3 billion on buybacks in the fourth quarter, the seventh-largest quarterly purchase by an S&P 500 company.Apple, a Dow stock, came in second at $10.9 billion. Apple, which is frequently among the biggest spenders on buybacks and dividends, spent $33.7 billion on buybacks last year.Citigroup was third at $4.1 billion, then Microsoft, a Dow component, at $3.6 billion.They were followed by Dow stocks General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).""While buyback activity has slowed since Q1 2016, the steady growth of dividends indicate a positive development for shareholders,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.With Allergan's giant sum, the health care sector led the S&P 500 in buybacks, spending $28.9 billion in the fourth quarter. In second was the information technology sector, at $28.7 billion.Allergan shares closed down 0.2% to 233.99 in the stock market today. Apple climbed 1.1% to 141.42, retaking a 141.12 buy point.

571,AGN,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) stand to outperform broad pharma stocks in 2017, a Credit Suisse analyst said Monday, citing their strong pipelines and expected clinical data this year.Merck stock closed down 1.5% at 64.15 on the stock market today. Shares of Allergan dipped 0.2% to 240.65, and Lilly finished 0.3% lower at 84.14. Drug stocks were down broadly, but stayed above their 50-day moving average.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan expects macro uncertainty to pressure drug stocks in the first half of 2017, continuing a trend that began in 2016 with the raucous election season. Drug stocks ended 2016 down 27%, though are up 2.3% since January.Merck will outperform on Keytruda, its immuno-oncology drug, Divan said. Keytruda and similar drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) teach a patient's immune system to identify tumor cells. The immune system then destroys cancer.Keytruda goes head-to-head against Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo in that both target a specific protein within the body.

572,AGN,"No. 2 drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) could boost its value by $5 billion in a takeover of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), an analyst said Monday, acknowledging Bristol-specific and macro uncertainties limit the likelihood.Still, it's been a common question ""given some of the challenges Bristol-Myers Squibb is facing and the activist involvement in the name,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan says. Questions of a takeout center on the next nine to 12 months, he said in a note to clients.""Pfizer commentary in our recent 'Meeting with Management' and at other investor conferences makes us think they are certainly looking at all possibilities when it comes to business development,"" he wrote.Overall, Credit Suisse sees Bristol having a positive impact on Pfizer's return on capital. An all-cash deal, assuming Pfizer pays a 25% premium and can extract 30% synergies, would lead to value creation of 80 cents a share.But if Pfizer opts for a cash-and-stock deal, ""dilution from issuing 'undervalued' shares will offset the initial value creation,"" analysts wrote. ""A deal partially financed with an 18% stock issuance would be a break-even for Pfizer shareholders.""IBD'S TAKE: Bristol-Myers has two immuno-oncology drugs approved, meaning it competes against other FDA-approved treatments from Roche and Merck. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown of this drug sector.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Bristol was up fractionally to 56.04 while Pfizer ticked up 0.5% to 34.18. Shares of Bristol have been under pressure this year and are down 4.4% since January.Activist investor Carl Icahn reportedly took a stake in Bristol-Myers in February. Icahn is known for his investments in companies like PayPal (PYPL), Xerox (XRX) and Allergan (AGN). Jana Partners, another activist investor, bought a stake in Bristol in during the fourth quarter.That, compounded with added pressure from the likes of Merck (MRK) and Roche (RHHBY) are adding to macro uncertainties for Bristol-Myers. In February, Bristol lost share in the immuno-oncology market to Merck while Roche remained flat on a month-over-month basis.RELATED:Bristol-Myers Partner Hits 18-Month High On Immuno-Oncology DealMerck Could Be Nearing This Rival With Another Keytruda ApprovalIncyte Spikes To Record High On Rumors Gilead Could Acquire It

574,AGN,"To satisfy the Trump administration's calls to deal with high U.S. drug costs, one industry leader is proposing that the president lead negotiations with drugmakers to restrain prices.Allergan (AGN) Chief Executive Brent Saunders cited tactics used by President John F. Kennedy decades ago to keep down steel prices. The administration also could waive federal antitrust rules that currently prohibit drugmakers from discussing pricing so they could put together guidelines to follow, he said.Voluntary agreements that restrain prices are ""a very practical solution that doesn't, in my view, do anything to impede innovation,"" Saunders said Wednesday in an interview at Bloomberg's headquarters in New York. Convincing fellow drugmakers to agree with him, however, could be a challenge.""It would be difficult,"" Saunders said.Big Pharma is under intense pressure to come up with ways to reduce prices after President Trump accused the companies of ""getting away with murder"" and threatened to use the government's buying power to force prices down.Saunders has been outspoken against excessive price hikes in his own industry. At Allergan, an $80 billion company whose products range from wrinkle treatment Botox to stomach and schizophrenia medicines, the CEO has implemented a ""social contract"" that caps increases at 10% annually.Trump ""could model something like that with the pharmaceutical industry — maybe that could look like something like our social contract,"" Saunders said. ""It's easy for me to suggest when we're already doing it, just to be transparent,"" he added. Asked about a targeted amount under restraint agreements, he said low single digits, or about the rate of inflation.Pharmaceutical giants including Novartis (NVS), Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical and AbbVie (ABBV) also have taken voluntary actions to cap price increases. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck (MRK) have taken steps to increase transparency about their prices.""The industry has moved quite a bit in three months, four months,"" Saunders said. ""But it would need another big push.""Under Saunders, Allergan has transformed itself into a specialty pharmaceutical behemoth after a series of acquisitions and the sale of its generics business. After an attempt to merge with Pfizer (PFE) Inc. in a $160 billion megadeal that was abandoned last year, Allergan has focused on smaller purchases.Allergan's shares are down compared with the rest of the industry. Over the last 12 months, they've lost 14%, compared with a 7.6% gain in the 25-company Standard and Poor's 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences Index, which includes Allergan.Rather than another transformational deal, Saunders is more interested in building up Allergan's main therapeutic areas, including medical aesthetics and dermatology, eye care, central nervous system and gastroenterology. In the past two months, he's made two acquisitions worth a combined $5 billion to add to Allergan's aesthetic-medicine and cosmetic-surgery lines.Hair restoration and skin quality are the next frontiers, he said. The company is currently doing research in both of those areas.""Those are huge unmet needs,"" he said.When asked about Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) whose assets include the Bausch & Lomb eye-care company that he once led, Saunders says he's not interested — not even ""in pieces.""Valeant didn't respond to a request seeking comment.

575,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) is buying fat-freezing company Zeltiq Aesthetics (ZLTQ) for $2.475 billion, the Botox maker said early Monday, sending Zeltiq stock to a record high near the offer price.Zeltiq's flagship product, CoolScultping, is FDA approved to remove unwanted fat cells without affecting the surrounding tissue. Body sculpting is a $4 billion market, and will become the third pillar of Allergan's global aesthetic company, Allergan said in its announcement.Zeltiq stock, which debuted in 2011, lifted 13.2% to 55.93 in the stock market today. Allergan's offer comes to $56.50 a share. Allergan stock edged up 0.2% to 246.88, close to a seven-month high.The deal is expected to close in Q2, subject to approval by Zeltiq's shareholders. Acquiring Zeltiq will be immediately accretive to Allergan's earnings, Allergan said.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan promised last year not to raise drug prices more than 10% per year in a ""social contract"" with patients, drawing some ire from Celgene's CEO. Read on for Mark Alles' response at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference.Allergan said in a release Monday it's aiming to marry its plastic surgery and regenerative medicines businesses to body sculpting. The ""three distinct, complementary businesses (will) converge to create optimal customer experience,"" the company said.""With CoolSculpting, our offerings to plastic surgeons, dermatologists and aesthetic practitioners will now extend to three of the largest and fastest-growing segments of their practices, putting Allergan in a unique position to provide expanded customer service, and help meet the needs of patients,"" CEO Brent Saunders said in the news release.Zeltiq is only the most recent Allergan acquisition. In December, Allergan said it would acquire LifeCell, a specialist in regenerative medicine, for $2.9 billion. That followed announcements to acquire Chase Pharmaceuticals and Motus Therapeutics.In September, Allergan announced four deals worth a total $2.4 billion: RetroSense Therapeutics, Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Tobira Therapeutics and Akarna Therapeutics. With Tobira and Akarna, Allergan is boosting its liver, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, offerings.RELATED:Intercept Bounds To 3-Month High On NASH Trial Edits; Analysts SplitAllergan Leads Drug Stocks On View-Crushing Q4, 2016, 2017 GuidanceEndo Resolves FTC Antitrust Suit, But Allergan Hanging; Stocks Mixed

576,AGN,"\Hologic (HOLX) announced a $1.65 billion plan to acquire body-sculpting firm Cynosure (CYNO) early Tuesday, a day after Allergan (AGN) said it would pay $2.5 billion for fat-freezing Zeltiq (ZLTQ).But investors were more forgiving of Allergan's purchase. Hologic stock fell 2.5% to 39.03 in the stock market today, touching a two-month low. Cynosure stock lifted 28%, near the purchase price of $66 a share and flirting with an all-time high.The all-cash transaction has a $1.44 billion enterprise value of net cash, the company said, and is subject to approval by Cynosure stockholders.Hologic, a leader in women's health, sees Cynosure as its ticket to the medical aesthetics market. Cynosure's portfolio includes more than 20 products in body sculpting, hair removal and skin revitalization.IBD'S TAKE: Hologic has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 73, meaning it outperforms nearly three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics like sales performance. But it's only ranked 10th in the 59-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. Masimo stock leads with a CR of 93. Head to IBD's Stock Checkup for the top five performers.Cynosure goes after the obstetrics and gynecological markets to make its sales — about 60% of its revenue is derived from that market vs. traditional plastic surgery and dermatology. Hologic has a strong presence in the OB/GYN market.The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings per share ex items, adding 3-5 cents in 2017. In 2018, that will grow to 13-15 cents, Hologic said in a press release. The transaction also fills the hole left when Hologic divested its blood screening business.Hologic estimates the deal will help grow revenue by 150 base points and increase EPS ex items by double digits over the next several years. By year five, the return on interest will exceed Hologic's cost of capital, the company said.""We had identified medical aesthetics as an attractive and complementary growth opportunity through our strategic planning process, and are pleased to have agreed to acquire Cynosure, the best-in-class company in the space,"" Hologic CEO Steve MacMillan said in the company's news release.The medical aesthetics market is worth more than $2 billion annually across the globe, Hologic said. On Monday, Allergan put a $4 billion price tag on body sculpting alone when it announced its plan to buy Zeltiq, which uses a technique to freeze fat cells.Zeltiq stock hit an all-time high, in response. Allergan stock closed up a fraction, and it rose 0.69% on Tuesday, to 248.47.

579,AGN,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) is likely to succeed in a phase three nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) trial after the FDA blessed key changes, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Friday as the company's shares rocketed to a three-month high.On the stock market today, Intercept stock lifted 5.2% to 118.51, after earlier hitting its highest point since November, up 8.8% at 122.66. The stock has been consolidating since September, remaining far from its 173.04 entry point and trading below its 200-day moving average.The Food and Drug Administration allowed Intercept to reduce the number of patients in its phase three trial of Ocaliva in NASH to 750 from 1,400. Enrollment is expected to wrap by mid-2017 and, with a 72-week treatment period, data will likely be ready by year's end 2019.Ocaliva already is approved for primary biliary cholangitis, a rare liver disease. Now, Intercept is among a growing throng of companies aiming at the NASH market. Novartis (NVS), Allergan (AGN) and Genfit are also working on NASH drugs. Gilead Sciences (GILD), though, bowed out in November.IBD'S TAKE: Intercept stock has a low Composite Rating of 16, meaning it underperforms 8 out of 10 stocks in terms of growth metrics like sales and earnings power. Head to IBD's Stock Checkup to see how biotech's biggest leaders stack up. (Hint: The No. 1 company has a CR of 95 out of 99.)Intercept stands a good chance of meeting its endpoint in the phase three trial, Yee wrote. Per the FDA, Ocaliva must only meet one of two co-endpoints: improvement in fibrosis or NASH resolution. Previously, the drug had to meet both endpoints.The FDA also agreed to a standard definition of NASH resolution as an improvement of ballooning to zero or residual/no inflammation. Under the new definition, Ocaliva showed in phase two a statistically significant reduction in fibrosis and hit NASH resolution in 20% of patients.""Because of these changes and the calculation, they are well overpowered to hit on this with fewer patients,"" Yee wrote in his research report. He sees a 65%-75% chance of success for Ocaliva's approval in NASH.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz, though, noted the ""questionable"" safety profile of Ocaliva, and wondered whether that could be the reasoning behind slow enrollment. Ocaliva resulted in itching in patients with primary biliary cholangitis. Meanwhile, others like Genfit aren't having problems filling trials.Schwartz is much more bearish on Intercept's chances of success in the trial. He has a market perform rating on Intercept stock vs. Yee's outperform rating.""It is discouraging that enrolling the 1,400-patient cohort was unattainable in a timely manner, and we are not convinced that this raises the probability of success in this trial,"" he wrote in a research report.RELATED:Conatus Pharma Doubles On Novartis NASH Licensing DealAllergan Challenges Intercept With Tobira NASH Drug

Facebook shares initially tumbled but rose modestly for the week.Amazon fell 4.4% Wednesday, undercutting its 50-day line, on a report that President Trump wants to ""go after"" the e-commerce giant. Trump has long been critical of Amazon, perhaps in part because CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. The White House denied any plans to target Amazon.

Fellow FANG Netflix (NFLX) found support at its 50-day line.Shares of Lululemon (LULU) soared 12% to record highs for the week. The athletic apparel maker and retailer beat estimates across the board and raised full-year guidance. EPS rose 33% to $1.33 as revenue grew nearly 18% to $929 million. In North America, where peers like Nike (NKE) have struggled, Lululemon sales grew in the low single digits. And online sales popped 42% in constant currency on top of 12% prior-year growth.

The annual inflation rate edged up to 1.6% from 1.5%, an 11-month high. Inflation is far below the Fed's 2% target, and there's enough doubt about corporate pricing power. So inflation will have to rise further to pressure Fed policymakers to hike rates more than three times this year. Commerce Department data on Thursday showed that disposable personal income rose 0.4% in February, but spending rose a modest 0.2%. That suggests people may initially be saving their tax cuts. Consumers ended 2017 on a strong note. Fourth-quarter GDP was revised up to 2.9% from 2.5%.Biotech stocks collectively rose to sixth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD last week, but news was more mixed among big movers.

581,AGN,"A dozen drugs launching in 2018 from heavy hitters like Roche (RHHBY), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are expected to reach blockbuster status by the end of 2022, an analytics firm says.Clarivate Analytics describes 2018 as ""the year of the blockbuster,"" in which these 12 drugs have either launched or are expected to launch, and eventually bring in north of $1 billion in sales over a five-year period. That's the biggest number since Clarivate began making its forecast in 2013.It's setting up ""to be an exciting year that will see valuable additions to existing treatments as well as disruptions to certain markets and first-in-class treatment options for some diseases,"" the firm said in its report, issued late Thursday.By the end of 2022, three drugs from Roche, Gilead and Novo Nordisk (NVO) are expected to top $3 billion each in annual sales with the remaining nine likely to account for $1 billion to $2 billion a year in revenue, analysts said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmong the 12 are two diabetes drugs, a Food and Drug Administration-approved medicine derived from cannabis plants and the first in a series of drugs expected to prevent migraines in some patients. In all, these dozen drugs are projected to collectively top $22.5 billion in sales in 2022.Roche's Hemlibra, a treatment for some patients with hemophilia A, tops the list and is expected to generate north of $4 billion in sales in 2022. Though there only 350,000 hemophilia A patients in the world — with roughly 30% of them eligible for Hemlibra — the treatment costs $482,000 the first year and $448,000 every year after that.The drug was approved three months early and launched in December 2017. Sales of $496 million are forecast for 2018 with the drug set to reach blockbuster status in 2019 at a forecasted $1.46 billion.Hemlibra is expected to take share from Shire's (SHPG) Feiba and Novo Nordisk's NovoSeven.Hemlibra also will compete against Bioverativ's (BIVV) Eloctate and Shire's Advate. For 2018, Eloctate was forecast to be a blockbuster, but Advate will continue to be the market leader with an estimated $1.8 billion in sales.""However, (Advate) sales are forecast to decline further thereafter,"" the Clarivate report said.Gilead's Biktarvy grabbed approval in February and targets an estimated 37 million people globally living with HIV. Of those, 21 million are receiving antiretroviral therapy which suppresses viral replication and allows the immune system to strengthen.Biktarvy adds to Gilead's HIV franchise which has long rivaled that of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The two have traded market share since 2006 when Gilead first entered the market with Atripla. Two of Gilead's HIV drugs were featured in Clarivate's 2016 Drugs to Watch report.In 2019, Biktarvy will become a blockbuster, generating $2.28 billion in sales before spiking to $4.3 billion in 2021 and declining to $3.72 billion in 2022, the report says. The trajectory is similar to GSK drug Triumeq, which is expected to bring in $3.68 billion this year, five years after its launch.Rounding out the top three, Novo Nordisk got approval for diabetes drug Ozempic in December. The drug helps stimulate the body's own insulin release and limit how much sugar gets into the blood from the liver, and slows down how quickly food leaves the stomach.Ozempic is expected to become a blockbuster in 2020 with $1.58 billion in revenue on its way to $3.47 billion in 2022.In 2017, immuno-oncology treatments from Novartis (NVS) and Gilead grabbed headlines for ""their ability to revolutionize the treatment of the disease,"" the report said. And more than half of all drugs on the potential blockbuster list were cancer therapies.But in 2018 just one drug on the list of expected blockbusters is a cancer treatment.Erleada, a product of Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson, was approved in February to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer that hasn't spread across the body. J&J and fellow Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) have drugs that treat the same cancer once it's spread.""While Zytiga and Xtandi battle to expand their market share, including the market for patients with non-metastatic disease, J&J's second-generation oral anti-androgen, Erleada, became the first approved in that setting in mid-February 2018,"" Clarivate said.The drug is projected to bring in $1.2 billion in 2020 and rise to $2 billion in 2022. It also could be expanded to treat other forms of prostate cancer and in combination with J&J's Zytiga contribute to its blockbuster potential.In 2021, GSK's shingles vaccine, called Shingrix, and a rare disease drug from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) known as patisiran are expected to join the blockbuster list with $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in sales, respectively.Revenue is expected to hit a respective $1.37 billion and $1.21 billion in 2022.GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) is expected to grab approval this summer for the first cannabidiol drug derived from the cannabis plant to treat patients with two seizure disorders. In 2022, the drug, called Epidiolex, is expected to generate $1.19 billion in sales.""If approved, Epidiolex will likely encounter bureaucratic barriers to distribution and political hurdles associated with cannabis-derived medicines, particularly in the U.S., where strict guidelines for use of medicinal cannabis exist,"" the report said.But the biotech isn't alone in this market. Cara Pharmaceuticals (CARA), Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (ZYNE) are also working on treatments based on the cannabis plant.A migraine drug from Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis, Aimovig, is projected to bring in $115 million in 2018 sales before spiking to $1.17 billion in 2022 sales. This drug, and others like it, seek to prevent migraines by blocking a specific peptide, or group of amino acids.If approved, Aimovig would be the first drug known as an anti-CGRP to market, ahead of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Eli Lilly (LLY). Allergan (AGN) also is working in this area.""A first-in-class mover advantage will be crucial for Aimovig since competition from two other subcutaneously administered monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP is not far behind,"" Clarivate said. Lilly and Teva filed for FDA approval of their drugs late last year.Meanwhile, Alder is in Phase 3 testing with its drug. Analysts are worried, though, that Alder may falter in submitting its application to the FDA after co-founder Randall Schatzman unexpectedly stepped down from his chief executive role on Tuesday.In other areas, Shire's lanadelumab, a treatment for a swelling disorder, is forecast to bring in $1.15 billion in 2022. Next is AbbVie's (ABBV) Elagolix, a treatment for painful symptoms associated with menstruation.Rounding out the list, Pfizer and Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Steglatro and Indivior's opioid dependence drug Sublocade are forecast to become blockbusters in 2022 with $1.09 billion and $1.07 billion in sales, respectively.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

582,AGN,"Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) could successfully compete with larger rivals Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) in preventing chronic migraines, a pair of analysts said Tuesday.X The comments come in the wake of Alder's results last week of a Phase 3 trial in chronic migraines in which more than 60% of patients saw a reduction in days where they're afflicted with migraines. The company also said it resolved a patent dispute over its drug, eptinezumab, with Teva and found $250 million in equity financing.""Alder is turning things around in 2018,"" Needham analyst Danielle Brill said in a note to clients. She has a buy rating and a 26 price target on the stock.Despite the bullish note, Alder toppled 5.3% to close at 16.90 on the stock market today. Shares rocketed 36% over two days after Alder revealed the results of its Phase 3 eptinezumab trial on Jan. 8. The stock broke out of a cup formation at a 13.35 buy point on Jan. 3.Eptinezumab is being developed as an intravenous treatment to prevent chronic migraines. It belongs to a class of drugs called anti-CGRPs and competes against rival drugs from Amgen, Lilly and Teva.In the Phase 3 trial, 15% of patients treated with eptinezumab had no migraines for three months. A third of patients achieved a 75% or greater reduction in migraine days from baseline through month three, and 61% saw their migraine days cut in at least half over that time.""We believe the data also showcased intravenous eptinezumab's differentiated profile,"" Brill said. ""Rapidity of onset, and magnitude of benefit with intravenous eptinezumab were clearly distinguished from subcutaneous (injection) competitors' data.""IBD'S TAKE: Alder stock rose to an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 84 out of a best-possible 99 last week, though has since fallen to a 79. Visit IBD Data Stories for what goes into an RS Rating and what prompted Alder's spike.A specialist cited by Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan prefers the intravenous route for eptinezumab ""because it will lead to regular office visits by patients where he can monitor their progress and ensure proper compliance to therapy.""Alder is likely to be fourth to the market with an anti-CGRP, Divan said in a note to clients. Analysts had worried that would put Alder at a disadvantage to its larger rivals. But, like Needham's Brill, Divan sees eptinezumab as differentiated.Still, Alder and its rivals will face the same insurer obstacles and competition from likely less costly treatments like Allergan's (AGN) Botox, he said. In the U.S., about 40% of Botox sales come from use in chronic migraines.""Based on the cost of novel therapies, it is possible payers may push patients to try older (off-label) therapies as well as Botox before patients are given access to CGRP antibodies,"" Divan said. ""But over time we would assume new patients and patients who are not having satisfactory responses to Botox will move over to the CGRP antibodies.""Shares of Teva dove 3% to close at 21.41. Lilly dipped 1.9% to finish at 85.29. Amgen lost was up a fraction to close at 185.54.RELATED:Why Amgen Could Have An Edge Over These Rivals In Preventing MigrainesBiotechs Cruise On Upgrades, But Drugmakers Miss The BoatWhy This Biotech Suffered A 2-Day Headache On Rare-Disease Trial

585,AGN,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS), Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) could stoke acquisitive appetites in 2018 as large-cap biotechs struggle with slowing growth and major patent cliffs, analysts said Tuesday.X Deal-making has slowed since hitting a record high in 2015, RBC analysts said in a note to clients. The number of deals valued above $1 billion hit 17 two years ago. This year, there have been six of those mergers, including Gilead Sciences' (GILD) $11.9 billion takeover of Kite Pharma.Investors had expected Gilead's major buy to stoke more acquisitions. When that didn't come to fruition, biotech stocks suffered. But ""pent-up demand"" could prompt mergers and acquisitions to play out next year, analysts say.""Many large-cap companies generate a disproportionate share of overall revenues from a handful of blockbuster drugs — many of which are facing impending patent cliffs in the coming years,"" RBC's note said. ""The need to make up for lost sources of revenue and stimulate growth may encourage future M&A.""Gilead bought Kite after suffering major declines in its hepatitis C drug unit. But its HIV drug, tenofovir alafenamide, is likely to lose patent protection in 2025. Celgene's (CELG) cancer drug Revlimid is facing patent cliffs in 2024-26. Amgen's (AMGN) anti-inflammatory Enbrel is likely to lose protection in 2019.These three also had the most cash on hand as of their recent updates. Amgen reported $41.35 billion, Celgene had $11.76 billion and Gilead noted $29.07 billion. The remainder of large-caps in the biotech realm had under $4 billion each.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts said Monday that large-cap biotech franchises will feel the pain of competition in 2018 amid a speeding number of rival branded and generic drug approvals. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what this could mean for the likes of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Gilead and Amgen.Overall, cash positions are nearing a five-year high, analysts say. Tax reform could help. Under the most recent proposal, companies can repatriate earnings at as a 15.5% tax rate. Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) have an excess of 90% of their cash currently overseas.""However, we think it's unlikely that the majority of overseas cash would be repatriated immediately upon institution of tax reform,"" RBC analysts said. Celgene, for instance, has suggested a chunk of its foreign earnings are expected to be reinvested permanently outside the U.S.Analysts also note the average projected revenue for the next seven years for mid-cap biotechs is likely to do little to offset the losses from patent cliffs. Performance of acquirers over the past two years has been poor. Industry checks also indicate large deals are on the outs — Gilead/Kite being the exception.Still, expectations are high for mergers and acquisitions, analysts say. In a recent survey, investors cited M&A as the biggest tailwind for the group. Drug pricing is expected to be the biggest headwind in 2018. RBC analysts are slightly bullish on M&A and slightly bearish on drug pricing.""With expectations high for M&A as a major tailwind for the sector, if it does not materialize in the first half of 2018, we could see broad downside,"" RBC said.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, too, notes M&A will be important for the Big Pharma group and that it will likely come as a result of changes in tax rates for repatriation. His top pick for 2018 is J&J, though he also expects Dow's Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) to rebound.""Additional funds for dividend growth and share repurchases should also boost the overall outlook for the sector from an investor perspective,"" he said. ""We see the regulatory environment remaining generally favorable and providing more rapid paths to market for products that bring real innovation.""RELATED:Beware: Price Wars For Big Pharma, Biotech Companies On HorizonThis Biotech Stock Seen As Cheapest Among Rivals In Cancer DrugsGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

586,AGN,"A British billionaire reportedly is considering buying a stake in Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), prodding shares of the Israeli drugmaker to pop Monday despite a price-target cut following a lackluster quarter.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva jumped 8.9% to close at 12.41. Allergan (AGN) also sustained a price-target cut following its mixed report last week, and shares dipped 0.3% to close at 174.34.Len Blavatnik is looking to acquire up to a $3 billion stake in Teva, according to Reuters, which cited reports from Israeli outlets over the weekend. Teva has a $12.4 billion market cap. Shares hit a 17-year low last week after third-quarter earnings missed and Teva cut its 2017 guidance.Blavatnik could either acquire a stake in Teva through a private stock listing or by scooping up some of Allergan's 10% stake. Allergan received 10% of Teva as part of a deal last year in which it sold its generics business to Teva. Last week, Allergan said it was looking to sell that stake.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan trimmed his price target on Teva to 8 from 14, and kept his underperform rating. He expects the stock to continue to ""languish"" as investors await an updated strategic plan from new Chief Executive Kare Schultz.""Teva left a lot of questions unanswered on their conference call,"" Divan said in a note to clients. ""This is understandable since the new CEO just joined the company the day before, but the lack of insight is still frustrating.""IBD'S TAKE: At least one biotech had ""alarming"" results, though earnings were mixed for most. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on the industry group thus far in the third-quarter earnings season.Teva, the No. 2 maker of generic drugs, now finds itself on the flip side of the coin. Mylan (MYL) just launched a generic version of Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis drug from Teva. Now, Divan sees Teva pulling in $1.01 billion in U.S. Copaxone sales next year, down 71% year over year.""Mylan came to market immediately and at a price that was lower than Teva expected,"" he said.Questions also remain for Allergan, Divan said in a separate report. He cut his price target on Allergan to 224 from 243, though he kept his outperform rating. Like Teva, Allergan is soon to face generic competition for Restasis, an eye drug. It sees competition in either January or July 2018.""Our base case now assumes Restasis generic entry in the U.S. at the start of 2018, instead of mid-2018,"" he said. ""Our base 2018 EPS of $15.25 is down from our previous $16.55 in large part because of this change and what we assume would be a relatively rapid erosion in sales.""Generics could also pressure Namenda EX (extended release), Estrace, Delzicol and Aczone, drugs to treat dementia, a menopausal side effect, ulcerative colitis and a type of acne, respectively.Divan also lowered his estimate for Kybella, a drug to reduce fat under the chin, ""given the limited commercial progress that product has made.""

590,AGN,"Drugmaker Allergan (AGN) got a price-target cut from Canaccord Genuity Thursday after the company hit a delay in its merger with Pfizer (PFE), among other issues.Analyst Corey Davis noted that on Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had asked for additional information on the Pfizer-Allergan merger, which was first announced in November. The companies also have to wait until Allergan finishes divesting its generic-drug business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), which itself hit a delay this month that caused Teva to push the expected closing date from Q1 to June. Pfizer and Allergan still expect to close their $160 billion merger in the second half of this year.""In the meanwhile, we are lowering our Q1 estimates (EPS drops from $3.43 to $2.89) as it's always the weakest quarter for specialty pharma, and we feel the rest of the Street is also too high,"" Davis wrote in his research note lowering his price target on Allergan stock to 320 from 340. ""This has been a trend in the past several years and is partly because of the reset of Medicare Part D.""Davis added that the merger of Target (TGT) and CVS Health (CVS) should hit Allergan's distribution business to the tune of $500 million a year, and the launch of bowel-disease drug Viberzi has increased spending.Davis wrote that he is nonetheless maintaining his buy rating due to the high likelihood that the deal will close. There has been some skepticism among investors over whether the Pfizer-Allergan deal is going to close this year -- besides the signals from Allergan's falling stock price, a buy-side survey by Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum this month found that a fifth of respondents place the odds at less than 50%. Along with the FTC's backlog, there's concern that the incoming president and Congress might do something to limit tax-inversion deals like this one, as some candidates have threatened to do.Pfizer's leadership and Wall Street analysts have been more confident, however. On March 8, Deutsche Bank analyst Gregg Gilbert wrote that the gap between Pfizer's offer price and Allergan's stock price -- then $47 -- presents a buying opportunity as it will likely narrow as the deal closing nears.Allergan stock was down a fraction in morning trading on the stock market today, near 274.

591,AGN,"Small biotech Alder BioPharmaceuticals (ALDR) soared more than 50% to a two-month high in early trading Monday after its migraine drug candidate succeeded in a mid-stage trial, positioning it to compete with some giant rivals.Alder said that a single intravenous infusion of its monoclonal antibody, ALD403, had significantly reduced migraine days over a 12-week period compared to a placebo. Depending on the dose, between 44% and 57% of patients experienced a 50% reduction in migraine days, while 27% to 33% experienced a 75% reduction.""Evaluation of ALD403 continues to exhibit a potential best-in-class profile, which includes immediate, significant and durable migraine prevention with infrequent quarterly dosing,"" Alder CEO Randall Schatzman said in a statement. ""With our commitment to the accelerated development of ALD403 reinforced by today's positive results, we look forward to advancing our development plan, and assuming FDA approval, independently marketing ALD403 in the U.S. to meet the critical medical needs of the 13 million patients nationwide who are candidates for migraine prevention therapy.""Alder's decision to market its drug without a big-pharma partner, unusual for a small biotech, could pit it against some very big competitors developing similar drugs. ALD403 is an anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody, similar to migraine candidates being developed by Amgen (AMGN), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Eli Lilly (LLY).Alder's drug is distinguished by its infrequent dosing: Amgen and Teva's drugs are injected once a month, while Lilly's is biweekly. It would also be competing against Allergan's (AGN) Botox, which is also quarterly but involves 31 separate shots.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote that ALD403's results seem roughly equivalent to Teva's in terms of effectiveness, but he did note that there was no significant improvement over the placebo in the number of patients who experienced a 100% reduction in migraine days. Between 4% and 8% of patients on the drug achieved this, which was rather lower than the 16% who had been headache-free in a previous trial.Alder stock, like so many other biotech stocks, had lost more than half its value since touching its all-time peak of 54.90 in July. But in early trading on the stock market today, shares were was up some 52% near 26.Image provided by Shutterstock.

592,AGN,"The Delaware Select Growth Fund (DVEAX) pulls out all the stops in its search for growth.The go-anywhere fund invests in companies of all sizes, and looks for names that are expected to grow faster than the U.S. economy over the long term. With $688 million in assets, the fund is sub-advised by a team of managers from San Francisco-based Jackson Square Partners.Year-to-date going into Tuesday, the fund is down 5.8% vs. an average decline of 3.4% from its peer large growth funds tracked by Morningstar. Over the last decade though, Delaware Select Growth has churned out an annual average return of 7.1% vs. 6.6% from the large growth category.The fund held 69 stocks as of Feb. 29, spread across varying market cap categories. By the fund's count, technology, consumer discretionary and health care are its top three weightings. The fund has an annual turnover rate of 46% versus 65% for its category average. Delaware Select Growth primarily bets on U.S. companies with 38% of its assets invested in its top 10 holdings.PayPal (PYPL) was one of those top holdings, and one of the fund's better recent performers.  The digital and mobile payments provider is up 14% so far this year. The stock was a top holding as of Feb. 29. Earnings per share rose 7%, 14%, 29% and 24% the past four quarter.Vital SignsAt the end of February, the fund's top holding was the biopharmaceutical company Celgene (CELG).  In January, the company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share growth of 17% on a 23% jump in revenue. Celgene’s top line has benefited from strong sales from its top-selling cancer drug, Revlimid.Shares of Celgene are down 16% year-to-date. Earlier this month, the biotech released drug-trial data that disappointed investors. Celgene reported phase-three disappointing results for apremilast, its experimental oral treatment for psoriasis.Delaware Select’s No. 2 position has also been making gains in the pharmaceutical space. Allergan (AGN) is coming off an impressive Q4 of its own. Botox was the company’s top revenue generator at $460 million for the quarter. The figure amounted to 13.1% of total revenue. In November, the company agreed to a blockbuster merger with Pfizer (PFE).Allergan has seen its stock price slide 12.2% since the beginning of the year. EPS growth has decelerated, growing 180%, 65% and 33% the past three quarters.Qualcomm (QCOM) was the fund’s third-largest holding and has been in the portfolio since 2005. The Delaware Select Growth team stated in its Q4 commentary that it believes the company’s mobile chip business will bounce back from 2015 ""product cycle issues that are unlikely to recur."" In a show of strength, the company recently upped its dividend by 10%.Qualcomm has seen its stock price rise 4.4% in 2016.Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) was added to the Delaware Select Growth portfolio in 2014. The company sells tracking and computer printing technologies such as barcode scanners and specialty printers. Zebra recently said it is projecting full year net sales growth of 1% to 4% for 2016. It also expects to pay down at least $300 million in debt principal.Zebra shares have declined 1.6% so far this year.In its Q4 commentary, the Delaware Select Growth team noted progress by Microsoft (MSFT), a top holding, in its shift towards cloud-based technology. ""We believe this transition should be beneficial as its software could be better utilized across multiple platforms,"" the team wrote.Shares of Microsoft have ticked down 2.9% so far this year.

""Their flat-out fear penalized stocks inordinately,"" Valeri said.In the second half, investors' fears eased. ""By mid-February, a lot of bad news was priced into stocks, and data started to get better,"" Valeri said. ""In mid-March the market got a tailwind from the Federal Reserve, which suggested it was likely to raise rates twice this year, not four times.""Click Here To View A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWeekly jobless rolls fell.

Tax-exempt bond funds gained 1.43%.""In the near term, there's good reason to think oil has stopped going down and the dollar has stopped going up,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. ""If that's the case, the market could get better in the second half of the year.""But, Doll cautions, oil has never staged a sharp rally. ""Commodities in general and oil in particular have never made a V bottom,"" he said. ""After declines, they've often had multiyear periods before going up the other side (of a price formation).""And since late March, the per-barrel price of benchmark light sweet crude oil has pulled back slightly.Also, China's economic growth is still not expanding. ""China is consciously reorienting its economy away from huge dependence on exports and capital investments and toward a longer-term, sustainable economy based on consumption,"" Doll said.Amid global economic uncertainty, U.S. stocks appear likely to remain a safe-haven attraction for investors.The technology and financial sectors appeal the most to Doll.

""When things improve and other investors get complacent, let some go (to take profits).""Doll said he will keep some telecommunications stock in his portfolio. ""I want some defense in there,"" he said. Instead, why not utilities, which are also defensive and pay dividends? ""They're expensive now, and telecom is a better value.""Doll said he also has more appetite for consumer discretionary than staples. ""Discretionary has better valuations,"" he said. ""And staples tend to be more global, and therefore face more risk of currency headwinds.""Valeri has a similar view on some sectors. ""We're still focused on areas that benefit from further expansion,"" he said. ""That means more cyclical sectors like consumer discretionary and tech. We also have a more modest overweight to industrials.""The $1.2 billion Fidelity Select Consumer Discretionary Portfolio’s (FSCPX) recent top holdings were Amazon (AMZN), followed by Home Depot (HD), Walt Disney (DIS) and Nike (NKE).He added, ""Health care is the one defensive sector that is a focus because earnings clarity is fairly good.""Allergan (AGN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and United Healthcare (UNH) were recent top holdings of Vanguard Health Care Fund (VGHCX), which wields $46.9 billion in assets.Like Doll, Valeri is leaning away from utilities and consumer staples. Unlike Doll, he's also leaning away from telecom. ""Our expectation is for improving economic growth,"" he said. ""So those sectors won't necessarily benefit as much. Utilities and telecom are rate-sensitive, and we think rates will move gradually higher this year. So that's a headwind for those sectors.

594,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) stock dived Tuesday after the U.S. Treasury and IRS announced plans for new rules aimed at curbing tax inversions, a practice that allows U.S. companies to avoid taxes by buying a foreign company and moving their headquarters overseas.That could impact the pending deal between Pfizer (PFE) and Ireland-based Allergan -- set to close this year -- since the latter is the result of several recent inversions.The companies said in a statement late Monday: ""We are conducting a review of the U.S. Department of Treasury’s actions announced today. Prior to completing the review, we won’t speculate on any potential impact.""Allergan fell nearly 20% to 233 in premarket trading, which would be the lowest level since October 2014. Pfizer rose nearly 2%.The latest Treasury  actions would limit the ability of inverted companies to lend money to their American subsidiaries, which creates deductible interest and reduces their taxable income in the U.S., by treating certain debt issuance as stock.""Serial inverters,"" are also targeted. Under the new rules, there's a three-year limit on foreign companies ""bulking up"" on U.S. assets to avoid ownership requirements for a later inversion deal.This is the third set of inversion-curbing rules issued by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew in the last few years. Lew said his office is continuing to explore additional ways to limit inversions.America's corporate tax system gives companies a strong incentive to shift headquarters overseas. The combined federal-state corporate rate is 39%, the highest in the industrialized world, while America -- unlike most nations -- taxes overseas earnings. Inverted companies still have to pay U.S. tax rates on American profits, but are get relief on earnings elsewhere.Other notable recent inversions involved Mylan (MYL), Medtronic (MDT) and Burger King, now called Restaurant Brands (QSR). But those deals have already closed.

596,AGN,"Big Pharma player Allergan unveiled what it expects to be its final full year of operation as an independent drug maker before merging into Pfizer, reporting fourth-quarter 2015 earnings that beat expectations and revenue that barely topped Wall Street estimates.Before the market open, Allergan (AGN) said non-GAAP earnings rose 33% to $3.41 per share on a revenue gain of 74% to $4.2 billion. Both metrics exclude discontinuing operations, notably Allergan's Global Generics business that it agreed to sell in July.The Global Generics unit carries the old Actavis name and generic drugs lines of business. Actavis had purchased specialty drug and Botox maker Allergan, a deal that closed in March, and renamed itself Allergan.Allergan stock rose 3.7% in the stock market today, to 285.82, 16% off its all-time high of 340.34, touched July 29. Pfizer (PFE) stock rose 1.9% Monday to 30.05, 18% below a nearly 12-year high set July 31 at 36.46.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q4 EPS of $3.34 minus items, down 14.6% from $3.91 in 2014, on revenue of $4.192 billion, up 3.4% from Q4 2014's $4.057 billion, although analyst numbers apparently were not uniformly adjusted for discontinuing operations. Allergan presented the pro forma year-earlier numbers as adjusted EPS of $2.57 and revenue of $2.4 billion.For the full year, Allergan said non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations increased 78% to $13.43 on revenue from continuing operations up 124% to $15.07 billion. With varying adjustments, for the full 2015 analysts expected $15.43 per share minus items, up 66% from $9.29 in 2014, on sales of $18.206 billion, up 117% from $8.380 billion in 2014.Allergan reported a Q4  GAAP loss from continuing operations of $2.13 per share, compared to a GAAP loss from continuing operations of $4.48 per share in the prior-year period. It said full GAAP results were impacted by amortization and acquisition expenses, license agreements, impairments, and severance related mainly to the acquisition of Allergan on March 17,  and Kythera on Oct. 1, as well as research and development expenses resulting from the purchase of R&D assets of Mimetogen.Allergan had declined to freshen its guidance upon issuing its Q3 performance Nov. 4, citing early merger discussions with Pfizer back then. But Monday it guided 2016 revenue to about $17 billion, with ""no material changes to gross margins"" from current levels and a non-GAAP tax rate ""normalized"" to about 14%. Management didn't specify EPS for the year nor offer Q1 guidance other than suggesting Q1 performance would be the weakest of the year and fall below Q4 2015 results.Allergan's 2015 results were an analyst's challenge, influenced by its extraordinary M&A dance card. In Q3, it began discontinuing operations of the renamed Actavis generic lines, which it agreed to sell to Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) in July for $40 billion.By Nov. 23, Allergan's board agreed to Pfizer's offer of 11.3 Pfizer shares for each Allergan share, then valuing Allergan at $363.63 a share, or $160 billion for the entire deal, expected to take nine months to close. CEO Brent Saunders told analysts in a conference call following the Q4 earnings release that he still expects the Pfizer buyout to close in the second half of 2016. It would be the second-largest acquisition ever, after the sale of Vodafone AirTouch in 1999 to Mannesmann for $202 billion. Dell's October offer to buy EMC (EMC) is valued at $67 billion. The Pfizer acquisition of Allergan is another in a thinning number of tax inversion deals that allow American companies to domicile in Ireland, Allergan's home base, where the buyer may enjoy a lower tax base. The Obama administration has criticized the practice and thrown up speed bumps, if not road blocks.On Feb. 8,  Pfizer said it plans to reorganize its two broad lines of business into three after the merger with Allergan is complete.Allergan CFO Tessa Hilado told analysts that debt stood at $42.7 billion on Dec. 31 and that $8 billion would be paid down after the close of the Teva sale. She put revenue from top-seller Botox at $656 million in Q4, with eye drug Restasis at $365 million, and Namenda XR at $190 million.  She said the CVS (CVS) purchase of Target (TGT) pharmacies ""had an effect in Q4"" on revenue, but that it didn't and wouldn't impact earnings.

597,AGN,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) shares climbed as much as 11% Tuesday after the drug maker said it expects to restate earnings, but not by much overall. That may help clear the air after a congressional investigation raised questions about the company's former relationship with distributor Philidor Rx Services and questioned its pricing practices.Specialty drugmaker Valeant said in a written statement late Monday evening that an internal review and additional analysis ""identified certain sales to Philidor during 2014 ... that should have been recognized when product was dispensed to patients rather than on delivery to Philidor.""Valeant said that it currently believes that about $58 million of net revenue that was included in the second half of 2014 should have been booked later.Correcting the misstatements is expected to reduce reported 2014 GAAP earnings per share by about 10 cents to $8.24, Valeant said. But it would  increase its 2015 GAAP EPS by roughly 9 cents. Based on analyst consensus that would lift 2015 EPS to roughly $10.37.Valeant shares closed up 4.4% in the stock market today. Shares had fallen 19.3% on Friday and Monday after Wells Fargo warned of unanswered questions about the company's accounting and strategic direction. The stock fell after hours Monday when the Wall Street Journal said an earnings restatement was likely.Its stock plunged 74% from an Aug. 5, 2015 intraday high of 262.52 after the questionable numbers came to light, to a 69.33 low on Nov. 18.In the statement, Valeant noted that the sales occurred prior its earlier bid to acquire Philidor. Specialty pharmacy Philidor was suspected of filling prescriptions for Valeant that altered doctors' orders to raise insurer reimbursements, Bloomberg said in an Oct. 29 report, citing former employees and an internal document.On Oct. 30, Valeant said it was severing ties with Philidor, which subsequently began winding down operations.Interim Chief Executive Howard Schiller said in the statement the company also expects to delay filing its 2015 10-K until its completed ""review of related accounting matters by its ad hoc committee.""This determination and the need to delay our 10-K filing are very disappointing but necessary,"" Schiller said, adding,  ""We remain committed to improving reporting procedures, internal controls and transparency for our investors.Schiller was named to the post on an interim basis on Jan. 6, filling in for ailing CEO J. Michael Pearson, who is being treated for severe pneumonia and complications.Valeant will release unaudited Q4 results on Feb. 29.Private label over-the-counter and prescription generic drugmaker Perrigo's (PRGO) shares have been battered too, and fell to the lowest point in about 2-1/2 years Monday. Perrigo lost 15% in three sessions after reporting weak fourth quarter earnings last Thursday and being downgraded by analysts on earnings. Perrigo closed up 0.6%.Big pharma Allergan (AGN), which reported a 33% hike n Q4 EPS and a 74% jump in revenue Monday, rose 3.7% Monday, and finished up 0.3% Tuesday. Allergan agreed in November to be acquired by Pfizer (PFE) for $160 billion and that deal is expected to close this year.

598,AGN,"Disgraced drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) continued to sell off along with the rest of the medical sector Thursday as reports surfaced that creditors were demanding new terms as the company defaults on its massive debts.Reuters cited anonymous sources saying that in early talks, lenders were asking for higher interest payments and a pledge to pay a larger amount of the bank loans from the proceeds of any Valeant asset sales. Valeant has been in breach of its reporting covenant since Tuesday, when it missed its 10-K filing deadline, which it has 60 days to resolve. However, if it doesn't file by March 30, it will also be in default with its bank creditors and will have only 30 days to resolve the default.Valeant is about $30 billion in debt after a years-long buying spree, culminating in a failed attempt to buy Allergan (AGN) last year. Allergan subsequently merged with Actavis and is now in the process of being bought by Pfizer (PFE).By late afternoon on the stock market today, Valeant stock lost 11.5% to 29.69. Medical groups tracked by IBD, even those unrelated to drugs, accounted for the seven worst performing groups out of IBD's 197 industries. The generic drugs group led the slide with a 2.8% decline.The hardest-hit individual stocks were Valeant's fellow specialty drugmakers, some of whom have consciously followed Valeant's business model. Mallinckrodt (MNK) authorized a $350 million stock buyback but was down 4.1% to 53.42.  Endo International (ENDP), which is headed by former Valeant executive Rajiv De Silva, hit a three-year low of 27.62, trading down 11.4% to 30.03.Horizon Pharma (HZNP), which has been criticized for pricing policies much as Valeant has, was down 6.8% after selling off for the last three days.Among major drugmakers, Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbled 4.7%.

600,AGN,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Perrigo (PRGO) shares continued to tumble Monday, generally pulling the drug sector down with them. Allergan (AGN) was an exception, rising on strong earnings.Valeant late Monday tumbled as low as 68 -- which would be the lowest since March 2013 -- on a Dow Jones report that Valeant Pharmaceuticals would likely restate earnings. Hours later Valeant said a restatement for 2014 and 2015 earnings is expected, related to sales of drugs to ex-distributor Philidor. Valeant said $58 million in sales in late 2014 should have been recognized later. Valeant expects 2014 earnings to be lowered by 10 cents a share, with 2015 EPS lifted by 9 cents.During the regular session, Valeant shares closed down 10.7% at 75.92  in the stock market today, extending losses on a bearish report from Wells Fargo Friday. Valeant shares dived nearly 10% that day after Wells Fargo initiated coverage on the maker of branded drugs to treat eye diseases, acne, depression and other ailments with an underperform, saying there were ""unanswered questions"" about its accounting methods and strategic direction.Earlier Monday, drugstore giant CVS Health (CVS) said it plans to restrict use of Valeant's Jublia toenail fungus drug as part of an initiative to cut costs for dermatology treatments. Jublia retails at about $1,000 for an 8-milliliter bottle, according to the website GoodRx.Valeant stock price has plunged 69% from a Sept. 21 intraday high at 245.82 despite double-digit quarterly earnings and revenue growth for nearly four years. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund is down significantly this year partly because of the fund's large stake in Valeant.Valeant had already been battered by a series of events including the absence of CEO J. Michael Pearson, who is being treated for severe pneumonia and complications. On Jan. 6, Valeant's board named board member and former Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller A interim CEO.Earlier this month, Valeant interim CEO Schiller was called before Congress to explain why the company decided to increase the prices of two cardiac drugs by 525% and 212%. Schiller promised to end an era of sharp price hikes.Perrigo, whose business model is divided between private-label over-the-counter and prescription generic drugs, fell 4.1% to 124.08 Monday to its lowest level since late 2013.The stock has lost 15% over three sessions, after Perrigo reported weak fourth quarter results on Thursday and subsequently had negative reports by Jefferies on Friday and by Goldman Sachs on Monday.Jefferies cut its price target to 163 from 209 although it maintained a buy rating. Goldman Sachs, however, downgraded the stock from neutral to sell, with a 124 price target, reports said.Perrigo reported $1.80 Q4 EPS minus one-time items, 13 cents below estimates. It was the company's first earnings miss in five quarters. Revenue grew 33% to $1.425 billion. Analysts expected $1.461 billion.Mylan (MYL) last year made an offer for Perrigo, which Perrigo shareholders in mid-November rejected. Mylan rose 3.2% Monday.Big pharma Allergan (AGN) reported what it expects to be its final full earnings report as an independent drug maker after it agreed in November to be bought by Pfizer (PFE) for $160 billion.Allergan's Q4 EPS ex items rose 33% to $3.41 on a 74% hike in revenue to $4.2 billion. Wall Street expected $3.34 EPS and $4.19 billion revenue.Allergan shares climbed 3.7% to 285.82. Pfizer rose 1.9%.But IBD's generic drugs and ethical (branded) drug groups were among the rare losers on an otherwise strong day for stocks.

601,AGN,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) announced Monday that after it closes its acquisition of Allergan (AGN) it plans to reorganize its three units into two, pending a possible split-up.Back in 2013, Pfizer reorganized its operations into three business units: Innovative Products; Established Products and Vaccines; and Oncology and Consumer Healthcare (VOC). This was widely viewed as a preparation for a split-up of the company. With its pending $160 billion buyout of Allergan,  Pfizer will be adding a large number of drugs, including the wrinkle treatment Botox and a variety of eye-care and skin-care products.On Monday, Pfizer said it plans to combine the innovative products and VOC businesses into one, but that will include a new subdivision called Global Specialty and Consumer Brands that will include most of Allergan's products. The larger Innovative Products business will be headed by current VOC head Albert Bourla, replacing Geno Germano who will leave the company. The new Global Specialty and Consumer Brands division will be headed by Allergan executive Bill Meury. The Established Products business will continue to be led by John Young.Allergan's current CEO Brenton Saunders, meanwhile, is set to become the next president and chief operating officer of Pfizer. It was generally expected on Wall Street that he would land a high-ranking position so that he could be ready to succeed present Pfizer CEO Ian Read.When Pfizer announced the Allergan buyout last year, it said that a decision on a split-up will not be made until 2018, which was a couple of years later than previously expected. Read reiterated this in Monday's announcement.""We are designing the combined company to preserve and enhance our option to potentially separate the innovative and established businesses into separate companies in the future, and continue to expect to make a decision about any potential separation by no later than the end of 2018,"" Read said in a statement.Pfizer stock was down about 1.8% in midday trading on the stock market today, near 28.50. Allergan was down about 3.6% near 264.

602,AGN,"Mark Finn never saw a market sell-off he didn't like. As portfolio manager of the $21.2 billion T. Rowe Price Value Fund (TRVLX), Finn often uses the dips to set up long-term positions in his mutual fund.The recent December-to-January stock market pullback presented its own set of opportunities for Finn. ""It has been a GDP-scare sell-off,"" he said ""People are worried the economy might tip back into a recession, so cyclicality is on sale right now. What I am looking for in particular are companies where I can get a really attractive dividend yield and (which) generate a lot of free cash flow and (which have) been cheapened because they're perceived to be cyclical business.""Finn is ready to pick his spots should more pullbacks occur in the months ahead. ""I am not overly optimistic about the market overall,"" he said. ""If we end the year flat to where we began, I think that would be as expected. In the interim, I'm getting chances to buy some really good companies with dividend yields of close to 5% that are trading at P/E multiples of 9 or 10 times.""T. Rowe Price Value was down 5.79% year to date going into Thursday vs. declines of 5.61% for its large-cap value peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 5.25% for the S&P 500. Over the past five years, the mutual fund has returned an annual average of 9.90%, beating its peers' 7.58% but trailing the S&P 500's 10.46%.The fund carries an IBD 36-Month Performance Rating of A-, meaning it's among the top 10% of all mutual funds in three-year performance.Finn relies upon a robust team of research analysts to help with fundamental stock picking. “We are opportunistically trying to identify and invest in quality companies that are facing some controversy or perceived controversy that we have determined are trading below intrinsic value,” he said. “When we have a good idea, we make it a big position to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders.”As of the end of 2015, General Electric (GE) was T. Rowe Price Value's top holding. Finn is optimistic that GE’s renewed focus on its industrial businesses will help increase margins over time. ""It has been one of the best-performing industrial companies over the last one, three and five years,"" he said. ""I think GE is going to continue to relatively outperform in industrials. They have really figured out what their mission is.""GE has seen its stock price climb 15.9% over the past year. The shares were up almost 1% in the stock market today.Pfizer (PFE), another top holding, has sunk 16% below its 52-week high. ""It has fallen back because of its Allergan (AGN) acquisition, but Pfizer is a phenomenal company with a really nice pipeline of products, and it now has a really good yield,"" Finn said.Pfizer is down 13% from a year ago, but sports a 4.0% dividend yield.In the energy sector, Finn has a favorable outlook for Exelon (EXC). ""It has a great dividend yield, and it looks like there may be a cyclical bottom coming in energy,"" he said.Shares of Exelon yield 4.0% and have gained 12% so far this year.Holdings that Finn sees as undervalued also include International Paper (IP) and AES (AES). “These are companies trading at around a 5% dividend yield, and the market perceives them as being cyclical and risky, but I really don't,” he said.

"
605,AGN,"Big pharma Pfizer fulfilled weeks of rumors Monday, announcing a deal to buy specialty-drug giant Allergan in a stock swap valued at $160 billion, heating up the political debate over tax-inversion deals.Pfizer (PFE) agreed to provide Allergan (AGN) shareholders with 11.3 Pfizer shares for each Allergan share , which — based on Friday's closing price — values Allergan at $363.63 a share.This price was somewhat lower than last week's anonymously sourced press reports pegging the price at $370 to $380 a share. But it was still a 16% premium on Allergan's Friday closing price.That makes the deal the second-largest M&A ever, said Thomson Reuters, behind only Mannesmann's $202 billion acquisition of Vodafone AirTouch in 1999. It's more than twice the value of the largest tech coupling ever, the $67 billion merger of Dell and EMC (EMC) announced in October.But the terms disappointed investors. Allergan stock fell 3.4% and Pfizer fell 2.6% on Monday. (Pfizer's drop lowered the value of the deal to $354.03 per Allergan share.)As expected, the deal will allow Pfizer to perform a tax inversion and domicile in Allergan's official homeland of Ireland, which will lead Pfizer to rename itself Pfizer PLC at the expected close of the deal in about nine months.Pfizer said that the inversion would result in a pro forma tax rate of 17% to 18%, which would cut more than $1 billion from the company's tax bill. Overall, Pfizer expects some $2 billion in cost savings in the first three years of the combination, though it doesn't forecast earnings accretion until 2018.Allergan shareholders will end up owning about 44% of the combined company, which should steer it clear of last week's new Treasury guidelines attempting to tighten the rules on such tax-inversion deals. Those rules targeted more lopsided deals in which the U.S. acquirer tries to redomicile while still owning more than 80% of the company.'Full' Tax BenefitsOn a conference call with analysts Monday morning discussing the merger, Pfizer CEO Ian Read said that he expects to realize the ""full benefits"" of a tax inversion, though he hastened to add that trimming the tax bill wasn't the only reason for the deal.He said that one pleasant surprise in Pfizer's due diligence was discovering the strength of Allergan's drug franchises — which, he says, Pfizer can further expand abroad, thanks to its vast global infrastructure.""Allergan expands our leadership position by bringing very strong franchises in aesthetics, dermatology, eye care, GI (gastrointestinal diseases), women's health, urology and anti-infectives,"" Read said. ""Some of you may remember that several years ago, Pfizer decided to exit or de-prioritize these areas, not because they were unattractive but because we did not have the scale, expertise or market-leading positions to be competitive. With Allergan, we gain access to expertise and market-leading products in these areas.""Read said that this lack of overlap between the two companies' product lines was one reason why the $2 billion projection in cost savings was somewhat lower than what analysts expected. He said that Pfizer plans to keep most of Allergan's operations and employees in Southern California — where it was originally headquartered before M&A brought it the Irish domicile — implying that there will not be big layoffs.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum theorized on a webinar for clients that preserving U.S. jobs might also be a way to deflect criticism for depriving the U.S. of tax income.If so, it didn't entirely work, as Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both criticized the deal Monday.""In the weeks ahead, I will propose specific steps to prevent these kind of transactions, which take advantage of loopholes that litter our tax code, distort incentives for investment and disadvantage small businesses and domestic firms that cannot game the international tax system,"" Clinton said in a statement.The buyout deal includes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, but it's likely that any real change to the legal regime would come only after a new president and Congress are sworn in early 2017, which is after the deal is expected to close, say analysts.Edison Investment analyst Maxim Jacobs, however, said that the Federal Trade Commission might look askance at such an enormous entity, even if it passes the Treasury's restrictions.""Although the Pfizer/Allergan deal appears to have been consummated and is attractive to both sides, the U.S. regulatory reaction to this very high-profile merger remains an unknown and may very well be negative due to the size of the tax inversion,"" Jacobs wrote in an email.Read will remain chairman and CEO of the combined company, while Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will become president and chief operating officer. This arrangement seemed to support pre-deal speculation that Saunders was being viewed as a potential successor to Read, who's 15 years older than Saunders.Pfizer also said that it will delay until 2018 making a decision about splitting up its innovative and established (i.e., old and generic) products into two or three businesses, a move that had been expected next year.Analysts on the call weren't happy about the delay, but Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said that he still expects the split to happen eventually.""Ultimately, the cash flows of the combined entity likely will quickly exceed $25 billion, but without a split, we believe that overall operational complexity is likely to be too high to drive innovative growth,"" Fernandez wrote in a research note.

606,AGN,"Dow Chemical (DOW) and DuPont (DD) are in advanced talks to create a chemicals giant, according to multiple reports, in what could cap a record year for merger activity, including last month's $160 billion deal for Pfizer (PFE) to buy Allergan (AGN).The merged Dow-DuPont firm would then split into three separately traded companies, according to the Wall Street Journal and CNBC's David Faber. The firms would be for agriculture, material services and specialty products.Dow Chemical closed Tuesday with a market cap of $59 billion, while DuPont was valued at $58.4 billion. Dow CEO Andrew Liveris was expected to become executive chairman of the merged firm. DuPont CEO Edward Breen, who took over only in October, is expected to hold the same position post-merger. Faber reported a merger deal is likely by Thursday.Both companies have been under pressure to shed slower-growth units. DuPont reportedly had sought to merge its agricultural assets with Syngenta (SYT). Syngenta had rebuffed overtures from Monsanto (MON).M&A activity has topped $4.3 billion in 2015, eclipsing the old record set in 2007. Pfizer's tax inversion deal with Allergan is the largest of the year and the big drug takeover ever.

"
656,AGN,"Pfizer (PFE) is near a massive deal to buy Allergan (AGN) and redomicile in Ireland, multiple reports said, even as the Treasury Department plans to impose new restrictions on tax inversions.Pfizer are discussing a deal that would pay $370-$380 a share for Botox maker Allergan, Bloomberg and Reuters reported late Wednesday. Allergan rose 4.5% to 310.83 on Wednesday, but retreated after hours following news of the inversion rules. Allergan traded as low as 237.50 on Oct. 21 before Pfizer-Allergan deal buzz picked up. Pfizer rose 1.3% to 33.31 on Wednesday, and was little changed late Wednesday.At $380 a share, it would be a $150 billion takeover, the largest health care deal ever and the biggest takeover of any kind this year.Bloomberg said the companies want to announce a deal as soon as Monday while Reuters said an announcement was not necessarily imminent. Both said that the Treasury's Wednesday announcement to issue ""targeted"" tax inversion guidance later this week could affect the timing of any agreement.By acquiring the Irish drugmaker, Pfizer would be able to limit its exposure to the punitive U.S. corporate tax system. America's corporate rates are the highest in the industrial world and the country taxes U.S. companies' overseas profits when they are repatriated.The Treasury issues restrictions on tax inversions in September 2014. That stopped an AbbVie (ABBV) acquisition, but deals involving Burger King (now Restaurant Brands (QSR), Medtronic (MDT) and Mylan (MYL) went ahead.It's unclear what new limits Treasury will impose, but the Obama administration can't ban inversions outright. In addition to the inversion benefits, Pfizer would beef up its brand-name drugs, and boost its pipeline of treatments in mid- or late-stage trials.Pfizer could use the Allergan deal to lead to a Pfizer breakup into two or three companies.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.
"
657,AGN,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) was reportedly near a deal to acquire Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) on Thursday, even as the Treasury Department said it would put out new guidance to cut the economic benefits of such deals.Pfizer and Allergan confirmed rumors that they were in such talks late last month, but details such as price were left to Wall Street speculation. Late Wednesday, however, Bloomberg and Reuters both reported that the price had been set in the range of $370 to $380 a share, which would total up to $157 billion. Bloomberg said the deal could be announced ""as soon as Monday,"" but CNBC said Thursday that the announcement is expected the following Monday.All this came just hours after Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew sent a letter to the Senate Finance Committee criticizing tax-inversion deals, in which a U.S. company acquires a smaller company in a lower-tax domicile in a sort of reverse acquisition that allows the U.S. company to relocate and cut its tax bill. Pfizer already tried to do this last year by acquiring British drug giant AstraZeneca (AZN) but was rebuffed, so the pursuit of Dublin-based Allergan is generally seen as an alternative inversion deal.Lew said in his letter that later this week Treasury will issue ""targeted guidance to deter and reduce further the economic benefits of corporate inversions."" Treasury had previously issued guidelines to that effect back in September 2014, which, as Evercore ISI policy analyst Terry Haines points out, never resulted in any actual changes of rules.""The 2014 'guidance' said Treasury would — but never did — propose new regulations to combat hopscotch loans; prevent restructuring of foreign subsidiaries; prevent inverted companies from transferring cash or property from a controlled foreign corporation to avoid U.S. tax; and strengthen its interpretation of the ownership rule,"" Haines wrote in an email to clients. ""Treasury also said it intended to take comment on earnings stripping: That also was not done.""Just What Can Treasury Do?In his letter, Lew boasted that his guidelines did slow down the previously torrid rate of tax-inversion deals — indeed, it torpedoed AbbVie's (ABBV) planned takeover of Shire (SHPG), with AbbVie deciding to pay a hefty termination fee rather than take the risk of the rules materializing. Haines' Evercore colleague, specialty-drug analyst Umer Raffat, wrote in a separate email that Lew might follow up with actual guidelines this time, and/or address the issue of earnings stripping, in which the inverted company's foreign HQ issues an intercompany loan to its U.S. subsidiary and charges tax-deductible interest.""In my prior conversation with legal experts, Treasury may not have the mandate to change the 50% cap on interest expense deduction,"" Raffat wrote. ""It will be very interesting to see if Treasury comes out and changes this threshold in the guidance anyways — and lets any concerned parties litigate it out (hoping that the timelines for litigation will be long enough to prevent an inversion transaction).""Raffat added that Treasury might also propose modifying the definition of ""debt"" to exclude such intercompany loans. After the 2014 guidelines came out, Allergan CEO Brent Saunders said that this seemed like the most plausible avenue of attack, and in the ""worst-case scenario"" it could hit the company's tax rate to the tune of 300 basis points, as Allergan (then called Actavis) was itself the product of a tax inversion and had a large U.S. presence.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote that it's hard to tell how much tax Pfizer could save under current inversion rules, but the deal price now on the table would still yield accretion for Pfizer.""We modeled conservative tax benefits going forward with a 2017 anticipated tax rate of 22% subsequently dropping to 18% in 2019,"" Divan wrote in a research note. ""Our initial cost-synergy assumptions are also relatively conservative, with an assumption of $1.2 billion in cost synergies realized in 2019. It is possible Pfizer would be able to extract greater cost synergies from a deal, with each incremental $1 billion in synergies representing an additional 3 to 5 cents to yearly EPS from 2017 to 2019.""In midmorning trading on the stock market today, Allergan stock was down about 2.6% near 302.50, while Pfizer was down more than 3% near 32.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

706,AGN,"The stock market today continued to trim early losses in afternoon trade, aided by a bounce in oil prices. The S&P 500 recovered to a 0.1% gain after dipping 0.7%. The Nasdaq whittled a 1% decline to 0.1%. The Dow swung out of its earlier losses and rose 0.2%, with Exxon-Mobil (XOM), Pfizer (PFE) and Chevron (CVX) doing much of the heavy lifting.Oil-related groups posted six of the 10 best gains among industries, as oil price rebounded on rising tension in the Middle East.Among S&P 500 stocks, Dollar Tree (DLTR) sprang ahead 7%, despite reporting mixed results in its first full quarter since acquiring peer Family Dollar. The stock is working on its seventh straight daily gain, and testing resistance at its 200-day moving average.Analog Devices (ADI) and Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) also rose more than 6%.The IBD 50 list was nearly evenly split between advancers and decliners. Avago Technologies (AVGO), Allergan (AGN) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) topped the list, each up between 2% and 3%. Signet Jewelers (SIG) and Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) dropped 3% apiece.

707,AGN,"If IBD 50 stocks are advancing, it's no thanks to sales growth. In their latest quarter, about 70% of the companies in the list reported revenue gains under 25% — the minimum gain that historically has characterized successful stocks.The average sales growth rate was less than 23%. It was skewed by two companies that more than doubled sales: Allergan (AGN) and Heritage Insurance (HRTG).Allergan, which has made big acquisitions, says that its revenue on a pro forma basis rose 12% in Q2.About a dozen IBD 50 companies had single-digit sales growth. (This breakdown was done based on last Monday's list.)Poor sales have hit consumer, medical, technology, transportation and other sectors in the IBD 50. In fact, sales weakness is pretty much endemic.In the second quarter, S&P 500 revenue fell 3.8% to $296.11 a share on a year-over-year basis, according to S&P Capital IQ. A slumping oil sector had much to do with the drop, but it wasn't the only reason.""Yes, energy has been a key reason for sales (and earnings) weakness,"" Lindsey Bell, senior analyst at S&P Capital IQ, told IBD. Excluding the energy sector, sales growth would have been 1.8% for Q2.""That said,"" Bell noted, ""growth ex-energy is still below the 10-year average of 6.5% as the strength in the U.S. dollar is weighing heavily on top-line growth. You can see that in the 3.6% decline the consumer staples sector posted during the quarter.""Indeed, some companies with currency exposure, such as Hawaiian Holdings (HA) (Q2 revenue down 1%), Cambrex (CBM) (up 9%) and Global Payments (GPN) (up 5%, but 15% excluding foreign exchange), cited currency factors in their earnings filings.The revenue slump is expected to continue. FactSet estimates that sales will decline in the third quarter by 2.9%. ""The Energy sector is expected to report the largest year-over-year decrease in sales of all 10 sectors, while the Telecom Services and Health Care sectors are expected to report the largest growth in sales of all 10 sectors for the quarter,"" a Sept. 18 report from Senior Earnings Analyst John Butters noted.Earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to drop 4.4%, FactSet says.Single-digit sales don't necessarily limit stock performance. Nike (NKE) roared out of a base Friday after it beat expectations with a quarter that saw sales rise only 5%.

"
709,AGN,"The mkt paused really - as investors now thought about the latest GDP report - which came in at +1.5%.....(great because it is positive) but when compared to the 2nd qtr it looks a bit pale.....yesterday's report was more a 60% drop from qtr to qtr all at a time when the FED suggests the economy is poised to 'explode' and that 'rates will rise in December'.
"
710,AGN,"In addition - yesterday's report was a disappointment when you consider year over year growth......last year's 3rd qtr growth rate was 2% - so all this says is that the economy continues to be held hostage to the dynamics of  weakness at home and abroad.   As the journal points out the ""US Economy Slogs Through Soft Patch"" -  consumer spending, business spending and home building all contributing to our positive report all in the face of 'headwinds' abroad.
"
711,AGN,"But do not be blindsided....Consumer spending  is misleading...because it includes what 'consumers spend' on healthcare - which is not something that many people consider they read the story about the health of the consumer......Spending by consumers on healthcare represents 30% of GDP...or some $18 bil ...but the gov't includes this under the heading of 'consumer spending' - making it appear as if the consumer spending is stronger than what reality might prove otherwise.   Remember - spending on healthcare is not really an option for the family budget - so that gets filed under the 'must pay' budget line.....which means that 'discretionary spending' gets cut back.....it's all semantics really....as far as Obama is concerned - Consumer spending - no matter on what - is still consumer spending....So - It's all good!

Where one US company buys a smaller foreign rival and then moves the corporate headquarters abroad and BOOM!  - they just cut their US tax obligation by millions of dollars....   And to make the point - PFE CEO - Ian Read made no bones about it.....saying that ""US Corporate tax rates have put the company at a disadvantage to its foreign rivals.....We are fighting with one hand tied behind our back.....and that Pfizer was doing what we need to do to ensure that we can continue to innovate.""

714,AGN,"And the 'other pharma' story continues to keep us glued to our seats....Valeant Pharma  (VRX) continues to make headlines......CVS Health Corp. (CVS), Express Scripts  (ESRX) and United Health  are all cutting ties with Philidor Rx - the pharmacy that has helped to propel VRX  to international fame.....The stock closed down $5 pts and is now down another 6 pts in early pre-mkt trading.  Remember that old quote - 'Where there's smoke, there's fire..'.....The question now is - is the fire just a log or the whole house?
"
715,AGN,"US futures are up 2 pts - Global mkts are under a bit of pressure.   The BoJ (Bank of Japan) did not increase their QE program which caught some by surprise but did not cause a negative mkt reaction.   In Europe  - EU eco data was mixed....CPI did rise by 1%, while German retail sales missed the expectation.  Inflation figures were better, but still low and will have no impact on the ECB's plan for more stimulus. 
"
716,AGN,"It is the last day of the month - so we will sure have some 'window dressing  or undressing' taking place  as asset managers close their books on October.   Earnings continue to weigh on some stocks, but overall the season is not as bad as originally expected....so the nervousness that permeated the mkts in early October seemed to have subsided.   Expect to see the mkt challenge 2100 today.....and then back off and churn in line....Eco data today  could derail us - but I doubt it.  Pers Income of +0.2%, Pers Spend of +0.2%, ISM Milwaukee of 44 and Chicago Purch Manager of 49.4.

(CVS), Express Scripts  (ESRX) and United Health  are all cutting ties with Philidor Rx - the pharmacy that has helped to propel VRX  to international fame.....The stock closed down $5 pts and is now down another 6 pts in early pre-mkt trading.  Remember that old quote - 'Where there's smoke, there's fire..'.....The question now is - is the fire just a log or the whole house?US futures are up 2 pts - Global mkts are under a bit of pressure.   The BoJ (Bank of Japan) did not increase their QE program which caught some by surprise but did not cause a negative mkt reaction.   In Europe  - EU eco data was mixed....CPI did rise by 1%, while German retail sales missed the expectation.  Inflation figures were better, but still low and will have no impact on the ECB's plan for more stimulus. It is the last day of the month - so we will sure have some 'window dressing  or undressing' taking place  as asset managers close their books on October.   Earnings continue to weigh on some stocks, but overall the season is not as bad as originally expected....so the nervousness that permeated the mkts in early October seemed to have subsided.   Expect to see the mkt challenge 2100 today.....and then back off and churn in line....Eco data today  could derail us - but I doubt it.  Pers Income of +0.2%, Pers Spend of +0.2%, ISM Milwaukee of 44 and Chicago Purch Manager of 49.4.On the earnings front look for some of the OILS....Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil  (XOM) , Phillips 66 (PSX), along with CVS Health Corp. (CVS), Colgate-Palmolive  (CL), &  Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY). Have a good weekend.

749,AGN,"Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) are considering a massive drug merger worth more than $300 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday, citing sources, making it the biggest deal of the year at least.

750,AGN,"The Doctor is 'NOT' in....  Just ask United Health Care's  (UNH) CEO - Stephen Helmsley........Obama care has made THEM sick and they are not willing to continue to suffer losses going into 2017........That's right 2017 - because yesterday the company announced a $700 mil loss in the exchange business for 2015 - which included an 'advance recognition of losses for 2016'.....this announcement caused them to cut 2015 earnings projections to $6/sh...down from $6.35/share.
"
751,AGN,"This announcement does NOT include an expected additional $225 mil in 2016 losses.......as a result - investors took 8% out of the stock at one point yesterday after they heard the news that ""the biggest US health insurer has suffered major losses on policies sold under the affordable care act's (ACA) exchanges and will consider withdrawing from them.....""
"
752,AGN,"Hark - hear the hear the other herald angels sing....AETNA (AET) , Humana (HUM), CIGNA  (CI), Anthem (ANTM) all chiming in singing the same tune.....But insurers that focus on the Medicaid population Molina (MOH)  don't seem to be having that same problem because their low income consumers  are subsidized by the gov't.  As a result - we are now seeing the effects of this poorly designed piece of signature legislation - Anyone seen Nancy Pelosi recently?  Did she ever read the legislation?  Insurers are raising premiums, cutting product offerings and choices of health care providers.... We as consumers are seeing the least desirable 'silver' plans increase rates by 7.5% on avg while the better plans are seeing increases of more than 10%, with higher deductibles and higher co-pays.........and just like ECON 101 taught you.....higher costs discourage buyers (in this case HEALTHY buyers) , which then only drives the costs even higher because the remaining consumers are sicker and need more healthcare....it's a vicious circle.....known as the 'death spiral'.....
"
753,AGN,"Now Republicans were quick  to jump on the bandwagon saying that ""Premiums are up and healthcare is more expensive...the consequences we see from this hastily and conceived legislation were entirely foreseeable and not at all surprising"" .....and as you expected the Democrats - led by Obama were quick to point out that the 'law is working well'.......Hmmm.....Well boys....you can't have it both ways - so which is it....is the ACA  working or not?  By the sounds of it.....CEO Helmsley clearly has a view......maybe the Democrats  need to talk to the insurers and see why the Doctor is NOT in......

"
755,AGN,"Now back to the mkts......the broader mkt showed a lack of direction yesterday after Wednesday's surge......causing the S&P to tease both sides of the unchanged at least 25 times....the lack of any real significant change came as traders/investor took a breath.  The technical underpinnings of the mkt continue to argue that only a few companies continue to dominate the major indexes, while so many continue to drag....While the biggest companies with the largest capitalizations have pushed the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closer to their annual highs.....the broader indexes like the Wilshire 5000 and the Russell 2000 are still struggling.

756,AGN,"(The Wilshire 5000 - a total mkt index that measure the performance of all US stocks with 'readily available price data'.  But most people do not follow or even know what the Wilshire 5000 is.....because the media only talks about the Dow, the S&P and the Nasdaq, which are heavily weighted with large cap companies....that the average investors knows....  In fact the Wilshire 5000 is a much truer measure of the real health of the US economy as a whole.... I'm just sayin....) From a short term basis, the market is trying to work off last week’s sharp selloff and so far it appears to be doing just that......We need to continue to watch what crude oil prices do....Crude is now trading at $41/barrel....it needs to hold here.... A rally in oil will certainly help support the mkt but that is still a difficult call given the fundamentals and the strengthening dollar.....but it IS in a short-term oversold condition - so a bounce would not be out of the question......causing bargain hunters to go on a shopping spree.

757,AGN,"Overnight - the Asian mkts finished the week strong... Japan +0.1%, Hong Kong + 1.13%, China + 0.37% and ASX +0.26%. In Europe - mkts are churning.....even as Draghi hints at more stimulus......The Mali hostage crisis this morning is raising concerns over global security..... causing the focus to once again turn to ISIS and the recent events in France.  In the end - the mkts need to digest the action of late as we move into the weekend.  FTSE +0.12%, CAC 40 -0.13%, DAX +0.3%, EUROSTOXX -0.01%, SPAIN -0.5% AND ITALY -0.6%.  US Futures are pointing higher.....currently +5 pts.....but keeping us still within the 2065/2100 trading range.  We will get another load of FED speakers today.....St Louis FED Pres Bullard and NY's Dudley - both speaking on the economy......and you can believe that they will hammer home the message of 'normalization' coming to a theater near you in December.  On the eco front - look for reports form the Kansas City FED......survey says 0.  Take good care    Kp

We as consumers are seeing the least desirable 'silver' plans increase rates by 7.5% on avg while the better plans are seeing increases of more than 10%, with higher deductibles and higher co-pays.........and just like ECON 101 taught you.....higher costs discourage buyers (in this case HEALTHY buyers) , which then only drives the costs even higher because the remaining consumers are sicker and need more healthcare....it's a vicious circle.....known as the 'death spiral'.....Now Republicans were quick  to jump on the bandwagon saying that ""Premiums are up and healthcare is more expensive...the consequences we see from this hastily and conceived legislation were entirely foreseeable and not at all surprising"" .....and as you expected the Democrats - led by Obama were quick to point out that the 'law is working well'.......Hmmm.....Well boys....you can't have it both ways - so which is it....is the ACA  working or not?  By the sounds of it.....CEO Helmsley clearly has a view......maybe the Democrats  need to talk to the insurers and see why the Doctor is NOT in......And in another move by the healthcare industry.....yesterday brought us news that Pfizer (PFE) is pressing ahead in its fight to save on corporate taxes by getting in bed with Ireland based Allergan (AGN)......putting the gov't and the company on a 'collision course' in what is known as the 'inversion trade'.......and here the Democrats want to prevent a company from 'strategically relocating' to take advantage of a broken US corp tax structure by piling on more regulations and red tape  while the Republicans say that the real problem here is the ""Broken US Corp Tax Structure"" as they call for a complete overhaul of the tax code - thereby eliminating the need or incentive to invert....Now back to the mkts......the broader mkt showed a lack of direction yesterday after Wednesday's surge......causing the S&P to tease both sides of the unchanged at least 25 times....the lack of any real significant change came as traders/investor took a breath.  The technical underpinnings of the mkt continue to argue that only a few companies continue to dominate the major indexes, while so many continue to drag....While the biggest companies with the largest capitalizations have pushed the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closer to their annual highs.....the broader indexes like the Wilshire 5000 and the Russell 2000 are still struggling.(The Wilshire 5000 - a total mkt index that measure the performance of all US stocks with 'readily available price data'.  But most people do not follow or even know what the Wilshire 5000 is.....because the media only talks about the Dow, the S&P and the Nasdaq, which are heavily weighted with large cap companies....that the average investors knows....  In fact the Wilshire 5000 is a much truer measure of the real health of the US economy as a whole.... I'm just sayin....) From a short term basis, the market is trying to work off last week’s sharp selloff and so far it appears to be doing just that......We need to continue to watch what crude oil prices do....Crude is now trading at $41/barrel....it needs to hold here.... A rally in oil will certainly help support the mkt but that is still a difficult call given the fundamentals and the strengthening dollar.....but it IS in a short-term oversold condition - so a bounce would not be out of the question......causing bargain hunters to go on a shopping spree.Overnight - the Asian mkts finished the week strong... Japan +0.1%, Hong Kong + 1.13%, China + 0.37% and ASX +0.26%. In Europe - mkts are churning.....even as Draghi hints at more stimulus......The Mali hostage crisis this morning is raising concerns over global security..... causing the focus to once again turn to ISIS and the recent events in France.  In the end - the mkts need to digest the action of late as we move into the weekend.  FTSE +0.12%, CAC 40 -0.13%, DAX +0.3%, EUROSTOXX -0.01%, SPAIN -0.5% AND ITALY -0.6%.  US Futures are pointing higher.....currently +5 pts.....but keeping us still within the 2065/2100 trading range.  We will get another load of FED speakers today.....St Louis FED Pres Bullard and NY's Dudley - both speaking on the economy......and you can believe that they will hammer home the message of 'normalization' coming to a theater near you in December.  On the eco front - look for reports form the Kansas City FED......survey says 0.  Take good care    KpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

759,AGN,"Embattled drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) tumbled nearly 40% Wednesday to a two-year low and closed down 19.2%, as short-selling outfit Citron Research charged it with a complex fraud involving multiple specialty pharmacies. Valeant responded that the report was based on erroneous assumptions.Citron referred to a report from the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation (SIRF) probing a lawsuit by the small California-based R&O Pharmacy against Valeant that alleges Valeant had charged it for drugs it had not actually bought.SIRF said in its piece that while R&O apparently hadn't done business with Valeant, it had done business with Philidor, another specialty pharmacy about which SIRF could find little information. SIRF eventually concluded that Valeant is the sole provider of drugs to Philidor and had an economic relationship with Philidor that it had not disclosed, and this led to Valeant's lawyers seeking payment from R&O on its behalf.On the conference call with analysts discussing Monday's Q3 earnings, Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson said the company normally didn't discuss its relationship with specialty pharmacies because it's a ""competitive advantage that we did not disclose to our competitors."" However, he did say ""we have a contractual relationship with Philidor, and late last year we purchased an option to acquire Philidor if we so choose,"" which Citron found mighty suspicious.Wrote Citron: ""An option? To acquire a company to which you are the only customer? Why would Valeant, a major big-cap pharma, a darling of the hedge-fund crowd, a suitor of Allergan (AGN) and an aggressive acquirer of pharmas like Salix, Bausch & Lomb, etc., etc., be secretly maneuvering to buy a little-known pharmacy with a dubious ownership structure?""Citron said it dug through the paperwork and had concluded that Philidor actually owns R&O, and said it found several other small pharmacies whose website domains were all registered on the same day and who share the same Privacy Officer phone number. Citron concluded that they were all set up by Valeant ""for the purpose of phantom sales or stuff(ing) the channel, and avoid(ing) scrutiny from the auditors.""Valeant Fires BackIn the early afternoon Wednesday, Valeant issued a press release disputing several points of Citron's report.Valeant said that the reason why the pharmacies use the same phone number is that Philidor provides ""back-end services, including call center, claims adjudication, IT and logistics support, as well as compliance/HIPAA regulation guidance, to other pharmacies, including R&O Pharmacy.""Valeant also said that it does not record shipments to Philidor and other specialty pharmacies as revenue until the drugs are dispensed to the patient, implying that it is therefore not using this to stuff its channels. It said the $69 million that it had charged R&O was also not recorded as revenue.""The timing of our revenue recognition by selling through the Philidor pharmacy network is actually delayed when compared to selling through the traditional wholesaler channel,"" Valeant said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Valeant stock fell almost 40% to as low as 88.50. That's more than 66% below its all-time high of 263.81, touched on Aug. 6. Valeant closed at 118.61 Wednesday, 19.2% below Tuesday's closing price.Other specialty drugmakers were also affected. Endo International (ENDP), whose CEO used to be president of Valeant and who has been re-creating Valeant's business model at Endo over the last two years, fell 13.3%. Allergan released a statement saying that only 3% of its sales go through specialty pharmacies. Allergan stock closed down 1.7%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

761,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) stock outplayed IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group on Wall Street-crushing Q4 and 2016 metrics, as well as 2017 guidance — leading GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi (SNY) stocks following their earnings reports.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Allergan stock jumped 3.7% to close at 241.17 after the firm released its Q4 earnings. Shares of Sanofi were up 2.4% to 41.21, while GlaxoSmithKline stock was up 0.7% to 39.75.All three drugmakers are in IBD's Ethical Drugs group, which was up a fraction midday Wednesday. This follows affirmation from Press Secretary Sean Spicer late Tuesday that President Trump would support allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare.For Q4, Botox-maker Allergan reported $3.9 billion in sales, down 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter but topping views for $3.77 billion. Allergan also posted Q4 earnings per share ex items of $3.90, up 14%, crushing expectations for $3.75.Total 2016 sales rose 15% to $14.57 billion, while EPS ex items rose 8 cents to $13.51.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan's ""social contract"" with patients promising to keep annual drug price increases at or below 10% drew some ire at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference last month. What did Celgene's CEO have to say about it?Guidance for $15.5 billion to $15.8 billion in sales and $15.80-$16.30 EPS minus items topped the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $15.24 billion and $15.90. At the midpoints of Allergan's outlook, sales and EPS are expected to grow 7.4% and 19%, respectively.Results were mixed for Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline.For Q4, Sanofi's sales came in at 8.867 euros ($9.55 billion based on the quarter-end exchange rate), missing the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $9.798 billion. EPS ex items of 0.62 euro was light by a penny.GlaxoSmithKline reported 7.586 billion euros ($9.4 billion), beating the $9.37 billion consensus view. Core EPS of 65 cents U.S. topped the consensus for 64 cents.RELATED:Endo Resolves FTC Antitrust Suit, But Allergan Hanging; Stocks MixedAllergan Pops On 2017 Guidance; Can It Survive Alzheimer's Rivalries?Allergan Outlook Improves On Good Trial For Colon Drug: Credit Suisse

762,AGN,"Activist investor Carl Icahn has reportedly taken a stake in cancer biotech Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) following an investment by Jana Partners in Q4, according to inside sources cited by the Wall Street Journal.In after-hours trading after the rumor broke, Bristol-Myers stock edged up a fraction. Shares rose a fraction in Tuesday's regular session, to 54.78, but they're down 27% over the last six months amid investor worries that Merck (MRK) has the upper hand in the lung cancer market.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo both belong to a class of immuno-oncology drugs that target PD-1 checkpoints in a patient's immune system. Roche (RHHBY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Incyte (INCY) are also working on I-O drugs targeting an array of checkpoints.Last month, the Food and Drug Administration accepted Merck's supplemental filing for Keytruda plus chemo in advanced lung cancer. Bristol said it wouldn't accelerate approval for its Opdivo plus Yervoy combo in the same market. Yervoy is another I-O drug targeting the CTLA-4 checkpoint.IBD'S TAKE: The I-O market could grow to $25 billion by 2025, Barclays analyst Geoffrey Meacham estimates — and those are just the indications we know of in 2017. Dive into the I-O world and its game-changing potential on IBD's Technology page.Bristol declined to comment to IBD regarding Icahn's rumored stake. Insiders reportedly say Icahn sees Bristol-Myers as a potential takeover candidate, the WSJ reported. Bristol-Myers is the ninth-largest biotech by market cap, valued at $91.5 billion.Icahn is known for his investments in household names like PayPal (PYPL) and Xerox (XRX).Last year, he made a big bet on Allergan (AGN), but slashed his stake in November. Shares lost about 11% from the time of his purchase in Q2 to the end of November.Jana Partners, another activist investor, bought a stake in Bristol-Myers in Q4. On Tuesday, Bristol said it would buy back $2 billion of its stock as part of an agreement with Jana. The company also added Robert Bertolini, Matthew Emmens and Theodore Samuels to its board of directors, temporarily expanding the board to 14 until an election in May.RELATED:These Are The First Immune-System Cancer Drugs OK'd By FDAMerck's Keytruda Sales Lag Without $40 Million In Deferred RevenueBristol-Myers Dives On Opdivo Setback; Will Get Keytruda Royalties

763,AGN,"Endo International (ENDP) agreed to a 10-year settlement with the FTC on Monday, resolving a 2016 antitrust suit filed in Pennsylvania alleging, in part, that Endo paid Allergan (AGN) in 2012 to prevent it from launching a generic version of its Lidoderm.The joint motion between the FTC and Endo was filed Monday in a California federal court and includes the FTC's original complaint against Allergan and Endo. The stipulated order resolves all disputes the FTC has against Endo related to its patent settlements.Last March, Endo settled patent litigation involving local anesthetic Lidoderm and pain management drug Opana. The FTC alleged ""certain aspects of the Opana and Lidoderm settlements constituted unfair methods of competition in violation of federal law,"" Endo said in a press release.Although the FTC voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit in October, the commission stated its plan to refile elsewhere — which happened Monday. But the joint motion also includes the stipulated order, dismissing the claims against Endo.IBD'S TAKE: While others struggle, Incyte is likely to outperform the broader biotech market in 2017. Grab the deeper dive in IBD's The New America.Endo didn't admit wrongdoing and won't have to make a payment. Rather, Endo agreed to ""a prohibition on agreements that prevent the marketing of authorized generic products or that involve payments to generics manufacturers in connection with delaying the market entry of their products"" for a span of 10 years.The lawsuit seeks restitution and disgorgement, according to Reuters, alleging that Allergan, then Watson Pharmaceuticals, accepted a payment from Endo in May 2012 to hold off launching a generic version of Lidoderm until September 2013.Allergan representatives declined to comment to IBD. Endo reps didn't return an email.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan stock finished up 0.2% to 214.82, while Endo stock was down 1.4% to 12.17. Allergan has been trading below its 200-day support line for 10 months, and Endo for the past 16 months.RELATED:Generic-Drugmakers Crash On Report DOJ Plans Collusion ChargesAllergan Pops On 2017 Guidance; Can It Survive Alzheimer's Rivalries?Allergan Outlook Improves On Good Trial For Colon Drug: Credit Suisse

764,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) stock popped to an eight-week high Thursday after the drugmaker issued 2017 guidance in line with broader Wall Street expectations.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Allergan stock lifted 2.4%, near 221. Shares have risen 10 of the past 11 trading days, last week moving above their 50-day moving average and zeroing in on their 200-day average. Allergan stock plummeted 33% in 2016 amid the raucous drug-pricing debate.For 2017, Allergan sees mid-single-digit non-GAAP top-line net revenue growth and double-digit growth in earnings per share minus items. That compares with the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet for 5.5% sales growth and 20% earnings growth, says Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler.IBD'S TAKE: Will your drug stocks survive if Donald Trump breaks with Republicans and seeks to curb rising drug prices?Koffler maintained her buy rating and 273 price target on Allergan stock following the announcement. She sees Allergan pulling in 4.3% sales growth and 19.1% EPS minus items growth in 2017.Executives will likely provide more specific guidance on the company's Q4 earnings conference call in February, she said.Allergan also guided to stable Restasis sales and continued erosion of Namenda XR sales.Restasis is an immunosuppressant used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Namenda XR is an Alzheimer's drug. But a generic version expected to launch in Q4 will erode Allergan's sales.RELATED:Allergan Outlook Improves On Good Trial For Colon Drug: Credit SuisseDrastic Drug-Price Action No Trump Card, Says NeedhamConatus Pharma Doubles On Novartis NASH Liver Drug Licensing Deal

765,AGN,"Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities Fund's (FIGWX) recent surge since the elections and since the Federal Reserve's December rate hike has given retirement-account and other investors reason to cheer.In the trailing three months going into Thursday, the $300 million fund's 10.45% gain topped 93% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged an 8.66% advance. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, gained 8.33%.For the Nuveen fund, that's way better than the mere 34% of direct rivals it outpaced in the past 12 months with a not-so-shabby 24.20% return.The difference between now and the earlier period? Within their overall investment approach, fund managers Harold Goldstein and David Chalupnik favored stocks likely to get an extra tailwind from the elections and from rising rates. Those had to be stocks that fit their basic approach, which is the pursuit of stocks they think will have faster earnings growth than the market expects.They paid for that by cutting stable and defensive consumer staples stocks by 7% in the fourth quarter and consumer discretionary stocks by 6%, the fund's fourth-quarter commentary notes.The managers pumped up their financials by 7%, mostly the day after the elections. They boosted technology by about 3% and energy by 2%.They began positions in Signature Bank (SBNY), SVB Financial (SIVB), Raymond James (RJF) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).All of those newcomers have very strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the high 80s or 90s. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.In addition to a sterling 96 Comp Rating, SVB Financial is the No. 3-ranked bank in IBD's superregional industry group, thanks to growth metrics like four years in a row of earnings per share (EPS) growth and a 39.7% annual pretax margin.IBD'S TAKE: SVB Financial is ranked No. 3 in the No. 1-rated Banks-Super Regional group. See which superregional bank is No. 1, and how these financials stack up on easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.The bank is headquartered in Silicon Valley, a hotbed of innovation. Its nonbanking businesses include asset management, private wealth management, brokerage and investment services, funds management, and business valuation services.Raymond James is No. 2 in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank-Bankers group. It is propelled by factors like its fourth-quarter 47% EPS growth and eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds.In tech, the fund opened a position in Broadcom (AVGO), a chipmaking company whose EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters. On IBD's Leaderboard, the company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and broadband communications.Goldstein and Chalupnik like the semiconductor space's economic sensitivity. And they like Broadcom's role among leaders of consolidation within its industry.In energy, the fund added new positions in Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE), and added to its stake in Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).""(We) added exposure to several growth-oriented exploration and production firms as a result of the generally improved outlook for oil pricing and supply,"" the managers wrote.In health care, the fund's overall weight stayed basically unchanged in the immediate postelection period. But the fund made individual stock moves.It started a stake in Incyte (INCY), which the managers call a fast-growing young biotech firm with an exciting pipeline of cancer-fighting treatments.To pay for Incyte, the fund used proceeds from the sale of two drugmakers, Allergan (AGN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which it had owned a long time.The managers think Allergan has grown so large that it can no longer grow much faster than its industry. They sold Bristol-Meyers because test results dimmed the outlook for a lung cancer therapy it was developing.The managers summarized their approach this way: ""The portfolio continues to be reasonably balanced from a sector standpoint as well as measured by other factors. The fund's largest overweight is in the area of companies with high growth potential that we believe can perform well somewhat independent of the economic cycle. We are always looking for exceptional growth companies that we believe have solid and/or improving fundamentals, a reasonable valuation and an approaching catalyst.""RELATED:Why This Victory Munder Fund Likes Semiconductor Gear Makers And Non-ObamaCare Health StocksWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

But shares in Lumentum, whose core business is optical communications, surged 22% for the week after its CEO discussed an emerging 3D sensor market opportunity — not included in company guidance. Some analysts speculated over an Apple iPhone 8 design win, though Apple may have multiple 3D device suppliers.Fabrinet (FN), which provides optical packaging and assembles optical, electromechanical and electronic devices for other manufacturers, reported fiscal Q2 earnings growth of 82% and a 51% revenue, both better than expected. It was the second straight quarter of accelerating profit growth and the best EPS gain in four years. Fabrinet gained more than 6%.RELATED:President Trump was a major topic at Cowen's Aerospace/Defense & Industrials Conference.

770,AGN,"SAN FRANCISCO — Celgene (CELG) CEO Mark Alles parried back Tuesday against so-called social contracts with patients, like that of Allergan (AGN), in the face of the drug-pricing debate that spiked last year on Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen and Turing Pharmaceuticals' HIV medication.""The debate is not new, it's just new because of social media,"" he said. ""Many pharma companies have become public in proclaiming free access programs. ... It's interesting because those principles have been at play at Celgene for years.""Speaking at a media panel Tuesday at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Alles outlined a series of programs at Celgene to offer less expensive or free access to Revlimid, a key chemotherapy to treat multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome and mantle cell lymphoma.Alles estimated that 6% of Celgene's medicine goes to patients for free each year. To subsidize that, as well as reinvest in R&D — CFO Peter Kellogg says Celgene reinvests north of 35% into R&D when accounting for partnerships — the company must hike prices each year.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, meaning it has outperformed 93% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks No. 5 out of 420 companies in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. To see which companies lead the sector, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""People think lowering prices is the answer (to the drug-pricing debate),"" he said. ""What if that meant we no longer had the threshold to provide access to patients who don't have a safety net?""The trouble is, Celgene isn't alone in annual price hikes. Last July, the Wall Street Journal found that drug prices had jumped about 10% vs. year-earlier figures. Alles says a number of factors are at play. Complicating matters, consumers generally don't understand the costly drug-development process.For instance, to run a ""pivotal,"" late-stage trial costs $100 million, on average. If the drug fails, the firm could be out millions, Alles said.""We welcome comprehensive transparency and look forward to how that evolves,"" he said. ""Incentives have to exist for companies to take risk to create returns.""Biopharmas and generics alike can't simply agree to prices — that's illegal, Alles noted. Late Monday, a pair of former Heritage Pharmaceuticals executives admitted to a price-fixing scheme between April 2013 and December 2015 involving a generic antibiotic and a diabetes drug, according to Philly.com.Ex-CEO Jeffrey Glazer and Jason Malek, former senior vice president of commercial operations, pleaded guilty in a federal court in Philadelphia to conspiring to manipulate drug prices. Federal investigators are also looking at Mylan, Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and four other drugmakers under suspicion of price-fixing.""We can't do as an industry what people want us to do,"" Alles said. But, he assured, ""no one in the U.S. is paying list price for drugs.""Celgene shares fell 0.2% to 119.98 on the stock market today. Celgene, working on a consolidation with a 127.10 buy point, rose 0.5% on Monday as it raised its 2017 profit forecast.

It's been a tough year in general for makers of generic drugs. Allergan in May received a U.S. Department of Justice subpoena seeking information about its Actavis generics unit, though liability transferred to Teva (TEVA) when it acquired Actavis in August. That's part of an ongoing, wide-ranging DOJ investigation of possible price collusion in the generics field.This month, the DOJ charged former Heritage Pharmaceuticals CEO Jeffrey Glazer and President Jason Malek with felony counts related to conspiring to fix prices for a diabetes drug and an antibiotic drug. The next day, the attorneys general of 20 states sued Mylan (MYL), Teva, Heritage and three other makers of generic drugs on price-fixing allegations.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has been among the worst-performing stocks this year, but on the other end of the scale among drugmakers is Celgene.

The new formulations of linaclotide, though, aims to treat the distal small intestine and colon, one trail with patients not experiencing constipation, ""where the majority of the abdominal pain associated with IBS-C is believed to originate,"" Allergan and Ironwood said in their news release.""Abdominal pain is usually the most difficult symptom to treat in patients with IBS-C. When that pain is not treated sufficiently, then that drives the patient back into my office again and again,"" Dr. Philip Schoenfeld, chief, gastroenterology section, John D. Dingell VA Medical Center and adjunct professor of medicine at the University of Michigan School of Medicine, said in the Allergan news release.

773,AGN,"President-elect Trump has promised action on high drug prices, but prospects of government taking control of drug pricing ""has largely subsided"" thanks to Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton, Needham said in an bullish research report Thursday on the specialty pharma sector.Furthermore, Trump's stated plans to lower corporate taxes and lessen the tax burden of U.S. companies looking to bring cash back to the U.S. should spark drug industry M&A, Needham analyst Serge Belanger wrote in his research report.Belanger named ACAD Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) and tiny Corium International (CORI) at the top picks in his specialty pharma coverage area.In an interview with Time early this month, when he was named the magazine's Man of the Year, Trump gave his most definitive statements yet on the long-simmering issue of escalating drug prices. ""I'm going to bring down drug prices,"" he told Time. ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks haven't been booming, but see which health care-industry related companies make the latest IBD 50 ranking of stocks that have performed the best in the past 52 weeks, with an emphasis on the most recent six months.The comments hurt drug stocks. But while drug pricing will remain an issue, Trump didn't expand on those comments in that interview or subsequently, Belanger told IBD via email, after we asked if the analyst could amplify on his report.""Even with Trump's comments, the idea of the federal government negotiating drug prices rather than insurers seems far-fetched now,"" Belander said in his email. ""We assume that pricing scrutiny of generic and old drugs will continue — PBM/payers (pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers) have been active in this area.""But while ""there had previously been talk from the Democrats of having Medicare and other agencies negotiate their own drug prices much like the VA and Medicaid do now ... pricing control of newly approved drugs seems less of an issue now with Republicans having across-the-board control.""Mylan (MYL) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) are among the few companies that have received the most heat from consumers and lawmakers for escalating drug prices.The Justice Department is investigating possible price collusion among makers of generic drugs, with companies such as Mylan, Allergan (AGN), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Endo International (ENDP) among those being investigated.In its first charges in that investigation, the DOJ this month charged former Heritage Pharmaceuticals CEO Jeffrey Glazer and President Jason Malek with felony counts related to conspiring to fix prices for a diabetes drug and an antibiotic drug.The next day, the attorneys general of 20 states sued Mylan, Teva, Heritage and three other drugmakers on price-fixing allegations.Besides less threat of drastic drug-price actions, Belanger sees a much-improved climate for mergers and acquisitions in the sector.""Drivers of increased M&A activity for 2017 and beyond are likely to be some of the proposed tax policy changes of the new

775,AGN,"SAN FRANCISCO — Less than an hour after President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the drug industry as ""disastrous,"" Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) CEO Randall Schatzman classified the tone at the 35th annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference as ""cautiously optimistic.""That's a wide departure from the 2016 event. At that time, he said, sentiment was decidedly pessimistic as the U.S. entered what turned out to be a raucous election year. The drug-pricing debate is alive, but biotech sentiment is growing stronger this year, Schatzman told IBD in an interview at the conference, one of the drug industry's major events, held this week in San Francisco.""Talking about the biotech industry as a whole, I think it's finally come to maturity,"" he said. ""Over the last two years, almost 70 drugs have been approved that have come from innovation in biotechnology, not large pharma. So the dollars there are really paying us back, and we're seeing some real game-changers.""Among those, Schatzman included Alder's anti-CGRP migraine drug, which competes directly with similar meds from Eli Lilly (LLY), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Amgen (AMGN). The migraine market is big enough that all four could grab a sizable share when their drugs hit shelves, likely in 2019.But he acknowledges Trump's comments didn't help stock prices. Holding his phone, Schatzman pulled up a screen of biotech stocks, red arrows indicating their descent. To that point, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) (an exchange-traded fund) fell 3% Wednesday. It rose a fraction both Thursday and Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary sent drug stocks into a tailspin on Wednesday. Get the deep dive on what it means for your drug and biotech picks on IBD's Industry Themes.So any rally Wall Street expected from the JPMorgan event didn't unfold. But here are five key takeaways investors could note for 2017 as Trump takes office, drug firms look to sidestep Lilly's Alzheimer's flop and M&A gets an early start.Trump isn't alone in his fixation on drug prices. Celgene (CELG) CEO Mark Alles parried back when a reporter questioned whether the No. 3 biotech would follow in Allergan's (AGN) footsteps, applying a so-called ""social contract"" to not raise prices more than 10% annually.Celgene has offered free access programs for years, Alles said, estimating the No. 3 biotech gives away 6% of its drugs each year for free. Drug-prices increases help fund R&D for new drugs, he added. CFO Peter Kellogg estimates Celgene reinvests 35% of its funds into R&D, when accounting for partnerships.Alles says Celgene goes through a ""thoughtful process,"" accounting for innovation and spending to bring a drug to market before it prices a new med. Schatzman used the same words to describe Alder's plan to price out its anti-CGRP drug, once it nears FDA approval and heads to market.But HealthPrize Technologies CEO Tom Kottler called pricing spikes the easy way out for drug companies. HealthPrize is a software-as-a-service firm that marries behavioral economics and consumer marketing to analyze and improve patient adherence to prescriptions.Pharma leaves about $637 billion in worldwide revenue on the table each year by not pushing patients to take their meds, Kottler told IBD. To bridge the gap, companies can bring new products to market, prompt doctors to write more prescriptions or raise prices. Typically, they choose the latter.They're missing out on easy money, Kottler says. But raising prices ""is the easiest thing for them,"" he said.Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced its immuno-oncology (IO) drug Keytruda in combination with chemo — Eli Lilly's Alimta — had won priority review from the FDA in non-small cell lung cancer and has a Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date of May 10.Meanwhile, Merck and Incyte (INCY) are moving Keytruda and epacadostat into phase 3 trials of four tumor types (non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck). Incyte stock jumped 9.4% Jan. 9 on the news.But Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is on Merck's tail, analysts say. Bristol-Myers is testing a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, both IO therapies, in NSCLC. Analysts expect the Bristol-Myers readout in the first half of 2018. IO combos are likely to be more effective and durable than IO plus chemo, some say.On Monday, Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical put down a $24 per share bid on Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIAD), an oncology firm based in Massachusetts. Ariad stock flew 73% on the news, helping shares of oncology firm Tesaro (TSRO) lift 3.7%.Tesaro stock and four IPOs led IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group in 2016, with each of those stocks seeing triple-digit gains. Tesaro jumped 157%, where the group overall fell 24% amid the painful election cycle.Now, analysts wonder if Tesaro's success and an oncology-minded atmosphere — reiterated by Takeda's offer on Ariad — could garner a bid for Tesaro. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez sees a potential takeout price of $170 per share of Tesaro stock, which closed Friday at 156.41 after rising 6.4%.""While Tesaro remains well positioned to grow independently, a validated PARP inhibitor like niraparib (an ovarian cancer drug still in development) could offer a durable and strategically important product opportunity for multiple suitors,"" Fernandez wrote in a research report Jan. 9.Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are asking a federal judge to stay a ban on their LDL-busting drug, Praluent, in the aftermath of a patent battle that landed in a win for No. 1 biotech Amgen. Praluent infringes on Amgen's patent for PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha, the judge said.Meanwhile, an LDL-buster from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO) is slowly advancing. On Jan. 9, The Medicines Co. announced a 180-day interim analysis from a study examining PCSK9si inclisiran. The data showed inclisiran significantly lowered LDL up to day 210.RBC analyst Adnan Butt expects six-month data to be similar on efficacy and safety. Details are expected during the 2017 American College of Cardiology conference in March in Washington, D.C. Inclisiran should do well on strong data despite the patent litigation for Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi.""Inclisiran is differentiated and has no patent litigation overhang,"" Butt said in a research report Wednesday.Axovant (AXON) CEO Vivek Ramaswamy says the biotech and drug industry has ""utterly failed"" in Alzheimer's. Oncology, inflammation, cardiology — they've all seen significant advancements in the last 10 years. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia, including those with lewy bodies, haven't, he says.""If we don't find a treatment, it's a major threat to society,"" he told IBD in an interview Wednesday. ""This is the single area in health care we have failed to deliver a major advancement in, in the last decade.""Ramaswamy says he was rooting for Eli Lilly in December. But Lilly's highly-lauded solanezumab failed to meet its primary endpoints in a late-stage trial, causing Lilly stock to plunge 10.5% the day of that announcement. Lilly's drug and a drug in development by Biogen (BIIB) work to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's.But that's a ""silver bullet"" theory, and Ramaswamy doesn't buy it. Instead, he sees it necessary to treat the various behavioral, psychological and neurological pieces of Alzheimer's and dementia. Axovant is aiming to build new therapies on top of older ones.Axovant is next is the Alzheimer's field to deliver a readout. Data are slated for Q3, he said. Ramaswamy is looking for just one major piece of news in Alzheimer's advancement. Says Ramaswamy, ""A rising tide will lift all boats.""

776,AGN,"In his first news conference since his surprise win, President-elect Trump on Wednesday indicated the issue of escalating drug prices would be a priority, using harsh words to describe the situation.""Our drug industry has been disastrous,"" said Trump. Drugmakers must be subject to ""new bidding procedures because they're getting away with murder,"" he said, hitting on an issue that already had been getting increased attention from federal and state lawmakers.Mylan (MYL) CEO Heather Bresch was skewered in a House committee in September, but plenty of others have been heavily criticized, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Mylan and Teva, which acquired generic drugmaker Actavis last year from Allergan (AGN), were the two publicly traded companies among six companies that in December were sued by the attorneys general of 20 states on price-fixing charges in the field of generic drugs. A day earlier, in its first action in its similar investigation, the U.S. Justice Department charged the former CEO and president of privately held Heritage Pharmaceuticals with price fixing.IBD'S TAKE: An event such as a news conference from a president-elect can move stocks. See IBD's Stocks on the Move to learn the latest big movers, both up and down, with a number of drugmakers currently on the moving-down list.In an interview with Time, when named that magazine's Man of the Year, Trump pledged to bring down high drug prices, but Wednesday marked his first substantive comments on the subject.""Pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs,"" he said at the news conference. ""We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly, and we're going to start bidding, and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.""Actavis had boosted the price of its hydrocortisone tablets by 9,500% over a number of years, while Mylan's EpiPen to treat allergic reactions saw a 700% price increase in six years ended last year. Both products treat potentially life-threatening situations.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) ETF fell 3% in the stock market today to 277.94 and falling back near its 200-day line.Already depressed, shares of Mylan and Teva fell 4.3% and 2.6% respectively on Wednesday, while Valeant tumbled 6.5%.IBD's 421-company biotech industry group fell 3.1%, again falling to its 50-day and 200-day lines.Among larger biotech stocks, Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) fell 8.1%, Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) plunged 7.4% and United Therapeutics (UTHR) fell 6%.Among larger drugmakers, Amgen (AMGN) ended the day down 1.4%, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) fell 3.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell 1.7%, with Biogen (BIIB) tumbling 3.6%.RELATED:Trump: Drugmakers 'Getting Away With Murder'Mylan, Teva Sued For Alleged Price-Fixing

Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 24.85.A week ago, Supernus announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed a lower court's decision that Actavis had infringed on two Supernus patents and that three Supernus patents were valid. Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) acquired Actavis from Allergan (AGN) this year.Supernus stock rose 3% on that news, but Monday's bigger jump came on no apparent news.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's biotech industry group has not been a leader of late, but IBD's Industry Snapshot and Industry Themes features can provider deeper dives on which groups are hotter, some helped by the Trump election win, among many factors.IBD's 422-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, meanwhile, rose much of the day before closing down nearly 1% Monday. The group, which briefly retook its 50-day line intraday, closed just below its 200-day moving average.Biotech stocks at first got a boost from the surprise presidential election win by Donald Trump, on thoughts he would focus less on the issue of high drug prices than his opponent, Hillary Clinton. But Trump, in an interview in Time published this month when the magazine named him its Man of the Year, said: ""I'm going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""That sent drug stocks falling, and the biotech group had been trading below its 50-day average all month. The group ranks No. 49 out of 197 groups, where a quarter ago it ranked No. 13.Trump, though, also aims to speed up the drug approval process, which could be a catalyst for some drug stocks.Among the bigger biotech stocks, Supernus and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) were leading the charge Monday. Clovis was up 22% Monday afternoon after getting a big FDA win for its drug to treat ovarian cancer. Trading resumed in the early afternoon after being temporarily halted.RELATED:Will Trump Break With Republicans And Push Major Drug Pricing Reform?Clovis Rockets On Cancer Win

That would be a 14-month high for the micro-cap biotech, which has had virtually no revenue.Novartis edged higher intraday.Several drugmakers are working on treatments for NASH, which stands for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a fatty liver disease. That includes liver specialists such as Intercept Pharmaceticals (ICPT) and Genfit, which does not trade on U.S. exchanges. Intercept has the advantage of its NASH drug recently winning tentative European approval for another liver disease.Among big biomed NASH players, Gilead Sciences (GILD) has candidates in trials. Allergan (AGN) made two acquisitions in September to enter the NASH development field.Intercept, Gilead and Allergan all fell about 1% intraday.RELATED:Biogen Names Insider New CEO After Five-Month Search, Stock FallsClovis Stock Rallies After AstraZeneca-Rivaling Ovarian Cancer Win

779,AGN,"As promised, Mylan (MYL) announced Friday that its generic version of its own EpiPen injector — which will cost about half the price of its existing EpiPen — will reach pharmacies next week.Mylan and its EpiPen have become the last poster boys for the issue of rapidly escalating drug prices. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch got skewered in a House committee hearing in September, with lawmakers asking questions about Bresch's own pay and her use of a private plane to travel to the hearing. Bresch is the daughter of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).The cost of a two-pen EpiPen pack has risen to $600 from about $100 in 2007. It's used to treat often life-threatening allergic reactions caused by insect bites, food, drugs and more.""Americans are rightfully concerned about rising drug prices, and now more than ever patients and families across this country are standing at the pharmacy counter struggling to pay for their medications,"" Bresch said in the company's announcement Friday.IBD'S TAKE: The pricing issue has weighed on drug stocks, but some groups are doing well. Find out which groups are on the upswing by regularly checking in with IBD's in-depth Industry Snapshot feature.The issue will remain on the front burner. While President-elect Trump had not been expected to focus on drug pricing as much as on easing the drug-approval process, he said in a Time magazine interview published this month: ""I'm going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""On Thursday, Mylan was among six drugmakers sued by 20 state attorneys general on allegations of fixing the prices of two generic drugs. Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) also was among those sued. Teva and Mylan are the two largest generic-drug makers by market cap. In a statement on that news, Mylan said that ""to date, we know of no evidence Mylan participated in price fixing.""Thursday's news followed Wednesday's announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice that it had charged the former CEO and former president of New Jersey-based Heritage Pharmaceuticals of colluding to fix generic drug prices. The charges were the first in a two-year DOJ investigation of drug price fixing. The DOJ is looking at Mylan, Teva and a group of companies that includes Allergan (AGN) and Endo International (ENDP). They have all disclosed receiving subpoenas.The AG suit revealed Thursday had named Heritage as the ""principal architect and ringleader of the conspiracies.""Mylan stock, down 30% this year, rose 0.2% to 37.86 in the stock market today. Teva, down nearly 45% this year, lost 0.65% to 36.49.Bresch, in Mylan's announcement Friday, said problems will remain until ""the pharmaceutical pricing system is reformed to address the increasing shift of costs directly to consumers. Pharmaceutical pricing is too far removed from the patient at the pharmacy counter and not designed for today's increasingly consumerized health care system.""The ""authorized generic"" EpiPen Auto-Injector has a wholesale acquisition cost of $300 for a two-pack. Mylan said releasing a generic version vs. the company's own product is ""an unprecedented action.""So, why would anyone chose the more expensive, nongeneric EpiPen?""Depending on several factors — for example, a patient's health insurance — the out-of-pocket cost for EpiPen Auto-Injector may be a more affordable option,"" Mylan spokeswoman Julie Knell told IBD via email. ""Mylan continues to offer both options for patients so that they can work with their health care professional to determine the best, least expensive option for them.""RELATED:Mylan, Teva Sued For Alleged Price-FixingDOJ Charges Pharma Execs With Price-Fixing

780,AGN,"Drugmaker Actavis faces fines for raising the cost of hydrocortisone tablets by more than 12,000%, British antitrust regulators said Friday as they continued a crackdown on excessive pricing in the pharmaceutical industry.The division of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) ""broke competition law by charging excessive and unfair prices in the U.K.,"" the Competition and Markets Authority said in a statement. In one example, The company raised the price of the 10 milligram packs from roughly 88 cents to $110 in U.S. currency. Teva, which acquired Actavis for $40.5 billion from Allergan (AGN) earlier this year, said it will ""defend the allegations.""""This is a lifesaving drug relied on by thousands of patients, which the (U.K.'s National Health Service, or NHS) has no choice but to continue purchasing,"" said Andrew Groves, CMA senior responsible officer. ""We allege that the company has taken advantage of this situation and the removal of the drug from price regulation, leaving the NHS — and ultimately the taxpayer — footing the bill for the substantial price rises.""The CMA sent Actavis a statement of objections laying out its concerns amid a wider crackdown on unfair drug pricing. On Dec. 7, the CMA fined Pfizer (PFE) and Flynn Pharma a record amount for abusing their dominant position by charging unfair prices for unbranded versions of the Epanutin anti-epilepsy drug.The regulator fined Pfizer roughly $105.2 million and Flynn Pharma $6.5 million after they increased prices by as much as 2,600% in September 2012. The price increases occurred after Pfizer transferred distribution rights to Flynn, which sold the medicine by its generic name, phenytoin sodium.Teva, which is already in the process of selling Actavis's U.K. operations to Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd., said the CMA probe raises broader questions about the regulation of generic medications.Although the pricing of the Actavis product ""under investigation was never under Teva's effective control, Teva believes that intervention by the CMA in prices for generic medicines raises serious policy concerns regarding the roles of both the CMA and the Department of Health,"" Teva said. ""Generic medicines continue to be an affordable alternative to branded therapies.""A statement of objections can often lead to fines or orders to change business practices. The regulator has the power to fine companies found to have abused a dominant market position up to 10% of their annual revenue.Hydrocortisone tablets are used as the primary replacement therapy for people whose adrenal glands do not produce sufficient amounts of natural steroid hormones, resulting in conditions such as Addison's disease. The tablets are also used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood, hormone and immune system disorders, skin and eye conditions, breathing problems, cancer, and severe allergies.Actavis also increased the price of 20 milligram hydrocortisone tablets by nearly 9,500%, resulting in charges to the NHS of $128.32 per pack by March 2016, the CMA said. The NHS had previously paid the equivalent of $1.34 per pack.Before April 2008, the NHS spent about 522,000 pounds a year on hydrocortisone tablets. By 2015, NHS spend on the tablets had risen to $87.4 million a year.Steep price hikes have put a string of drugmakers under the microscope in the U.S. with companies like Mylan (MYL) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX). bearing the brunt of the public outrage. President-elect Donald Trump, who had been cited as a boon to free-market health care, also declared himself an opponent of high drug prices in an interview with Time magazine.

781,AGN,"Allergan (AGN), Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) stocks fell Wednesday after the U.S. Department of Justice accused two former pharmaceutical executives of colluding to fix generic drug prices.Former Heritage Pharmaceuticals CEO Jeffrey Glazer and Jason Malek, an ex-president, were charged Wednesday in Philadelphia with conspiring to fix prices for an antibiotic and a diabetes med, all felonies, the DOJ said in a release.Both were fired from Heritage in August, according to a Bloomberg report, citing a lawsuit filed last month in New Jersey. Heritage accused Glazer and Malek of stealing tens of millions of dollars by siphoning profits in various racketeering schemes.The FBI is prepared to go after pharma companies that violate antitrust laws, said Special Agent in Charge Michael Harpster, in a statement after filing the charges. Drug price collusion ""skews the market and flouts common decency,"" he said.""It's a sad state of affairs when these pharmaceutical executives are determined to further pad their profits on the backs of people whose health depends on the company's drugs,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have nearly returned to their pre-election levels on recent commentary by Donald Trump that he would work to cut down on drug prices.On Wednesday, Teva stock fell 1.8%, Mylan 1.6% and Allergan 0.48%. IBD's 17-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group fell 0.81%.The charges are the first in a two-year investigation of generic drugmakers, including Allergan, Mylan, Teva, Lannett (LCI), Impax Laboratories (IPXL), Covis Pharma, Sun Pharmaceutical, Mayne Pharma, Taro Pharmaceuticals (TARO) and Endo International (ENDP).In an emailed statement, Edison, N.J.-based Heritage Pharma said: ""In August 2016, following an internal investigation that revealed a variety of serious misconduct by the individuals charged today, Heritage Pharmaceuticals terminated them.  We are fully cooperating with all aspects of the Department of Justice's continuing investigation.""Recently Heritage initiated its own legal action against these same individuals to seek redress for an elaborate embezzlement and self-dealing scheme.  We are deeply disappointed by the misconduct and are committed to ensuring it does not happen again.""Last month, Allergan and Sun Pharma declined to comment to IBD. Mylan said it had disclosed a subpoena regarding antibiotic doxycycline. But there's been no subpoena for information on the pricing tactics of digoxin, a blood pressure med.CEOs across the drug and biotech market have commented on rising drug prices in light of recent commentary by President-elect Donald Trump that he's ""going to bring down drug prices."" Hillary Clinton was often seen as tougher on drug prices.Earlier Wednesday, Express Scripts (ESRX) CEO Timothy Wentworth joined the fracas, saying he doesn't see a major impact to business if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. But, he said on a guidance call with analysts, the overarching drug price conversation isn't going away.""There is no question in my mind that conversation is not going to go away, and that we need to demonstrate using both our tools, but our clients' voice as well to demonstrate that,"" he said, according to MarketWatch.Shares of the pharmacy benefit management company tanked as much as 6.5% Wednesday and ended the day down 3.6% at 70.52, when below their 50-day line.

782,AGN,"Thanksgiving week saw Shire's (SHPG) Xiidra lose some ground to rival Allergan (AGN) in the dry-eye market, but the broader sector continues to grow in the wake of Xiidra's launch in August, RBC analyst Douglas Miehm said Friday.Xiidra's market share declined to 17.6% from 18.5% the prior week, Miehm said. Total Xiidra prescriptions dipped 22.1%, underperforming Allergan's Restasis, which declined 17.7%.But the declines were expected during the short week, Miehm wrote in a research report. Xiidra did better the week before, with total prescriptions climbing 11.6% as total Restasis prescriptions rose just 4.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Other Sector Leaders are facing off in the biotech world, with Boston Scientific acquiring Neovasc assets to take on Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement market.Meanwhile, new Xiidra prescriptions fell 28.2% during Thanksgiving week, wiping out an 11% increase in the prior week, Miehm wrote. Still, Xiidra's new prescription market share remained robust at 28.4%, he said, down slightly from the week-earlier 29%.The broad dry-eye market which, Miehm says, is growing 21.5% this year, based on a four-week average of total prescriptions, up from an estimated 2% year-over-year growth before Xiidra's entrance to the market.He reiterated his outperform rating and 235 price target on Shire stock, which was up more than 2.2% to close at 174.80 on the stock market today. Shares last month fell below their 200-day and 50-day moving averages.

783,AGN,"Stock buybacks by Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM), Verizon Communications (VZ),  Intel (INTC) and Comcast (CMCSA) slowed in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, but the tech and telecom stocks have another thing in common: They're all up in 2016 just the same.Apple's September-quarter share repurchases of over $6 billion were still tops among all companies — ahead of Microsoft (MSFT), General Electric (GE), Allergan (AGN) and Citigroup (C) — even though they fell 57% from Apple's $14 billion in buybacks in the year-earlier period.In its fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24, Apple's buybacks slipped to $29.72 billion from $35.2 billion the previous year, says Standard & Poor's.Comcast bought back $1.4 billion of its own stock in Q3, down from $2.8 billion in Q3 2015. In the 12 months ended Sept. 30, Comcast bought back $4.74 billion of stock, down from $7.77 billion in the year-earlier period.Qualcomm bought back $225 million of stock in Q3 and Intel repurchased $497 million, says S&P. For the 12 months ended Sept. 30, their share repurchases were down $7.3 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, from the year-earlier period.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Burlington Stores and Martin Marietta are among stocks on IBD's Leaderboard. Leaderboard follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping. The leaders are constantly monitored.Verizon has not repurchased any shares in 2016. The phone company has prioritized debt repayment after buying out Vodafone Group's (VOD) 45% stake in Verizon Wireless for $130 billion. In the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2015, Verizon bought back over $5.1 billion of its own stock, says S&P.Despite the slowdown buybacks from the above-named companies, all the stocks gained in 2016.As of Thursday's close, Apple stock was up 11% for the year. Apple stock, flat in the stock market today at 116.73, has formed a cup pattern, with a buy point of 118.79.Comcast stock, down a fraction Thursday, is up 24% for the year.Qualcomm rose 0.44% Thursday to 66.04, and it's up 32% for the year.

"
784,AGN,"An interview with Time upon his selection as the news magazine's Man of the Year brought President-elect Trump's most definitive statements to date on drug prices: ""I'm going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""The incoming president, though, has been short on details. And many observers say his bigger focus will be to streamline the U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug approval process. That effort got a boost on Wednesday, the same day Trump's Time interview was published, when the U.S. Senate approved a bill aimed at speeding up approval for drugs and medical devices. President Obama is expected to approve the so-called 21st Century Cures bill.But just what actions Trump will take remain as unknown as any resolution to the issue of drug prices that, at times, jump exponentially despite the critical needs of patients.Trump has vowed to repeal President Obama's Affordable Care Act. And he's promised to ""drain the swamp"" of special interests in Washington that helped contribute to the rise of Big Pharma.Before the Time interview, though, he hadn't broached the drug pricing issue, which just after his election boosted drug stocks. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnologg ETF (IBB) jumped 12.6% in the two days after the Nov. 8 election, but it's fallen 8% since. IBD's 421-company Biomed/Biotech industry group jumped 9.7% on Nov. 9, while the generic and ethical drug groups rose 7% and 5.7%, respectively. The groups have given back those gains.Trump can't ignore rising drug prices, says Trevor Williams, Penn Mutual Asset Management managing director. The trouble is that the businessman and reality TV star is a relative political enigma, Williams told IBD.""It's hard for me to see him being a champion (of lowering drug prices) in the same sense Hillary would have been because he's so focused on dismantling the ACA,"" Williams said. ""But with Trump not having a political history, it's really difficult to telegraph where he's going to go with it.""Some of his policy proposals, though, could be telling.Trump pledged in a ""Contract with the American Voter"" to fully repeal the ACA, better known as ObamaCare, within his first 100 days in office, replacing it with Health Savings Accounts. In that vein, he said he'll cut down on FDA ""red tape.""""There are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications,"" Trump wrote in his contract.Trump's crack at the FDA is nothing new, says Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan. Yet, in recent years the FDA has worked to expedite sorely needed drugs through its Fast Track Designation and with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which helps fund drugs quickly.Still, there is a backlog in approvals of generic drugs, Divan told IBD. Many proposals in the works have targeted making the approval process for generic drugs — cheaper drugs similar to drugs out long enough that they've lost their patent protection — much easier.Trump's platform would remove barriers to entry for ""safe, reliable and cheaper"" products. Trump could also allow broader and off-label use for a number of drugs, Penn's Williams said.His replacement plan for the ACA remains somewhat ambiguous. Trump has backed off earlier promises to fully repeal the act. For one, he says he'll maintain provisions that require insurers to cover patients with pre-existing conditions and let parents cover their children through age 26.Obama didn't touch pharmaceuticals much in his ObamaCare legislative centerpiece, says Divan, outside of requiring drugmakers to pay for some of the expanded health care coverage. If Trump completely does away with the ACA — which is unlikely, Divan says — some of those fees could disappear.""Backroom negotiations (for the ACA) let the companies come out reasonably well,"" Divan said. Repealing the ACA could put the cash from those fees back into drugmakers' pockets. Yet, Wall Street is anything but reasonably sure how Trump-care could affect biotech and drug firms.Trump doesn't appear to have any vendetta against pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), but drugmakers might. PBM tactics undercut Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in Q3, prompting both stocks to topple in late October after Amgen offered dim 2017 views and Eli Lilly saw diabetes sales take a hit.PBMs are third-party administrators for commercial, government and Medicare health plans. PBMs use discounts and competition to keep drug prices low, which can help patients but raise conflicts with drugmakers.Amgen stock toppled nearly 10% on Oct. 25 after its Q3 sales of immunosuppressant Enbrel came in flat. The firm, though, said it doesn't expect any net selling price increases in 2017. The business will be driven on volume, Amgen executive Anthony Hooper said on the company's earnings conference call.IBD'S TAKE: Rebates chipped away at Amgen's Enbrel sales in Q3. What does this mean for the broader industry? Grab IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper look.Eli Lilly stock on Oct. 25 after its Q3 sales of diabetes drug Humalog fell 14% ""as higher volume was more than offset by lower realized prices,"" the company said in its earnings conference call, after EPS and revenue missed Wall Street targets.Trump's lack of commentary on PBMs could be telling, Divan told IBD. As it stands, the government is not involved in drug price negotiations. But Trump could work to change this in order to lower drug prices. That's not been a focus of Republicans, Divan says, though Trump is not your typical Republican.The question, he says, is whether ""the new administration willing to go after something (Big Pharma) politically to score some points with the general public?""Drug companies have their own views, of course. Merck (MRK) CEO Ken Frazier this month, in a Bloomberg interview, said his company has been ""restrained"" in raising prices.""There will always be an individual drug in an individual year that you can point to and say, 'That looks large in relation to others.' But if you look at the whole portfolio, you will see that Merck has tended to be rather restrained when it comes to drug prices,"" Bloomberg reported Frazier saying.Bloomberg also reported this month that Allergan (AGN) CEO Brent Saunders said Trump could ""be more vicious, more focused, on taking down whoever does something again"" in terms of spiking the price of a drug or drugs. Bloomberg had interviewed Saunders and Frazier after both appeared at the Forbes Healthcare Summit in New York on Dec. 1.There's no question patients have had it with high drug prices.The Kaiser Foundation found in September that 77% of Americans, up from 72% last year, believe drug prices are too high. Americans generally support requiring firms to release information on how prices are set and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices.Kaiser's survey followed a drug pricing controversy that erupted in September over Mylan (MYL) boosting its price on a pair of EpiPens to $600 from about $100 in 2007. Its CEO, Heather Bresch, was subjected to tough questioning at a House committee hearing.Last year, a similar controversy prompted Capitol Hill hearings involved Turing Pharmaceuticals and its former CEO, Martin Shkreli, involving big hikes on a decades-old HIV drug. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) has also imposed huge hikes on drug prices.The U.S. Justice Department is investigating and is expected to file charges against some generic drug companies for price collusion before year's end.Yes, while analyst Divan says ""I don't think the issue is going away,"" he also says he sees fewer chances of big changes to drug pricing policies under Trump.RELATED:Pfizer's Q3 Sales Challenged By Eli Lilly, Novartis Amid Breakup BustEli Lilly Topples As Alzheimer's Darling Sola Fails; Biogen, Merck DownCelgene, Kite, Spark Look To Sidestep Lilly Alzheimer's FlopAlder Keels For Sixth Day After EU Upholds Teva Migraine Patent

785,AGN,"As has been the norm, Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks in the third quarter as the information technology sector overall led the field, says a report by FactSet Research.Firms in the S&P 500 overall spent $115.6 billion on share buybacks in Q3, but that was down 28% year over year and the smallest quarterly total since Q1 2013.Top spender Apple repurchased $7.2 billion worth of shares in Q3. Following Apple for second place was General Electric (GE) at $4.3 billion, then Microsoft (MSFT) at $3.55 billion, Allergan (AGN) at $3.2 billion and McDonald's (MCD) at $2.77 billion.Apple, General Electric and Microsoft led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks in Q2 as well. Three months ago Microsoft said its directors had authorized a new stock buyback program of as much as $40 billion, and the company reaffirmed that it is on track to complete its current $40 billion buyback authorization by year-end.IBD'S TAKE: Share repurchases are a popular way to return capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings by reducing the number of shares outstanding. It's also a move that companies make when they begin to transition from rapid growth into middle age.As has been the norm for the S&P 500 index, the information technology sector was the top spending group in terms of buybacks at $27 billion, but that was down 41% year over year. Several major contributors were the smaller repurchases from Oracle (ORCL), Intuit (INTU), and Apple. The financials sector was the second top spending group, with $25 billion worth of stock being repurchased in Q3.Apple shares rose 0.1% to 117.06 on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple, Exxon Mobil Lead S&P 500 In Q2 Dividends PaidApple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Are Kings Of Cash

786,AGN,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX) sales force expansion for two stomach drugs could signal failed negotiations to sell its Salix Pharmaceuticals unit, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said Wednesday amid a similar report from The Wall Street Journal.Acquisition talks between Valeant and Japanese firm Takeda Pharmaceuticals broke down during an 11th-hour price disagreement, inside sources told the WSJ. Valeant officials didn't immediately return a request for comment from IBD.Takeda would have paid roughly $10 billion for Salix, a business Valeant bought in 2015, winning a bidding war with rival Endo International (ENDP). Salix was the largest independent gastrointestinal (GI) drug company in the world before its acquisition.Since then, though, Valeant has accrued nearly $30.4 billion in long-term debt, according to its Q3 earnings release. Amid struggles that included allegations about its relationship with the since-shuttered Philidor mail-order pharmacy, complaints about price hikes on some of its drugs and the naming of a new CEO, Valeant stock has toppled 94% since its peak in August 2015. Valeant stock closed down 8% at 15.79 in the stock market today.On Tuesday, Valeant said it planned to expand its sales force for primary care physician (PCP) prescribers of Xifaxan for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea and Relistor for opioid-induced constipation. The cost of doing so is already included in its 2016 guidance, Valeant said.IBD'S TAKE: Valeant stock has gone about as low as most stocks can do, with a near-worst-possible Composite Rating of 2, meaning it underperforms 98% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Gauge your better drug-company bets on the Stock Checkup.Mizuho's Koffler reiterated her underperform rating and 11 price target Wednesday on Valeant stock.Xifaxan is an antibiotic and only taken for two weeks at a time, she wrote in a research report.

Zemcolo recently had success in a phase 3 trial for treating traveler's diarrhea.""We think that the expansion is a reasonable, but ultimately futile, reaction to Xifaxan's slowing growth as evidenced by year-over-year growth of 2.3% in 550-milligram (total prescriptions) and an average year-over-year decline of 1.8% in 550-mg (new prescriptions) over the past four-week period,"" Koffler wrote.RELATED:Mallinckrodt Earnings Top, But Stock Dives On GuidanceValeant Officials Charged In Connection With Kickback SchemeInvestment Houses Said To Be Eyeing Buyout Of Valeant DivisionValeant Crashes On Q3 Sales, EPS Miss; Slashes 2016 Guidance

787,AGN,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock nose-dived Monday after the firm scrapped development of a drug to treat walking impairments in stroke patients — defying an otherwise upbeat day for biotech stocks.On the stock market today, Acorda stock toppled 4.2% to 20.40. Shares are down by half for the year vs. a 16% dip in IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. Shares of the group were up a small fraction Monday afternoon.RBC analyst Michael Yee maintained an outperform rating on Acorda stock, but noted low prior expectations on Ampyra's use in stroke victims with walking impairments. Ampyra is a muscle strengthener that can be used in treating multiple sclerosis.Acorda began enrolling patients in phase three of its post-stroke walking-deficit trial for Ampyra in December 2014. The study was stopped early at a pre-specified interim analysis due to lacking efficacy.By week 12, 19% and 14% of patients receiving 10-milligram and 7.5-mg doses, respectively, showed at least a 20% improvement on a two-minute walking test. But that wasn't much better than patients on the placebo — 13.5% showed the same improvement.IBD'S TAKE: Acorda stock has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 14, meaning it underperforms 86% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Find better bets on the Stock Checkup.Investors remain leery of Ampyra as its patent faces continual pressure, Yee wrote. The U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board is due to make a decision on a pending petition in March. Acorda and Allergan (AGN) recently reached a settlement over an Ampyra patent dispute.""Bottom line, (the) stock currently remains cheap given the fact that it still only prices in the Civitas program (CVT-301) and nothing else,"" Yee wrote.

788,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) stock plunged to a six-month low Wednesday after the drugmaker reported third-quarter sales and earnings that missed Wall Street's views and cut its full-year guidance on lagging demand for its Asacol and Namenda drugs.On the stock market today, Allergan stock fell 5.2% to 197.89. Meanwhile, IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group slipped a fraction.For the third quarter, Allergan reported $3.62 billion in sales and $3.32 earnings per share ex items, up 4% and down 2.6%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics missed the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet for $3.68 billion and $3.56.Sales of ulcerative colitis drug Asacol fell 45% to $86.4 million amid growing generic rivalry, as Namenda sales dipped 31.5% to $146.5 million. Sales of Namenda, a dementia drug, fell on an unfavorable rate of currency exchange with foreign nations, Allergan said in a release.Allergan also slashed its full-year profitability guidance to $13.3o-$13.50 in adjusted earnings, vs. earlier expectations for $13.75-$14.2o. At the midpoint of guidance, adjusted earnings would be down 2.5% vs. the year-earlier quarter.The firm also kept its full-year sales view at $14.45 billion to $14.65 billion, which would be up 9.5% vs. 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Fellow drugmakers Amgen and Biogen are also struggling amid the angst-fraught political environment.

789,AGN,"President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Congress will likely seek faster drug pipelines, buoying Medidata Solutions (MDSO) and other medical software firms, KeyBanc analyst Donald Hooker said Monday, as drugs stocks rose again.The emphasis on faster pipelines will come amid reduced drug pricing scrutiny and Trump's plan to incentivize repudiating cash to the U.S., Credit Suisse analyst Kennen MacKay wrote in a separate research report. He predicts a Trump presidency will likely keenly boost the biotech sector.On the stock market today, Medidata stock helped lead IBD's 17-company Computer Software-Medical industry group, which was up 1%. Medidata stock was up 4.2% to 55.53, its seventh straight gain. Hooker has an overweight rating and 65 price target on shares, and he says the macro backdrop has improved for Medidata following Trump's election.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and drug stocks have flown on Trump's win, but uncertainty exists in his intentions for the Affordable Care Act. Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full skinny.""Rising drug prices have become a major political issue this year,"" Hooker wrote in a research report Monday. ""Instead of price controls, we suspect that Republican solutions will more likely involve regulatory reforms that speed up approvals on new drugs and create greater competition.""Trump could ""make drug development great again,"" he quipped.Hooker sees 20% organic growth for Medidata in 2017 given the likely improving regulatory and legislative landscape for information technology in drug development. Medidata has enterprise deals with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Boehringer Ingelheim.IBD's biotech industry group rose 6% the day after the election, though it fell Thursday and Friday. The 421-company group was up 1.7% Monday. IBD's 18-company generic drug group has risen every day since the election, and it was up 2.1% Monday on hopes that Trump regulations could help the industry.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was seen as tougher on runaway drug prices. In September 2015, the biotech industry saw stocks tumble when Clinton called out former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli for boosting the cost on a decades-old HIV pill.In September, Mylan (MYL) drew national ire after raising the price on a pair of EpiPens to $600, from about $100 in 2007. Mylan, Allergan (AGN) and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) are among a handful of drugmakers currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for alleged price collusion.But Trump likely won't push back on drug pricing, MacKay said. Investors are more bullish on the sector given Trump's proposals to incentivize returning cash to the U.S.Still, ""we caution that health care/pricing could be one of the areas where Mr. Trump makes concessions with Democrats,"" he wrote in his research report. Seattle Genetics (SGEN) stock reacted richly to Trump's election, he noted.RELATED:Incyte Recoups Losses After Price-Fixing Fracas On Strong Chemo ResultsMylan Third-Quarter Earnings Fall Short But Stock Steady

790,AGN,"Pfizer (PFE) stock popped Thursday on a report the drugmaker is considering selling its consumer care business for $14 billion, less than two months after the firm opted against a long-rumored corporate breakup.Evercore analyst John Scotti expects the potential transaction to garner 7 cents earnings per share in 2018, at the midpoint of the forecast, assuming after-tax proceeds of the sale are used for share buybacks.The potential sale makes sense, Scotti wrote in a research report Thursday, as Pfizer reassesses its future. Pfizer walked away from a $160 billion merger with Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) in April, after lawmakers looked to crack down on tax-inversion deals, where U.S. companies were setting up their headquarters in lower-tax regions such as Ireland. Pfizer also had long mulled a corporate breakup, splitting up its innovative and essential health divisions, but scrapped that idea in September.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) bought Pfizer's then consumer care business in 2006. Pfizer built that unit back up with its 2009 acquisition of Wyeth. Later, Pfizer sold its nutrition business to Nestle and spun off its animal health business, Zoetis (ZTS).""Thus, the sale of the current portfolio of consumer products appears to be a logical next step that will allow Pfizer to focus on its core competency — developing and selling innovative drugs,"" Scotti wrote.IBD'S TAKE: How will Trump's presidency affect drug and biotech stocks? Get the full skinny on IBD's Industry Themes.Reuters first reported the potential customer care sale late Wednesday, citing anonymous sources. The unit pulls in $3.5 billion in sales annually. Scotti likened it to Bayer's $14.2 billion acquisition of Merck's (MRK) consumer care business, a $2 billion annual unit.On the stock market today, Pfizer stock climbed 4.3% to 33.49, above its 50-day line, ramping for a second consecutive day following the election of President-elect Donald Trump. Shares rose 7.1% on Wednesday.Drug and biotech stocks have rebounded on Trump's election. Trump is seen as less likely to challenge drug prices vs. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who unveiled a plan last year to cut the spiraling price tags on drugs.Trump, though, has promised to tackle the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare), which investment bank RBC said Tuesday could cause a dip in biotech stocks on the uncertainty of new, not-yet-outlined national health care.Editor's Note: Corrects fourth graph to show Zoetis was a spinoff.RELATED:Pfizer Will Likely Overpay For M&A Post Allergan Breakup-Flop: JeffriesUnexpected Twist: Pfizer Scraps Breakup Following Dead Allergan Merger

791,AGN,"Drugmaker Mylan (MYL) is slated to report rising Q3 sales and earnings after the close Wednesday, just four days after it and fellow drug leaders Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Allergan (AGN) plummeted on news of a federal probe into alleged price collusion.For Q3, Mylan is expected to report $1.46 earnings per share ex items on $3.123 billion in sales, up a respective 2.1% and 15% vs. the year-earlier quarter. It would be Mylan's 12th consecutive quarter of sales and EPS growth.EPS is expected to decelerate from 27% growth in Q2, but sales are seen speeding up from 8% growth in the prior quarter. Mylan has beat or met EPS views from the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for seven of the past eight quarters. But sales have only beat twice.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has an IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it performs near the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Get the Stock Checkup to see which stocks are better rated.Mylan stock is down 30% over the past 13 weeks and touched a three-year low on Thursday, as the company has attracted national ire for its EpiPen prices. In September, CEO Heather Bresch was grilled by a congressional committee about the high prices, with a two-pack of EpiPens priced at $600, up from about $100 in 2007. EpiPens are used to treat severe allergic reactions to insect stings, bites and foods.Over the same time period, IBD's 44-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group has fallen 8.6%, including a 9% nose-dive last Thursday when reports emerged of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into potential price collusion among generic drugmakers.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Mylan stock ended trading up more than 4.5% to 36.59.RELATED:Incyte Recoups Losses After Price-Fixing Fracas On Strong Chemo Results

792,AGN,"Shares of drug giant Pfizer (PFE) fell Tuesday after the company said it would end development of a cholesterol-lowering drug projected to be a blockbuster, reduced its earnings outlook for the current quarter and posted Q3 EPS that just missed Wall Street expectations.Pfizer stock fell 2.1% to 31.06 in the stock market today. The member of the Dow Jones 30 industrials is trading at a nearly seven-month low, after touching a 12-year high above 37 on Aug. 1.Ceasing work on the injection drug, called bococizumab, was unexpected. The company said it proved to have unexpected side effects and was becoming less effective.Wall Street had modeled $1.5 billion in peak annual sales for bococizumab, Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in a note to clients. ""PFE was clear that they do not see this attenuation of benefit in competitive data"" from Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron (REGN), he wrote. The problem ""appears to be bococizumab specific,"" Scotti said.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer's megadeal to buy Allergan went bust in April. Could AT&T's $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner go the same direction?For Q3, the drugmaker said revenue rose 8% from the year-earlier quarter, to $13.05 billion, while earnings per share inched up 2% to 61 cents. Revenue met views, but EPS missed by a penny, according to Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti.For 2016, Pfizer now guides to EPS of $2.38-$2.43, down from its earlier guidance of $2.38-$2.48, and to sales of $52 billion-$53 billion, vs. earlier guidance of $51 billion-$53 billion.Pfizer attributed the miss to higher-than-expected COGS, cost of goods sold, tied to foreign exchange rates, Scotti said. Sales of breast cancer drug Ibrance were ""marginally below consensus,"" Scotti said, but ""Prevnar delivered a small beat."" Sales of Prevnar, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, missed forecasts in Q2.""Our Innovative Health business executed strongly behind the latest product launches, and our two recent acquisitions — Medivation and Anacor — are providing new near-term opportunities to potentially drive incremental growth for the business as its product pipeline continues to mature,"" Pfizer CEO Ian Read said in the earnings release. ""We see this business as highly focused on those therapeutic areas where it is best positioned to deliver value to patients.""By maintaining our overall high level of financial flexibility and discipline, we are in a strong position to support the strategic initiatives for each business and will remain opportunistic to business development activity in addition to continuing to actively manage our cost structure.""In August, Pfizer announced its agreement to acquire Medivation, maker of prostate cancer drug Xtandi, for $14 billion. This came after New York-based Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) in April called off their planned merger, which would have been the industry's largest ever, after U.S. regulators set up roadblocks to so-called tax-inversion mergers, where U.S. companies looked to set up headquarters in lower-tax regions such as Ireland.In September, Pfizer said it would not split into two separate companies, a move it had mulled for several years. It had been expected to separate its Essential Health business, consisting of older, off-patent medications, and its Innovative Health business, which is dedicated to newer drugs.RELATED:Surprise Twist: Pfizer Won't Split UpLilly, AbbVie Lead 2017 Rankings, Pfizer Challenged

793,AGN,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) cut its losses Tuesday on a fibrosis drug, but still plans to send two potential treatments for fatty liver disease to phase-two testing in 2017, a Needham analyst said Wednesday after the biotech's Q3 earnings report.But Needham's analyst, Alan Carr, kept his hold rating on Gilead stock following its Q3 report late Tuesday. In the stock market today, shares dipped 2.1% to 72.51. Shares are down 28% this year, matching the decline in IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group.For Q3, Gilead reported $7.5 billion in sales and $2.75 in earnings per share ex items, down a respective 9.6% and 15% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales topped the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet for $7.46 billion, but EPS missed by 9 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead's Q3 report follows those of Amgen and BioMarin. Both are similarly struggling during the volatile election season. Keep tabs on Industry Themes for more.Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti attributed the Q3 sales beat to HIV-1 drug Genvoya, which brought in $80 million more than expected. That was partly offset by a $30 million miss in hepatitis C drug sales. Sales of hep C drugs have been impacted by Medicaid, which restricts access to all but the most seriously ill patients.Gilead's hep C unit is comprised of Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa. The trio brought in $3.3 billion in sales, down 31% vs. the year-earlier period. Gilead attributed the decline to lower demand for Harvoni and Sovaldi. Epclusa launched in June and July in the U.S. and Europe, respectively.RBC analyst Michael Yee expects some near-term challenges for Gilead stock on low visibility for its hepatitis C sales in the U.S. and in Europe. He kept an outperform rating on Gilead stock but cut his price target to 90 from 95.Gilead also announced it discontinued testing of fibrosis drug simtuzumab, which failed to show efficacy in phase-two trials of NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Instead, the firm is looking to send two single agents to phase-two testing and has plans for combination trials in 2017.The NASH battle, meanwhile, continues to heat up with Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), Novartis (NVS), Allergan (AGN) (which is buying Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for that purpose) and Gilead all in the mix. NASH affects some 3 million Americans every year.Liver disease is ""an area of opportunity,"" Needham's Carr wrote in his research report.RELATED:Allergan Stock Topples On Q3 Miss; Slashes 2016 Outlook

795,AGN,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) drug is ""clearly active and promising,"" but Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) remains one to two years ahead, RBC analyst Michael Yee said after Gilead, the No. 2 biotech by market cap, unveiled promising efficacy data.Gilead's Selonsertib aims to inhibit apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, a protein tied to NASH, diabetic kidney disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Of 72 patients enrolled in Gilead's 24-week phase-two study, 43% showed at least some improvement in fibrosis, the company said.That jibes with the results of Intercept's earlier NASH study, in which 35% to 40% of patients had a positive response vs. 20% on the placebo track, Yee wrote.Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA), which is being acquired by Allergan (AGN), also is active in the NASH market. In a recent study, 20% saw improvement in fibrosis using Tobira's drug.But Intercept has a healthy lead over Gilead and Tobira/Allergan, Yee says. All three are vying for a NASH market worth a potential $2 billion to $5 billion. Intercept should see key data in 2018-2019, but its rivals will likely have to wait until 2019-20, he says.""From a competitive landscape this is not shocking that there are NASH drugs that are starting to show promise and move into late stage,"" Yee wrote. ""Intercept is still one to two years ahead and will have data (in) 2018-2019.""Thursday's news did little for Gilead stock on Friday. On the stock market today, Gilead fell 3 cents to 74.28. Shares are down 26% for the year, as IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group has fallen 22%.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead is on tap to report its Q3 earnings on Nov. 1.

796,AGN,"Shire's (SHPG) Xiidra is routing Allergan's (AGN) dry-eye drug market share, RBC analyst Douglas Miehm said Friday, as he nearly tripled his expectations for sales of Shire's Xiidra in 2016-2018.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan stock fell 2.1% to 227.55, while Shire stock dropped 1.8% to 187.70. Miehm has an outperform rating and 245 price target on Shire stock.Shire stock broke out of a flat base at an entry point at 203.47 on Sept. 19, but the breakout's gone nowhere and shares are now 7% below the buy point, in an area where investors are advised to sell. Some drug stocks have been hit by the volatile election season, with high drug and health care prices always a big issue.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks were the worst-performing group on Wednesday and have slipped since. The 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group toppled to No. 11 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 8 over the past week. Can they climb the Q3 ""wall of worry?""In the first week of October, Shire's dry-eye drug pulled in 9,963 total prescriptions, up 8.7% week over week. That compares with incumbent Restasis from Allergan, which saw total prescriptions fall 1.7% despite increasing 1.9% in the prior week.Shire's total market share grew to 13.3% from 12.2% in the prior week, Miehm wrote. The total dry-eye drug market is nearly 75,000 prescriptions, up almost 4% over the past four weeks following Xiidra's launch on Aug. 29.Trends play well into RBC's outlook, Miehm says. He hiked his expectations for 2016 Xiidra sales to $120 million from $41 million. For 2017 and 2018, he sees $726 million and $1.14 billion in sales, respectively. All three forecasts nearly tripled vs. earlier views.RELATED:Pfizer Will Likely Overpay For M&A Assets Post-Allergan Breakup Flop: JeffriesProthena Slammed On Politics; Could Win Eli Lilly Or Pfizer PartnershipAllergan Challenges Intercept With Tobira NASH Drug

797,AGN,"Stocks turned mixed after a soft start Wednesday as Wall Street digested news of a Trump win.After plunging more than 700 points overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average was mostly unchanged. The Nasdaq lost 0.5% and the S&P 500 eased 0.3%.Early leaders in the Dow, included Pfizer (PFE), Caterpillar (CAT) and Merck (MRK). JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) also outperformed.IBD'S TAKE: The election result was described as ""shocking"" and an upset, but the IBD/Tipp presidential tracking poll ultimately had it right.The 10-year Treasury yield soared 11 basis points to 1.97%. December gold rallied around 1% to $1,286.50 an ounce.Drugmakers, a campaign target of Democrat Hillary Clinton due to pricing, traded generally higher. In Pfizer's industry group, Mallinckrodt (MNK), Shire (SHPG) and Allergan (AGN) led with gains of more than 8%.Hospital operators, which stand to lose if President-elect Trump acts on promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act,  dove deeper into their early losses. Tenet Healthcare (THC) toppled 26%, HCA Holdings (HCA) skidded 15% and Universal Health Services (UHS) dropped 10%.Coal mining stocks soared with Consol Energy (CSX) up 12%. Arch Coal (ARCH) added 8%.Cement and construction aggregates suppliers surged, possibly on an early commitment to infrastructure and other large-scale projects by Trump. Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta (MLM) each swept 10% higher. Martin Marietta gapped out of a cup-shaped base with a 206.46 buy point.

798,AGN,"No. 2 drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) could become acquisitive post-breakup flop, but it will likely overpay for those M&A assets, said Jeffries analyst Jeffrey Holford as he downgraded Pfizer stock Thursday, citing a lack of catalysts.In the stock market today, Pfizer stock fell nearly 1% to 32.76, its third consecutive down day. Shares dipped out of a flat base that formed over nearly two months and are now 13% from a possible entry point at 37.49.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs toppled hard Wednesday on political angst. But on Thursday, players like Supernus Pharmaceuticals rebounded. You can find a day's big movers at IBD's Stocks On The Move.Holford downgraded Pfizer stock to a hold rating from buy, and cut his price target to 36 from 39 ""as the key drivers that originally drove our upgrade have played out or failed to materialize,"" he wrote in a research report.Ibrance, Pfizer's treatment for metastatic breast cancer, was granted accelerated FDA approval in early 2015. But the strong ramp it enjoyed in the U.S. has since petered out. Rivals could add some pressure in 2017, even as Pfizer prepares for its European launch.""We note recent prescription trends indicate that the U.S. opportunity is becoming saturated as patients are beginning to roll off treatment as rapidly as new ones are recruited,"" he wrote. ""The European launch should reinvigorate growth in 2017.""Similarly, Holford was previously bullish on Pfizer Prevnar-13, a drug to combat pneumococcal pneumonia. But much of the U.S. adult catch-up opportunity is now penetrated, he wrote.Pfizer's biggest potential catalyst is to engage in M&A, which Holford sees as likely over the next 12-18 months. Pfizer walked away from its $160 billion merger with Allergan (AGN) after tax rules changed in April. Last month, it scrapped a years' old plan to itself break up into two separate companies.M&A would help Pfizer drive a stronger growth profile, but it's risky, he wrote.""Whilst management may find attractive targets to acquire, we believe that the environment for M&A is very competitive right now and there is a high risk that Pfizer may overpay for assets,"" he wrote.RELATED:Prothena Slammed On Politics; Could Win Eli Lilly Or Pfizer PartnershipMerck Topples Bristol-Myers On Lung Cancer Drug WinRegeneron-Sanofi Could Beat Pfizer, Roche, AstraZeneca On Eczema

799,AGN,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

800,AGN,"Biotech stocks climbed for the third consecutive day Tuesday, with mid-cap Tesaro (TSRO) forging the way, but among the largest companies, Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG) are buyable now, says Mizuho analyst Salim Syed.Syed initiated coverage Tuesday on Amgen, Gilead and Celgene stocks with buy ratings. He also initiated on Biogen (BIIB), but with a neutral rating on the lack of near- or medium-term catalysts and uncertainty after former CEO George Scangos resigned in July.""To be clear, we still think Biogen has some good programs and it could be a matter of time before we get excited again ... just not right now,"" Syed wrote in a research report. He has a 290 price target on Biogen stock, which slipped 2 cents Tuesday to 295.60.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group lifted a fraction on the stock market today. But the volatile election season has strangled shares, causing the group to topple 16% over the past seven weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Syed has a neutral rating on Biogen stock, but shares are looking better after Biogen and Ionis announced early efficacy in phase 3 testing of a spinal muscular atrophy drug. Check out Industry Themes for the full take.Syed likened Amgen to a jogger. He has a 164 price target on the stock, down a fraction to 138.45 on Tuesday.""Before Amgen's most recent Q3 call, we thought of Amgen largely as a 'ho-hum' steady stock, a jogger if you will,"" he wrote. ""However, since Amgen's Q3 call (about 1.5 weeks ago), the stock has come down about 12%.""Enbrel commentary during the Q3 call spooked investors, he says. Sales of the immunosuppressant were flat at $1.45 billion and, given contract negotiations, Amgen expects ""relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017"" for Enbrel.Wall Street has been predicting a decline in Amgen's legacy businesses for some time. But Syed sees a silver lining in new drugs, like Amgen's Repatha, a cholesterol-busting PCSK9si rival of Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron's (REGN) Praluent.Repatha already has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but sales have suffered on restricted access, Syed wrote. Repatha is currently in phase 3 testing to treat cardiovascular outcomes and, in September, met primary and secondary endpoints in a phase 3 test for coronary artery disease.CV data are expected in Q1. Syed calls this ""the most important data event for Amgen."" A positive event could pull Amgen stock out of the dumps. Shares hit a two-year low Friday, though they managed to close up fractionally for the day.Gilead managed the impossible in 2013-14 after it launched Hepatitis C (HCV) drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni and tripled its revenue to become a $30 billion company, Syed wrote in a separate report. But the duo are cures for HCV and, therefore, won't last forever.""The flip side of developing a cure is eventually the disease will be eradicated,"" he wrote. ""While great for patients, this means declining revenues over time. This has been weighing on Gilead's stock as the answer of slope of decline isn't exactly clear.""For Q3, Gilead's hep C trio -- Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa -- brought in $3.3 billion in sales, down 31% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Epclusa, which launched in June and July in the U.S. and Europe helped to offset declines in Sovaldi and Harvoni.Syed models 10% year-over-year declines in HCV sales for Gilead.But Gilead is working on its next leg of growth, Syed says. He has an 88 price target on Gilead stock. Its nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Hepatitis B (HBV) drugs are still too early in their pipelines. Plus, Gilead is facing NASH competition from Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Allergan (AGN).Gilead isn't ""a table-pounding buy,"" but the stock is undervalued and the company will likely perform over time, rewarding patient investors, Syed wrote.Gilead stock rose 4 cents Tuesday to 74.04.If Celgene is a castle, chemotherapy drug Revlimid is its moat, Syed says. During Q3, Revlimid sales grew 30% vs. last year to $1.89 billion, driven by new market share gains and increased duration. Revlimid is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).Revlimid ""allows Celgene to grow its next sources of revenue,"" Syed wrote in a separate report. ""(Revlimid is) still a growing part of the business and a value add to Celgene, but this part of the business is fairly well established and mature.""Inside its moat, Celgene has cancer drugs durvalumab and CAR-T in conjunction with AstraZeneca (AZN) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), respectively. Celgene is also working on its next-generation replacement for Revlimid, which is expected to go generic in 2022 and be fully generic in 2026.At its core, Celgene has ozanimod, currently in phase 3 testing for multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis, and GED-301, an investigational Crohn's disease drug. These are central to Celgene's investment thesis, says Syed. He has a 130 price target on Celgene stock, which rose 0.89% Tuesday to 108.45.RELATED:Which Four Biotechs Are Derisked And Buyable Ahead Of Election Day?Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: AnalystGilead NASH Drug 'Active And Promising,' But Lagging InterceptAllergan Challenges Intercept With Tobira NASH Drug

801,AGN,"Biotechs and drugmakers rallied Friday following a big drop-off Thursday on news that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating a dozen companies suspected of price collusion, including industry leaders Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL).After plunging 9% Thursday to a four-month low, IBD's 44-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group rose 3.8% on the stock market today. The group was the second-best performer out of 197 groups.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, meanwhile, rose 2.7% and was the third-best performer.Price collusion is a new challenge for the industry, already wracked by controversies over spiraling prices. It's illegal for companies to agree on a set price or coordinate discounts.In September, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch was grilled by a congressional committee over the sixfold price increase of two EpiPens to $600. Last year, former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli drew national ire after raising the price of an AIDS medication by a factor of 56.U.S. prosecutors could file the first charges before year's end, according to anonymous sources cited by Bloomberg. Biotech and drug stocks plunged Thursday following the report.A two-year investigation spans more than a dozen companies including Teva, Mylan, Lannett (LCI), Impax Laboratories (IPXL), Covis Pharma, Sun Pharmaceutical, Mayne Pharma, Taro Pharmaceuticals (TARO) and Endo International (ENDP) subsidiary Par Pharmaceutical. Teva's Actavis unit, acquired from Allergan in August, also has been implicated.IBD'S TAKE: The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF got a nice 3.6% boost Friday, rising on a buyback following the slump Thursday. Other ETFs wobbled as the election season aims for a dynamic close next week. ETFs are a proxy for the broad market. See who's winning on IBD'S ETFs & Funds page.Several companies have acknowledged the DOJ investigation in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.In May, Allergan (AGN) received a DOJ subpoena requesting information about its generics business. Liability has since been transferred to Teva, which acquired Allergan's generic business, Actavis, in August. Teva twice disclosed two subpoenas from the DOJ and Connecticut Attorney General.Allergan declined to comment beyond the previous disclosure and liability transfer. Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley told IBD, ""Teva is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas.""Mylan has already disclosed a subpoena regarding antibiotic doxycycline. But there's been no subpoena for information regarding the pricing tactics of digoxin, a blood pressure drug. Mylan, Mayne, Par, Actavis, Sun and Lannett all make digoxin. Covis makes Lanoxin, the branded version.""Mylan is and has always been committed to cooperating with the Antitrust Division's investigation,"" spokeswoman Lauren Kashtan told IBD in an email. ""To date, we know of no evidence that Mylan participated in price fixing.""Sun Pharma declined to comment beyond saying it would continue to cooperate with the DOJ.Lannett, Impax, Covis, Mayne, Taro and Endo didn't immediately return requests for comment.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan didn't immediately see that the news would create long-term damage outside of a near-term overhang on the stocks. Allergan stock lost 4.6% on Thursday, while Teva fell 9.5%. But Allergan stock rose 3.3% Friday, while Teva rose 2.7% and Mylan 2.5%.The drag on Allergan was inappropriate considering the Actavis sale, he wrote in a research report. In Teva's case, the sharper deluge was likely an overreaction, he said.""We acknowledge the investigation will likely be an overhang on Teva and the generics space until we have more clarity on the outcome and understand any potential financial or criminal penalties that may be imposed,"" Divan wrote.RELATED:Generic-Drug Makers Crash On Report DOJ Plans Collusion ChargesEagle Pharma, Teva Pharma Diverge On 'Surprise' Leukemia Drug WinTeva Pharma Has Generic 'Tricks' Ahead, But Valuation 'A Treat'Mylan Jumps as DOJ Settlement Removes 'Lingering Concerns'Ariad Could Follow Gilead's -- Or Mylan's -- Route In Drug Price Battle

802,AGN,"Prothena's (PRTA) 10% stock nose-dive since Friday amid political volatility is a buying opportunity, says RBC analyst Michael Yee, who sees the biotech landing a partnership with the likes of Eli Lilly (LLY) or Pfizer (PFE) on its psoriasis drug.Investors, though, haven't been that bullish on Prothena stock or any of its rivals. On Wednesday, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group was the worst performing out of 197 groups tracked. Shares plunged 3.1%, dipping below the 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: The 421-company group is ranked No. 8 out of 197 groups tracked, rising from No. 126 just 13 weeks ago. But shares were raked over the coals Wednesday as Prothena and Supernus toppled markedly. Check out IBD's Industry Themes to get an idea of better stock bets.Yee chalks the weak drug stocks of late to political angst. He has an outperform rating and 95 price target on Prothena stock. Prothena shares closed up 0.9% on the stock market today to 54.85, but intraday had fallen more than 9% below an entry point at 60.09 touched on Sept. 19, out of a consolidation. Investors are advised to sell if a stock falls 7% or 8% from a buy point.""The key take-away is the recent 10% pullback, which we think is mostly all due to political uncertainties (House/Senate race), is an opportunity in our view because the company is on track with a very busy and full pipeline,"" he wrote in a research report Thursday.Prothena has three key drugs on the line. It is currently enrolling patients in Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials for NEOD001, a drug to treat amyloidosis. Amyloidosis occurs when a normally soluble protein mis-folds and accumulates, becoming toxic to organs.Yee has 70% confidence in NEOD001's chances and sees ""100% potential upside"" toward a 125 price target if the Phase 2B Pronto trial shows positive data in 2017. And Prothena's PRX002 and PRX003 are underappreciated by the Wall Street consensus, Yee says.He expects the duo to provide additional upside opportunities in 2017-2019. PRX002 aims to treat Parkinson's in partnership with Roche (RHHBY), and PRX003 is Prothena's drug for psoriasis. The latter is key considering Big Pharma's interest in inflammation drugs, evidenced by a number of Allergan (AGN) deals.""Pharma is interested in this including Pfizer and Eli Lilly,"" he wrote. ""We think Prothena could land a nice partnership on this asset after Phase II data in summer.""The design could also be novel, he says. Prothena's PRX003 is building on the science of inhibiting TH-17 cells and IL-17s cytokines, which are tied to inflammatory diseases. The method is used by Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly and Novartis (NVS) in their psoriasis drugs.RELATED:Allergan Challenges Intercept With NASH DrugEli Lilly Looks To Coral More Animal-Health Business From Zoetis
"
803,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) is taking on Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA), but Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler likes the deal, saying a key Tobira drug has ""a solid chance of approval.""Tobira's cenicriviroc (CVC), a drug to battle nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, failed to meet its primary endpoint in a two-year study ended in July. The drug, however, did show efficacy in improving fibrosis without worsening NASH.Regulatory endpoints on NASH drugs continue to change, Koffler wrote in a research report. Last year, the FDA outlined two surrogate endpoints: an improvement in fibrosis without a worsening in NASH or complete resolution of steatohepatitis without a worsening in fibrosis.Genfit and Intercept are using surrogate endpoints with interim analysis after weeks 52 to 72. If Allergan follows that path after the Tobira acquisition is final, expected late this year, it's likely CVC will get the FDA nod, Koffler wrote.Koffler trimmed her price target Tuesday on Allergan stock to 299 from 305, based on R&D expenses and expected buybacks. Allergan has been on a buying spree recently, agreeing to acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals and Akarna Pharmaceuticals, in addition to Tobira.In midday trading on the stock market today, Allergan stock fell 1.9% to close at 237.95, and continues to trade below its 50-day line.Koffler expects a sweeping beat when Allergan reports its Q3 earnings. A date hasn't yet been scheduled. For Q3, Koffler predicts $3.78 billion in sales, down 10% vs. Q3 2015, and $3.72 earnings per share ex items, up 9%.The analyst consensus models $3.79 billion in sales and $3.63 EPS ex items, according to Thomson Reuters.Koffler kept her buy rating on Allergan stock. But she also lowered her 2020 sales expectations for Restasis, Allergan's dry-eye drug, following an impressive launch from rival Shire (SHPG) with its Xiidra. For 2020, she sees $1.36 billion in sales vs. earlier calls for $1.58 billion.She also gave her Viberzi forecast a haircut, down to $495 million from $621 million.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan isn't the only drugmaker battling it out against rivals.

"
804,AGN,"The biggest breakup in drug industry history isn't happening.Pfizer (PFE) won't split in half, after years of what the pharmaceutical giant called an ""extensive evaluation."" The decision follows the collapse of Pfizer's attempted $160 billion merger with Allergan (AGN) this year, a deal that would have shifted the company's tax address overseas and bulked up units before a split. In recent months, New York-based Pfizer had signaled it might stay together.""By operating two separate and autonomous units within Pfizer we are already accessing many of the potential benefits of a split -- sharper focus, increased accountability, and a greater sense of urgency -- while also retaining the operational strength, efficiency and financial flexibility of operating as a single company,"" Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said in a statement.The question now is what's next for the biggest drugmaker in the U.S. Pfizer, in the statement, said it is ""poised to grow"" both businesses, and the drugmaker most recently agreed to a $14 billion deal to acquire Medivation (MDVN) and its cancer treatments.Investors have been waiting for a decision since 2012, when a Goldman Sachs analysts suggested the company should. Soon after, Pfizer began reorganizing its business into what eventually became two distinct units -- one cash-generating business with older and off-patent medicines, and another growth-focused operation with products dependent on more recent research and development.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have been among the healthier stocks in recent weeks, and takeover talk has been a key factor. Amgen and Biogen are among the most likely buyers as investors see a slew of potential takeover targets.The shares fell 1.2 percent to 33.85 at 8:49 a.m. ET on the stock market today. Pfizer's stock has gained 52 percent since March 2012, when the drugmaker indicated at a meeting with Goldman Sachs analysts that it may be willing to consider a breakup. That's comparable to the 53 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in the same period, but well below the 96 percent jump in the S&P Health Care Sector Index.The decision doesn't affect the financial guidance for 2016, which Pfizer reaffirmed. Both units have delivered solid year-over-year performance over the course of the past three years, demonstrating their ability to compete on a standalone basis, Pfizer said.
"
805,AGN,"An election year has added to the pressures that hit biotechnology stocks hard, but a look under the hood of two sibling biotech ETFs is revealing. It shows the more speculative companies in this extremely heterogeneous industry caused much of the hurt.BioShares Biotechnology Products (BBP) is down 1.4% year to date through Oct. 20 and invests in established companies that have brought at least one drug to market.The 35 stock holdings in this exchange traded fund include Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron (REGN).IBD'S TAKE: The largest, cap-weighted biotech ETFs stand to benefit most if these five top companies climb the ""wall of worry"" that has built around the industry.BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC) is down 31.0% so far in 2016 and invests in young and smaller companies whose drugs are in the experimental-testing stage.Its portfolio includes Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), whose shares rocketed in September after the FDA approved its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. That approval means Sarepta will move to the BBP portfolio when the two BioShares ETFs next rebalance in December.This ETF pair allows investors to decide ""how much to mix,"" in terms of combining more-risky with less-risky biotechs, said Paul Yook, founder of BioShares.BBP's focus on household names makes it a relatively less volatile fund. In contrast, BBC holds the riskiest biotechs — highflying companies whose shares could double or triple overnight, and may crash and burn just as well.Yook describes BBP and BBC as the only exchange traded funds to separate clinical-trial companies and product companies into two distinct and stand-alone investments.Investors don't seem much enamored with the idea of custom-tailoring risk. The funds are extremely small and thinly traded, nearly two years after their debut. They have, however, seen a combined $5.8 million in net inflow over the first three quarters of 2016.The BBP fund is the best performer among biotech ETFs so far this year, and BBC the worst.Meanwhile, bellwether iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) has given up 20.8% year to date and sits 21% below its December high.Biotechnology ETFs crumbled over the past year, coming under pressure from lackluster earnings as well as negative scrutiny for health care peers Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Mylan (MYL) in a politically charged season.Despite the ""wall of worry"" around this industry group, at least one analyst has a favorable outlook for biotechs after the Nov. 8 presidential elections.Yook points out another promising sign: a pickup in M&A, with mouthwatering sticker prices for target companies. Allergan (AGN) announced in September that it would acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for roughly $639 million — a 159% premium per share.Biotechs are attractively priced too. This is one rare corner of the stock market where valuations are cheaper than they have been historically, Yook told IBD in a phone interview.While many ETF investors are waiting to buy biotechnology stocks until after the November election, he believes the fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency is priced in.The Democratic presidential contender's remarks on drug price-gouging had triggered sharp biotech declines.Yook added: ""Most of the political scrutiny will be faced by specialty pharmaceutical companies such as Valeant, Mylan and Horizon (HZNP), which our BioShares funds avoid. ""RELATED:Can These Top 5 Biotechs Climb Q3 'Wall Of Worry'? RBC Calls For Rally 
"
806,AGN,"Shares of Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) multiplied more than eight-fold Tuesday after Allergan (AGN) agreed to buy the liver drug maker for as much as $1.7 billion.Allergan seeks to gain a late-stage experimental drug to treat liver diseases, one of the most anticipated categories in biotechnology. It will pay $28.35 a share for Tobira in cash, according to a statement Tuesday, or about $533 million based on the number of shares outstanding. Allergan also agreed to pay up to $49.84 a share if Tobira hits certain sales and regulatory goals.Even if Tobira fails to hit the goals, the lower price is six times its $4.74 closing price on Monday. At the close, Tobira shares had catapulted by nearly 721%, nearing 39 a share. Shares continued to climb after hours, gaining nearly 1% to 39.25 in recent action. Allergan ended the trading day down down 2.7% to 238.67.Tobira, based in South San Francisco, is developing several treatments for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis -- known as NASH, a severe type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The hefty premium shows how important therapies for the disease have become for biotech companies, with Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) both working on experimental therapies to treat it.
"
807,AGN,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) topped a Credit Suisse evaluation of pharmaceutical companies heading into 2017, leaving more challenged Pfizer (PFE), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) in the dust.But the PharmaValues 2017 list did little for IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which fell a fraction on the stock market today, a fifth consecutive down day. The group is down more than 20% this year, touched a three-month low Monday and is trading below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and pharmaceutical stocks have been trampled in the last month. With Q3 earnings reports coming up, can they climb the ""wall of worry?""Credit Suisse ranked 48 Big Pharma stocks on factors like enterprise value/net present value, pricing and replacement powers, and sales growth. Overall, Eli Lilly topped the list, with Europe-based Sanofi (SNY) and Novartis (NVS) trailing closely.AbbVie ranked highest on fundamentals, with investors likely assuming a long life span for Humira, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research report. Humira is the brand name for adalimumab, Abbvie's drug to treat arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.AbbVie stock, though, slipped a small fraction Monday, while Lilly stock fell nearly 1%.Meanwhile, Pfizer was ""weak across the board,"" AstraZeneca has a high EV/NPV (enterprise value to net present value) and Novo Nordisk is exposed to U.S. pricing pressure.For AstraZeneca, investors are potentially factoring in its oncology pipeline, Credit Suisse says, but ""recent results from others demonstrate significant risk.""Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) scored well in EV/NPV valuation, with most of its sales power driven by its generic division. Gilead Sciences (GILD), Incyte (INCY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are all trading at a discount with Vertex only needing ""minimal further pipeline success to justify the current valuation,"" the report said.Among biotechs, Vertex topped Credit Suisse's list, with Amgen (AMGN) flailing at the bottom. Like pharmaceuticals, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, has been down this month. The group fell a fraction Monday and, like the ethical drugs group, also fell for a fifth straight trading day, and fell for the seventh day of the past eight trading days.Though near the bottom overall, AstraZeneca scored well in terms of pricing power with its shift toward oncology products. But Novo Nordisk is in ""the eye"" of the diabetes-rebate storm in the U.S., Credit Suisse said.Pricing power, Credit Suisse analysts note, is important as it helps ""companies to resist discount pressures from formulary managers and governments."" In that regard, Allergan (AGN) is the clear winner, with only Shire (SHPG) rivaling it in the dry-eye market.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), which focuses on rare diseases, is the most exceptional biotech, the analysts said, while Biomarin (BMRN), Incyte and Vertex also get high marks for being unique.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly beat out the cohort on R&D productivity and ability to drive the current pipeline.This follows the dramatic seesaw between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck (MRK) after Bristol-Myers' lung cancer drug, Opdivo, failed to meet a key endpoint. Eli Lilly scored well on its launches of Trulicity for diabetes and Taltz for psoriasis.
"
808,AGN,"In an unexpected twist, Pfizer (PFE) decided against splitting up Monday, ending years of analyst speculation over what would have been one of the biggest corporate breakups in U.S. history.The decision follows ""an extensive evaluation"" and speculation that began in 2012 with Goldman Sachs' suggestion that Pfizer should consider a breakup, according to Bloomberg. The following year, Pfizer began reorganizing itself into what would become its Essential Health and Innovative Health business units.Pfizer stock closed down 1.8% at 33.64 on the stock market today, tugging down IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which fell 1.65%. Pfizer's $204 billion market cap makes it the second-largest company in the group behind $215 billion-valued Roche (RHHBY). Pfizer is trading near a three-month low of 33.55, touched Sept. 15, but shares hit a 12-year high of 37.39 on Aug. 1.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech M&A fodder is heading up, just one of the recent stories in the IBD Industry Themes column.But new tax rules in April forced Pfizer to scrap its $160 billion merger with Allergan (AGN). Under the new rules, Pfizer wouldn't have been allowed to shift its tax address overseas. Doing so would have helped Pfizer bulk up ahead of its expected breakup.Pfizer CEO Ian Read said Monday in a statement that Pfizer is already reaping the benefits of a split -- ""sharper focus, increased accountability and a greater sense of urgency — while also retaining the operational strength, efficiency and financial flexibility of operating as a single company.""Both its Innovative Health and Essential Health units have delivered three years of solid year-over-year performance, Pfizer said. In its August Q2 earnings announcement, Pfizer said Innovative Health sales rose 7% year over year and Essential Health grew 16%. Overall, Pfizer reported 11% growth in Q2 sales.""When we first explored the trapped value question several years ago, market valuations of other companies suggested that our two businesses could be worth more as separate companies than they are together in a single company,"" said Pfizer CFO Frank D'Amelio in a statement.Since then, that gap has closed, he said. Essential Health is focused on older, off-patent medications, where Innovative Health drives R&D spending for growth-oriented products. Pfizer expects the duo to become market leaders.To that end, it acquired Anacor for its Innovative unit and recently added Hospira and Innopharma to its Essential unit. It's working to close the acquisitions of Medivation (MDVN) and AstraZeneca's (AZN) small molecule anti-infective business.Pfizer reiterated its 2016 outlook. In 2017, it plans to begin giving guidance for indirect expenses incurred by its two business units.RELATED:Axovant Confidence 'Not Swayed' After Rival Alzheimer's Drug FailsLiver Disease Gets The Attention Of Several Major Biotech CompaniesAerie Pharmaceuticals Skyrockets On Eye Drug News
"
809,AGN,"IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group dropped 8% over the past three weeks, but RBC analyst Michael Yee expects stocks to rally, despite lackluster Q3 earnings, after the election season wraps.The sector still has nearly four weeks of ""choppiness"" before the Nov. 8 election, and recent blowouts have had some investors taking profits. But Yee suggested in a recent video to buy on the dip, as biotechs climb the ""wall of worry.""""Because of Q3 earnings not being hugely great for biotechs, and a combination of uncertainty in the election, I understand we could trade choppy in the (SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI)) until we get some clarity on the election,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs were the worst-performing group Wednesday, and IBD tracks 197 groups. But last month, biotechs were on a major roll. Keep tabs on the Industry Theme for which sectors should grab your attention.Like, the 421-company group, shares of the SPDR Biotech ETF have plunged dramatically this month, down 10% over the past three weeks. On Thursday, shares were flat at 61.32, 6% from an entry point at 65.05 out of a flat base.Of the biggest biotech players, Yee is most confident on Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), respectively, Nos. 1 and 4 in market cap. In the stock market today, Amgen and Biogen both rose a fraction, to 164.29 and 294.41, respectively.The consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Amgen to report $5.73 billion in sales and $2.80 earnings per share ex items, flat and up 3%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Analysts model Biogen reporting $2.9 billion in sales, up 5%, and $4.97 EPS ex items, up 11%.Biogen is a stock to own over the next three to six months, Yee says. There's a 30% chance Biogen will get taken over, as it still lacks a CEO after the company announced in July, amid M&A rumors, that George Scangos would step down. Yee also sees a 30%-40% chance Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug trial could yield positive results, which could tug rival Biogen up 20%.Other catalysts include Biogen's partnership with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) for drugs to treat type 1 muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Ionis is enrolling infants and children in Phase 3 trials for SMA. Wall Street underappreciates those catalysts, Yee says.Celgene (CELG), too, has a number of trials that could stoke the stock, Yee says. For Q3, analysts model a 22% jump in sales to $2.84 billion and $1.48 EPS ex items, up 20%. Celgene share are down 8.5% since Sept. 23, rising a small fraction Thursday, to 100.63.Yee only expects an in-line quarter. Early next year, Celgene is expected to release the results of trials for drugs to treat muscular dystrophy, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis — which are likely stock catalysts.Gilead (GILD), the No. 2 biotech by market cap, is in for a rough quarter on shadowy visibility for its hepatitis C drug, Yee says. The drug, Epclusa, won FDA approval in June and can be used in pill form to treat six types of hep C. But lacking greater visibility, Gilead stock is range-bound, Yee says.Consensus expectations are too high for hep C sales and EPS in 2016, he wrote in a research report. For 2016, the consensus of 26 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $11.79 EPS ex items. Yee's estimate is $10.Broadly, analysts are bearish on Gilead's Q3, forecasting a 9% sales dip to $7.53 billion and EPS minus items down 10%, to $2.89. Shares are down 10% over the past three weeks, ending Thursday near flat, at 73.06.Smaller Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) (with a $3.55 billion market cap) will likely print an across-the-board beat for Q3, Yee predicts. But shares have been pressured recently by Gilead, Novartis (NVS) and Allergan (AGN) which are jumping on the NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) train.NASH drugs have made big headlines over the past month with Allergan buying Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) to bulk-up in the NASH battle. But, says Yee, Intercept's drug, which belongs to a class called FXR agonists, is more potent.""Intercept's drug gets into the liver an activates FXR (farnesoid X receptors) in the liver,"" he said. ""The others don't get as much FXR effectivity in the liver; they just do it in the gut. It's not as potent as Intercept.""Yee also calls Prothena (PRTA) one to own on likely positive Parkinson's drug and psoriasis drug data in Q4 and the spring, respectively. Prothena stock was in a sell zone Thursday, 16% below a 65.05 entry point achieved Sept. 19, after rising nearly 1% Thursday to 54.85.RELATED:What Will Gilead Try Buying Next?

The Tobira deal gives Allergan a leg up in the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where Gilead (GILD) and Intercept (ICPT) Pharmaceuticals also compete.IBD's 420-company biotech industry group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 173 just 13 weeks ago. Collectively, the group has a $771 billion market cap, No. 11 among all groups. The group fell 0.7% Friday, its first decline in the past eight trading days. The group was up 3.8% for the week.Needham analysts reviewed R&D pipelines, business development areas of interest and M&A activity for 26 large companies to gauge how interested Big Pharma is in biotechs -- ""an important theme in the biotech space,"" they wrote in a research report.Since 2012, Allergan, Amgen, Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Shire (SHPG) and Valeant (VRX) have been most acquisitive, buying (or prepping to buy) more than 100 companies, collectively. Shire has been most active, with 14 acquisitions.""We believe late-development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets,"" they wrote in a research report titled, ""What does Big Pharma want to buy?"" Peak areas of interest include oncology and cardiovascular, Needham research showed.But that may not be where Big Pharma takes its beaucoup bucks for M&A. Needham analysts suggested central nervous system (CNS) players Adamas and Acadia Pharmaceuticals, and liver disorder drugmaker Intercept could be of prime acquisition interest.Eight firms overlap in potential interest for Adamas and Acadia: AbbVie (ABBV), Allergan, Eli Lilly (LLY), Lundbeck, Merck, Novartis Pharmaceuticals (NVS), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Takeda Pharmaceutical.Needham lists 13 potential acquirers for Adamas, but Allergan makes particular sense considering the duo already partner on the next-generation formulation of memantine and the fixed-dose combination product Namzaric, both of which battle Alzheimer's.By year's end, Adamas plans to file a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ADS-5102, a treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia -- involuntary movements -- in Parkinson's disease patients and multiple sclerosis walking impairments, Needham wrote.Meanwhile, Acadia's 11 potential suitors could be interested in Nuplazid, a drug to ease psychosis associated with Parkinson's launched earlier this year. Needham suggests Acadia could be looking to expand the label for other uses.Similarly, Intercept could draw interest from nearly a dozen potential buyers including Gilead, No. 2 biotech by market cap. On Thursday, an RBC analyst posited Intercept would continue to lead Gilead and Allergan in the battle against NASH.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks notched higher this week, up about 4% since last week.

811,AGN,"Medical behemoth Gilead (GILD) is trailing Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) in the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) liver disease, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Thursday, two days after Botox maker Allergan (AGN) jumped in with its $1.7 billion agreement to acquire Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA).Larger Gilead and Allergan — with $107.2 billion and $94.4 billion market caps — are later to the NASH race than Intercept ($4.1 billion market cap). Intercept began enrolling its Phase 3 trials in September 2015 and expects to complete enrollment early next year.IBD'S TAKE: Would you shove a stick in your eye to avoid daily eye drops to treat glaucoma? Glaukos can help. Check out IBD's New America.Intercept, and a handful of rivals, are attempting to treat NASH by targeting FXRs (farnesoid X receptors), a class of proteins found in the liver and intestines. FXRs can be stoked to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, bile-acid homeostasis and fibrosis — all tied to NASH.But newer players are looking at using non-bile acid FXRs, a departure from Intercept's chemistry. Still, Intercept's Phase 2 FLINT trial is the ""most mature data set in the space to show significance on both fibrosis and liver histology based on pre-specified parameters,"" Young wrote in a research report.Long-term, Young sees room in the NASH space for many players, but Intercept will be more successful than Gilead with a 75% success rate vs. 50%, respectively, she predicted. Intercept will also have to contend with Novartis (NVS), Encanta and now Allergan.Allergan entered the race on Tuesday with its plan to acquire Tobira to get a leg-up on NASH treatment. Yet, Tobira's CVC (cenicriviroc) missed its goal of improving nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLAD) activity score. The activity score is a severity measurement for patients who likely have NASH.Tobira'a CVC successfully reduced fibrosis without worsening NASH in 20% of patients vs. 10% treated with a placebo. Comparatively, Intercept's Phase 2 trial for OCAs (obeticholic acid) improved fibrosis in 35% of patients vs. 19% who received the placebo.Now, Allergan expects to combine Tobira's CVC, a diabetes treatment and a preclinical non-bile acid FXR from Akarna. Encanta has both bile and non-bile FXRs likely slated for human trials soon. Combining treatments will be key, Young predicted.""We think a combination of regimens will be an important part of the treatment paradigm and we think Intercept is positioned well here long term,"" Young wrote. She has an outperform rating and a 200 price target on Intercept stock.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Intercept stock rose 1% to 170.40, but are up nearly 15% so far this month. Shares are in a buy zone for the third consecutive day after pivoting from a 169.17 buy point out of a double bottom base on Sept. 20.Gilead Sciences shares fell 0.2% to 81.52. Allergan climbed 2.1% to 243.43.

812,AGN,"It's been called a ""silent epidemic"" that's slowly wasting away the livers of millions of Americans while doctors have a paltry understanding of the disease and no approved treatments.But now, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is in the sights of more than a dozen drugmakers. Allergan (AGN) became the latest Tuesday, announcing two deals to acquire NASH treatments in less than 12 hours. It's racing companies from startup Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) to giants including Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Pfizer (PFE) to reach an untapped market that could be worth $5 billion to $10 billion a year, according to a May estimate by RBC Capital Markets Corp. analyst Michael Yee.Drugmakers still are trying to determine how different components of the disease -- inflammation, scarring and metabolic changes -- interact and are experimenting with a variety of treatment mechanisms. With so many companies piling into the field, they'll have to work to distinguish themselves.""We're looking for something that's got a 'wow' factor,"" said Alex DePaoli, chief medical officer of closely held NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., which has a NASH partnership with Merck & Co (MRK). ""We want to develop something that pops your eyes out.""NASH occurs when fat accumulates in the liver along with inflammation and damage, and as much as a quarter of the U.S. population may have a precursor condition, called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The ailment develops slowly, and patients often don't show symptoms until their livers are heavily damaged. It's most common in people who are overweight or have diabetes, and doctors mainly prescribe diet changes and weight loss.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Biomed/Biotech sector is running hot, ranked eighth among IBD's 197 industry groups. The sector is led by Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), and more can be found about it here.While doctors need to perform a biopsy to diagnose NASH, about 6 million to 15 million people in the U.S. alone are estimated to have the condition, and about 20% of them will go on to develop life-threatening cirrhosis. NASH will be the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020, according to Allergan. Drugs that treat it likely will command high prices, Elizabeth Krutoholow, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said.At the head of the race are Intercept and French biotech firm Genfit, with large trials underway. Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA), which Allergan agreed to buy Tuesday for as much as $1.7 billion, is preparing to recruit patients for a final-stage study. Investors also are watching for results from two of Gilead's mid-stage trials that are expected to be presented this year. On the acquisition news, Tobira shares soared by more than 721% Tuesday. Shares were up another 0.5% in afternoon trades Wednesday.Intercept is testing Ocaliva, already approved to treat a rare liver disease called primary biliary cirrhosis, against NASH. Enrollment of a final-stage trial of 2,000 people is expected to be completed next year, with interim results due in 2019.A potential concern is that in an earlier trial some patients experienced itching when taking the drug, in some cases so severe that it interfered with basic activities. Chief Executive Mark Pruzanski said in an interview that he hopes Ocaliva will become a backbone treatment, used in combination with other drugs.Genfit is developing elafibranor, a once-a-day-treatment that raises fat metabolism and fights inflammation, to ""treat the underlying cause of fibrosis,"" Dean Hum, Genfit's chief scientific officer, said in an interview.While elafibranor failed to meet a primary goal in a mid-stage trial last year, it showed promise in a subset of patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease. A final-stage trial in 2,000 moderate and severe patients is underway, and the company may have data by late 2018.Beyond the startup biotechs, some of the biggest companies are paying attention and ready to do deals. Merck said it will pay as much as $450 million for its partnership with NGM. Gilead, maker of the blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni,  bought a NASH drug from Nimbus Therapeutics LLC for $1.2 billion, including milestone payments. Before that, Gilead also bought a drug from Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG for as much as $470 million.Gilead now has four NASH candidates in its portfolio and will have data from two later this year. The drugs target different aspects of the disease and will be developed individually, but may be used in potent cocktails. Allergan's Tobira is the biggest NASH deal so far, and on Tuesday the company also announced a $50 million purchase of Akarna Therapeutics Ltd., another developer of NASH treatments.Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, may be a future acquirer. It has a NASH drug in trials and two more to be tested in humans by the end of the year. NASH is ""a major priority,"" said Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The company is trying to treat the disease in its early stages.It won't be easy. Along with Genfit, Tobira's mid-stage trial failed, and Raptor Pharmaceutical (RPTP) ended its program.""Data is starting to come out of studies, and a lot of confidence will be built and lost,"" said Jay Luly, chief executive of Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which will begin testing an experimental treatment in patients this year. ""The same, I expect, will happen with money.""

813,AGN,"Drugmaker Allergan (AGN) got an upgrade from Mizuho on Friday, based on expectations of solid product sales despite lowered guidance.Analyst Irina Koffler wrote that consensus estimates now reflect Allergan's guidance cut in its Q2 earnings report this month, giving the stock potential for upside. She added that a breakout of individual products sales, including Botox and the new double-chin treatment Kybella, show that management's 2017 guidance for 10% organic sales growth is feasible.""A strong fall push in Kybella DTC (direct-to-consumer) promotion should also drive increased utilization of Botox and (dermal) fillers, in our view,"" she wrote in her upgrade note. The key, she said, is execution.""This is the hard part,"" she wrote. ""Management will need to contain costs, while launching new products and advancing the pipeline.""Koffler upgraded her rating to buy from neutral and her price target to 305 from 246.Allergan stock edged up 0.1% to close at 253.14 on the stock market today. Allergan stock remains above its 50-day line, but it carries a weak Relative Price Strength Rating of just 19, putting its performance within the lower fifth of all stocks over the past 12 months.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts' trim to their Allergan forecasts after its guidance cut is reflected in IBD's Estimate Revisions metric, now showing as a warning red in Stock Checkup.Editor's Note: Story notes new price target of 305 from analyst Koffler, who issued a correction to her earlier research note.

European bank woes briefly rattled financials and markets, while the number of possible Twitter (TWTR) buyers expanded. Nike (NKE) beat earnings views but gave weak guidance on orders.The major averages rose modestly for the week due to Friday's solid gains as Deutsche Bank (DB) concerns eased. The S&P 500 closed just below its 50-day moving average after trading above that key level for most of Friday. Oil prices surged on OPEC's deal to cut output, giving a big boost to shale producers and other energy stocks. Biotech, fiber optic and several retail groups fell. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% in September but rose 3.3% for the third quarter. The Nasdaq advanced 1.9% in September and 9.7% for Q3.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it would cap output at 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, essentially giving up a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale production. But the cartel won't enact those cuts until November when full details -- and individual production quotas -- are likely to be firmed up at an official OPEC meeting. In August OPEC's production was 33.2 million barrels a day. The Energy Information Administration said U.S. inventories fell by 1.88 million barrels vs. the 2.8 million-barrel increase analysts expected, falling for a fourth straight week.

815,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) acquired a gene therapy for eye disease Tuesday, while its CEO separately criticized ""predatory"" drug pricing and pledged to limit his company's price increases.Allergan agreed to pay $60 million upfront to acquire RetroSense Therapeutics, along with unspecified future milestone payments tied to the success of RST-001, a gene therapy for the eye disease retinitis pigmentosa. While Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) has a gene therapy for the same disease in late-stage development, the two platforms take different approaches, noted Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat.""Spark's gene therapy is only aimed at one specific defect. … However, Retinitis Pigmentosa may be caused by a very heterogeneous set of mutations (encompassing 60+ genes),"" Raffat wrote in an email to clients. ""In simple words, Allergan's approach can (in theory) address this heterogeneous disease irrespective of the mutations causing it.""IBD'S TAKE: Spark Therapeutics stock has been hovering near a buy point since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base early last month. To learn more about bases, see IBD's How To Buy Stocks.Allergan stock rose 1.3% to 239.12 on the stock market today, but it's still down more than 20% for the year.

Among other things, he made a specific promise regarding Allergan's price increases:""Where we increase price on our branded therapeutic medicines, we will take price increases no more than once per year and, when we do, they will be limited to single-digit percentage increases.  Our expectation is that the overall cost of our drugs, net of rebates and discounts, will not increase by more than low-to-mid single digits percentages per year, slightly above the current annual rate of inflation.""Saunders also said Allergan would stop increasing prices if there was no corresponding increase in cost, a practice often taken as a drug nears its patent expiration and a practice that Allergan has taken in the past, he admitted.RELATED:Allergan Carves Middle Path in R&D Spending With 'Open Science'Is EpiPen's Price The FDA's Fault?

818,AGN,"Recent Wall Street darling Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) isn't the only potential takeover candidate among hot, or potentially hot, biotech companies, says RBC Capital Markets.In a research report Wednesday, RBC analysts list Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Spark Therapeutics (ONCE), BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI), Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI), Tesaro (TSRO), Incyte (INCY) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) -- as well as Sarepta — as top takeover contenders, all on their late-stage or FDA-approved ""blockbuster franchises.""Sarepta stock rocketed 74% on Monday after the FDA approved its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the first drug approved to treat the rare disease. Sarepta stock hit another all-time high Wednesday, above 58 for the first time since March 2002. Sarepta closed up 0.9% to 56.22 in the stock market today.After the close, Sarepta announced plans to offer up to $225 million in stock to finance further trials, production and other drug efforts. But shares were little changed late.IBD's 214-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group rose 0.5% Wednesday, its sixth straight gain and touching an eight-month high intraday. The group ranks No. 8 of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 175 just 13 weeks ago.The second half of 2016 is likely to prove a rallying point for biotech stocks, RBC analysts said.""Biotech sentiment should continue to improve and investors should 'climb the wall of worry' as we get through the year and past the election, which we believe has been mostly based on political rhetoric,"" the analysts wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Many biotechs, and a fair number of stocks overall, have recently hit 52-week highs, and you can check out these stocks — listed by Composite Rating — at IBD's New Highs listing. This is a good feature to check for winning stocks.M&A furor has been heating up in the biotech sector. Over the past 10 months, four biotech acquisitions valued at over $5 billion have been announced, RBC said, along with a smattering of smaller deals. On Tuesday, Allergan (AGN) announced an agreement to acquire liver-disease drugmaker Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for as much as $1.7 billion.Among the big deals pending, Pfizer (PFE) is buying Medivation (MDVN) for $14 billion and in June bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion.

819,AGN,"IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group rose Tuesday to an eight-month high for the third straight trading day, outperforming a wishy-washy overall market that awaits Fed announcements Wednesday at the end of its two-day meeting.The 419-company group — IBD's second-biggest behind Finance-ETF — was up 2.7% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, touching its highest price since Jan. 11. The group ranks No. 14 out of 197, up from No. 31 four weeks ago, No. 36 eight weeks ago and No. 175 13 weeks ago.IBD'S TAKE: When looking for in-depth reporting on the top-performing industry groups, the IBD Industry Snapshot should be your first port of call. Fiber-optics and mining are among industries recently profiled.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) continued to help spark the group, rising for a second day after the FDA's approval early Monday of its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) sent its shares soaring 74%. Sarepta stock ended trading Tuesday up nearly 14% to 55.73. But PTC Therapeutics (PTCT), also working on DMD treatments, fell 7.1% to close at 10.21, after jumping 21% to an eight-month high on Monday.Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH) jumped to a record high of 21.26, a gain of nearly 12% on news it would join the S&P SmallCap 600 index.

820,AGN,"A number of biotech stocks rose Wednesday. Biotech is one of the few groups holding up well during a time when the market uptrend is under pressure.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) stock jumped 27% Wednesday, to an eight-month high of 32.45. It is recovering from a huge 75% decline early this year. Last week, a Food and Drug Administration staff member who had argued against approval for a key Sarepta drug left the FDA for a job in the private sector, raising hopes for the drug's approval, multiple media sources reported Wednesday. The Sarepta drug is eteplirsen, to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The FDA continues to review the drug.The exit of the FDA staff member, Dr. Ron Farkas, is a plus for the Sarepta drug, but not the biggest plus, Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a research note Wednesday, in which he hiked his price target on Sarepta stock to 47 from 26.  Farkas ""was not the only skeptic and frankly we do not believe he personally held enough power to be a deciding factor,"" Messer wrote.Instead, Messer said the company likely will provide the desired trial results to support approval of the drug.Sarepta had plenty of company on the upswing Wednesday. Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals (RARE) got a bullish report from Credit Suisse on Wednesday, ahead of Friday's start of the annual meeting for the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. Credit Suisse expects Ultragenyx to report solid trial results for its drug to treat XLH, a bone disease with symptoms that include leg bowing in childhood and dental abscesses. Long-term medical therapy is the usual diagnosis for the disease.Ultragenyx stock rose 3.2% in the stock market today, to 72.13 and touching a three-month high. It remains in a deep price consolidation.IBD's 419-company biotech industry group rose 2% Wednesday. The group has been on the move, now ranking No. 15 out of 197 groups, up from No. 36 four weeks ago, No. 89 eight weeks ago and No. 171 13 weeks ago.IBD'S TAKE: If a group is rising, it will almost surely soon be featured in IBD's weekly Industry Snapshot, if not already there. It's a good idea to regularly check out this feature for a deep dive into some of the best-performing industry groups.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) rose 1.2%, after Monday's gain of 3%, its biggest one-day jump since June. The ETF is forming a base with a 299.58 buy point.Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) rose 3.5% and extended from a July 28 breakout, Seattle Genetics (SGEN) jumped 4.6% and also extended from a July breakout, and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) soared 7.9% to an eight-month high as it tries to recover from  a severe decline. A rise of 5.7% sent Exelixis (EXEL) soaring to a 14-year high. It too is extended.In a research note Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets pointed to a related group, saying that ""select pharma names are beginning to show signs of stabilizing/bottoming: MNK, AGN.""Allergan (AGN) stock rose 2% Wednesday, while Mallinckrodt (MNK) rose 1%.RELATED:Top New Issue Patheon Helps Turn New Ideas Into RealityCelgene, Kite and Vertex Are 3 Biotechs To Watch In September

821,AGN,"Drug industry mergers and acquisitions continued Wednesday as two pharma companies sold off non-core assets.British giant AstraZeneca (AZN) agreed to sell its small-molecule (i.e. non-biotech) antibiotics to Pfizer (PFE) for an upfront payment of $550 million plus another $175 million in January 2019, along with up to $250 million in milestone payments depending on whether the drugs still in the pipeline make it to market.The portfolio includes the already-commercialized drugs Merrem, Zinforo and Zavicefta, which treat a range of serious infections, as well as two late-stage pipeline candidates for drug-resistant infections. Allergan (AGN) holds the North American rights to Zavicefta and Zinforo and will continue to do so, with Pfizer acquiring the international rights.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer's size and patent losses have kept it from being a big growth stock lately, but it's a leading dividend stock, as outlined recently in IBD's column The Income Investor.The move fits AstraZeneca's strategy of focusing on its three chosen areas of oncology, respiratory/autoimmunity, and cardiovascular/metabolic diseases. For Pfizer, it adds to its existing portfolio of more than 60 anti-infectives.""As we continue to reshape our Essential Health portfolio, we are focusing on areas that further address global public health needs and that complement our core capabilities and experience in therapeutic areas,"" John Young, head of Pfizer Essential Health, said in a statement.The deal is expected to close in Q4.Pfizer stock closed 0.8% lower at 34.82 on the stock market today. AstraZeneca stock fell 1% to 33.50.Meanwhile, specialty drugmaker Mallinckrodt (MNK) said it's selling its diagnostic nuclear-imaging business to Belgium-based IBA Molecular for $690 million.The fact that Mallinckrodt has two not-especially-related businesses -- specialty drugs and imaging -- comes from its peculiar history. It was a more diversified company when Tyco International (TYC) bought it in 2000, but after Tyco spun off its medical business as Covidien (now part of Medtronic (MDT)) in 2007, and then Covidien spun off Mallinckrodt in 2013, the other divisions were stripped off. Since the spinoff, the drug business has been growing much faster than the imaging business, so a sale has been widely expected.The deal has to clear some unusual regulatory hurdles, including approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, so the companies say it will close in the first half of 2017.Mallinckrodt stock dropped 4.7% to 79.14 after setting an 11-month high intraday.RELATED:Pfizer-Medivation Deal Reignites Biotech Buyout Speculation3 More Drugmakers Beat Q2 Estimates, But Guidance Mixed

823,AGN,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) were rising Monday as the company continued to fill out its new management lineup by appointing a new chief financial officer.Valeant nabbed Paul Herendeen from animal-health company Zoetis (ZTS), where he has been executive vice president for the last two years. He also was CFO for a number of years at Warner Chilcott before its 2013 buyout by the company that eventually became Allergan (AGN). Valeant's current CFO, Robert Rosiello, will become head of corporate development and strategy.The role of CFO is crucial because of Valeant's recent accounting scandal, which resulted in the company restating the last couple years of earnings. Rosiello wasn't implicated because the trouble really happened before his June 2015 appointment, under the previous CFO Howard Schiller, who took most of the heat when Valeant's auditing committee produced its report in March. At the same time, CEO J. Michael Pearson quit.IBD'S TAKE: Valeant became the poster child for a drugmaker relying on price increases to goose revenue. Learn how much other big-cap drugmakers are relying on price vs. demand.RBC Capital Markets analyst Douglas Miehm wrote that the change is probably due to matching the talent with the job.""We view the new role for Mr. Rosiello favorably, as he worked for McKinsey for over 30 years and has advised companies in the health care, consumer-product and technology sectors on M&A ventures and operational strategic initiatives,"" Miehm wrote in a research note.Valeant stock rose 8.8% to 31.27 in the stock market today, above 31 for just the second day in the past three months-plus.The rise might also have been fueled by a wider bounce in drug stocks viewed as buyout targets in light of Pfizer's (PFE) $14 billion buyout of Medivation (MDVN). In Valeant's Q2 earnings call, CEO Joseph Papa said he was prepared to sell off about $8 billion worth of assets, and some on Wall Street have wondered if a buyer might acquire the entire company now that it's down 87% from its 52-week high.RELATED:

824,AGN,"Wal-Mart (WMT) and Applied Materials (AMAT) scored price target increases Friday after strong earnings Thursday, and Allergan (AGN) was upgraded to buy.Wal-Mart's  price target was raised to 78 from 71 at Telsey Advisory, and to 76 from 73 at RBC Capital Markets.On Thursday, the discount giant reported  Q2 earnings and sales above views, with strong sales in home, toys and sporting goods. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart agreed to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion as it tries to compete in online sales with Amazon.com (AMZN).Wal-Mart shares finished 2% lower at 72.81 on the stock market today. Wal-Mart hit a 14-month high on Thursday.Applied Materials price target was raised to 30 from 28 at RBC Capital, and to 32.5 from 26 at Cowen.Late Thursday, the chip-gear maker reported record earnings and issued guidance that beat views.Shares jumped 7.1% to close at 29.64.Allergan was upgraded to buy and had its price target raised to 318 from 248 by Mizuho, which cited an improved outlook and less risk.Allergan shares edged up 0.1% to 253.14.L Brands (LB) was upgraded to sector perform from underperform at RBC Capital and has its price target raised to 90 from 88 at Telsey Advisory, and to 75 from 68 at FBR Capital.The operator of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works stores topped quarterly estimates on Wednesday.L Brands shares dipped 0.1% to 77.76.IBD'S TAKE:  L Brands is one of the weaker apparel retailers. But several names have broken out after earnings, including Ross Stores and Lululemon Athletica. Compare L Brands to others in the retail group on Stock Checkup. Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) was downgraded to underperform by Longbow Research.Shares fell 2.9% to 163.02.RELATED:

825,AGN,"Allergan (AGN) shares fell Monday after the specialty drugmaker reported a mixed quarter and guidance.Allergan's results were complicated by its recent M&A activity. Last week, it announced that it's selling its generic-drug distribution business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), and thus excluded that segment as a discontinued operation in its Q2 report, which analysts' consensus had not yet adjusted for. An Allergan spokesman told IBD that this would shave $375 million off sales and 5 cents off EPS.With that adjustment, both the top and bottom lines came in slightly ahead of expectations, representing 7% and 12% operating growth over the year-earlier quarter, respectively. However, Allergan also slightly lowered its full-year guidance for sales of branded drugs -- previously it had said about $15 billion, but Monday it set of range of $14.75 billion to $15 billion. It also gave full-year EPS guidance for the first time, with a midpoint on the low side of Wall Street's number.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan's busy M&A history has not only complicated its financials, but has also driven many of its stock moves, such as its 14% drop in April when Pfizer ended its buyout deal with the company. IBD prefers to judge stocks by their fundamentals, as described in the CAN SLIM Investing System.Foreign-exchange headwinds drove some of Allergan's revenue guidance decrease, but Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry wrote that fundamentals were looking good.""The two biggest drivers of the top-line outperformance were Restasis (dry eye) and some legacy women's health products (Estrace Cream & Loestrin),"" Gerberry wrote in a research note. ""Overall quality of the Q2 results was strong, with Botox and dermal fillers both achieving mid-teens year-over-year growth. ... Allergan exits the quarter with a strong balance sheet, and recent divestitures of generic and distribution business (have) brought increased focus to the business.""Allergan stock closed down 2.3% to 248.03 on the stock market today.
"
826,AGN,"As usual, the specialty and generic drugmakers come to the fore as the earnings season nears its end, with several interesting stocks on deck.Allergan (AGN), reporting early Monday, has somewhat complicated financials since it just sold its huge generics business to Teva (TEVA) and had been counting that as a discontinued operation during the deal's lengthy approval process.Excluding that, the consensus sales estimate of $4.1 billion is flat vs. the year-earlier quarter, and the EPS estimate of $3.34 a share is up modestly, according to Leerink.IBD'S TAKE: Any outfit looking to acquire Biogen would have to pay a pretty price. Biogen itself, boosted by buyout rumors, is in the latest IBD Big Cap 20, a screen of companies that can deliver big gains but that have less volatility that smaller stocks.The Teva deal, which closed Aug. 2, leaves Allergan with a fat wad of cash to fuel buyout speculation. Already an anonymously sourced report had the company exploring an acquisition of Biogen (BIIB).Allergan stock traded mostly flat this week, closing Friday up a fraction at 253.85.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is looking at a shrinking quarter when it reports early Tuesday, continuing its recent woes from pricing pressure. Profit is seen falling 42% to $1.48 a share, with sales dropping 9.8% to $2.46 billion.The company accepted broad price cuts in its partnership this year with Walgreens (WBA), though the stock rose on July 6 when Walgreens made positive comments about the deal in its own earnings report.Valeant is starting to launch an oral version of constipation drug Relistor and is nearing the possible launch of psoriasis drug brodalumab, both of which have their skeptics on Wall Street.Valeant stock, down more than 90% from its 52-week high, closed the week a fraction lower at 21.96.Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), reporting after the close Tuesday, is still on the growth train, with sales expected to climb 12.8% to $376 million, with profit up 16% to $2.80 a share.Jazz's stock is still elevated after it rose nearly 8% on July 28, when the patent board rejected a competitor's request to review a patent on Jazz's lead drug Xyrem, which has been subject to increasing patent challenges as it ages.Overall shares are down about 20% from their high, however, ending the week down a fraction at 150.66.Also late Tuesday, generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) is expected to record 8% sales growth to $2.57 billion, with profit gaining 24% to $1.13 a share.The company launched 12 new generic drugs in Q2 alone, but pricing pressure on the space has been an issue over the last few quarters.Mylan closed its $7.2 billion buyout of Swedish rival Meda on Friday. The deal was not hugely popular with investors when it was announced in February, which -- combined with an earnings miss -- drove the stock down 18%, but it's recovered somewhat since then.On Friday, Mylan stock closed up 1.7% for the week, at 48.46.

827,AGN,"Yahoo (YHOO) and Nike (NKE) were the largest stock purchases made by hedge fund managers in the second quarter, while Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX) were the top sales, says an analysis by FactSet Research.The top 50 hedge funds sold $2 billion worth of Netflix stock in Q2, more than any other company, says FactSet. The selling was led by Viking Global Investors, which reduced its stake by 22%, and Tiger Global, which exited its 4.2% stake worth $1.6 billion.

The buying was led by TCI Fund Management, which increased its ownership stake to 7.5% from 1.5% a quarter ago. The Yahoo purchases were made as rumors circulated of several companies being interested in acquiring the core operating business of Yahoo. A month ago, Verizon Communications (VZ) confirmed it would acquire Yahoo for $4.83 billion.Yahoo stock rose 2% in Q2 and is up 13% this quarter. Besides its core internet business, Yahoo owns big stakes in China's Alibaba Group (BABA) and in Yahoo Japan, which is traded on the Tokyo exchange.

829,AGN,"Pfizer (PFE) announced a deal Monday morning to buy Medivation (MDVN) for $81.50 a share, or an enterprise value of about $14 billion.The move follows months of takeover speculation for the cancer drugmaker, as well as widespread reports Sunday of an imminent Pfizer-Medivation deal.Medivation rose nearly 20% to 80.43 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today. Pfizer fell 2 cents to 34.96.""The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer,"" Pfizer CEO and Chairman Ian Read said in a statement.Pfizer said the deal will boost earnings per share by five cents in the first year after closing, with additional gains after that.Medivation closed Friday at 67.16 with a market valuation of $11.1 billion. That was slightly extended from a 63.04 buy point from a flat base.Medivation traded as low as 26.41 on Feb. 9. But it's been the subject of widespread buzz over possible buyouts. The biotech earlier this year rejected a $58 a share offer from France's Sanofi (SNY).Last week, a report had Pfizer, Merck (MRK), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Sanofi as possible Medivation buyers.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs can deliver great growth. But are they generating profit and revenue gains via higher sales volumes or price increases? Here's how to hunt for biotech stocks.Medivation makes Xtandi, a prostate cancer drug with an annual sales rate already above $2 billion. It has other cancer fighters in development.Pfizer's $150 billion attempt to buy Allergan (AGN) fell apart earlier this year after the Obama administration changed rules to make tax inversion merger deals less attractive.RELATED:Medivation Affirms Guidance As Earnings Growth FlattensBiotechs Make Case For Leadership, But Is It A Convincing One?

830,AGN,"Shares of Biogen (BIIB) shot up Tuesday on a report that some big drugmakers are exploring the possibility of buying the company.The Wall Street Journal said in an anonymously sourced report that Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) had both talked to Biogen about the possibility, though the talks were ""informal and preliminary."" Biogen stock, which had been down slightly for the day, then jumped and closed up 9.4% to 330.11 in the stock market today, hitting a one-year high.Wall Street has been tossing around the possibility of a Biogen takeout for some time, but rumors started to heat up after CEO George Scangos announced his retirement last week. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee noted in a video last weekend that this leaves Biogen ""vulnerable"" to a takeover, especially since investors have gotten restless with the slowdown in the company's multiple-sclerosis franchise and risky pipeline.Among the most talked-about pipeline drugs is aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease, which might explain some of Merck's interest. Merck is working on a different class of Alzheimer's treatments called BACE inhibitors, but it could be thinking like Eli Lilly (LLY) that the disease will ultimately be treated with a combination of drugs. Allergan inherited a drug treating Alzheimer's symptoms with its acquisition of Forest Laboratories a few years ago, so it could presumably leverage its sales force.No other companies were named, but Yee opined that Roche (RHHBY) would also be a logical buyer, given that it already has a partnership with Biogen selling lymphoma drug Gazyva.Merck fell 0.6% Tuesday while Allergan lost 1.6%. Roche climbed 0.2%.

All three major indexes rose fractionally for the week -- the Nasdaq and Dow closed up 0.2% while the S&P 500 climbed 1 point. More quality breakouts appeared. Retailers, energy plays and some hot growth stocks led the market amid earnings reports and higher oil prices. But solar stocks tumbled on weak SunPower (SPWR) guidance. REITs struggled as investors sought growth names -- and worried about store closures.Alibaba reported revenue of $4.84 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $4.53 billion. Revenue rose 59% in local-currency terms, the best gain since Alibaba's September 2014 IPO. EPS rose 33% to 74 cents, beating the consensus of 63 cents.JD.com reported revenue of $9.8 billion, slightly above the consensus and up 42% in local currency. It reported earnings per share of 4 cents, double the 2 cent consensus, but its Q3 revenue estimate fell short of projections. Both companies showed strong growth in mobile users.Alibaba stock soared 16% for the week, breaking out of a base to their highest level since January 2015. JD.com leapt nearly 13%.Next week, messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), perhaps Alibaba's biggest Chinese rival, reports earnings. So do mobile gaming portal NetEase (NTES) and flash e-commerce seller Vipshop (VIPS).IBD'S TAKE: With the market at record highs, many growth names large and small are breaking out. To get an in-depth look at Alibaba, Acacia and other top-rated stocks -- and how they fare vs. rivals -- go to IBD Stock Checkup to develop your watch list.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih hinted at a production freeze, which could come at a meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum next month. But Russia's energy minister said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks. The International Energy Agency said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. OPEC said Saudi Arabia pumped a record amount of crude oil in July, and the cartel left its 2017 demand outlook unchanged at 95.41 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million for the week ended Aug 5. And U.S. production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels, a second straight week of declines.U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 15 to 396 in the week ended Aug. 12, Baker Hughes said. That's the seventh straight weekly gain and the highest level since late February.Still, U.S. crude oil prices closed the week at $44.49 a barrel, up 4.4%.Wal-Mart Stores, looking to keep pace with Amazon, agreed to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart has sizable online sales, but growth has been decelerating. Wal-Mart also will put Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, though Jet.com will remain separately. Lore previously founded Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, before Amazon bought it.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.2%, hitting a 14-month high during the week.Solar stocks after SunPower cut its 2016 guidance and inverter-supplier SolarEdge (SEDG) cited a slowdown at U.S. installers. For Q2, SunPower's Q2 revenue growth and adjusted loss topped estimates. But SunPower sees Q3 revenue of just $700 million to $800 million vs. the consensus for $1.13 billion, as demand for utility-scale solar projects tumbles. And SunPower also cut its 2016 view to $2.8 billion-$3 billion, missing analysts' view for $3.3 billion.SolarEdge's $124.8 million in fiscal Q4 sales missed analysts' expectations for $129.4 million, but 44 cents EPS minus items beat by a nickel. The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million-$139 million trailed the consensus at $137 million, and EPS missed by a penny.SolarCity (SCTY), which has agreed to a takeover deal by Tesla (TSLA), topped analysts' Q2 projections for adjusted loss and revenue. But its current-quarter view for $155 million-$168 million in revenue lagged the consensus for $174.6 million.SunPower stock crashed 28% to a 3-year low.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), involved in everything from gaming to autonomous driving and AI, rose 8.3% for the week to a fresh high after the Tesla partner reported $1.43 billion in sales and 40 cents earnings per share. That topped the consensus for $1.35 billion and 37 cents, and was up 24% and 700%, respectively, vs. last year. Nvidia sees current-quarter sales at $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts' model for $1.45 billion.With China, telecoms and data centers spending heavily for higher-speed connections, makers of fiber optic components are seeing huge demand.Hot IPO Acacia Communications said Q2 revenue rose 101% to $116 million, and adjusted earnings soared 305%. Lumentum (LITE) and Inphi (IPHI) also reported stronger-than-expected figures. NeoPhotonics (NPTN) sales growth fell short due to sluggish demand for older parts, but production of 100-gigabit gear is ramping up. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group hit a 15-year high Thursday and ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups.Acacia rose 41% Friday and nearly 50% for the week, blasting to new highs. Lumentum rose more than 4% and Inphi 16%, also to new highs. NeoPhotonics climbed 2.6% to 14.01, clearing a 13.85 buy point on Friday.Related:IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications is among several tech leaders that have risen 20% past a buy point, putting them in profit-taking zone. But when you should you sell these top stocks? IBD's latest Tech Leaders column explains when to hold onto winning stocks, and how those rules apply to Acacia, Weibo and others right now.Recent IPO Twilio (TWLO), a communications software firm, reported a narrower than-expected non-GAAP loss. Q2 revenue jumped 70% to $64.5 million, vs. Wall Street estimates of $58.2 million, although sales from its top customer, Facebook (FB)-owned WhatsApp, fell 8% year over year. Twilio's full-year guidance edged consensus estimates.Twilio shares surged 28% for the week, hitting a new high.Medpace Holdings (MEDP) soared 20% to 27.79 in Thursday's debut after pricing at 23, the high end of its expected IPO range. Shares edged up 0.9% to 28.04 on Friday. Medpace provides outsourced clinical development services for drug and medical device companies.Specialty drugmakers ended what had been a strong Q2 season for the drug industry on a more ambiguous note. Allergan (AGN), freshly divested of its generics business, beat expectations slightly but trimmed its sales guidance. Shares fell 1.7% for the week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) missed Q2 numbers but affirmed its guidance as it reorganized. It said its deal with Walgreens (WBA) was finally turning profitable and that it was willing to sell $8 billion worth of non-core assets. The stock soared 25% Tuesday, but pared weekly gains to 13.5% on a report that Valeant could face criminal charges of defrauding insurers.Medivation (MDVN) reported a ho-hum quarter, but profit will likely be flat until an expected market expansion for its drug Xtandi in Q4. Shares rose 4.4% to 66.02, a 14-month high and just barely in buy range from a 63.04 entry. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed EPS estimates and lowered guidance, partly due to a change in tax reporting and partly due to higher costs. Its stock dropped 9.3%. Mylan (MYL) beat its profit estimate slightly and affirmed its guidance, with its controversially high-priced EpiPen making up for light generic drug sales. Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4. That's still below the neutral 50 level.

834,AGN,"Drug giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) raised its Q2 guidance Tuesday, and said that Wednesday morning it would offer long-term guidance that includes its $40 billion buyout of Allergan's (AGN) generic-drug business.Teva added $100 million to its topline estimate, now $4.9 billion to $5 billion, roughly the same as the year-earlier quarter. Its EPS range is now $1.19 to $1.22 a share, up a few cents from previous guidance but down from $1.43 last year.Teva stock was up 1% in after-hours trading, after rising 3% in Tuesday's regular session, to close at 52.46, a one-month closing high.The company also said that it would give guidance for 2016 to 2019 that includes Actavis, Allergan's global generics business, in an 8 a.m. ET conference call.In its last earnings report, the company had promised to do so once the deal closed, which it expected to happen in June. But the process has dragged on as Teva has sold off various products to meet Federal Trade Commission requirements. Teva has apparently decided to give the guidance as the deal is ""awaiting FTC clearance,"" according to Teva's press release.Allergan stock rose a fraction in Tuesday's regular session, to 239.70, and was flat after hours.
"
835,AGN,"British drugmaker Shire (SHPG) was up early Tuesday after it won an unexpectedly early Food and Drug Administration approval late Monday for its dry-eye drug.The FDA approved lifitegrast, newly branded as Xiidra, for the ""signs and symptoms"" of dry-eye disease -- a broader label than it might have gotten, according to Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat.""Recall there was a big controversy in that only one phase 3 showed efficacy on sign endpoint,"" Raffat wrote in an email to clients. ""In our doc calls, docs seemed to really care about how the drug does on SIGN endpoint.""Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry wrote that this differentiates Xiidra from its chief competitor, Allergan's (AGN) Restasis. Another difference is that the package mentions that studies showed Xiidra bringing significant improvement as early as two weeks, whereas the typical onset for Restasis is six to eight weeks.Shire and Allergan, however, might not be in a zero-sum game.""Based on our ophthalmologist KOL (key opinion leader) checks, there are a significant number of eligible patients who have either failed to adhere to Restasis due to tolerability and/or slow onset, and there is pent-up demand for a new topical anti-inflammatory as the last drug approved in the space was 2003,"" Gerberry added in his research note. ""We expect the Xiidra approval to expand the dry-eye category from $1.4 billion current to $3 billion.""We currently forecast lifitegrast sales of $900 million and $1.3 billion by 2021 and 2026, respectively.""The FDA had until July 22 to decide whether to approve Xiidra, so the OK came earlier than expected. Shire says it won't launch the drug until the third quarter, however, and as of Wednesday morning it hadn't announced a price for it.Shire stock closed up 4.8% at 195.31 on the stock market today, but it's still down nearly 5% for the year. Shire carries a not-so-great IBD Composite Rating of 68, where 99 is highest. Allergan rose 0.6% Tuesday.

836,AGN,"The U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union -- Brexit -- was as dazzling as an opening ceremony of the Olympics. But instead of being uplifting, Brexit's fireworks came in the form of stock market devastation.Yet now, little more than a month later, many stocks are rising like the Games' fireworks over Rio de Janeiro.Take a look at the top-performing growth stock mutual funds since the June 27 post-Brexit low.The ranks of those Olympic class sprinters include $286.5 million Driehaus Micro Cap Growth (DMCRX), up 13.62% in that span. Others joining OTC on the medal stand and in the elite runners-up circle are $13.3 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX), up 13.55%; $6.8 billion Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX), up 13.12%; $105.7 million Tocqueville Opportunity (TOPPX), up 12.80%; and $220 million Harbor Small Cap Growth Opportunity (HASOX), up 12.41%.Click Here To See A List Of Top Holdings Of Top-Performing Growth FundsThe next five top performers, with gains ranging from 12.31% to 11.67% were $144.5 million Lord Abbot Micro Cap Growth (LMIYX), $161.7 million JPMorgan Dynamic Small Cap Growth (VSCOX), $6.6 billion Primecap Odyssey Growth (POGRX), $777.3 million Wells Fargo Emerging Growth (WFGDX)  and $1.09 billion JPMorgan Small Cap Growth (PGSGX).And what powered those gold-medal funds? Their top holdings included familiar names like Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB).Those names gained 10% -- in Amazon's case -- to 17% by Alphabet in the month-plus since the Brexit low.But a whole bunch of additional growth stocks that are also among the championship funds' top holdings did even better. Some are household names, some are less well-known.Leading the pack was Acacia Communications (ACIA), which soared 85% since the June 27 low. Acacia accounted for 2.26% of the Driehaus fund's assets as of its latest disclosure. The S&P 500 was up a fraction as much, just 6.45% since Brexit. Acacia has a 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) Rating.The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Composite Rating. You should look for stocks whose rating is 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.SMR Ratings of A and B are the best.Acacia is a cloud-infrastructure tech firm. It is the top-ranked stock within IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group. The group is ranked No. 9 now, up from No. 36 four weeks ago.The stock's share price has more than doubled since the stock went public in mid-May, leaving its share price extended. Its four most recent quarterly reports have shown earnings per share skyrocketing at triple-digit paces.Medivation's (MDVN) rebound since Brexit has been more modest. It was up 12%. That's still more than twice as good as the broad market itself.And it leaves the maker of cancer drugs still within a buying range. Trading around 63 on Friday morning, it was less than 2% past its 63.04 flat-base entry.It has a 99 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating. EPS growth is slowing down, having grown 867%, 250%, 164% and 38% the past four quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Medivation is a takeover target. IBD's Ken Shreve reports that Sanofi is a suitor. Medivation's blockbuster drug is prostate-cancer treatment Xtandi.

837,AGN,"Mobileye (MBLY) is up 16% since Brexit. The company is a leader in driver assistance systems such as automatic braking.It has a 96 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.Trading around 46, shares are within 4% of a 49.10 alternate handle entry.Shares gapped down on July 26 when the company said that it would continue its relationship with Tesla (TSLA), but would not supply additional technology or components. Investors have been assessing whether Tesla or any other firm can produce driverless technology that would threaten Mobileye's.IBD'S TAKE: Paul Gordon, lead manager of $2.1 billion MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund, told IBD this week that he is not worried about Tesla.""Tesla is one of many Mobileye customers,"" said Paul Gordon, lead manager of $2.1 billion MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX). ""They are not a significant percentage of sales currently."" Mobileye's July 26 pullback was due to investors' fears that Tesla had found another supplier to provide autonomous driving chips at a lower price. Gordon doubts that's the case. ""And it's more difficult to imagine that a Ford (F), GM (GM) or even BMW (BMWYY) can do what Mobileye can.""Paycom Software (PAYC) was another big gainer post-Brexit, up 29% since then.Paycom provides cloud-based human capital management software. It was a top holding of the Tocqueville fund. The stock has a 99 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.Trading around 51, shares are extended from their 42.70 entry. Paycom has a 99 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.One big winner since Brexit is Biogen (BIIB). It's a top holding of the 12th top-performing fund, Vanguard Capital Opportunity (VHCOX), which notched an 11.63% gain. It also is held by Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth.Biogen is up 41% since the Brit-brewed market meltdown. That leaves it slightly extended beyond its recent 291.02 buy point in a cup-with-a-handle base.With a 5.36% weighting, Biogen was the top holding of the sixth-best performing growth-stock mutual fund, $13.5 billion Vanguard Capital Opportunity (VHCOX), which notched an 11.13% gain.Biogen has a 97 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.EPS grew 10%, 25% and 23% the three quarters. It is the No. 3 stock in the Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. The group is ranked 34th now, up from 112 four weeks back.Mergers and acquisitions are roiling the pharmaceuticals and biotech waters. Early this week the Wall Street Journal said Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) might be checking out Biogen. But Fox Business said Allergan could not afford to make a run at Biogen, and Biogen and Merck's product lines are so different that such a hookup offers no synergies to Merck.

Alibaba (BABA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Nvidia (NVDA) headline quarterly earnings reports, while tech leaders Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) will start the week in buy range. More drugmakers will report, and top department store chains could signal more trouble in…

839,AGN,"The jobs report pushed stocks toward fresh all-time highs in a busy week. Tesla Motors (TSLA) announced a deal to buy SolarCity (SCTY) as tech M&A was strong. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) fueled a sell-off in consumer-related stocks, while oil prices briefly undercut $40 a barrel. Also, the Bank of England cut rates and revived bond buying.The major averages were little changed through Thursday, but rallied Friday on the strong jobs report. The Nasdaq climbed 1.1% for the week for a record close Friday and just 10 points below its July 2015 intraday peak. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, hitting a fresh intraday best. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.6%. Energy stocks fell as oil undercut $40 early in the week, but rallied as crude recovered somewhat.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, the second straight month of much-better-than-expected hiring, allaying fears about the economy. ISM's manufacturing index and nonmanufacturing index fell a little more than forecast, but still pointed to growth. Strong hiring and wage gains should support consumer spending and housing demand, despite many consumer-related firms reporting stalling demand.Tesla took a step closer toward acquiring SolarCity for $2.6 billion as a special committee of ""independent and disinterested"" SolarCity board members evaluated the proposal and alternatives, stating its approval of the merger. The deal still needs to be approved by shareholders and regulators.Tesla reported Q2 earnings that missed estimates but showed improvements in electric-car production. Its production is on track to support about 50,000 deliveries in the second half of 2016, which reaffirmed previous guidance.The electric-car company's losses ballooned to $1.06 a share from 48 cents in the year-earlier figure, much greater than the 52-cent loss estimate. Tesla reported non-GAAP revenue of $1.56 billion, up 33% but missing the consensus of $1.62 billion.Tesla fell 2% for the week, while SolarCity lost more than 7%.Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies is selling its Chinese operations to Apple (AAPL)-backed rival Didi Chuxing Technologies, capitulating on an expensive battle for a foothold in China. The deal has Uber swapping its Chinese business for a 20% stake in Didi, making the former foe the largest stakeholder in Didi. In turn, Didi will become the de facto ride-hailing leader in China, valued at more than $35 billion. Uber's most recent valuations put it north of $68 billion.Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed to buy Fleetmatics (FLTX), a vehicle tracking system maker, for $2.4 billion, or $60 per share. The acquisition expands Verizon' push into web-connected vehicles, part of the Internet of Things. Ireland-based Fleetmatics' mobile-software platform lets businesses manage commercial fleets by providing data on vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage.Verizon fell 3.2% for the week, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Fleetmatics jumped 38.5% to 59.50.Time Warner (TWX) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) both turned in mixed results, but Time Warner's move to buy a 10% stake in Netflix (NFLX) rival Hulu – joining current co-owners Walt Disney (DIS), Fox and Comcast (CMCSA) -- stole headlines. Viacom (VIAB) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, as did Lions Gate (LGF), which posted a surprise Q1 profit.U.S. oil prices fell below $40 per barrel early in the week, following July's 14% tumble, as OPEC production climbed on strong output from Nigeria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia continued to pump out oil near record highs. U.S. crude stockpiles rose in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration, but U.S. production dipped and gasoline supplies fell. Shale producers Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS), and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) all lifted their output forecasts. Oil closed the week higher, at $41.80.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) plunged 16% Friday after its cancer drug Opdivo ended a string of clinical-trial successes with its failure in a trial as a single therapy of newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients. Merck (MRK) had succeeded with a similar patient group in a trial of its competing drug Keytruda, though it was aiming at a smaller potential market. Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN). This further boosted Biogen's stock a day after its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) announced the unexpected success of a clinical trial of nusinersen, a treatment for a rare spinal disease with blockbuster potential. Biogen rose nearly 9% for the week.Meanwhile specialty drugmakers Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Shire (SHPG) rose 19% and 3.5%, respectively, after they beat estimates and raised guidance, while Pfizer (PFE), Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) slipped after they beat Q2 numbers but issued so-so guidance. Animal-health company Zoetis (ZTS) also rose after beating and raising.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) led auto stocks lower after reporting slower U.S. sales for the month of July, with Ford projecting U.S. industry sales to fall in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains. Department stores, grocery stores, restaurants and airlines also declined, but recovered somewhat by week's end.The sell-off among consumer stocks triggers a warning for the broader U.S. economy amid falling business investment and homebuilder spending. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.2% annual rate in Q2, but if that falters, the economy may not be able to match its anemic Q2 GDP growth of 1.2%.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) beat Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS up 57% to 47 cents, but revenue growth of 12% to $508.8 million missed views. The steakhouse chain also said early Q3 same-restaurant sales growth had slowed from Q2.The outlook comes amid growing worries about the restaurant sector overall. Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's both recently reported weak U.S. comps amid warnings from analysts about the retail sector.But pizza delivery chains including Papa John's (PZZA) are bucking the trend. Papa John's said EPS jumped 30% to 61 cents to top views, and raised guidance for the rest of the year. Also, chicken-themed El Pollo Loco (LOCO) and Wingstop (WING) rallied on their results, while Jack In The Box (JACK) soared on its earnings.Separately, Monster Beverage (MNST) reported weaker-than-expected earnings growth, but topped on revenue forecasts. Monster Beverage, a Leaderboard stock, rallied Friday, hitting a new high.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should look for growth stocks clearing proper buy points. IBD Leaderboard is a premium service that provides detailed chart analysis of leading stocks. See what other top-rated growth names are at or near buy points.The Bank of England cut interest rates by a quarter-point to 0.25%, as expected, as the U.K. economy slows in reaction to the Brexit vote. But policymakers went further, reviving government bond purchases and announcing that the BOE would buy corporate debt. They also signaled that a rate cut to near-zero is likely by year-end, but BOE Gov. Mark Carney said he's opposed to negative rates and ""helicopter"" money.Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), which makes crushed stone, sand and other aggregates used in construction, fell short of second-quarter forecasts. Rival aggregates supplier Vulcan Materials (VMC) also badly missed. In the related ready-mix concrete market, U.S. Concrete (USCR) reported that Q2 EPS plunged 59% to 54 cents, missing by 41 cents. Revenue rose 12.7% but also missed. All three blamed bad weather and said they expect better results in the second half. Martin Marietta CEO Ward Nye cited ""record or near-record rainfall and its attendant effects in many of our key markets."" Shares of the trio fell hard on the earnings misses but recovered some lost ground by the end of the week.Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported a 7% decrease in passenger unit revenue for July, saying the drop was in line with its expectations. But investors appeared worried about the tone the results set for the third quarter, during which Delta said the key metric of operating efficiency would fall 4%-6%. German carrier Lufthansa warned that terror attacks and economic uncertainty would affect travel also hurt the sector. Delta stock fell 2.8%. American Airlines (AAL) and  JetBlue (JBLU) also sank but United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) closed the week higher. .Aetna (AET), Humana (HUM) and WellCare (WCG) all put out estimate-beating quarterly results this week.

Earnings climbed 34% to $1.22 per share. The FBI reported that firearm background checks, seen as an indicator of future gun sales, rose 3% in July from June and were up 37% from July 2015. Shares fell 4.5% the day after earnings as Ruger's CEO said he was stepping down but closed the week down only 1.2%.Meanwhile Taser International (TASR) said Q2 EPS fell to 7 cents a share from 11 cents a year ago. But that beat forecasts by 3 cents a share. Sales popped 26% to $58.8 million, easily topping views for $54.42 million. The stun gun maker said bookings for its Axon body cameras soared 135%.Taser stock rose 1%, hitting a 1-year high.

840,AGN,"Israeli drug giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) was rising Wednesday after it offered a largely bullish outlook for its business after it acquires Allergan's (AGN) generic-drug business -- though it's still not clear when that will be.Late Tuesday, Teva raised its Q2 guidance ahead of Wednesday morning's conference call giving financial guidance out to 2019. It expects sales growth in the low teens this year and next year, flattening to about 3% the year after that, which was what Wall Street had expected, according to Thomson Reuters.Teva guided to a drop in EPS this year, as expected, but its 2017 guidance of $6 to $6.50 EPS was above consensus of $5.92. Its ranges for subsequent years called for modest growth but were on the high side of analysts' estimates.An SEC filing Wednesday morning stated that the closing date for Teva's $40 billion buyout of Actavis, Allergan's generic-drug business, had been pushed from July 26 to Oct. 26. Teva and Allergan had originally hoped for a Q1 closing, but the Federal Trade Commission has subjected the deal to a lengthy review process, making both companies sell off products to meet antitrust guidelines.Nonetheless, on the conference call with analysts Wednesday, Teva CEO Erez Vigodman said he expects the deal to close ""any time now.""Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat noted that 2018 revenue and EBITDA guidance was a bit lower than the company had predicted last July, which Teva attributed to delays both in the deal closing and in its pipeline, but analysts were already lowballing the company's guidance for that year.Raffat also noted that the guidance implies erosion in sales of its best-selling multiple-sclerosis drug Copaxone, from about $4 billion this year to about $3.25 billion in 2019. Copaxone has lost its patent protection and Novartis (NVS), partnered with Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA), launched a generic version in the U.S. last year.Teva stock jumped as much as 7.6% early on the stock market today, but ended the session up 3.8% to 54.46. Allergan stock was up 0.6% to 241.17.

841,AGN,"Major equity averages edged higher early Wednesday amid another busy day of headline flow. Goldman Sachs (GS), Walt Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL) outperformed in the Dow with gains of 1% or more.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 barely rose while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1%.The S&P 500 suffered its third distribution day in seven trading sessions Tuesday, raising its count to four. The Nasdaq composite currently shows three.IBD'S TAKE: Increasing signs of distribution, or higher-volume declines in the indexes, can cause cause problems for a market uptrend. To learn more about institutional selling and its impact on the market, check out this lesson in IBD University.In economic news, 178,600 private-sector jobs were added in July, according to the ADP National Employment Report. The data come ahead of Friday's official jobs report, for which economists expect July nonfarm payrolls to rise 185,000, with the unemployment ticking lower to 4.8%.In the stock market today, Time Warner (TWX) bucked the trend, rising nearly 4%, after the company reported earnings and announced it was taking a 10% stake in streaming service Hulu.Electronic Arts (EA), which had been showing supporting action at its 10-week moving average ahead of earnings, rose 0.1%. Adjusted earnings of 7 cents a share fell 53% from a year earlier, but this handily topped the consensus estimate for a loss of 2 cents. Sales rose 6% to $1.27 billion. The results were helped by strength in digital downloads. Elsewhere, Biogen (BIIB) fell 4.5% after surging 9% Tuesday on reports that Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) could be potential suitors.Inside the IBD 50, strong earnings and raised sales guidance late Tuesday helped the cause of Paycom (PAYC), as shares rose almost 4% to 49.13. The provider of workforce management software also got an upgrade to buy and a price-target hike to 57 from 50 at Wunderlich.West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September delivery rose 0.9% to $39.85 barrel after briefly topping $40. The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude supplies rose by 1.4 million barrels last week, but gasoline inventories fell by 3.3 million barrels. U.S. crude production also fell.After the close, Tesla Motors (TSLA) and Herbalife (HLF) will be out with quarterly results.Tesla were flat after falling the prior two days in the wake of its deal to buy SolarCity (SCTY).Herbalife stock lost 0.9% ahead of earnings. The stock has been volatile, but after surging nearly 7% in the week ended July 15, it's still holding above a 66.36 buy point.

843,AGN,"Generic drugmaker Sagent Pharmaceuticals (SGNT) popped 40% on the stock market today after it said it's being acquired for $736 million.Japan's Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical agreed to pay $21.75 a share in cash for the company, a 40% premium over Friday's closing price. Nichi-Iko said that the deal will provide it with a platform to commercialize its biosimilar drugs in the U.S. market, while giving Sagent access to its ""sophisticated manufacturing infrastructure and industry-leading quality control systems.""Sagent closed at 21.71.The news follows Sagent's own acquisition last month of five generic drugs awaiting approval from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), in the lengthy process of closing Teva's purchase of Allergan's (AGN) generics business.For the first time in at least four years, Sagent's revenue fell year over year in each of the past two quarters, driven by price pressures and a weak cold and flu season, as much of its business is in anti-infective products. The stock hit an all-time low of 10.55 on May 3, but it had gained about 50% before the buyout was announced.In other generic-drug news, Lannett (LCI) was up 12.7% to 27.72, hitting a five-month high. Lannett said the FDA had approved its generic version of Paxil, GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) popular antidepressant.The stock also probably received a lift by Lannett CEO Arthur Bedrosian's comment in the Paxil press release that ""our fiscal 2017, which began on July 1, 2016, is currently exceeding our expectations.""

844,AGN,"The sale of Allergan's (AGN) generic-drug business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) cleared another hurdle Tuesday when Impax Laboratories (IPXL) announced that it's paying $586 million to acquire 19 products the two firms were required to divest for competitive reasons.Impax wasn't allowed to name the products until the June 30 deal closing, apart from Teva's portion of a generic version of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) attention deficit drug Concerta, which the two firms have been developing in partnership. Allergan already has its own generic Concerta on the market, so it had been expected that one of them would have to go after Teva and Allergan announced their $40 billion deal last July.The remaining products Impax acquired include 15 that are already on the market, one approved in two strengths but not yet launched, one awaiting approval and one in development. There's also a drug that's a different strength of an existing product awaiting approval, Impax said.Together, the products generated $150 million in sales and $100 million in gross profit last year. Impax said the acquisitions will add $80 million to its top line in the second half of this year, and would double full-year earnings growth to 20%. Impax also hiked its full-year interest-expense guidance to 20% from 12%, and slightly increased its gross-profit guidance to the low 50% range.Impax CEO Fred Wilkinson said on a conference call with analysts that the timing is highly opportune, since Impax was facing a difficult second half financially. The last two quarters brought triple-digit earnings growth, thanks to the company's anti-inflammatory diclofenac sodium gel, but new competition was expected to shrink bottom-line growth to single digits in Q2 and Q3 and to move it into the red in Q4.Wilkinson said the Federal Trade Commission had marked the unnamed products for divestiture because they face limited competition or because of manufacturing difficulties, intellectual property barriers or difficulties meeting bioequivalence standards. The last issue had torpedoed the in-house version of Concerta that Impax had developed in 2014, when as it was under FDA review. Then, the agency updated its bioequivalence guidelines in a way that excluded Impax's drug, as well as Mallinckrodt's (MNK) already marketed product. Impax and Teva came by the current drug through an acquisition.Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry, however, doesn't like what the guidance implies about the base business.""Absent the acquisition, new guidance implies 8% downside relative to the current FactSet consensus sales forecast,"" Gerberry wrote in a research note. ""The guidance revision to the base biz is due to increasing competition to high margin generics relative to the 1Q16 update.""He added that getting full rights to Concerta should help, but that still has more than a year to go to get to market.The market seemed to agree with his assessment. Impax stock tumbled by 11.5% to 28.31 at the close on the stock market today, near 28. Teva stock lost 1.9%to 50.98, while Allergan gave back 1.6% to 231.55.
"
845,AGN,"Back in 2014, when specialty-drug maker Allergan was fending off a hostile takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, one of its main reasons for resistance was its claim that Valeant would decimate its research and development capabilities.Indeed, at that time, Valeant boasted that it had figured out a way to spend far less on R&D than other large drugmakers, while still cranking out new drugs.Two years later, the scene looks very different. Valeant (VRX), plagued by scandal and financial troubles, is reworking its business model. And Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) is touting an approach to R&D it calls ""open science,"" following its merger with Actavis -- and after its near-merger with Pfizer (PFE) that would have been the industry's largest but was scuttled in April when the U.S. changed its tax rules concerning companies looking to locate their headquarters in lower-tax countries. Like Valeant, Botox maker Allergan doesn't have its own internal research infrastructure and spends less on R&D than your typical Big Pharma. But it still spends more than Valeant and other low-cost specialty pharmas through its collaborations with a host of small biotechs and other external developers in its quest for leading drugs.Allergan CEO Brenton Saunders and R&D chief David Nicholson recently spoke with IBD to explain more about what open science means and how it could help Allergan grow.IBD: A lot of companies acquire or license externally developed drugs, so how is ""open science"" differentiating? Saunders: Maybe we can start by giving you our perspective on open science and why we think it's the preferred model for Allergan.We start with the premise that innovation and investment in R&D is crucial to the success of Allergan. Our mission is to help people live their lives better by finding cures and treatments to unmet medical need. And so therefore, we need to be in the innovation business. When we look at how do we participate in the most efficient, effective way, we believe that open science is the most effective construct for Allergan. We are focused in seven therapeutic areas (and) trying to be leaders in all seven, but to build scale in discovery platforms could be potentially counterproductive for us.When we look at where innovation comes from, and how innovation in health care is best accomplished, we believed it was better to tap into this very vast ecosystem of innovators. These are academic research centers. They're venture-backed startup companies. They're private companies. They're R&D-based public companies, and they're research spinouts out of large pharmaceutical companies and beyond. When we look at the totality of that universe, it's much larger than anything we could ever build on our own.It also provides some additional advantages for us. One is it provides the ability to pursue the best ideas with the best probability of success and the potential to meet the most unmet need, because we're not wedded to internal programs that we have made significant investment to, and we'd have to justify canceling or bypassing in order to chase an idea we believe was better.I think it also creates an attitude difference. We don't have a team of people here who are opposed to going outside for fresh ideas. We don't have a ""not invented here"" syndrome, because we depend on open science to sustain our innovation flow, and so we need to be good at partnering and licensing and acquiring R&D assets, and so we've developed a core capability around it.Now, in order to be a good partner, part of open science means we need to be a development powerhouse and also a commercial powerhouse. Because generally people don't want to give you their ideas unless they have extreme confidence that, one, you can finish them, that you have all the requisite skills in research development, like pharmaceutical science or clinical development or regulatory affairs to get the science to become a drug. And they generally want to take a royalty or milestone payment with regard to commercial success -- so they want to believe that, in your hands, the approved drug can become a commercial success as well.Nicholson: One of our advantages, in that we don't have an internal research organization, is that we don't need to do technology-based collaborations to feed our research. We have collaborations that are exquisitely focused on products within our therapeutic areas.The open-science model for me is collaboration with this huge resource in the external world, the biotech industry. And our open-science model is focused exquisitely on novel, innovative product opportunities within our seven therapeutic areas. And I think that makes us almost unique in the industry.IBD: So when you say you don't have to license technology, are you talking about a platform or a delivery technology or something like that?Nicholson: When I'm talking about technology platforms, I'm talking about very, very fundamental research technology and discovery technology. Clearly, we are interested in technology that can be utilized within development for novel pharmaceutical science technology. For instance, we did a deal with Anterios recently that gave us access to technology that lets us get large molecules across the dermal barrier.Because we don't do discovery research, we don't have to have pure technology-based discovery collaborations. When we have collaborations in the early space, it's because that technology is already delivering development projects.Saunders: If you have deep discovery in platforms and technologies, it can take away some of your flexibility to purse novel or interesting new technologies, because you've made such an investment in that capability. It's almost a fixed investment, if you will.IBD: Since many companies are looking for drugs to acquire or license, how competitive is the scene out there?Saunders: There's some areas where it remains incredibly competitive. A good example is oncology, where there really is an arms race occurring in large pharma to acquire as much technology as possible, particularly as the technology is exploding. You can see that in some of the dealmaking and the price of some of the dealmaking lately in the cancer arena.In the seven therapeutic areas we compete in, there is some competition, but we generally are the 800-pound gorilla in those areas. We pride ourselves in our reputation of being easy to do business with, and being committed to strong and productive partnership skills. That's something that we believe is a competitive advantage, and something we take quite seriously.IBD: The appropriate spending level of R&D is much-debated of late. How do you decide the appropriate level?Saunders: My view on spending R&D dollars is very practical. We will invest in R&D where we believe the investment targets an unmet medical need -- i.e., it's innovative -- that the probability of success meets certain criteria, (and) that we have the capabilities to make it successful.So we, very differently than most of the rest of the industry, don't target our spend based on revenue numbers. We spend against programs that we think make a difference.Nicholson: This is part of our open-science model. Because we don't have the fixed costs that are normally associated with running a discovery organization, we make certain that we have a development powerhouse with a certain proportion of flexible spend. Therefore, we can flex up and down the amount of cash we spend on R&D, depending on what the pipeline needs.IBD: What's your preference as to the stage of development at which you enter into the process with these external programs?Saunders: One of the best-kept secrets about Allergan is that we would enter an agreement or collaboration at any stage of development -- early, mid or late. We've done that quite successfully. The drug we just launched for schizophrenia and bipolar mania, Vraylar -- we entered into that collaboration 14 years ago and really developed that drug from phase one all the way to approval. It was quite complex pharmaceutical science and development.People tend to talk about the R&D that we bring in at a later stage -- because it seems more real, right? It's closer in time. But the reality is, we are very open-minded to entering into those collaborations and R&D-related structures any time in the continuum, so long as it meets the criteria of meaningful innovation, probability of success and (that it) fits within our capabilities.IBD: Of course, the probability of success is more difficult to gauge the earlier it gets. How do you gauge that?Saunders: A lot of times you can manage that through structure. For example, we have a structured deal with a company called Rhythm Health. We really were impressed with the work Rhythm Health was doing with a condition called diabetic gastroparesis. There really hasn't been any meaningful pharmaceutical advances in diabetic gastroparesis in about 30 years.David and the team at Allergan evaluated the science and the work that was being done at Rhythm, and while early, we thought it was incredibly innovative. So we signed an option agreement with Rhythm where they will finish the phase-2b study, which will read out in a few months. If positive, we have the option to bring it into Allergan in phase three and finish the development.We did the same thing with a company called Trevena (TRVN) and an acute heart-failure drug. They reported those results a few weeks ago and the study failed, and therefore we didn't exercise the option.We don't have a one-size-fits-all. We will do a deal at any stage of development depending on the preferences of the partner, and the conviction in the science on our side that makes sense. One of the things that is a hallmark of Allergan is being open and flexible to principles of mutuality. How do you create a win-win for the inventor of an idea and the people who will be responsible to bring it to conclusion? We're always looking for mutuality in all our deals to create that win-win scenario to make everyone feel good and remain constructive and productive around bringing it to fruition.

848,AGN,"Injectable-drug specialist Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) stock was down sharply Monday after it got a downgrade from Mizuho saying that its thesis had played out.Eagle stock jumped 28% on June 10 when Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) won a patent case against several generic drugmakers, including Pfizer's (PFE) Hospira unit and Sagent Pharmaceuticals (SGNT), that were trying to launch generic versions of its blood-cancer drug Treanda. In January, Teva and Eagle launched a low-volume, faster-acting version of Treanda called Bendeka, which it says it expects to replace Treanda on the market eventually.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler wrote in her research note that she expects the companies to retain market exclusivity for Bendeka until 2019, but she said other catalysts might be slow in coming.""The Treanda/Bendeka switch is a genuine success story for Eagle, but its other hospital launches like Ryanodex and Docetaxel have been more challenging,"" Koffler wrote as she downgraded the stock to neutral from buy. ""We are reminded that cost is still critical within this setting, and this insight has influenced our longer-term outlook on Bendeka and the rest of Eagle's portfolio.""Koffler noted that Eagle is preparing to file for approval of a version of Eli Lilly's (LLY) lung-cancer drug Alimta, which is altered in a way similar to Bendeka's reformulation of Treanda, but she doubted that it will be as lucrative as the Teva deal.""We are concerned about competition from other 505(b)(2) filers like Allergan (AGN), who has already launched this type of product in EU,"" she wrote. ""For this reason, we think that replicating a Bendeka-like agreement could be challenging here.""Eagle turned its first annual profit last year, of 16 cents a share, which analysts expect to jump to $4.56 this year with the help of the Bendeka launch. The stock nonetheless has a single-digit Relative Strength Rating, and ended trading down 9% on the stock market today, to 40.76.

849,AGN,"Specialty-drug giant Allergan (AGN) got conflicting messages from Wall Street on Friday, as Goldman Sachs put the stock on its Conviction Buy list, while Mizuho lowered its price target, due to differing opinions about the company's near-term strategy.Goldman analyst Jami Rubin wrote in a research note that after meeting with top executives, she believes the company is on track to deliver sustainable double-digit top-line growth and margin expansion.Rubin added that near-term catalysts include the closing of Allergan's $40 billion sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), which both Teva and Allergan confirmed this week will happen next month, as well as the potential $10 billion share buyback Allergan unveiled during its Q1 earnings report on Tuesday.For Rubin, Allergan's decision to scale back its acquisition strategy in favor of the stock buyback makes sense.""We believe Allergan management is listening to shareholders and placing capital deployment priorities on unlocking value by investing in the most attractive assets available -- Allergan shares,"" Rubin wrote.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler, however, found the shift less than inspiring.""Aside from a large $5-billion-to-$10-billion share buyback, management is not pursuing any transformational changes to the business (as expected), and (we) are less excited by an execution story,"" she wrote in a research note, lowering her price target to 232 from 250, while affirming a neutral rating.The market for now sides with Goldman. Allergan stock rose 3.4% on the stock market today, to 223.35.But Allergan shares are still down nearly 30% this year, and they plunged 15% on April 5 after the company and Pfizer (PFE) called off their $160 billion marriage as the Treasury Department issued new rules to discourage mergers that would enable U.S. companies to move their headquarters to lower-tax countries, such as Allergan's home base of Ireland.

850,AGN,"Specialty-drug giant Allergan (AGN) reported a mixed first quarter, affirmed guidance and announced a massive share buyback Tuesday, lifting its battered stock.Allergan stock was already boosted 6% Monday after Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) said in its Q1 report that its buyout of Allergan's generics unit, Actavis, is on track to close next month after having been delayed by various regulatory issues. This would render moot the worries over generic-drug pricing that drove the stock to a two-year low on Friday, after it had already been hammered by the break-up of its merger with Pfizer (PFE).The stock was up another 5.5% in early trading on the stock market today as Allergan reported operating earnings of $3.04 a share, up 15% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales climbed 48% to $3.8 billion, about $150 million below Wall Street's average estimate.Allergan affirmed full-year revenue guidance of $17 billion vs. $15.1 billion last year. All the above numbers exclude Actavis.The company said it will use part of the roughly $40 billion in proceeds from the Teva deal to buy back stock. It plans to buy $4 billion to $5 billion over the next four to six months, and said if conditions allow it will consider extending the program up to as much as $10 billion.Allergan stock, once a resident of the IBD 50, still holds an excellent EPS Rank of 97 and actually declined less than the group as a whole during the drug-stock sell-off between August and February. But the high-profile dissolution of the Pfizer deal in early April pushed the stock down to single-digit Relative Strength Ratings, leading to a mediocre Composite Rating of 40.

Revenue shrank 3.5% to $4.81 billion, but that's more than $30 million past consensus.Teva guided Q2 earnings at $1.16 to $1.20 a share, down from $1.43 a year ago and bracketing consensus. It forecast Q2 revenue to decline slightly to $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, on the low side of analysts' $4.89 billion.Teva stock was up 4.5% in early trading on the stock market today, near 52.50, perhaps as a relief rally after the whole industry got spooked Friday by Endo International's (ENDP) comments about pricing pressure in generic drugs, driving it to slash its full-year guidance. Teva stock fell to a more than 18-month low of 50 on Friday.Teva declined to offer 2016 guidance until it closes its buyout of Allergan's (AGN) generics unit Actavis, which is expected to happen next month, but its Q2 guide did not suggest a dramatic underperformance.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan did note, however, that the generics business, which makes up about 45% of total revenue, missed Wall Street's estimate, though this was balanced out by a beat on the specialty side.""U.S. Generics revenues declined 32% year over year, mainly from a decline in sales of Nexium and Pulmicort,"" Divan wrote in a research note. ""Specialty Medicine revenues increased by 10% year over year, driven primarily by higher sales of CNS (central nervous system) and respiratory products.""Allergan stock, which also sold off Friday, was up 4.5% in early trading Monday.

854,AGN,"Biotech stocks fell into one of the deepest craters in their history, starting last summer, but rumblings of a recovery are sounding.After a three-year bull run that more than quadrupled its value by its peak last July, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Industry Group plunged 50% by early February, hurt by backlashes against high drug prices and mergers that seek to lower corporate taxes.But the group has gained 12% since its Feb. 11 low, and some leading stocks have done better than that.3 Biotech Stocks Buoyed By Potential Blockbuster DrugsBioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) is up 30% from its Feb. 9 low. Incyte (INCY) has gained 29% from its low point that same week, while Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) has climbed 45%, and Medivation (MDVN), boosted by buyout talk, is up 127%.The group was up by even more before taking some hits over the past two weeks on negative earnings news from several industry players. But fund managers tell IBD the rebound is here.Why? For one, they say, the spate of bad news has already been factored into stock prices. But more than that, they see a climate favoring rejuvenated M&A, hot drugs in the new-product pipeline and pricing power for innovate products.Bottom line: The positive factors that drove the runup never went away, they say. They just got drowned out by the noise.""A very key point is that this group is a very high-beta group -- particularly the small- to midcap stocks. Since they don't have sales, they don't have earnings,"" said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.""The history of this group is that elevated macro uncertainty definitely hits (it),"" Vandeventer said. ""My own opinion is this group trades more on sentiment than on fundamentals during those time periods.""Vandeventer points to troubles in China as emblematic of the macroeconomic concerns that hit biotech stocks.Another sentiment-driving factor is politics.Many of the candidates in the U.S. presidential race have bashed drugmakers for high prices and have proposed ways to clamp down. Wall Street has dismissed some of these ideas as impossible or ineffective. What seems to be generating the most concern are Democrats' proposals to let Medicare and Medicaid negotiate drug prices, which they are not allowed to do now.Already the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services has shown its teeth. It announced a pilot program changing the reimbursement for Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in hospitals and clinics. The Part B reimbursement scheme was long criticized for encouraging use of expensive drugs because it reimburses health care providers for the entire cost of a drug, plus 6% on top. The proposed scheme would reduce that premium and add a flat fee unrelated to the price of the drug. That, in theory, could encourage doctors to choose cheaper options.On the M&A front, the Treasury Department last month issued new guidelines on tax-inversion deals that derailed what would have been the drug industry's biggest-ever merger, between Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN). Tax inversions have become a popular way for drugmakers to boost their bottom lines and get access to cash. Allergan, after earlier mergers, is based in Ireland, which has low taxes.""We think that with the tax regulation -- I call this the 'inversion bottom' -- and the bad press associated with the health care industry, that created a bottom in our minds,"" said Robert Bombace, senior portfolio manager at Frost Investment Advisors. ""A lot of the bad news has already been baked into these companies.""In fact, a number of industry insiders say the breakup of the Pfizer-Allergan merger could turn out to be good for biotech stocks because it makes them acquisition targets for the two companies. Allergan has a long history of acquisitiveness, and Pfizer is thinking of splitting its innovative drug business from its other products. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum says Pfizer will want to bulk up its innovative business to make it valuable as a standalone, since its pipeline is modest compared to its big-pharma competitors.Schoenebaum has also said, though, that biotech boards are balking at buyout offers. They can't accept how much their valuations have dropped, so they've been unwilling to sell at market prices. He suspects this will lead to hostile takeover deals if the big players are willing to do them. This partly came to fruition in late April, when Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid for Medivation, as rumors swirled that AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer were also interested.Medivation's response reflected the attitude that Schoenebaum spoke of -- that the market was underpricing the stock.""Sanofi's opportunistically timed proposal, which comes during a period of significant market dislocation, and before several important near-term events for the company, is designed to seize for Sanofi value that rightly belongs to our stockholders,"" Medivation founder and CEO David Hung said in a statement rejecting the offer.Bombace, however, says the biotechs' reluctance might be for show.""I think that's just a bargaining chip,"" he said. ""The reality is that most of these companies will have to partner up anyway. ... The larger pharma and biotech names ... will reach a point where their pipelines are so dry, it will force their hands.""Bombace sees lots of exciting biotechnology science going on to fill out those pipelines. As he put it, we're ""going from the Model T stage to the space-shuttle stage.""Though he declined to name specific companies, he pointed to work in biomarkers -- which include PD-1 inhibitors such as Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) Keytruda. He also cited work in genetic mutations, the focus of many rare-disease firms such as BioMarin and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).These discoveries are keeping money flowing into and out of biotechnology, says Leonard Yaffe, who manages a health care hedge fund at Kessef Capital Management. He told IBD that specialty drugs -- the largely biologic drugs prescribed by specialists, as opposed to primary-care doctors -- contributed only 1% of prescriptions last year but 37% of dollars spent on drugs, up from 25% two years earlier.""One thing I think will drive the biotech stocks is that, if you look at drugs introduced in the last two years, 65% of the revenue derived from those drugs are from biologicals,"" Yaffe said. ""So it's the most attractive sector in the pharmaceutical area.""Also, while most publicly traded biotech stocks don't have earnings, those that have successfully launched drugs remain highly profitable. Of the top five biotechs in market cap -- Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) -- four have IBD EPS Ranks ranging from 89 to 96, putting them in the top 11% of all stocks in EPS growth. Regeneron has a 68 EPS Rank.Those numbers, however, reflect the pricing power of biologic drugs, which is precisely what's under political attack these days. Vandeventer says price uncertainty is the biggest risk to his bull thesis on the group right now. But he also points out that Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton attempted a previous overhaul of the health care system back in the mid-1990s, which depressed drug stocks in the short term but was followed by the late-1990s boom.That boom was driven by the first wave of biotech innovation, when companies like Amgen and Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech proved that biotechnology could produce blockbusters. Vandeventer says that innovation will remain the key in maintaining pricing power, even under political pressure. He points to Gilead's portfolio of hepatitis C drugs, which started in late 2013 with the launch of Sovaldi. Despite much political criticism of Sovaldi's high price, no one could stop it because the drug was so superior to anything else on the market.""Companies that have done the research -- they'll continue to get price increases,"" he said. ""Companies that are particularly in the rare-disease, orphan-disease arena, (or) the oncology space -- companies that have drugs in an era of targeted medicine that have higher efficacy rather than a shotgun trying to hit a disease -- are going to have pricing power.""The promise of such drugs can still make small stocks explode. Celator Pharmaceuticals (CPXX) has surged to over 13 from under 3 since March on favorable late-stage trial results for its acute myeloid leukemia treatment. The company also saw a hedge fund take a position in the stock and attracted favorable initial coverage from an analyst.There are signs that even generalist investors think biotech stocks have gotten cheap, says Yaffe. During the first quarter, a common lament was that every biotech stock got punished for bad news, but good news got no reward. But when Biogen issued a mixed earnings report that drew mostly negative reactions from Wall Street on April 21, its stock rose more than 5%.Biogen had fallen even harder than other big-cap biotechs, dropping 50% from its March 2015 high to its Feb. 12 low, so it was ready for a bounce, says Yaffe.""The overview comment is the sector had corrected 30%, and at some point it gets to the level where the stocks are very attractive,"" he said.

855,AGN,"Less than a month after Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion takeover of Allergan (AGN) over new anti-inversion rules, the drug giant reportedly is eyeing a possible bid for  Medivation (MDVN), sending the cancer biotech's stock higher.Pfizer has approached Medivation for talks, according to Reuters. That could lead to an offer that would top a $9.3 billion bid for Medivation from France's Sanofi (SNY) last week. Medivation has rejected Sanofi's $52.50-share bid as undervaluing the company, which is best known for prostate cancer drug Xtandi.Medivation shares have been trading well above that Sanofi offer price, closing down 0.8% to 57.52 on Tuesday. Medivation rose above 60 in pre-market trading on the stock market today on the Reuters report.Pfizer stock edged lower before the open. On Tuesday, Pfizer rose 2.7% to 33.70, breaking out of a consolidation, after the pharmaceutical king reported its best quarterly earnings per share gain in more than six years. Pfizer's 32% EPS rise, better than expected, benefited from several one-time factors, including its recent Hospira takeover.
"
856,AGN,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) rose Tuesday after it beat Wall Street's Q1 estimates and raised its guidance, as the company moved on after it and Allergan (AGN) last month called off their mammoth $160 billion merger.Before the open, Pfizer said earnings, excluding one-time items, rose 32% over the year-earlier quarter to 67 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus by 12 cents. Revenue increased 20% to $13 billion, beating consensus by about $1 billion.The accounting in Q1 was complicated by several factors, including the Sept. 3 acquisition of generic drugmaker Hospira.""If we look closely to year-over-year revenue growth, it is worth mentioning that out of $2.1 billion growth vs. Q1 ’15 (or $2.9 billion of operational growth or 26% year-over-year) favorable FX (foreign-exchange rates) contributed $729 million, and inclusion of Hospira contributed $1.2 billion,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email to clients. ""Excluding FX and Hospira, Pfizer stand-alone revenue increased by $1.7 billion (15% year-over-year growth).""There is also an additional factor favorably contributing to revenues -- $900 million due to an additional five selling days this quarter. Excluding this impact, operational year-over-year revenue growth comes as 8%, which is still very good growth for Pfizer with its relatively mature portfolio of products.""Still, none of these factors except foreign exchange contributed to Pfizer's full-year guidance increase. The company added $2 billion to its revenue guidance, now $51 billion to $53 billion, and 18 cents to its EPS range, now $2.38 to $2.48. Pfizer said that about $1 billion of the revenue hike and 12 cents of the EPS gain were due to improved operating performance.Pfizer stock rose 2.7% on the stock market today, to 33.70, and touched a nearly five-month high.A number of important drugs also beat consensus, including breast-cancer treatment Ibrance, epilepsy drug Lyrica, and pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13. Enbrel -- Amgen's (AMGN) rheumatoid-arthritis drug, which Pfizer markets outside the U.S. -- also beat expectations, as it did domestically for Amgen in its Q1 report last week.Nonetheless, investors' minds may be elsewhere, wrote Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan in a research note.""We expect investors to view the quarter as a positive but maintain their focus on the strategic outlook of the company following the failed Allergan deal and ahead of a decision on a potential split of Pfizer,"" he wrote.Pfizer and Allergan, based in low-tax Ireland, called off their merger, which would have been the industry's largest ever, after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb tax inversion deals.

857,AGN,"Drugmaker Endo International (ENDP) plunged 39% Friday after it delivered a hefty guidance cut driven by weakness in its generics business, dragging nearly every other generic-drug stock down with it.Endo actually beat analysts' consensus in Q1, but it cut its full-year earnings guidance by 23% -- now $4.50 to $4.80 a share -- and trimmed the revenue outlook by 11% to a range of $3.87 billion to $4.03 billion. In the company's earnings release, CEO Rajiv De Silva blamed ""new competitive entrants, including for Voltaren Gel; greater-than-expected price erosion across the Generics sector; and delays on regulatory actions related to certain Endo products.""IBD's Take: How healthy are shares of Endo and Teva and how do they stack up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupIt was the second factor that rattled the rest of the generics industry. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) stock fell 6.8% to 50.22, and hit a 19-month low of 50.01. Allergan (AGN), already staggering from the cancellation of its buyout by Pfizer (PFE), hit a two-year low of 195.50 and ended the day at 201.63, down 4.1%, even though it's selling its generics business to Teva.Perrigo (PRGO), which cut its own guidance last month, fell 4.8%, to 92.42. Smaller drugmaker Akorn (AKRX), down as much as 20%, ended the day off 7.9%, at 22. Akorn, which has fallen way behind on its accounting due to internal issues, late Friday finally set dates for its Q4 and Q1 earnings releases, for May 9 and May 17, respectively.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz wrote in a research note that Endo's problems read through most directly to Teva, Akorn and Perrigo, and more moderately to Allergan. Essentially, whoever's done the most price-hiking on products representing more than 5% of generic sales lately is in the most trouble.Referring to industrywide data from IMS, Schwartz wrote: ""Based on our analysis, Akorn has taken 13 price increases matching the above criteria (44% of IMS generic sales), Perrigo eight (18% of generic IMS sales) and Endo took 17 (17% of generic IMS sales).""Teva, meanwhile, is due to report its own Q1 earnings and guidance on Monday morning, and Allergan is due before the open the following day.Endo itself got at least four downgrades from Wall Street analysts Friday, mostly to neutral but one to underweight. It ended the day at 16.17, a seven-year closing low.

860,AGN,"Walt Disney (DIS), Macy's (M), Gap (GPS), Kohl's (KSS), Fossil (FOSL) and others reported weak earnings or guidance, triggering a broad sell-off in retail and other consumer stocks -- but not for shares of Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year low amid fresh evidence that iPhone demand remains weak. The major indexes ultimately closed modestly lower, with the S&P 500 and Dow industrials falling below key support.The major averages fell for a third straight week, with most or all of the losses coming Friday. The Dow fell 1.2% and the S&P 500 0.5%, both closing below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since Feb. 29. The Nasdaq, already below that key line, retreated 0.4%.

ESPN lost subscribers once again, but the media networks segment didn't appear to disappoint Wall Street too badly. Studio revenue shot up 22% on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" fanfare. ""Captain America: Civil War"" should keep movie box office receipts high in Q2.Disney shares tumbled 4.8% to 100.52, falling out of a cup-with-handle base and well out of buy range. Disney closed just above its 50-day line.Apple stock fell last week amid new evidence that Apple suppliers are seeing weak orders for the upcoming iPhone 7. That suggests Apple's sales woes may continue for quite some time.

Several large and small banks halted work with Lending Club. Shares shed 51%, hitting a record low.Peer-to-peer lending firm Prosper recently announced a large round of layoffs, and disappointing quarterly results from OnDeck (ONDK) have prompted worries over insufficient loan-volume growth.Online gaming platform NetEase (NTES) more than doubled revenue in Q1, beating estimates, boosted by mobile games such as “Fantasy Westward Journey” and newer releases such as “Kung Fu Panda 3.” EPS also topped. Shares rose 9.3% for the week, moving above the 200-day line.Weibo (WB), a Twitter (TWTR)-like social-media platform majority owned by Sina (SINA), fared well, helped by mobile-user growth, strong ad revenue and expansion beyond major cities.

862,AGN,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) rose sharply for the third day in a row Thursday, after the company came to an agreement with its creditors to avoid a default.Valeant said lenders had agreed to an amendment extending the filing deadline for its 10-K annual financial report to May 31, and its 10-Q for Q1 to July 31. Previously, both were due at the end of March, though the agreement gave Valeant 30 days after that to file to prevent a default. The amendment also waives the cross-default to Valeant's indentures, which was set off when the company failed to file its 10-K by March 15.Valeant is late in its filing because of a review of its financial records that it started after a scandal erupted last fall surrounding its relationship with now-defunct pharmacy Philidor. On Tuesday, the company said the review was complete, so it expects to file the 10-K this month. The new agreement gives it a bit more breathing room.Valeant said the amendment also will affect its M&A capabilities.""The terms of the amendment will restrict the company's ability to make certain acquisitions and other investments and to pay dividends and other restricted payments until the financial statements are filed and the company achieves certain leverage ratios,"" Valeant's statement said. ""While these restrictions are in place, the company will also be required to apply substantially all net asset sale proceeds to prepay its term loans.""Valeant has become highly levered through a series of acquisitions that have quickly bulked up the company, but the management put acquisitions on hold after the Philidor scandal broke. No asset sales have been announced, though Wall Street has been speculating that the company will be slimmed down or even broken up. On Wednesday, several analysts and reporters asked Allergan (AGN) CEO Brenton Saunders if Allergan might acquire Bausch & Lomb, a business that Valeant bought in 2013 back when Saunders was running it.Valeant stock rose as much as 12% on the stock market today, but closed Thursday up 3.9%, at 35.51. The stock has risen 26% this week despite hitting a more than five-year low on Monday, as investors have been heartened by the completion of the financial review as well as promises of a new CEO in the near future.

863,AGN,"The future of the $160 billion merger between big pharma Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan seemed to be unraveling Tuesday after the U.S. Treasury Department proposed new rules to take away the tax benefits of the deal.Late Monday, Treasury announced an action designed to curb tax inversions, deals in which a U.S. company like Pfizer merges with a smaller foreign company like Allergan so it can relocate to the lower-tax foreign domicile. The Pfizer-Allergan agreement, announced in November, was the latest and biggest of a series of such deals over the past few years that have drawn increasing criticism from politicians.At a press briefing Tuesday, President Obama voiced his approval of the new rules.""I've been pushing for years to eliminate some of the injustices in our tax system,"" Obama said. ""So I'm very pleased that the Treasury Department has taken new action to prevent more corporations from taking advantage of one of the most insidious tax loopholes out there, and fleeing the country just to get out of paying their taxes.""Obama also urged Congress to pass legislation to create a more comprehensive solution, including lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate to a level more like other countries'. Many CEOs of inverted companies have also urged this.Allergan stock fell 15%, to 236.55, in the stock market today.Wall Street analysts agreed that the big downside surprise to the Treasury action was the proposed rule regarding ownership. Under current law, if a U.S. company merges with a foreign company and ends up owning more than 80% of the foreign company, it cannot officially relocate to the foreign company's home country. The way the accounting works now, the Pfizer-Allergan merger would end up with Pfizer owning 56% of the new company, while Allergan would own 44%.Allergan as it is today is a fairly new entity. Back in 2013, the New Jersey drugmaker then known as Actavis acquired Irish counterpart Warner Chilcott, giving it the coveted Dublin address. Since then, it has bought more companies, notably New York-based Forest Laboratories in 2014 and California-based Allergan last year, which led to the name change.The Treasury's guidelines seem to be aimed squarely at Allergan for this. ""For the purposes of computing the ownership percentage when determining if an acquisition is treated as an inversion under current law, today’s action excludes stock of the foreign company attributable to assets acquired from an American company within three years prior to the signing date of the latest acquisition,"" says Treasury's statement.That creates complications.""Here, Allergan (formerly Actavis) is the byproduct of two acquisitions (Forest and legacy Allergan) by Actavis that led to the issuance of an estimated 200 million to 227 million shares of Allergan,"" wrote Leerink analysts Jason Gerberry and Seamus Fernandez in a research note. ""If you strip those shares from the pro-forma Pfizer-Allergan share count (at 11.3x multiplier), you end up with Pfizer owning close to 80% of the New Co.""The analysts noted that the buyout deal includes a provision for changes in the tax law -- without a change, the breakup fee is $3.5 billion, but with adverse changes that drops to only $400 million.This ""lowers the probability of the deal closing,"" they concluded. Nonetheless, they added that Pfizer's ownership could come up shy of 80% unless the feds also back out shares related to the Warner-Chilcott deal -- ""but it’s our view that Warner was the original foreign entity, and it is all subsequent deals that get backed out of the ownership test.""However, an unidentified source told Reuters on Tuesday that Pfizer believes Treasury has painted a target on it, so there will unlikely be any escape routes.""Pfizer is aware that the Treasury will keep ruling against any solution it can come up with,"" Reuters quoted its source as saying.By Tuesday afternoon Pfizer had made no formal decision, its only statement being a brief late-Monday press release saying the company is ""conducting a review"" and would say nothing until it's completed.Treasury's proposal also included a provision attacking earnings stripping, in which the foreign parent makes loans to the U.S. subsidiary and deducts the interest payments from earnings. Analysts say this was expected and is not by itself a deal killer.The rules formally took effect April 4, but are not finalized -- they first have to go through a public comment period that could take months, according to Evercore ISI policy analyst Terry Haines. However, Treasury might have the edge if the rules aren't final, Haines says.""Both of these provisions we expect could be subject to litigation from affected companies, but an affected company is not likely to quickly get court relief through a stay of Treasury's proposal,"" Haines wrote. ""Treasury is carefully limiting its earning stripping action to a 'proposed regulation,' not even a 'temporary regulation' like its other actions today on the 2014 and 2015 proposals.""According to Haines, ""What Treasury is trying to do is avoid court scrutiny while discouraging inversions at the same time: If a rule is only 'proposed' by a regulator, courts reject lawsuits because the government has not taken a final action that definitely harms someone.""On the plus side for Pfizer investors, Evercore drug analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in an email to clients that if the Allergan deal doesn't go through, this could move up the timeline for Pfizer's long-expected split into two companies -- one devoted to innovative drug development and the other established products. That had been pushed into the future when the Allergan deal was announced in November, but Schoenebaum speculates that a decision on that could be made as early as this year.Pfizer stock rose 2.1% Tuesday.As for Allergan, if it doesn't merge with Pfizer it will still be affected by the earnings-stripping provision, which Allergan CEO Brenton Saunders has said could shave profit margins by two or three percentage points. Still, analysts calculated that Tuesday's stock drop brought Allergan well below its stand-alone value.""The updated guidance will put downward pressure on Allergan's stock price, but we continue to view the company as undervalued at its stand-alone price and think its moat is wide, buoyed by a strong and differentiated portfolio along with a solid pipeline,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Damien Conover in a research note.

Pfizer gained 5%.Meanwhile, oil-field services giants Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) outperformed in the S&P 500, jumping 9% and 6%, respectively, after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to halt their planned merger on concerns that the combined company would stifle competition in the sector.After the close, watch for earnings from retailers Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and small-cap Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI).
"
867,AGN,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) contemplated splitting itself, while specialty drugmaker Allergan (AGN) campaigned to regain investor confidence Wednesday, after the two companies announced that their planned merger was off.Pfizer early Wednesday confirmed rumors that the companies had canceled their $160 billion merger, two days after the Treasury Department released new guidelines that would have removed most of the tax benefits of the deal for New York-based Pfizer. After its stock tanked Tuesday, Allergan's CEO went on a media blitz to promote his company's prospects as a stand-alone.On a conference call with analysts Wednesday morning, Allergan CEO Brenton Saunders maintained that Treasury's action against tax inversions will have no impact on the stand-alone Allergan, which redomiciled to Ireland through an inversion deal with Warner Chilcott three years ago. The company will retain its 14% corporate tax rate, he said, and it should also be free to deploy capital however it chooses.Saunders also said Allergan's $40 billion sale of its generic unit Actavis to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) is unaffected by the spiking of the Pfizer deal and is on track to close in June. The timeline for that buyout was delayed from its original Q1 closing date, as Teva works its way through a multi-country regulatory clearance process, but Saunders said the two companies are determined to get it done.""Teva is doing a lot of work,"" said Saunders. ""They've restructured their company; they have named their entire leadership through a few levels that include 200 Allergan executives moving to Teva. ... This is a great deal for Allergan, but also a great deal for Teva.""Allergan stock, down 15% Tuesday, rebounded 3.5% Wednesday, to 244.74. Teva stock rose 4% to 56.73.The closing of the Actavis sale should give Allergan a big wad of cash, so many of the analysts' questions on the call related to what it will do with the money. Several seemed to be rooting for share buybacks, given that Allergan stock is trading near a 52-week low in the wake of the Pfizer breakup.Saunders said all options are on the table, but he emphasized that Allergan's ""growth pharma"" model means that it's constantly on the hunt for growth assets. He said that Allergan's business-development team has stayed active since the Pfizer deal was announced, and if the right opportunity came along ""we could announce it tomorrow.""A couple of analysts raised the name of contact-lens giant Bausch & Lomb, with which Saunders has a personal history. He headed the company from 2010 until 2013, when it was sold to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) for $8.7 billion. Given Valeant's recent spectacular crackup, many on Wall Street have speculated that B&L might again go on sale, with Allergan a suitable buyer not only because of Saunders, but also because of Allergan's large ophthalmology business.Saunders' response to this seemed to be a swipe at Valeant's infamously opaque financial reporting.""It sold for $8.7 billion three, four years ago, with a late-stage pipeline of 30-some programs, and a strong organic growth profile,"" he said. ""I can't tell that any of those things today are still true. Based on public information, it's impossible to tell that it's worth more than it sold for four years ago.""Pfizer, meanwhile, rose 5% to 32.93, hitting a four-month high, as investors looked toward another possible major catalyst for its stock. Back in 2013, the company reorganized so that it would be able to split its innovative drug-development business from its established products, and perhaps divide itself into more pieces if necessary. The company had originally planned to make a decision on that this year, but when the Allergan buyout was announced, the issue was pushed into next year. In Pfizer's press release announcing the end of the Allergan deal, however, it said the decision date is back to this year.That itself could bring some more M&A, writes Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum.""After a recent acquisition of Hospira, Pfizer probably has critical mass to transform its Global Established Products business unit to an independent company, but Innovative Products business units might benefit from additional assets acquired from outside,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients.The prospects of both companies going back on the hunt may have been what lifted drug stocks as a whole Wednesday, especially biotechs. Distressed big-cap biotech Biogen (BIIB), which has been subject to buyout speculation given that it's trading 35% off its high, rose 5.3% to 279.57. Smaller Anacor Pharmaceuticals (ANAC) rose 16% to 73.20, likely because its late-stage eczema drug is seen as a fit for Allergan's dermatology portfolio.

873,AGN,"The Treasury Department may have squelched drug giant Pfizer’s (PFE) bid to take over Ireland-based Allergan (AGN), but ETF investors needn't fear.The new federal rules don't ice over the broader merger market, says Sal Bruno, chief investment officer of IndexIQ, the firm behind the largest merger-focused ETF.The $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan merger deal was widely seen as another attempt by a large U.S. company to move its legal domicile overseas and avoid America's steep corporate tax rates. The new rules make these so-called corporate inversions more difficult and potentially less profitable.However, ""tax inversion deals make up a small percentage of the total merger market,"" Bruno said. Most merger deals focus on opportunities for synergies and growth, he added.The Pfizer-Allergan kibosh hurts the merger industry from an ""optics standpoint,"" according to Bruno. Tactics to dodge corporate taxes have come in for flak recently from President Barack Obama and presidential candidates on both sides of the political divide.IQ Merger Arbitrage (MNA) dumped 1.4% Tuesday following the news and extended losses on the stock market today.This exchange traded fund invests in global companies that are targets of publicly announced takeovers. It rebalances monthly and uses a liquidity-based weighting method.Allergan is a top five stock holding in this exchange traded fund, with a 7% portfolio weighting.MNA has coasted along with far less volatility than the benchmark S&P 500 in the past year. Its 2.8% gain in the first quarter came in a very volatile period for the equity market.That performance helped to cushion Tuesday's blow.MNA was still up 1.35% for the year through April 5. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) has added 0.67%.The challenges for merger ETFs extend beyond the Pfizer-Allergan debacle.The Obama administration has taken a more aggressive stance on big mergers. It's suing to block the $35 billion merger of oil majors Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Staples’ (SPLS) bid for rival office supplier Office Depot (ODP) is also under scrutiny.Even more worrisome, deal activity is showing signs of cooling off after a record year for M&A in 2015.The U.S. recorded 1,007 deals cumulatively worth $241.5 billion in the first quarter, down 33% from 1,250 deals worth $361.3 billion in Q1 2015, according to intelligence service Mergermarket.Bruno believes the pace of M&A will remain brisk for the near future.Interest rates remain low, making it easier to borrow money to buy other companies. In a low-growth climate, acquisitions can add growth if a company can't generate growth on its own. And corporate balance sheets and cash flows are healthier than they have been in decades.""There's ample deal flow out there,"" Bruno said. ""We have a very positive outlook for merger-arbitrage as a whole.""Most challenging of all, perhaps, ETF investors continue to be wary of more niche products.MNA falls into the ""liquid alternative"" fund category: it aims to diversify a portfolio made up mostly of stocks and bonds. It's a category that hasn't grown tremendously in the ETF space, Bruno said.MNA debuted in 2009 and holds $127.7 million in assets. ProShares Merger (MRGR) launched in 2012 and holds $8.2 million.Despite the proliferation of thematic new products, plain-vanilla ETFs are dominant.""Investors will continue to focus most of their time and attention, as they well should, on very low-cost, broad, very well-diversified market exposures,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, said in a recent interview.However, Bruno expects liquid-alt ETFs to take off as people get more comfortable with their diversification benefits.""We will see growth going forward,"" he said. 
"
874,AGN,"A new sheriff is en route, but that hasn't stopped the old sheriff from swinging his corporate billy club around town.The subject is company mergers and the instances in which the administration of President Barack Obama -- who promised to ""reinvigorate"" federal antitrust enforcement on the campaign trail back in 2008 -- is cracking down are piling up. This week, Obama's Justice Department sued to block the $35 billion merger of Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) over antitrust concerns.Also this week, Obama said the Treasury Department had taken further steps to curb tax inversions by which U.S. companies buy a foreign target and then re-domicile to avoid higher taxes. That scuttled a major acquisition on Wednesday as drugmakers Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) called off their $150 billion deal.There also are several other instances in recent weeks and months when the administration has taken aim at big business. So, what gives? Is it a product of last year's robust M&A environment, which saw $4.3 trillion in global deals announced, or symptoms of a White House that critics have accused of being anti-business?""They’re definitely getting more aggressive,"" Max Jacobs, an analyst at London-based investment research house Edison, said of the administration. ""Historically, Obama has been a bit more on the liberal government intervention side of things.""Take the Pfizer-Allergan merger. The deal would have resulted in U.S.-based Pfizer relocating its headquarters to low-tax Ireland to benefit from that nation's 12% corporate tax rate. By doing so, it would have bypassed U.S. rates of 35%, the highest in the industrialized world.Terminating a deal that had been in the works for months, Pfizer now will pay Ireland-based Allergan a breakup fee of $150 million.""There is a political calculation here,"" said Dane Hamilton, editor at Mergermarket, speaking of tax-inversion deals. ""Obviously, the Obama administration would like to stop companies from moving overseas because they generate a lot of tax dollars.""Still, Obama's pending departure in January may not bring much relief. In terms of a friendlier face when it comes to M&A, there is a dearth of obvious presidential candidates at the moment.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's front-runner for president, wants to crack down on inversions, while fellow White House Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders has called the practice a ""tax-scam."" Meanwhile, Republican front-runner Donald Trump and party rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas propose lowering U.S. taxes to ward off inversions, but aren't coming out in support of them.Still, clamping down on tax inversions won't solve the corporate tax code's underlying problems, said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford University.""Our tax system very much put these incentives in place,"" she said. She added, though, that it's becoming more difficult to get inversion deals done.Tax inversions aren't the only target, though. The vigilant antitrust watchman that is the Obama administration has taken aim elsewhere.In addition to antitrust concerns over the Baker Hughes-Halliburton deal, which would combine the world's No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield-services firms, the Justice Department took Electrolux (ELUXY) to trial late last year, causing General Electric (GE) to back out of a $3.3 billion deal to sell its appliances unit. And the Federal Trade Commission has taken Office Depot (ODP) and Staples (SPLS) to trial to block the $6.3 billion deal between the two biggest office-supply chains.There's more. Last year, the administration quashed the $45 billion Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger, which would have combined the nation's two largest cable television companies. Yet in 2010, it approved Live Nation Entertainment’s (LYV) merger with Ticketmaster.Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, which favors more aggressive antitrust law enforcement, said the size of some of the companies merging raises ""red flags for enforcers.""But deals are still being struck despite politicians' griping.Major health insurers Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) combined in a $37 billion deal, and Anthem (ANTM) agreed to buy Cigna (CI) last year for $48.4 billion. The world's two largest beer makers, Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and SABMiller, agreed to combine for $105 billion.For now, though, the old sheriff has a free hand, said Edison's Jacobs.""(Obama) has the benefit of not having to stand for election,"" he said.

875,AGN,"Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) confirmed Wednesday that they are ending their $160 billion merger agreement after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb tax inversion deals Monday.Ireland-based Allergan rose 3.5% to 244.74 on the stock market today. CEO Brenton Saunders told CNBC that Allergan has a bright future as a standalone firm. Allergan plunged 14.8% Tuesday to 236.55, hitting the lowest levels since late 2014, amid concerns that the new rules imperiled the deal.Pfizer rose 5% Wednesday after gaining 2.1% to 31.36 on Tuesday.""Pfizer Inc. today announced that the merger agreement between Pfizer and Allergan plc has been terminated by mutual agreement of the companies,"" the drug giant said in a statement. ""The decision was driven by the actions announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury on April 4, 2016, which the companies concluded qualified as an ""Adverse Tax Law Change"" under the merger agreement.""U.S. companies have a strong incentive to redomicile overseas to reduce their exposure to America's unusually high corporate tax rates and global reach. Pfizer's board reported voted to scrap the deal given that there would no longer be tax benefits.Saunders said the new rules blindsided Allergan, and felt that they unfairly targeted his compnay, though it was not named specifically. The Treasury set restrictions on""serial inverters"" -- and Allergan has a history of inversion deals. Allergan is run from New Jersey, but has its official headquarters in Dublin.Pfizer will pay $150 million in merger-related expenses.Pfizer CEO Ian Reed said in a statement the drug giant may go ahead with a corporate split: ""We plan to make a decision about whether to pursue a potential separation of our innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2016""The Obama administration has become more aggressive going after big mergers. The Justice Department is suing to block the merger of Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI), which said they'll fight the DOJ's action.  But Baker Hughes shares rebounded 8.8% Wednesday after sliding 5.1% on Tuesday on reports that the DOJ would take action.

877,AGN,"Perrigo shareholders rejected a hostile takeover bid by fellow generic-drug maker Mylan Friday morning, sending Perrigo stock down and Mylan up, as a long and acrimonious battle ended.
"
878,AGN,"Mylan (MYL) said in a press release that by the 8 a.m. ET deadline, some 40% of Perrigo (PRGO) shares had been validly tendered, missing the 50% required for the $26 billion takeover to succeed.

""Our recent financial results continue to demonstrate the power of our stand-alone platform, with double-digit growth in our legacy business, as well as enhanced double-digit growth from the EPD business.""
"

""Strong organic growth, a disciplined approach to M&A and transparent, accessible corporate governance policies are the foundation of our successful business strategy.""
"
884,AGN,"Mylan first proposed buying Perrigo back in April for $60 in cash plus 2.2 Mylan shares for each Perrigo share, which it later lifted to $75 a share plus 2.3 Mylan shares — at the time, about $36 billion.
"
885,AGN,"By the time Mylan launched its tender offer on Sept. 14, the stock portion of that offer had lost considerable value, a result of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) abandoning its own hostile bid for Mylan to buy the generics business of Allergan (AGN) and also from the general drug-stock sell-off. Perrigo's stock has fallen also, however, leading Mylan to argue that Perrigo shareholders could still make money off a deal.
"
886,AGN,"Perrigo's leadership has steadfastly opposed Mylan's overtures, criticizing the offer, Mylan's business and Mylan's corporate governance. At the same time, they've sought to mollify shareholders with operational improvements and a $2 billion share buyback plan, the latter of which Papa said Friday would go ahead now that the vote is over.
"
887,AGN,"According to anonymously sourced reports, Perrigo's buyout prospects were also on hold until the Mylan issue was resolved. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that during the summer, Perrigo was in talks with Endo International (ENDP) about a possible combination.

893,AGN,"Biotech Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) has had a mostly good year, but it's preparing for a challenging future. Sucampo has enjoyed strong sales and profit growth over the past four quarters thanks to its constipation drug Amitiza, marketed by partner Takeda. The drug has driven Sucampo stock to a strong IBD Composite Rating of 86 even after the recent drug-stock hammering. But Amitiza is facing competition from Linzess, a fast-growing rival from drug giant Allergan (AGN).

"
903,AGN,"Sucampo has one other product in the pipeline: cobiprostone, a potential treatment for oral mucositis and nonerosive reflux disease. But both CEO Peter Greenleaf and Wall Street have said that the company needs to acquire more assets.
"
904,AGN,"On Aug. 26, Sucampo launched a tender offer worth $278 million in cash and stock for Japanese biotech R-Tech Ueno. Sucampo says that the acquisition will boost its financial profile along with its pipeline. Recently, Greenleaf talked to IBD about the acquisition and what it means for Sucampo's future.
"
905,AGN,"IBD: What was the rationale behind the R-Tech Ueno acquisition? Your companies had a relationship, right?
"
906,AGN,"Greenleaf: We had a relationship insomuch as the founders of Sucampo were the founders of R-Tech Ueno and held a 50% ownership position in our company as well.
"
907,AGN,"The business relationship between the two companies was primarily manufacturing. They were the exclusive manufacturer of our lead product, Amitiza; a historical product called Rescula for ophthalmology indications, which is really only available today in Japan; and one pipeline product we have in development, a product called cobiprostone.
"
908,AGN,"We had some historical tie-up in research and development, where we worked on some pipeline development. But today, while we have rights to some of the assets, we weren't currently engaged in some specific research collaborations with the company.
"
909,AGN,"The acquisition we set up as an accelerant to grow and transform the company. The strategic benefits are really threefold.
"
910,AGN,"One, it provides us an immediately accretive transaction. About a third of the economics (is) outside of what accrues to our partners, but a third of the economics accruing outside of our partners we would be acquiring. It brings significant financial benefit to the company: increased revenue, enhances our profitability and free cash flow, and our early projections — still to be adjusted based on our final financing terms — (call for) a near-doubling of EPS and income for the year to follow.
"
911,AGN,"We did give some guidance on what the financial results should look like: net income about $55 million to $60 million, EPS of about $1.20 to $1.30, and adjusted EBITDA (of) $95 million to $100 million. Those numbers are obviously significantly higher than where we are today. (Sucampo had EPS of 40 cents in 2014.)
"
912,AGN,"(Two), we get full control of supply chain and manufacturing, basically taking Sucampo from a company doing research and development — and producing revenue through our partners — to also having the benefit of controlling manufacturing. That helps us in two ways: one, it gives control, helps ensure that we have contiguous and continuous supply chain, helps us (in) management of risk; and second, operationally, it should provide us the opportunity to renegotiate contracts, to gain operational leverage, hopefully to continue to reduce our cost structure.
"
913,AGN,"Lastly, R-Tech Ueno had a lot of pipeline programs in this transaction. We're gaining several new assets across multiple new indications, and there's at least one of those that we're initially very excited about and could bring significant diversification and value to the company.
"
914,AGN,"IBD: Can you elaborate on the pipeline?
"
915,AGN,"Greenleaf: The R-Tech Ueno pipeline provides six new assets across multiple therapeutic areas. Those (include) gastroenterology, ophthalmology, an element of dermatology, autoimmune disease and oncology. Our initial diligence has told us that most of those assets will not meet our criteria to develop further, but they do have data up to certain phases of development — mostly in phase one, some in phase two. If we did not decide to develop those, we would either close them down, and they would appear as synergy in the deal, or we would decide to monetize them in some way by out-licensing them to other partners, either regional or global.
"
916,AGN,"There is one program — it's called a vascular adhesion protein inhibitor — that's currently being studied as an oral and as an IV formulation in autoimmune disease and in cancers, stroke and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). This is in pre-proof-of-concept development, but there's been a lot of interest across the pharmaceutical sector in this pathway and this inhibitor as a real potential solution in many autoimmune/inflammatory disorders.
"
917,AGN,"There have been a couple deals, most recently where Boehringer Ingelheim actually licensed a vascular adhesion protein inhibitor from a smaller company called Pharmaxis that's in the same stage of development, for an upfront $40 million to $50 million, and then earn-outs. So it shows there's some real interest from large pharma in this space. We're excited about the prospects.
"
918,AGN,"IBD: Does this have an impact on future deals? Are you still on the hunt for other assets?
"
919,AGN,"Greenleaf: Yeah, for sure. We've said in the past and will continue (to say), as part of our strategy, that we'll build the company both organically and inorganically, and that we'll continue to work to strengthen our pipeline as well as our financial performance as a company. So yes, we're still actively out there looking for opportunities in both the pipeline and in the commercial space.
"
920,AGN,"We're in the process of getting this one locked down — hopefully getting a successful tender offer. We've said publicly that we're using debt financing and cash on our balance sheet to finance, so that's in process. It's going to be a matter of what our debt financing looks like on the back end and how quickly we can deleverage that.
"
921,AGN,"There's so many different ways you can structure deals these days. It's not slowing us down, but to some degree we're digesting and starting the process toward getting the deal done and integrating it. While we want to do more deals, we're going to try to make this one a success first. We don't think that will take a long time, but we want to first get the deal done and start the base stage of integration.
"
922,AGN,"Do we think it's going to affect our ability to do other deals? I think a lot of that comes down to (the fact that) every deal's different; and size and structure, as well as what the deal will bring to us, are all factors that are very deal-specific. Management has no desire to have this slow us down in future deal flow.Biotech Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) has had a mostly good year, but it's preparing for a challenging future.

923,AGN,"Shares of specialty-drug giant Allergan (AGN) were seesawing Tuesday after the company issued guidance late Monday for the rest of the year following the sale of its generics business.

924,AGN,"Biotech Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) said Monday that it had reached a settlement with Actavis, the generic-drug arm of Allergan (AGN), agreeing that Actavis' generic version of Acorda's drug Ampyra won't come out until 2027. Acorda stock rose sharply while Allergan's fell.The news, which was revealed only through a terse SEC filing, came as a big surprise to Wall Street. Most had expected the generic version of Acorda's multiple-sclerosis drug to come sooner.""We and many investors have perceived Acorda as having little negotiating power to generate a favorable settlement,"" wrote Leerink analyst Paul Matteis in a research note Monday. ""The agreement that Actavis cannot market generic Ampyra until 2027 represents a best-case scenario for a settlement, in our view.""Ampyra provides virtually all of Acorda's current revenue, running at $437 million over the past 12 months, so Acorda stock responded favorably with a 12% spike to above 31 in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Allergan was down 3% near 279. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), which has agreed to acquire the Actavis business in a deal closing early next year, was down 3% near 58.""If the Ampyra franchise really does go out and have increased visibility to 2027, or anywhere in the 2020s, then the current $420 million Ampyra business should be worth more like comparables of four to five times sales, implying Ampyra could be a $1.6-2.0 billion equity value business or $35-44/share just for the MS indication alone,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note. ""Of course, the Phase III post-stroke indication would add significantly to this if that study is positive, given the potential to double sales.""However, Matteis pointed out that there are nine other generic drugmakers who've sued to make generic versions of Ampyra, so the business is hardly settled. He also wrote that it was possible that the Teva acquisition influenced the settlement more than the fundamental legal issues, especially since Teva itself was one of the other filers contesting the patent.""Eliminating one of two filings for Ampyra may be a strategic move ahead of FTC review/approval of the (Teva-Actavis) deal, or could be merely driven by a desire to save money and avoid redundant legal expenses,"" Matteis wrote. ""If this were the case, the readthrough onto other (filers) would be limited; however, we are unsure if this was a motivating factor.""Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

"
927,AGN,"Analysts expect social-media pioneer Facebook's third-quarter earnings per share to surge 21% from a year ago to 52 cents on revenue up 36% to $4.367 billion, both accelerations from the prior quarters.
"
928,AGN,"The company over the past year has made all its public posts searchable, tried to recast itself into a more news-centric site, and rapidly expanded in video for users and advertisers — developing an array of new video features to deepen user engagement.
"
929,AGN,"The site's users are viewing around 4 billion videos a day, Jefferies said in a research note last month, and the investment firm expects video ads to become a multibillion-dollar business over the next two years as digital ad formats become more expensive.
"
930,AGN,"""As video consumption explodes across FB's massive user base, we think FB looks well positioned to capture an increasing portion of TV ad budgets as marketers migrate toward data-driven, highly targeted online video ad campaigns,"" Jefferies said. The firm also said that Facebook app Instagram, with its ""beautiful visual layout"" and ""highly engaged audience"" would make for a good advertising environment.
"
931,AGN,"Shares closed down 0.7% to 102.58 in the stock market today.
"
932,AGN,"Upscale grocery chain Whole Foods has struggled with its ""whole paycheck"" reputation, allegations that it overcharged consumers and competition from traditional grocery chains like Kroger (KR), which have pushed more aggressively into Whole Foods' turf by offering higher-quality fare.
"
933,AGN,"Whole Foods in September said it would lay off 1,500 workers, partly to keep prices lower and invest in technology.
"
934,AGN,"Whole Foods is trying to draw younger shoppers with less disposable income by launching a new chain of stores called 365 by Whole Foods Market. Those stores are set to open next year.
"
935,AGN,"Analysts expect Whole Foods' Q4 EPS to fall around 3% to 34 cents. Sales are seen rising 7% to $3.470 billion, both slowing from the prior two quarters. Shares rose 1.1% to 31.27.

936,AGN,"Two media giants reporting Wednesday, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX), have been pressured by the rise of online programming from services like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video. Investors will be tuned into the companies' ad sales, subscriber figures, and other signs of how they've adapted to the digitization of television.
"
937,AGN,"Analysts see 21st Century Fox's Q1 EPS slipping 5% to 37 cents, with revenue edging down to $6.422 billion. Time Warner's Q3 EPS is expected to fall 12% on revenue up 4% to $6.512 billion.

"
940,AGN,"Botox maker Allergan's Q3 EPS is seen falling by a cent to $3.18. The Street forecasts sales rising 10% to $4.033 billion. That gain, while strong, pales in comparison to the prior quarter, when sales jumped 116% after Actavis acquired the company in March.

941,AGN,"Regeneron's third-quarter EPS is expected to leap 27% to 3.20, with sales lifting 45% to $1.054 billion.
"
942,AGN,"Regeneron's drug for failing eyesight, Eyelea, has propelled the company's growth. Its drug Praluent, an injectable PCSK9 inhibitor co-developed with Sanofi (SA), launched this summer.

945,AGN,"Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.Facebook (FB), Whole Foods Market (WFM) and 21st Century Fox are among the notable companies reporting quarterly results on Wednesday. Here's a look at what to expect.Analysts expect social-media pioneer Facebook's third-quarter earnings per share to surge 21% from a year ago to 52 cents on revenue up 36% to $4.367 billion, both accelerations from the prior quarters.The company over the past year has made all its public posts searchable, tried to recast itself into a more news-centric site, and rapidly expanded in video for users and advertisers — developing an array of new video features to deepen user engagement.The site's users are viewing around 4 billion videos a day, Jefferies said in a research note last month, and the investment firm expects video ads to become a multibillion-dollar business over the next two years as digital ad formats become more expensive.""As video consumption explodes across FB's massive user base, we think FB looks well positioned to capture an increasing portion of TV ad budgets as marketers migrate toward data-driven, highly targeted online video ad campaigns,"" Jefferies said. The firm also said that Facebook app Instagram, with its ""beautiful visual layout"" and ""highly engaged audience"" would make for a good advertising environment.Shares closed down 0.7% to 102.58 in the stock market today.Upscale grocery chain Whole Foods has struggled with its ""whole paycheck"" reputation, allegations that it overcharged consumers and competition from traditional grocery chains like Kroger (KR), which have pushed more aggressively into Whole Foods' turf by offering higher-quality fare.Whole Foods in September said it would lay off 1,500 workers, partly to keep prices lower and invest in technology.Whole Foods is trying to draw younger shoppers with less disposable income by launching a new chain of stores called 365 by Whole Foods Market. Those stores are set to open next year.Analysts expect Whole Foods' Q4 EPS to fall around 3% to 34 cents. Sales are seen rising 7% to $3.470 billion, both slowing from the prior two quarters. Shares rose 1.1% to 31.27.Two media giants reporting Wednesday, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX), have been pressured by the rise of online programming from services like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video. Investors will be tuned into the companies' ad sales, subscriber figures, and other signs of how they've adapted to the digitization of television.Analysts see 21st Century Fox's Q1 EPS slipping 5% to 37 cents, with revenue edging down to $6.422 billion. Time Warner's Q3 EPS is expected to fall 12% on revenue up 4% to $6.512 billion.Time Warner shares rose 1% to 77.30; Fox rose 1.4% to 31.28.Two pharmaceutical companies, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Allergan (AGN), also report Wednesday.Botox maker Allergan's Q3 EPS is seen falling by a cent to $3.18. The Street forecasts sales rising 10% to $4.033 billion. That gain, while strong, pales in comparison to the prior quarter, when sales jumped 116% after Actavis acquired the company in March.Regeneron's third-quarter EPS is expected to leap 27% to 3.20, with sales lifting 45% to $1.054 billion.Regeneron's drug for failing eyesight, Eyelea, has propelled the company's growth. Its drug Praluent, an injectable PCSK9 inhibitor co-developed with Sanofi (SA), launched this summer.A ""(special) focus is expected to be given to initial figures from the Praluent launch,"" Roth Capital Partners said of Regeneron's upcoming quarterly results. ""As we noted in our previous note, we expect a gradual launch, though we eventually expect Praluent and Repatha to achieve blockbuster status. We believe doctors will first look to optimize statin therapy and other modalities like Merck's (MRK) Zetia/Vytorin before moving to an injectable therapy.""Regeneron shares fell 0.2% to 578.

The Relative Strength line — which tracks the stock vs. the S&P 500 — has been hitting new highsJust as Facebook has expanded its presence abroad with buyouts, Starbucks has broadened its appeal beyond coffee drinkers with several nonjava acquisitions: tea seller Teavana, baked goods purveyor La Boulange and juice maker Evolution Fresh.Additionally, investing in mobile payment technology has paid off for the coffee giant, whose My Starbucks Rewards program has over 10 million members. RBC Capital Markets said last week that mobile payments accounted for over 20% of Starbucks' August sales, and adoption of its new Mobile Order & Pay feature is seen growing.Shares closed up 1.2% Wednesday. Starbucks also toughed out the recent selloff, and shares remain above their 50-day.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) has made over 100 acquisitions since merging with Biovail in 2010. The biotech failed to beat out Actavis in its battle for Botox parent Allergan (AGN), but it has not stopped shopping, acquiring gastrointestinal drug maker Salix Pharmaceuticals and sexual-health drug firm Addyi this year.Shares took a hit Monday following Hillary Clinton's ""price gouging"" tweet in which she said she would outline a plan to take on high drug prices in the specialty drug market.Valeant shares rallied 0.2%, remaining below their 50-day.Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), another 99-rated stock, announced in May the acquisition of CirroSecure, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) securer.Last year, Palo Alto also bought Morta Security and Tel Aviv-based Cyvera.

Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that the news not only cuts out the cUTI market but raises questions about the drug's approval timeline in complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI).""Given negative results from Ignite-2, we believe Tetraphase may need to run an additional Phase III trial,"" Somaiya wrote in his downgrade note, in which he lowered his price target to 10 from 54.Guggenheim analyst Louise Chen lowered her price target to 20 from 60 but maintained her buy rating. She was more confident than Somaiya that Tetraphase won't have to run another cIAI trial.""Three things give us confidence this could happen,"" Chen wrote in her research note.""1) Similar drugs have been approved with only Phase 2 data. According to Tetraphase, they have more data than these drugs.""2) Based on discussions with the FDA, Achaogen (AKAO) expects plazomicin to be approved for cUTI with only one successful trial.""And, 3) in the EU new antibiotic guidance requires only one trial for approval, and IAI and UTI were two of the five target infections noted by the agency.""Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

1090,AGN,"The Bausch & Lomb division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) announced positive late-stage trial results of a new glaucoma drug Thursday and projected it could sell more than $1 billion a year. Valeant popped over 6% in morning trading in the stock market today, though by early afternoon it was up just over 3%.Bausch & Lomb licensed the drug, Vesneo, from French biotech Nicox before it was acquired by Valeant last year. The two phase three studies compared Vesneo with standard treatment timolol maleate and found that Vesneo was better at reducing intraocular pressure, or excess fluid in the eyeball, in once-daily and twice-daily doses. The company said it plans to submit the drug for FDA approval by the middle of next year.In its press release, Valeant said the drug's peak annual sales could pass $500 million in the U.S. and $1 billion worldwide, which would make it a bona fide blockbuster.Valeant doesn't normally give drug sales guidance before approval, but it may be emphasizing its R&D bona fides in its hostile takeover attempt of Allergan (AGN). One of Allergan's main reasons for resisting Valeant's overtures — apart from valuation — is the fear that Valeant will decimate Allergan's R&D.On Thursday, Allergan issued an official response to the correspondence between the Valeant and Allergan CEOs that Valeant released to the press, which included Valeant's assertion that its Q3 results will beat expectations. Allergan's statement talked up its own financials and said it will soldier on in the face of shareholder/Valeant partner William Ackman's lawsuit threats should it succeed in buying Salix Pharmaceuticals (SLXP) to spoil the takeover attempt.Also on Thursday, Valeant said ValueAct Capital CEO Jeffrey Ubben is joining its board on Oct. 1. This underscored ValueAct's commitment to the company, as ValueAct President Mason Morfit left the board in May to join the board of Microsoft (MSFT) and to enable his company to sell Valeant shares.On Thursday, Ubben said ValueAct has not reduced its position in Valeant, and in fact plans to increase it.Allergan's stock popped 2% to a new high of 179.59 Thursday morning, but by early afternoon was down a fraction from Wednesday's close.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_AReeves.

Valeant stock fell nearly 7% after its earnings report and has slipped further since, though it was up 1.5% midday Friday.Allergan, by contrast, earlier issued a strong Q2 earnings report and a cost-cutting plan, which perhaps sparked doubts that the deal will get done.""In our opinion, AGN's weakness is likely driven more by technical and arbitrage-related trading, and we recommend buying shares today,"" Fernandez wrote. ""We see little if any weakness in AGN's business from the VRX bid, view the planned restructuring by management as overdue, and believe 2015 EPS (of more than) $8.20 a share is achievable without using its balance sheet.""Despite its recent decline, Allergan's stock retains a stellar IBD Composite Rating of 98.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

But Salix, which makes medicine for gastrointestinal problems, is merging with a unit of Italy's Cosmo Pharmaceuticals as part of a tax-inversion deal.It's not clear if Allergan would buy the Cosmo unit as well or if Allergan would use the deal as an inversion, the process of moving a company's headquarters overseas to capture cheaper tax rates, the Journal said.Allergan shares rose 4% on the stock market today.

In July, Allergan announced that it would cut its work force by 13%. Analysts said that the job cuts would make it harder for Valeant to show that its merger proposal adds incremental value to the company.Allergan has called Valeant's business model unsustainable and said that a deal with Valeant would hurt its research and development program.Valeant and activist investor William Ackman, who owns a large stake in Valeant, have been angling for a takeover since April.

1233,AGN,"Allergan's (AGN) blockbuster eye drug, Restasis, could outperform expectations this year, an analyst said Monday as she boosted her price target on the stock.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler raised her price target on Allergan stock to 194 from 176, though she kept her neutral rating. Koffler cited bullish views for Restasis sales in 2018 and longer-term expectations for Botox and Vraylar, a depression drug. But, there are still unknowns for other drugs, she said.""The stock has been edging higher and we pulled the model out an additional three years 2025 to assess if we are missing something in the story,"" Koffler said in a report to clients. ""Indeed, we found additional value, especially if management can remain disciplined about (operational expenses).""Koffler expects Restasis sales to be $278 million, $264 million and $136 million for the next three quarters.

Meanwhile, Botox sales look strong longer term and Vraylar could grab approvals to treat more forms of depression.After 2018, Koffler's model lags the consensus which is likely running on the assumption the firm can grow at a 5% compounded annual rate from 2017-22. But Koffler sees only 2% growth over that time period. She has conservative views on Allergan's pipeline and international segment.Koffler doesn't ascribe any value to Allergan's ability to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a form of liver disease. She also has modest expectations for new eye drugs and a treatment for a digestive disorder. Further, the consensus may be missing patent cliffs for two drugs in 2021-22.Investors could be open to management turnover and restructuring attempts. Koffler, though, worries that Allergan could engage in risky mergers and acquisitions. At the same time, she sees Allergan's efforts to sell its women's health and anti-infection units as neutral to its valuation.""However, we don't expect the company to be acquired and there is still significant uncertainty about capital deployment, and whether management will pursue risky or expensive (mergers and acquisitions) or opt for a more conservative debt repayment strategy,"" she said.If Allergan goes the more conservative route for debt repayment, ""we could see an additional bump in the stock,"" she said.On the stock market today, Allergan rose 1.3% at the closing bell, to 176.84.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

A sale would allow Allergan to focus on four key segments: medical aesthetics, central nervous system, gastrointestinal and eye care.But the firm isn't feeling pressure to sell, Saunders said.""It takes another party to consummate a deal,"" he said during a conference hosted by Bernstein.

Samsung/Biogen and Teva/Celltrion already have their copies on the market in Europe.Herceptin is a major cash cow for Roche. In 2017, it brought in $7.01 billion in sales, just behind fellow cancer drug Rituxan/MabThera, which generated $7.39 billion. Of Herceptin's sales, $2.1 billion stemmed from Europe.Roche is working feverishly to push back against competition for Herceptin. Last year, Roche sued Dow Jones component Pfizer to block it from selling its Herceptin biosimilar in the U.S. Roche's Genentech unit said Pfizer's Herceptin biosimilar would infringe on 40 of its patents.Some of its patents on Herceptin will begin expiring in 2019, Bloomberg reported.On the stock market today, Roche stock rallied 2.1% to close at 27.38, after hitting a five-year closing low on Thursday.

1242,AGN,"Japan's Takeda Pharmaceuticals clinched the $62 billion acquisition of Shire (SHPG) early Tuesday after a six-week tussle between the two companies in which Allergan (AGN) also was briefly interested in a possible merger.If approved, it will be the largest overseas purchase by a Japanese company, according to Dealogic. Dealogic says that with debt, the deal is worth $81.5 billion. Takeda will add its roughly $33 billion market cap to Shire's, which is north of $49 billion. The new Takeda will be close in size to Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly (LLY).RBC analyst Douglas Miehm said the deal alleviates some concerns, notably that the Japanese drugmaker could de-lever sufficiently and that its dividend will remain intact. The firm expects to general annual pretax cost synergies of $1.4 billion by the end of the third year.""We do anticipate the deal spread to remain wider than normal given the complexity of the transaction requiring approval in various geographies, ability to realize synergies, especially R&D (research and development) and long-dated closing date,"" he said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe total deal is consistent with Takeda's fifth proposal and values Dublin-based Shire at 49.01 pounds, or about $66.21, per share. All together, Takeda will pay 46 billion pounds, or roughly $62.1 billion. The companies expect the deal to close in the first half of 2019.Under the terms of the deal, Shire shareholders will receive $30.33 in cash and either 0.839 new Takeda shares or 1.678 Takeda American depositary receipts for each Shire share. When the deal wraps, Shire shareholders will own 50% of the new Takeda.Takeda's new shares will also trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.RBC's Miehm noted that the acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive to earnings from the first full fiscal year following the close. It's also expected to provide a return on interest above Takeda's cost of capital over the same time period.Takeda confirmed that it still needs approval from two-thirds of its existing shareholders. But it is confident it can get those votes, Miehm said. To pay for the acquisition, Takeda entered into a bridge credit agreement — a type of loan — for $30.85 billion.Miehm kept his outperform rating on Shire stock. On the stock market today, Shire rose 1.5% to close at 163.73. That, and first-quarter outperformance from Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), didn't help drug stocks more broadly, though, which dipped 0.3%.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

1243,AGN,"In a rapid turnaround, Allergan (AGN) said late Thursday it doesn't intend to bid on Shire (SHPG) — leaving thrice-rebuffed Takeda Pharmaceuticals alone in the race for the rare disease drugmaker.The entire saga erupted early Thursday when reports emerged Allergan might be interested in buying Shire. About the same time, Shire confirmed it had rejected three bids from Takeda with one worth north of $61 billion.Allergan first said it was in the early stages of a potential bid on Shire. Hours — and a stock plunge later — Allergan said it definitively won't make an offer to take over Shire. Meanwhile, it's still ""evaluating a full range of potential strategic options,"" Allergan said in a news release.Shares of Allergan closed down 4.2%, at 158.59, and were flat in after-hours trading on the stock market today. Shire sank 1.1%, to 160.74 at the closing bell.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeculation about a Shire-Takeda merger has been swirling since late March. Since then, Takeda has made three bids on Shire. In each case, Shire's board determined the bids ""significantly undervalue"" the firm's growth prospects and pipeline.Takeda confirmed it put forth a buyout bid for Shire worth about $66 per share, comprised of cash and stock. Both firms say they are willing to continue negotiating. Still, Takeda is confident it ""remains well positioned"" even if negotiations fall through.""Building on Takeda's existing momentum, the acquisition of Shire would accelerate its transformation and result in a global, value-based R&D-driven biopharmaceutical leader headquartered in Japan,"" Takeda said in a prepared statement.The short-lived interest from Allergan came as a surprise, Leerink analyst Etzer Darout said in a note. The firm has said it could become acquisitive and is looking at strategic options.""A combination with Shire introduces some growth challenges in out-years, which are reflected in the negative stock reaction,"" he said.Shire is likely to face erosion of attention deficit hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse beginning in 2023 and significant erosion of its hemophilia business as it competes with rival Roche (RHHBY). Allergan would have had to justify the bid to its shareholders, he said.The Shire interest comes amid a flurry of biotech acquisitions that kicked off earlier this year when Celgene (CELG) announced its plan to buy Juno Therapeutics and Sanofi (SNY) unveiled plans to acquire Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).Novartis (NVS) sold its share of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) consumer health unit for $13 billion and used part of the proceeds to fund its $8.7 billion plan to acquire AveXis (AVXS). Merck KGaA agreed to sell its over-the-counter unit to Proctor & Gamble (PG), days after it was rumored Mylan (MYL) might buy it.Earlier this week, Shire said it would sell it cancer unit to France's Servier for $2.4 billion.Analysts have speculated that Celgene could also be on the lookout for more acquisitions with Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) and Jounce Therapeutics (JNCE) as potential targets. Amgen (AMGN) also has a huge war chest and is facing competition for its older medicines.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

1244,AGN,"Mylan (MYL) shares rebounded Thursday following worries that first-quarter sales would lag based on tough year-over-year comparisons for allergy drug EpiPen.Those concerns stemmed from commentary during Mylan's investor day, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said. On Wednesday, Mylan reiterated its 2018 guidance, but called for tough comparisons for first-quarter adjusted profit and sales of EpiPen.""Management indicated that the first half of 2017 contained some nontrivial amount of branded EpiPen sales that may result in slightly tougher comps in the first half of 2018,"" Koffler wrote in a note to clients.Koffler now expects adjusted income in the first quarter to account for 16.7% of full-year profit, down from 20% in the year-earlier period.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We therefore pushed sales and earnings further to the second half of 2018,"" she said. ""If Mylan cane get through at least one of its larger approvals expected this summer, we think investors would get more constructive on execution and guidance.""She urged investors to buy Wednesday's dip, when shares closed down 2.7%. Investors listened. On the stock market today, Mylan climbed 2.2% to close at 41.26.For 2018, Mylan still expects to report $11.75 billion to $13.25 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $5.20-$5.60 per share. The sales guide is slightly above the consensus for $12.42 billion. At the midpoint, the adjusted profit view is just north of analysts for $5.38.Mylan expects its first-quarter adjusted profit share of full-year earnings to be about 3 base points lower than last year. The firm also expects higher interest expense following recent debt financing, Koffler said.But Koffler has a buy rating and 51 price target on Mylan.""We think the stock is undervalued,"" she said.The firm recently launched a generic copycat of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone. It views that as a gradual ramp over time, Koffler said.The firm also has key approvals coming this year, including generic versions of Amgen's (AMGN) bone marrow stimulant Neulasta, GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) inhaler Advair and Allergan's (AGN) eye disease drug Restasis.""Management noted FDA may ask for additional clarifications on its Advair application even though all formal information requests have been completed, which led to investor concern about another approval delay,"" Koffler said. ""Management noted that Advair was a 'when, and not if' story.""Mylan is also working with Theravance Biopharma (TBPH) on a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a condition of the lungs. The Food and Drug Administration is likely to make a decision on that drug in November.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsLooking For The Next Nvidia?

1245,AGN,"Tiny biotech CymaBay (CBAY) launched to a high not seen in a month Wednesday after unveiling strong data for a liver disease treatment — to the detriment of Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), which has struggled with its rival drug.On the stock market today, shares of CymaBay soared 11.4% to close at 13.44, after earlier rocketing as much as 24.3%. Meanwhile, Intercept sank 6.6% to 70.11. Biotech stocks collectively advanced 0.2%.CymaBay is testing a drug called seladelpar as a second treatment option for a liver disease known as primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz noted the results so far compare favorably with Intercept's drug, Ocaliva.""We continue to view seladelpar as an attractive agent (as a second treatment option in) PBC despite Ocaliva's advantage of earlier market entry,"" Schwartz said in a note to clients. He raised his expectations for seladelpar's success to 75% from a prior view of 60%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSeladelpar was tested in patients who had abnormally high levels of the enzyme alkaline phosphate. At 12 weeks, patients treated with 2-milligram, 5-milligram and 10-milligram doses of seladelpar saw their alkaline phosphate levels cut by 21%, 33% and 45%, respectively.At 26 weeks, patients who received 5-10 milligrams of CymaBay's drug had alkaline phosphate reductions of 43% to 45%. Overall, 29% of patients had normal alkaline phosphate levels at 26 weeks.The drug wasn't associated with any itching that sometimes can occur with PBC, CymaBay said in a news release. Patients in the 10-milligram dose group saw a 24% decrease in itching at week 26, suggesting the drug could have anti-itching activity.Importantly, the lack of liver toxicity is a ""huge plus,"" Schwartz said. That was a concern after patients taking Intercept's Ocaliva experienced liver injury or died. Intercept argued the patients were receiving inappropriately high doses of Ocaliva.CymaBay noted chronic doses of 2-10 milligrams of seladelpar didn't lead to liver toxicity. This means physicians should be able to adjust patients' doses without worry of liver injury or death, Schwartz said.""With Ocaliva's recent resolution to its FDA label, investors have grown particularly cautious on liver toxicity for PBC drugs,"" he said. ""Today's update should quell such concerns.""The firm is now on track to begin a Phase 3 study in the second half of 2018. CymaBay expects to test the 5-milligram and 10-milligram doses of seladelpar in the study. Schwartz also sees CymaBay grabbing success with seladelpar into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a liver disease.CymaBay is now in midstage testing with seladelpar in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. Other players in the NASH drug race include Intercept, Gilead Sciences (GILD), Shire (SHPG), Allergan (AGN) and Novartis (NVS).RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1246,AGN,"Biohaven Pharmaceuticals (BHVN) cratered by a third early Monday after it unveiled the results of two late-stage trials for its migraine drug, a competitor to an investigational therapy from Allergan (AGN).The drug, called rimegepant, was tested as a treatment for acute migraine. In two Phase 3 trials, rimegepant met its key goal of pain freedom and freedom from the worst symptoms at the two-hour mark. Numerically, though, Allergan's drug had a slight advantage.Piper Jaffray analyst Charles Duncan warned investors against losing the forest for the trees. The effectiveness data show rimegepant is approvable and clinically meaningful, he said in a note to clients. Further, rimegepant continued to improve after the two-hour mark.""We are encouraged to see the delta between rimegepant and the placebo widen past the two-hour time point even without repeat dosing or adjunctive therapy/rescue meds, which to us suggests the candidate is differentiated by prevention of recurrence and lack of any rebound effect,"" he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe sees Biohaven's rimegepant as a $1 billion drug. He models peak sales of $1.3 billion in 2030.Still, in morning trading on the stock market today, Biohaven fell as much as 33.3% to a low of 16.51. That was below the stock's initial public offering last May at 17. Biohaven ended the regular session Monday down 7.4% to 22.92. Allergan rose 0.5% to 160.21.Between the two trials, 19.6% and 19.2% of patients who received a single 75-milligram dose of Biohaven's drug rimegepant — without repeat dosing or rescue medicines like triptans — were pain free at the two-hour mark vs. 12% and 14.2% of patients who received a placebo.Of those who received rimegepant, 37.6% and 36.6% were free of their worst symptoms at the two-hour point vs. 25.2% and 27.7% of patients who received the placebo.Investors were keyed in to how this would compare vs. Allergan's drug, ubrogepant. Both drugs belong to a class of medicines called anti-CGRPs which aim to block a specific peptide associated with migraines. Biohaven and Allergan's drugs are both being tested orally.Allergan's ubrogepant was tested as 50-milligram and 100-milligram doses, allowing for repeat doses and rescue medicines. After two hours, 19.2% and 21.2% of patients were pain-free vs. 11.8% of placebo patients. The worst symptoms disappeared in 38.6% and 37.7% of patients vs. 27.8% in the placebo group.But ubrogepant patients had liver issues whereas rimegepant didn't. In Allergan's trial, there were six patients whose liver function rose greater than three times the upper limit of normal. A safety board said none of those cases had a probable relationship to the drug.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges still expects Allergan's ubrogepant to be competitive. Generic triptans make up about 90% of acute migraine prescriptions. But for 75% of patients, they carry severe warnings and about 30%-40% of patients don't respond to triptans.Further, he notes resolution on the liver worries for ubrogepant won't be resolved until long-term safety studies for Allergan's drug are available in the second half of 2018.Rimegepant and ubrogepant differ from other anti-CGRP drugs being investigated which aim to prevent migraines. Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis (NVS) are in the lead on that front. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) are also working on these drugs.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

On Tuesday, the L.A. Times reported that Allergan co-founder Gavin Herbert spoke against it at the annual shareholders' meeting, warning that Valeant would decimate Allergan's research-and-development budget. This came a day after activist investor William Ackman, who's joined with Valeant in the bid, said Allergan's attempt to find a better buyer would likely be fruitless.Nonetheless, Allergan said it is reviewing the $47 billion offer. Valeant's attempt has certainly driven up Allergan's stock price, which hit an all-time high of 170.05 on May 1. In early trading Monday it was near 166, with a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Alnylam fell 2.6%, near 142.50, after breaking out of a consolidation earlier this month at a 147.73 buy point. Regeneron fell 2.1% to 327.69. Biotech stocks were up a small fraction.The deal between Alnylam and Regeneron is based on Regeneron's discovery of a variation in the HSD17B13 gene which is tied to reduced risk of, or protection from, various chronic liver diseases, the firm said in a press release.Regeneron's findings stem from a large-scale human genetics effort undertaken by the Regeneron Genetics Center. The new potential therapeutic target could be used to trim the risk of, or halt the progression of, some chronic liver diseases.Alnylam and Regeneron plan to look at potential treatments for a disease known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in which the liver suffers damage similar to that caused by alcohol. Patients are often obese or have type 2 diabetes.They plan to use Alnylam's expertise in RNA interference to target the HSD17B13 gene. RNA interference allows researchers to specifically target and silence any gene involved in the cause or pathway of human disease.Piper Jaffray's Tenthoff says the collaboration could expand into a co-development or co-commercialization deal.

1358,AGN,"Finding the best biotech companies to invest in can be tricky as volatility often pockmarks the space. Clinical plans don't always come to fruition and sometimes biotech stocks can suffer at the hands of regulatory decisions from the Food and Drug Administration.But the best biotech companies to invest in tend to have a commonality: A strong streak of earnings growth. As of June 2018, Investor's Business Daily's MarketSmith.com has two biotech stocks among a 150-strong list of the fastest growing stocks.Near the top of the list of fastest growing stocks, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) is ranked eighth. Over the past five years, its earnings per share have grown a massive 147%, compared to 319% for the top-earning stock, Momo (MOMO), a Chinese social media firm.Supernus has made a name for itself among biotech stocks. Though in terms of market cap it still trails bigger biotech companies like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG). But Supernus lands itself on the list you might consider as the best biotech companies to invest in for strong metrics. As always, do your research before buying any stock, and be sure to check the company's stock chart to make sure it's the right time to buy.It has several years of double-digit quarterly sales growth with drugs that help disorders of the central nervous system. Among those, Supernus counts epilepsy drugs Oxtellar XR (extended-release) and Trokendi XR.Trokendi XR is also approved to prevent migraines. It rivals drugs like Botox from Allergan (AGN) and Amgen's Aimovig.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) is unique among biotech stocks. Though IBD ranks it No. 144 out of 150 of the fastest growing stocks — which might put it on your research list for the possible best biotech companies to invest in — it doesn't market a single drug.Instead, Ligand acquires early-stage technologies necessary for drug development. It then licenses these platforms out to pharmaceutical companies like Dow Jones stocks Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE). As of June 2018, Ligand has a year of both double-digit sales and earnings growth under its belt.Ligand and Supernus both have IBD Composite Ratings of 99, meaning they perform in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

1359,AGN,"A migraine prevention treatment from Eli Lilly (LLY) faces an uphill battle against Amgen (AMGN) which, late Thursday, had strong results from long-term studies of its approved medicine.Both Amgen and Lilly have migraine prevention drugs called anti-CGRPs. These drugs work by blocking a specific peptide associated with migraines. Amgen's drug, Aimovig, grabbed approval in May, but Lilly's is fast approaching approval, likely in September.Although Allergan's (AGN) Botox is well known as a treatment for wrinkles and facial lines, it has other uses in excessive sweating, urinary incontinence and to prevent migraines. On Wednesday, Lilly showed that its drug, called Emgality, can benefit patients for whom Botox didn't prevent migraines.But RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay doesn't expect the study to ""substantially impact positioning in the marketplace.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We do find the post-Botox analysis to provide a unique perspective and marketing point for Emgality with the physicians who have established familiarity with Botox and the estimated 50% of patients that may step through Botox to CGRP therapy,"" he said in a report.On the stock market today, Lilly advanced 1% at the closing bell, to 85.49. Amgen sank 0.1%, to 183.34. Shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies each rose a fraction.Late Wednesday, Lilly said Emgality benefited some patients for whom Botox didn't work to prevent migraines.Lilly tested its anti-CGRP at 120-milligram and 240-milligram doses in patients who failed on Botox as a migraine prevention treatment. On average, 41.3% and 47.5%, respectively, saw their migraine days per month cut in half.""These data are compelling given that Botox is a commonly used agent in the prophylactic treatment paradigm for migraine, and could potentially be required as a step-through therapy prior to treatment with the CGRP class,"" RBC's MacKay said.But Lilly will continue to face an uphill battle against Amgen, MacKay said. U.S. officials approved Aimovig in May. The drug already has an established safety and effectiveness profile. It also beat rivals Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) to market.""We expect that Aimovig will continue to benefit from their first-to-market status,"" he said.But MacKay doesn't expect Aimovig to completely fill the revenue hole Amgen faces amid a growing list of challenges for its legacy products. Notably, three of Amgen's drugs are facing potential competition from biosimilars, nearly identical drugs.Further, Amgen partners with Novartis (NVS) on Aimovig, meaning it will have to share sales.Amgen is more bullish, though. The biotech released results on Wednesday of a survey of 11,000 patients who experience at least four migraines per month. Six in 10 respondents said they missed at least a week of work each month due to migraines.Effective migraine prevention could help ease an estimated $22 billion annually in economic cost, Amgen said. About half of that is due to lost productivity. Additional data show patients are often reluctant to admit suffering from a migraine.This suggests the ""already extremely large market could see potential upside beyond the incident and prevalent populations estimated in medical literature, as well as the numbers underpinning assumptions in our model,"" MacKay said.MacKay estimates that there are 2.4 million chronic and 4.3 million episodic migraine patients in the U.S.""However, despite potential for the migraine market to be significantly larger vs. established literature, we see (Amgen's) base business erosion creating a significant/challenging revenue hole to fill, especially given Aimovig revenues are shared with partner Novartis,"" he said.Late Thursday, Amgen said Aimovig was tested for a year in chronic migraine patients. The biotech also took an interim look at data three years into an ongoing five-year study in episodic migraine patients. Researchers tested patients at doses of 140 milligrams and 70 milligrams.On average, patients saw their migraine day per month decline by a respective 10.5 days and 8.5 days. Monthly migraine days declined by half for 67% and 53% of patients, respectively. Those days also dropped by three-quarters in 42% and 27% of patients, respectively.Just 13% of patients on the 14-milligram dose and 6% of patients on the 70-milligram dose had no migraine days.""These data showing sustained (effectiveness) and consistent safety and tolerability of Aimovig over an extended period of time are important for migraine patients and their clinicians to know,"" Stewart Tepper, professor of neurology at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School, said in a prepared statement.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

1360,AGN,"When Kris Bakowski was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2002, the Georgia resident felt relieved to finally put a name to the fog that was slowly enveloping her brain, even if there was no viable Alzheimer's treatment.For months, she would forget her own phone number. She had trouble with colleagues' names. Mapping out her route home from work became a chore. One day she found herself alone at the mall without any recollection where she was or how she got there.Biopharma companies believe they might be able to help soon. Analysts say Biogen (BIIB) could be first to crack the code on a disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment that slows the disease's progression. Indeed, Biogen and Tokyo-based Eisai announced late Thursday that Phase 2 tests on their Alzheimer's drug slowed progression of the disease after 18 months. The news sent Biogen stock soaring by more than 23% at one point Friday.Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN) and others also are developing potential Alzheimer's drugs, along with a number of development-stage biotech companies.Victory is not certain, though. A number of Big Pharma companies, including Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), have been down this road and abandoned planned Alzheimer's treatments. But at least one expert sees success in the next decade, which wouldn't come too soon for Bakowski and other Alzheimer's patients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBakowski, now 62, has been blogging about her Alzheimer's experience for 15 years. In a blog post for the Alzheimer's Association, she describes the eight months of testing that led to her diagnosis and subsequent relief. She's hopeful for a cure in her son's lifetime, but her family isn't so optimistic.""My husband likened it to the Titanic — that the ship was sinking, and he and my son were going to survive and I wasn't,"" she wrote. ""My son reflected that it was like his mother was on death row, but innocent of the crime.""The potential Alzheimer's market is massive. An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. Without a way to intervene, the Alzheimer's Association expects the cost of caring for people with these diseases to hit $1.1 trillion by 2050, in today's dollars. That would be up from an estimated $277 billion in 2018.But, like Bakowski, many experts are hopeful.Privately held Proclara Biosciences is among a cadre of biotech companies aiming to develop an Alzheimer's treatment. Chief Medical Officer David Michelson calls the field ""pretty vibrant.""Michelson, who has held positions at Merck and Lilly, says the steady drumbeat of ""bad news"" in Alzheimer's treatments reflects not so much a failure to affect their specific targets in the brain but issues such as side effects in specific tests. He recently spoke during a webinar hosted by Endpoints News.""There's a lot of really tremendous work that's ongoing and it's enabling new approaches that are becoming possible and generating promising new targets,"" he said. ""I am actually very hopeful and optimistic about what the next five to 10 years hold for research in Alzheimer's.""Several drugs have been approved in the U.S. to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type, including Aricept from Eisai and Namenda from Allergan (AGN). Both treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Neither can cure the disease.Elliot Goldstein, chief executive of ProMIS Neurosciences, can count these types of treatment on one hand. None of them slow the progression of the disease, he told Investor's Business Daily. ProMIS is also working on an Alzheimer's treatment. It trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange for under 1 and doesn't have any sales or earnings yet. Goldstein previously worked at Novartis, which is also developing Alzheimer's drugs.Biogen's strongest hope is a drug now dubbed aducanumab. Goldstein predicts the drug will come to market in 2020.""Aducanumab has a high potential of approval because it has showed a small improvement on decline"" of patients into Alzheimer's symptoms, he said.Biogen did not respond to a request for comment for this article.Visit the IBD Stock Checkup to see how Biogen rates now on key fundamental and technical metrics.In total, Biogen has six potential Alzheimer's treatments in its pipeline. Aducanumab is farthest along, with a late-stage study likely to have data in 2019 or 2020, analysts say.Biogen and Eisai's Thursday announcement involved another drug known as BAN2401. Tests involved 856 patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer's. The companies said the drug, an antibody, achieved ""statistical significance on key predefined endpoints"" that evaluated effectiveness at 18 months. Biogen stock jumped 19.6% to close at 357.48 but had surged to an intraday high of 367.89 for a gain of 23.1% at one point.Still, it's a messy field. Biogen stock plunged 6.6% on Valentine's Day this year after it added 510 new patients to an ongoing study of aducanumab. That move caught investors off-guard. Also that week, Merck scrapped a late-stage Alzheimer's treatment study as the risks looked likely to outweigh benefits.""It can be a volatile area,"" Canaccord analyst Sumant Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily. ""There have been very spectacular failures in the past. There's a component of the investor who thinks, 'What if the next one works?' That can help from a stock point of view.""Then again, he said, ""Nothing else has worked in the past.""The trouble in Alzheimer's treatment research is that scientists aren't exactly sure what causes the disease. One prevailing theory ties the disease to the buildup of toxic plaque in the brain. That happens when a protein called beta-amyloid structurally changes. Beta-amyloid is sticky and clumps together, becoming plaque.Pharmaceutical companies are looking at two approaches to beta-amyloid that essentially boil down to either removing it or preventing it. BACE inhibitors work to prevent the buildup, while monoclonal antibodies — like Biogen's aducanumab — aim to remove it.ProMIS' Goldstein notes adverse events also must be sidestepped. Some Alzheimer's treatments come with a side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. This refers to swelling in the brain. Goldstein says ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment, set to begin clinical studies in 2019, doesn't cause that.But Mizuho analyst Salim Syed says it's possible to help patients get past ARIA. A common idiom of the industry is, ""If you don't get ARIA, are you really treating the plaque?"" he told IBD.Then, there's the trouble of determining whether a study is designed well, Proclara's Michelson says. First, evidence must show the drug engaged the intended target, like beta-amyloid. Second, patients must be proven to actually have Alzheimer's. Third, the study must be big and of appropriate duration.""It turns out when you look back across history, there aren't that many studies and that many drugs that have been studied in a way that really fulfills all three of these elements,"" he said.He argues that only two studies have hit all three design goals. They are Merck's now-failed BACE inhibitor known as verubecestat and Biogen's aducanumab.In February, Merck scrapped a study of its Alzheimer's treatment in patients with prodromal, or very early-stage, Alzheimer's disease. A year earlier, it said the same drug had ""virtually no chance of finding a positive effect"" in patients with mild or moderate forms of the disease.Meanwhile, the field is thinning. J&J stopped a midstage test of a BACE inhibitor in a group of patients in May because of liver safety concerns. In January, Pfizer (PFE) stopped all research in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment failure in late 2016 was acutely painful for the company. Its monoclonal antibody called solanezumab lost out in three late-stage studies. The last study was in patients with a mild form of Alzheimer's.ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment binds to several toxic misfolded proteins causing Alzheimer's, Goldstein says. It functions on the theory that there are other targets in Alzheimer's disease outside of beta-amyloid. Some drugs are also testing the theory that tangles of a protein called tau could be the root cause.Privately held United Neurosciences hopes to come in with a vaccine for Alzheimer's. The goal is to use the drug as both a treatment for early Alzheimer's and as a preventive measure. Physicians must administer the drug before ""it's too late to rescue the brain,"" United Neurosciences Chief Medical Officer Ajay Verma told Investor's Business Daily.Verma's background is at Biogen, where he directed the development of drugs, including aducanumab. Before that, he was at Merck and Novartis.Verma expects aducanumab to get approval. Several sell-side analysts model around a 35% likelihood that aducanumab can appease the Food and Drug Administration.But Verma sees a possibility that aducanumab could be expensive, since it would be the first treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. ""I think the challenge is, will it be a solution or just for the rich?"" he said.Verma ultimately expects the solution to treating Alzheimer's disease to lie in combinations of drugs. That's been key in treating cancer, HIV, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and high cholesterol, he says.Without intervention, the number of Alzheimer's patients will triple by 2050, James Hendrix said in Endpoints News' webinar. Hendrix is the director of global science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association.""We need better therapies and we need them sooner rather than later,"" Hendrix said.But Alzheimer's treatment studies are tricky, United Neurosciences' Verma says. A barrier between the blood and the brain makes getting a drug to the brain difficult. Plus, animal models aren't particularly predictive, and studies must run for long periods of time.Further complicating matters, science isn't sure which stage is the best to treat.Those reasons are at the center of a 0.5% approval rate from the FDA for Alzheimer's treatments, according to a 2015 paper presented by Hendrix. The industry average is 4.1%.Research is improving, though, Hendrix says. Scientists are aware of the potential impact of beta-amyloid and tau, as well as a number of approaches targeting different stages. In the end, it could be enough for an Alzheimer's treatment to just delay the beginning of the disease by several years, he says.""It might be possible to delay the onset for us to die of something else,"" he said.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Forecast For The Next Six Months: What You Should ExpectHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

Shares touched their lowest point since October 2013. Meanwhile, Mylan stock weathered its soft quarter and guidance, rising 0.9% to 40.69, on the Botox announcement.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in a note to clients that Mylan and Revance are likely several years from the market with a Botox copy. Still, the downside effect on Allergan is undeniable, she said.Botox accounted for nearly 20% of Allergan's sales in 2017. Allergan sells Botox as a cosmetic drug to treat age lines around the forehead, eyes and mouth. Botox as a therapeutic also treats a number of conditions including excess sweating and chronic migraines.""It may create an immediate overhang on Allergan's reimbursed therapeutic franchise and its future outlook,"" Koffler wrote. ""We are less concerned about cosmetic pressure because we aren't expecting Mylan to invest in a dedicated sales force, but we still expect those fears to weigh on the stock.""Mylan is paying Revance $25 million upfront. Revance is also eligible for up to $100 million in clinical and regulatory milestones and up to $225 million in sales-based milestones, Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said in a note to clients.The deal helps Revance monetize its expertise in botulinum toxin — the active ingredient in Botox, Amsellem said. He calls the deal with Mylan a ""form of downside protection"" for the drug known as RT002, an injectable neuromodulator like Botox.""Put another way, this is a way for Revance to participate in a wider chunk of the botulinum toxin market in the context of a declining pricing environment (whether due to other brand botulinum toxin products or Botox biosimilars or both),"" he said.Revance has said its first goal is to have RT002 approved as a cosmetic treatment for frown lines, though it eventually expects to go after therapeutic indications, Mizuho's Koffler said.Allergan also said late Wednesday the Food and Drug Administration pushed back its review of an application for a drug called ulipristal acetate until August ""to provide a full review of the file."" Ulipristal acetate is being considered to treat bleeding in women with uterine fibroids.The drug already sells in Europe and Canada as Esmya and Fibristal.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

Adjusted profit of $1.43 per share declined 9%, though it topped the average view of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $1.41 a share.North America segment third-party net sales declined 17% to $1.3 billion. Sales of EpiPens, which treat emergency allergic reactions, decreased by $131.9 million after the launch of an authorized generic and higher governmental rebates following a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice.But Europe segment sales climbed 16% to $1.07 billion and revenue from the rest of the world grew 12% to $815.7 million.For 2018, Mylan guided to adjusted profit of $5.20-$5.60 per share on $11.75 billion to $13.25 billion in total revenue. The consensus had expected adjusted earnings of $5.34 per share and $12.64 billion in sales.Mylan also announced it signed a license agreement with Revance Therapeutics (RVNC) to bring a biosimilar of Botox to the market.

1363,AGN,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is taking an ""overly optimistic"" long-term view of its business, an analyst said after the firm offered a mixed fourth-quarter report and called for 2018 to be a down year.X Guidance for 2018 sales of $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion — vs. analyst views for $8.38 billion — is conservative given it reflects the potential Valeant's ulcerative colitis drugs Apriso and Uceris will lose exclusivity, Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said.But Valeant's guidance for U.S. dermatology business to double by 2022 vs. 2017 is likely ""overly rosy,"" Amsellem said in a note to clients. He doubted Valeant's call for 2018 to be a trough year. The picture only worsens in 2020 with significant debt maturing, he said.""Though it is not lost on us that Valeant has a brisk pace of new/upcoming launches, we believe that Valeant's aspirational target for doubling U.S. dermatology sales by 2022 vs. 2017 is overly optimistic,"" he said.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler deemed Valeant's outlook ""optimistic"" for a 5%-8% compound annual growth rate in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and appreciation from 2018-21.Valeant shares collapsed 11.4% Wednesday following the company's fourth-quarter report and were still in free fall on Thursday. On the stock market today, Valeant toppled another 6.9% to close at 15.26, after diving as much as 7.5% in earlier trades.Valeant is bullish on a combination of the drugs retinoid tazarotene and halobetasol called Duobrii for plaque psoriasis. But generics of tazarotene, like Allergan's (AGN) Tazorac, are now available, though higher-concentration versions of halobetasol are not widely available.""There are a number of other higher-concentration topical steroids that are generically available,"" he said. ""Put another way, Duobrii might be efficacious and well-tolerated, but there are economic/payer realities to consider.""Over the next five years, Valeant expects its ""significant seven"" drugs to grow to north of $1 billion from around $100 million. Among those, Valeant counts therapies for psoriasis, opioid-induced constipation and glaucoma.But it will have to square off vs. Allergan in psoriasis, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Purdue Pharmaceuticals in opioid-induced constipation, and Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI) in glaucoma, Amsellem said.

Contraceptive Minastrin 24 dipped 93%, overactive bladder drug Enables toppled 67% and skin drug Tazorac declined 48%.Allergan guided to $15 billion to $15.3 billion in 2018 sales and adjusted earnings of $15.25 to $16 per share, topping analysts' view for $14.57 billion and $13.51 per share, respectively.For the March quarter, Allergan sees adjusted income of $3.20 to $3.40 per share on $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion in sales. The midpoints of earnings and sales guidance missed the consensus for $3.35 and $3.57 billion, respectively.Allergan also reported strong results of a trial testing 1,327 adults in the U.S. with acute migraine attacks. The results stem from the first of two pivotal Phase 3 studies evaluating 50-milligram and 100-milligram doses of a drug called ubrogepant.Ubrogepant is given orally and belongs to a class of drugs known as anti-CGRPs. In the study, patients were treated for a single migraine attack of moderate to severe intensity, Allergan said in a news release.Both doses showed statistically significant results vs. the placebo. At hour two, 19.2% and 21.2% of patients treated with the 50-milligram and 100-milligram doses, respectively, were pain-free vs. 11.8% of placebo patients.The most bothersome symptoms disappeared in 38.6% and 37.7% of patients who received the 50-milligram and 100-milligram doses of ubrogepant vs. 27.8% of placebo-treated patients.It's key to note that liver toxicity results were better than expected, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a report. Allergan bought the rights to ubrogepant from Dow's Merck (MRK) and two prior oral anti-CGRPs from Merck were discontinued for toxicity reasons.Of the 1,327 patients, six had elevated liver enzymes that were greater than three times the upper limit of normal. But there were alternative explanations in all the cases, Allergan said. None were noted to have a probable relationship to ubrogepant.""Allergan had previously mentioned no cases of (elevated liver enzymes greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) on a blinded basis from this Phase 3,"" Raffat said. ""For that reason, it appears that Allergan has cleared the bar on liver safety — this is key.""Migraine attacks are often treated with drugs known as triptans. But triptans don't work in all migraine patients. Of those with a low response to triptans, 25.9% and 21.7% responded to 50-milligram and 100-milligram doses of ubrogepant vs. 11.8% for the placebo.The triptan market had more than $7 billion in peak U.S. sales in 2008, Raffat said. Allergan is calling for $1 billion to $2 billion in peak sales of its two oral anti-CGRPs — ubrogepant and atogepant — expected to launch in 2020 and 2022.RELATED:These Biotech Stocks Each Dived More Than 20% — Is The Sell-Off Overdone?Bristol-Myers Squibb Dives Despite Strong Earnings, Opdivo DataCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?

1367,AGN,"AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are the likeliest targets of a biopharma ""detonation event"" in which tax reform spurs widespread mergers and acquisitions across the group, an analyst said Friday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez calls the coming consolidation ""inevitable.""Products made by the likes of AbbVie (ABBV), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN), Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Shire (SHPG) are soon to face new competition and generic rivals.This follows ""an unprecedented period of innovation and new product launches within large biopharma,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Several of the largest companies will likely experience a substantial growth slowdown within the next five to seven years.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCelgene, Biogen and AstraZeneca would be most accretive to a potential acquirer, based on short-term financials, Fernandez said. Their average accretion in 2020 would be 25%, 14% and 13%, respectively.But Bristol, AstraZeneca and Vertex make the most sense long-term and strategically, he said. These three appear to be ""best positioned"" for longer-term revenue growth based on a look at consensus expectations for 2020-24.The last major consolidation period in biopharma occurred during the last decade, in which there were seven deals greater than $40 billion in value. The largest was Dow Jones stock Pfizer's (PFE) $93.8 billion acquisition of Warner-Lambert, at a 34% premium.Pfizer also paid the biggest premium, 38%, on Pharmacia, forking over $60.5 billion to acquire the firm. Merck paid a 34% premium to buy Schering-Plough for $45.7 billion. Since 2010, deals combining Pfizer with AstraZeneca and Allergan (AGN) and AbbVie with Shire have failed.Fernandez sees the next cycle as a seller's market. Pfizer is struggling with its late entry to the immuno-oncology market, whereas Merck has a strong immuno-oncology drug — Keytruda — but lacks a robust late-stage pipeline.Roche faces biosimilar competition for its top drugs: Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. Novartis (NVS) is still experiencing challenges in its Sandoz unit. AbbVie is strong in the near-term, but its key drug Humira will soon see competition in Europe and in the U.S. after 2022.Strategically, AstraZeneca would be a strong fit for AbbVie, Pfizer, Roche or Merck, Fernandez said. Bristol could fit in at AbbVie and Pfizer. Meanwhile, it's possible AbbVie could swing for Vertex.Through a financial lens, AstraZeneca, Vertex, Biogen and Bristol are the most compelling targets for their ability to enhance long-term sales, he said.Amgen could be an acquirer or a target with $70 billion in funds to buy something, Fernandez said. Assuming Amgen is looking to make a deal valued at less than $90 billion, Vertex rises to the top of the list among the potential targets, outlasting Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Shire.""Among the three, Vertex looks more interesting,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

1368,AGN,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) has climbed 162% since hitting its 2017 low, but shares tumbled Wednesday after an analyst suggested their rise over the past nine months ""makes no sense.""X ""We believe the movement is a confluence of factors that have little to do with underlying factors, and have much more to do with perceptions surrounding liquidity/bankruptcy risk,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a note to clients.In short, the underlying dynamics mean Valeant is still in trouble, he said.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Valeant toppled 10.9% to finish at 19.88. Shares have been on a run since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a 15.84 buy point in late November. This month alone Valeant was up 7% as of Tuesday's close.Short interest now stands under 9% compared with a 2017 high of 16%, he said. That could be related the fact Valeant also has no long-term debt maturities in 2018 and 2019. But it has maturities of $2.7 billion, $3.2 billion and $5.3 billion in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.""Liquidity risk is likely off the table for now,"" he said. ""That however does not mean that the dynamics surrounding the business have changed.""U.S. prescription volumes in Valeant's dermatology, brand eye care and legacy segments show declines of 30%, 15% and 12%, respectively, in 2017 vs. 2016, Raymond said. Each of these units is facing payer pressure and loss of exclusivities for key drugs.Further, it appears antibacterial Xifaxan is maturing, he said. Xifaxan is approved to treat traveler's diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that occurs in patients with liver dysfunction.IBD'S TAKE: Valeant has an IBD Composite Rating of 66 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms more than six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags leaders like AbbVie with a CR of 98. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other top-rated drug stocks.Xifaxan accounted for 13% of sales in the third quarter and is likely near 20% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Raymond said. That means its gross margins are likely in the 90% range.The pressure is on for Xifaxan, which is the most important revenue driver for Valeant, Raymond said. It requires only a small specialty salesforce to reach the gastroenterology community and hospital settings.""As such, this is the one topline driver that must continue to demonstrate a steady track record in order for anxiety regarding liquidity/bankruptcy risk not to reemerge,"" he said.But Xifaxan is also soon to face competition from Cosmo Pharmaceuticals' Aemcolo. Cosmo is aiming to file for approval of Aemcolo in traveler's diarrhea in the near-term and could enter the market before the end of the year.In new launches, Valeant is entering the glaucoma space with Vyzulta, which will rival Aerie Pharmaceuticals' (AERI) Rhopressa. Other players include Dow stock Pfizer (PFE), Allergan (AGN) and Novartis (NVS). Competition is likely to result in a wide spread between gross and net sales for Vyzulta.Valeant is also launching Siliq to treat plaque psoriasis. But physician feedback suggests the go-to treatments in that drug class will be Novartis' Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz.""We do not believe these are opportunities that are significant enough to drive sustainable EBITDA growth,"" he said. ""Quite the contrary, we continue to believe that the loss of exclusivities and payer pressure will continue to be headwinds.""Raymond reiterated his underperform rating and 12 price target on Valeant.RELATED:Novartis Tops A High After Crushing Fourth-Quarter EarningsAbbott Spikes To Record After Topping Quarterly ExpectationsWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

1369,AGN,"Revance Therapeutics (RVNC) launched to a nearly two-year high Tuesday on Phase 3 data for a frown line-treatment that would rival Allergan's (AGN) Botox but likely won't come on the market until 2020, if approved.X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Revance soared by 33.7% to 34.75, and broke out of a flat base with a buy point at 28.85. Intraday, shares touched a high last seen in January 2016. Allergan sank 1.6% to finish at 164.28.The treatment, called RT002, is used to treat wrinkle lines between the eyebrows. RT002 would rival Allergan's Botox, which brought in $729.2 million in 2016 for what is known as a ""facial aesthetic product."" Allergan also sells Botox as a therapeutic for hyperhidrosis and other conditions like migraines. In total, the drug made $1.98 billion in 2016.Revance's drug has a longer duration than Botox by a month, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. The effects of Botox as a cosmetic last around three to four months. But it's not certain RT002 will get a label for up to six months.""I think there's a case to be made for that, but that's not a layup,"" Raffat said. ""It's possible that Revance gets a language like five to six months (for duration of effect).""In a pair of Phase 3 trials, the percentage of patients who had none or mild wrinkles and achieved at least a two-point improvement from baseline vs. a placebo was 73.6% and 74%.IBD'S TAKE: Stock dividend yields have been stingy lately, and finding income has been tough for years.

1370,AGN,"Despite the sell-off in health stocks Tuesday, a joint venture by Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to wring out cost savings from the health care system appears very unlikely to impact industry earnings over the next couple of years, according to analysts.X Figuring out how to rein in health costs without the participation of big health care players looks like a near-impossible task, Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo said. ""We note that the cost to implement systems, adjudicate patient data, and partner with hospitals, doctors, pharmacies on a national basis is onerous.""Caliendo adds that the scale of the big three new partners wouldn't be big enough to squeeze discounts out of providers by steering patients their way, compared to the purchasing power of UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). ""The new company will have to align itself with all these other providers in some way to provide the best care for its employees,"" Caliendo concludes.In fact, Caliendo gave CVS a big vote of confidence earlier Tuesday, saying its planned combination with Aetna positions it to create savings for the government and private employers. Needham raised its rating on CVS to strong buy with a 100 target.Caliendo does think that ""profits in the industry, especially at the underwriting level, are excessive,"" and there are improvements to the current care delivery model that can be made. He sees that as a prime reason behind the CVS-Aetna deal.CVS is looking to shift more health care services to the lowest-cost location: its in-store clinics. That's a different take on UnitedHealth's playbook of expanding into urgent care and other outpatient locales to drive savings for customers.But no such path forward was evident in the announcement from Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire. The plan to establish an independent company ""is in its early planning stages,"" according to a statement by the trio.""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" acknowledged Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett.""Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation,"" said Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Yet it's unclear at this point who any of those talented experts will be.As Wall Street weighed the long-term nature of the effort and the dearth of substantive details, the initial shock wave that rippled across Wall Street subsided. Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer, sank 4.35% to 236.65 on the stock market today, after diving as much as 6.2% earlier. CVS Health, which is in the process of buying Aetna, pared losses to a 4.1% drop.Drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) were down 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Prescription benefit management firm Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.2%, but had tumbled 11.4% earlier. Both CVS and UnitedHealth also operate PBMs, which manage the prescription side of health insurance contracts.Pharmaceuticals and biotech stocks also lost ground, though the hit didn't look much worse than the broader market downdraft on Tuesday. Merck (MRK) shed 1.6%, Allergan (AGN) 1.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) 1.7% Pfizer (PFE) lost 3.1% despite topping earnings views and offering bullish guidance.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Insurers have been solid performers, ranked No. 43 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The knee-jerk reaction among investors is surely a reflection of the unsustainably high cost of health care in the U.S., and the fact that Amazon, which has been itching to disrupt the retail prescription business, is attached to the effort.Traditionally, the fear among health care investors has been that government — not the private sector — will impose cost controls to get a handle on runaway budget deficits, thinning out industry profits in the process. Medicare negotiating drug costs is one such fear, but industry experts say that the government is unlikely to produce much in the way of savings unless it is willing to deny patients access to certain drugs, which could create a political backlash.But Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire aren't the first big employers to join forces to attack health costs. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte noted on Tuesday that the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 large self-insured employers that launched last year, also hopes to find savings and improve employee satisfaction, though it's working with CVS and UnitedHealth to achieve its aims. Initial reports indicated that alliance members expected to save a combined $600 million in prescription costs over three years.Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire say their initial focus will be on ""technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost."" The new corporate entity, they say, will be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""Just what form those technology solutions would take is far from clear. Caliendo supposes that ""Berkshire might bring some underwriting skills (although they've never underwritten healthcare) and AMZN might make pharmacy and medical procurement contributions and provide IT expertise.""Leerkink's Gupte says she's unclear whether Amazon wading deeper into solving the health care mess will accelerate its move into the supply chain of the prescription industry.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Trump's State Of The Union Might Move Markets Up — Or DownStocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A BreakGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Three IBD 50 Stocks In Buy RangeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

1371,AGN,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) dropped Tuesday after the generic drug giant rebuffed a request from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to spare hundreds of jobs tied to a Jerusalem facility.X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva fell 3.4% to close at 17.90, though it fell as much as 4.8%. Shares have lost about half their value since the beginning of the year amid competition for Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.New Chief Executive Kare Schultz called the cuts — about 1,700 in Israel and 800 at the Jerusalem facility — ""painful"" steps to help the firm reduce some $35 billion in debt as of the end of the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg report.""The measures included in the restructuring plan are aimed to achieve our shared aspiration to sustain Teva as a strong global company, managed out of and based in Israel,"" Schultz reportedly said in a prepared statement.Without taking these steps, it's possible Teva could become a takeover candidate, the firm said. Teva didn't immediately return a request from Investor's Business Daily for comment.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 16 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms more than eight in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated generic drug stocks.In total, Teva expects to eliminate 14,000 positions globally and to close a number of manufacturing facilities by the end of 2019 to contend with its debt. The debt stems from Teva's $40.5 billion spend in 2016 to acquire Allergan's (AGN) generic unit.Analysts have applauded Teva for taking steps to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2019. Israeli officials, on the other hand, had hoped to work with Teva to reduce the number of dismissals by offering government help, according to a Bloomberg report.Others are reportedly calling on the government to rescind about $6.3 billion in tax breaks the generic drugmaker has received since 2006.

Allergan is now facing a slew of potential generic versions of Restasis after a judge tossed out four patents covering the drug. But the drugmaker is appealing the decision, Chief Executive Brent Saunders said in a release.""We have strong arguments for an appeal and we filed a notice of appeal with the court,"" he said. ""If a generic product enters the market, Allergan is ready to mitigate that impact by growing our base business, reducing costs and deploying our balance sheet.""IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie leads the drugmakers' industry group with a Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other top-rated drug stocks.CFRA analyst Jeffrey Loo says Allergan sees 2018 earnings per share above $15 if a generic of Restasis is launched in January, and above $16 if a copy of the drug is launched in July. The drug accounts for about $2.15 in earnings, he wrote in a note to clients.Still, ""we see several attractive fast-growing products, particularly in aesthetics,"" he said.Total medical aesthetics sales grew 55% in the quarter to $602.3 million. Sales of Kybella, though, fell 32.4% to $9.6 million. Allergan noted that there were fewer Kybella promotions in this quarter than the prior year.Allergan also narrowed its full-year sales guidance to $15.875 billion-$16.025 billion, from $15.85 billion-$16.05 billion. It raised the lower end of its 2017 adjusted earnings per share view by 10 cents and now sees wrapping the year with $16.15-$16.45 per share.Novo Nordisk reported adjusted profit of 63 cents per American Depository Receipt on $4.198 billion in sales, up a respective 8.6% and 1.6% vs. the year-earlier period.Adjusted income beat the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks for 58 cents per ADR.

1373,AGN,"What's got a tax address in Ireland, headquarters in New Jersey, a blockbuster drug on a Native American reservation, and new trouble in Washington?If you guessed Allergan (AGN), you're right.Last month, Allergan said it would transfer the rights to Restasis, a blockbuster treatment for chronic dry eye that had $1.49 billion in sales last year, to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. The unusual agreement could allow the drugmaker to use the tribe's status as a sovereign nation to shield its Restasis patents from attack by rival drugmakers.House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, and ranking member Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, wrote Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders on Tuesday about what the letter referred to as the ""unconventional maneuver.""""The implications of Allergan's patent transfer raise questions for Congress as the exchange may impair competition across the pharmaceutical industry and ultimately dissuade companies from pursuing less-costly generic alternatives to brand drugs,"" Gowdy and Cummings wrote.Allergan said in a prepared statement that it would comply with the committee's request for documents and other information.The Food and Drug Administration approved Restasis in 2003 and it was Allergan's second-best-selling drug last year, according to the company's 2016 annual report. The drug's most recent patents expire in 2024, according to an FDA patent database.In relation to the deal, the lawmakers asked Allergan for communications, market-share projections and documents presented to the company's board of directors. They also sought documents and communications regarding consideration of future such deals.Gowdy and Cummings gave Allergan until Oct. 17 to answer their questions.Allergan shares ended trading Tuesday down 0.6% to 209.80. Allergan's tax domicile is in Dublin, Ireland, and its headquarters are in Parsippany, N.J.The move to strike an agreement with the tribe was a defense against being held hostage ""by entities such as hedge funds"" seeking to profit from pharmaceutical companies ""by demanding financial payment"" in exchange for not filing challenges with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Saunders wrote in a letter on Tuesday to Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, and Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California.The letter was in response to a Sept. 27 letter from other senators asking for the committee to investigate the Restasis agreement. The deal would ""have no impact"" on a challenge to Allergan's patents for the drug awaiting a ruling in the Federal District Court in Texas, Saunders said in his letter.""To be clear, if the District Court ruling is adverse to Allergan's patent position, and there is an FDA approval of a generic version of Restasis, that product could enter the market many years in advance of the listed patent expiry dates,"" Saunders wrote.On Monday, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, wrote the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America asking if the lobby group approved of Allergan's deal with the tribe.""This is one of the most brazen and absurd loopholes I've ever seen, and it should be illegal,"" McCaskill said in a separate statement. ""Given its recent comments regarding corporate responsibility, PhRMA can and should play a role in telling its members that this action isn't appropriate, and I hope they do that.""Representatives for PhRMA didn't immediately return requests for comment.

"
1375,AGN,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) beat analysts' Q4 estimates Tuesday but its guidance was soft, sending the stock up more than 1% in after-hours trading, in a day when several large drugmakers reported.Gilead's earnings rose 37% over the year-earlier quarter to $3.32 per share, topping analysts' EPS consensus by 32 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue increased 16% to $8.51 billion, vs. analysts' expectation of $8.13 billion.For the full year, EPS rose 56% to $12.61 while revenue gained 31% to $32.64 billion.Gilead guided 2016 product sales, which covers nearly all revenue, at $30 billion to $31 billion. Analysts had expected $30.68 billion in product sales and total revenue of $31.68 billion. Gilead does not provide total revenue or EPS guidance, but it did provide guidance on expenses, which were slightly above expectations on the R&D and sales, general and administrative lines. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum calculated that the implied EPS guidance for 2016 is $10.48 to $11.92, which would miss consensus of $12.23.In Q4, the hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni both beat estimates, though entirely due to sales outside the U.S., where analysts have less visibility. Next year's expected revenue decline is due to an anticipated decline in U.S. HCV market, which had an enormous lift-off when the two drugs were approved but has flattened as ever-larger numbers of patients have been cured of the disease.On the conference call with analysts, commercial-operations chief Paul Carter said that they could expect the HCV market in 2016 to behave similarly to how it did in the second half of 2015, essentially flat in the U.S. while growing in foreign markets where it is still being launched. He said that it might see some growth as payers seem to be loosening their restrictions on the drugs, which initially strained their finances due to their high prices and the enormous volume of patients. However, he acknowledged that revenue per patient was likely to fall as less-sick patients came aboard, requiring shorter treatments.Carter also sounded confident about Gilead's ability to fend off competition, which got a new entrant last week when Merck's (MRK) Zepatier was approved last week and priced well below both Gilead's and AbbVie's (ABBV) HCV drugs.""We're confident our label is very strong, and we're very much supported by the real-world data we've seen since the launch of Harvoni,"" Carter said.Earlier in the day, big pharma Pfizer (PFE) said Q4 revenue rose 7% over the year-earlier quarter to $14.05 billion, beating analysts’ consensus by about $45 million. Earnings, excluding one-time items, slipped 2% to 53 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny.For the year, EPS declined 3% to $2.20, while sales slid 2% to $48.85 billion.However, Pfizer’s 2016 profit guidance missed Wall Street’s expectations of $2.20 to $2.30 a share. Analyst Schoenebaum blamed foreign-exchange headwinds.“Excluding a roughly negative $2.3 billion top line ($0.8 billion of top line FX impact due to Venezuela currency impact alone) and $0.16 bottom line impact due to FX, both 2016 top and bottom line guidance would have bracketed the Street,” Schoenebaum wrote in an email. “We spoke with Pfizer, and they believe that the Street underestimated the FX impact in 2016.”S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo raised his rating on Pfizer to buy from hold, saying the valuation has become attractive after it, like almost every other drug stock around, has sold off in recent months.""We view growth within its Global Innovative Products unit positively, driven by Prevnar 13 and Ibrance,"" Loo wrote in a research note. ""We expect its pending acquisition of Allergan (AGN) to be completed in the second half of 2016.""Pfizer stock closed down 0.1% at 30.14.Mallinckrodt (MNK) rose 5.7% to close at 65.71, after the specialty drugmaker reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings of $2.09 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter and topping consensus by 31 cents. Sales climbed 19% to $914.8 million, some $25 million above the Street’s average estimate.Mallinckrodt raised its full-year EPS guidance to $7.85 to $8.30, up from $7.70 to $8.20.Baxter International (BAX), a leader in dialysis products, also beat expectations in the most recent quarter, pulling off a sharp increase in earnings despite a decline in sales. Fourth quarter profit from continuing operations jumped 54% to 43 cents a share, 11 cents past Wall Street’s consensus. Revenue dropped 7% to $2.6 billion. Baxter stock rose 1.8% Tuesday to close at 37.95.Baxter said it expects EPS this year of $1.46 to $1.54, beating consensus of $1.42. Its forecast for the current quarter was below the Street, however, at 28 to 30 cents.

1380,AGN,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals raised its hostile bid for fellow drugmaker Allergan Wednesday morning as the campaign increasingly turned into a debate about Valeant's own business model. Investors seemed unimpressed as Valeant's stock fell 2.3% to 126.95 while Allergan's slid 5.4% to 156.12.Valeant (VRX) added $10 a share in cash to last month's original offer of $48.30 plus 0.83 of a Valeant share for each Allergan (AGN) share, coming to a total of $49.4 billion.Valeant also provided a new contingent value right (CVR) related to sales of an eye drug in development that uses DARPin antibody technology. The CVR would provide up to $25 a share of added value if the DARPin drug accumulates $20 billion in sales over 10 years on the market.Valeant pledged $400 million to develop the drug.Hours before this announcement, Valeant said that it sold some of its dermatology assets to Nestle (NSRGY) for $1.4 billion.The divested products include Dysport, a competitor to Allergan's biggest seller, Botox.""By selling them ahead of time, we've eliminated one more roadblock to our integration with Allergan,"" Valeant CEO Michael Pearson said at the investor meeting Wednesday.Pearson said he learned from talking with Allergan investors that a higher price and the DARPin optionality were their two biggest requests. He also gave investors an overview of Valeant's history and business model, describing how he transformed the company since he came on board in 2008 from a smallish specialty pharma to a diversified global player through a series of acquisitions.Valeant's presentation also addressed criticism that Allergan's management made Tuesday of Valeant's business model. After hiring a consultant and an accounting firm to examine Valeant's financial statements, Allergan said Valeant's organic growth rate in the past five quarters was negative and that it's been misleading investors.Will Cost Cuts Hurt R&D?Allergan charged that Valeant's last two major acquisition targets, Medicis and Bausch & Lomb, have lost market share since being acquired, and their apparent growth has come from price increases.Raising what's probably been the biggest concern for Allergan's management, the report also said Valeant couldn't achieve its promised $2.7 billion in cost cuts without decimating the R&D budget.At Wednesday's meeting, a number of executives from those acquired companies delivered talks on their experiences since joining Valeant. Most of them touted the growth of their divisions, although Deb Jorn, an executive from recently acquired Bausch & Lomb who now heads dermatology marketing, said dermatology suffered last year from patent losses and integration problems with the buyout of Medicis.Pearson alluded to this situation on Valeant's last earnings call, saying he's learned from that experience not to muck around with the salesforce of a large acquisition target.Pearson also countered Allergan's allegations against Valeant's financial reporting. He said organic growth was negative if you include the impact of foreign-exchange rates, divestitures and product discontinuations, but Valeant isn't alone in the pharma industry in excluding those.He also pointed out that recent growth has been hit by four of Valeant's top 10 products going off patent, an issue in the drug business but not a situation expected to occur often.Valeant's raised offer seemed to leave Wall Street underwhelmed. Wells Fargo's Lawrence Biegelsen noted that at Valeant's last closing price, the offer amounted to $166 a share, barely above Allergan's Tuesday closing price of 165.02, and he wrote that it might not be sufficient to move Allergan's shareholders.Down The RoadBernstein analyst Aaron Gal agreed, pointing to the long-term guidance of 20% compound annual earnings growth over the next five years, which Allergan issued when it formally rejected Valeant's first bid on May 12.""We think Valeant is expecting Allergan shareholders will continue to believe the stock will decline to its pre-offer range ($120-$130) if the offer was not to materialize,"" Gal wrote in a research note Wednesday. ""Given the new guidance, the stock may decline to $140, but is then likely to rebound immediately afterward.""Gal also didn't care for the CVR offer, writing that the DARPin drug would be better spun off to someone more committed to developing the product category than Valeant.But BMO's Alex Arfaei, who unlike Biegelsen and Gal covers Valeant rather than Allergan, wrote that the offer was about what he expected.""Given the reported over 50% overlap in VRX/AGN shareholders, we believe that most AGN shareholders are familiar enough with Valeant's business model to invest in the combined entity,"" he said.

With 306.7 million Allergan shares, according to the Valeant filing, Valeant is also offering about $14.81 billion in cash.Allergan stock was up 15%, near 163.50, but some analysts expect the offer will get a poor reception.""We believe that Allergan will likely do all it can to resist a hostile takeover by Valeant,"" Sterne Agee analyst Shibani Malhotra wrote in a research note.Still, the offer puts Allergan ""in play,"" and other suitors might come forward, wrote Malhotra. Allergan's ""management would need to take transformative action in order to keep the company independent,"" he wrote.Allergan shareholders would control about 43% of the combined company, Valeant said in its SEC filing.Valeant proposed the deal in a regulatory filing late Monday and followed up with a detailed prospectus early Tuesday. Pershing Square, run by investor William Ackman, holds about 28.9 million shares of Allergan, a more than 9% stake, according to regulatory filings.Pershing Square and Valeant entered a partnership on Feb. 25, Ackman says in a regulatory filing. The two firms created a fund to acquire Allergan shares, with Valeant initially contributing $75.9 million.The deal could accomplish several ""important strategic goals"" for Valeant, wrote FBR Capital Markets analyst William Tanner. It would expand the Canadian drugmaker's product portfolio and could boost Valeant's EPS by 2015, wrote Tanner, who rates Valeant stock as outperform, or buy.The deal includes about $2.7 billion in annual operating cost synergies, wrote Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez.""Likelihood of a successful VRX bid go up assuming announced synergies are achievable,"" wrote Fernandez, who rates Allergan stock as market perform, or hold.Allergan confirmed that it received the bid but didn't immediately respond to requests for comment, nor to say when its board would meet to discuss the offer.

1458,AGN,"Embattled specialty drugmaker Allergan on Wednesday beat Wall Street's first-quarter earnings estimates and raised its guidance, but the company's stock slid 0.3% to close at 165.87 as its future remained in doubt.Allergan (AGN) reported earnings of $1.18 a share, up 20% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 5 cents. Sales rose 13% to $1.62 billion, in line with estimates.Guidance followed a similar pattern. For the full year, the company set a sales range of $6.78 billion to $7 billion, bracketing consensus, while the EPS range of $5.64 to $5.73 topped the Street's $5.47. Last year, the company made $4.77 a share on sales of $6.3 billion.For the second quarter, the firm guided sales of $1.73 billion to $1.8 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year ago and again meeting views. Allergan guided EPS above consensus at $1.41 to $1.44 vs. $1.22 last year.The announcement came as Allergan's shareholders were still weighing Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX) $47 billion hostile-takeover attempt, launched on April 22. On Tuesday, Allergan co-founder Gavin Herbert slammed the takeover bid at the annual shareholders' meeting, warning that Valeant would decimate Allergan's research-and-development budget.Allergan CEO David Pyott refused to take questions on the Valeant drama on Wednesday's conference call to discuss results. Instead he focused on the company's continued growth and market-share gains in its chief markets: ophthalmology, dermatology and aesthetics. Sales of its lead product Botox grew 10% to $502 million, and the company forecast full-year Botox sales of $2.18 billion to $2.28 billion, up from $1.98 billion last year.Botox retains 76% market share, with Valeant's Dysport taking up most of the remainder. In a research note Wednesday, Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse pointed out that the company will benefit from Johnson & Johnson 's (JNJ) decision last month to halt development of PurTox, a potential competitor to Botox.Sales of eye drop Restasis climbed 12% to $232 million, and Allergan estimates that they will crack $1 billion this year. The facial-aesthetics category jumped 33% to $147 million, helped by the launch of skin-firming injectable Juvederm Voluma.The breast-aesthetics product line grew 11% to $100 million, even though it was stagnant last year. On the call, Pyott said unit growth is still flat but that the company has succeeded in shifting to higher-end products, like the Seri Surgical Scaffold for tissue reconstruction.Several times during the call Pyott suggested that Allergan will unveil a new strategy in the near future, both in response to the Valeant approach and to shareholder pressure to lower spending. Sales, general and administrative expenses totaled 40.4% of revenue in the quarter, a slight decline from last year, but Pyott acknowledged that investors had ""been asking when we'll get it down to the mid-30s. We've been slow to go there.""Pyott said the board had started talking about the issue some nine months ago, but is holding off on a final decision until the Valeant situation is resolved.""Management would simply have to run the business more aggressively but not necessarily forfeit traditional methods of pharmaceutical value creation of internal and purchased R&D,"" Cowen analyst Ken Cacciatore wrote in a note Wednesday. ""However, they would have to plausibly convince the current shareholders that it makes more sense to be buying AGN stock at $165 rather than selling.""

1528,AGN,"Three big pharmas reported light-to-mixed Q1 earnings Tuesday, but their shares went in different directions in the stock market today as Wall Street seemed to focus on different details of the reports.
"
1529,AGN,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) said Q1 earnings rose 12% over the year-earlier quarter to 46 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents. Sales, however, fell 1% to $3.8 billion, missing consensus of $3.9 billion. Bristol added a nickel to the low end of its previous 2014 EPS guidance range, now $1.65-$1.80, but the midpoint is below analysts' $1.78. Sales guidance of $15.2 billion to $15.8 billion was squarely in line with consensus. Both represent modest declines from last year.
"
1530,AGN,"HIV drugs Sustiva and Reyataz were largely responsible for the Q1 miss, along with rheumatoid-arthritis drug Orencia. On the other hand, stroke preventer Eliquis finally seemed to be finding its legs after a disappointing launch last year, with sales of $106 million beating views by $12 million. Diabetes also outperformed, but Bristol sold that business in February to AstraZeneca (AZN), though it's still collecting royalties.
"
1531,AGN,"Bristol also announced it's begun a rolling FDA submission process for its PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in squamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer, based on a study it expects to complete by year-end. Nivolumab performed well against this disease in a phase one trial, which presents a significant opportunity because the prognosis for squamous patients today is poor. Bristol said it will report phase two results at a meeting in October.
"
1532,AGN,"The company also acquired privately held biotech iPierian, which develops treatments for a class of neurogenerative diseases called Tauopathies.
"
1533,AGN,"Bristol stock was down 3% in midday trading, near 49.

1535,AGN,"For ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum, the most interesting thing about the results was that beleaguered diabetes drug Januvia beat expectations.
"
1536,AGN,"""We can't quantify the price impact at this point, but would note that ANY favorable (year-over-year) price impact is good news for MRK, as the DPP-4 category was plagued by new and aggressive price competition in 2013,"" he wrote in an email to clients.
"
1537,AGN,"Merck said it would leave pipeline updates till a business-review meeting next week. It also didn't comment on its efforts to sell its consumer business, which has reportedly drawn interest from Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble (PG) and Bayer (BAYRY) over the past few days.
"

Previously it expected to file in Europe early next year and in the U.S. somewhat later, but now it expects an EU filing late this year.
"
1540,AGN,"Another product of the Regeneron partnership, dupilumab, is being moved to a phase three trial for atopic dermatitis. Perhaps based on these encouraging reports, Regeneron stock was up 3.7% in midday trading, even as Sanofi stock was down more than 1%.
"
1541,AGN,"Sanofi was also in the news Tuesday as it was reported that Allergan (AGN) has approached it as a possible buyer, in Allergan's bid to fend off a hostile bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX). The reports were based on anonymous sources, and the companies refused to comment.

"
1559,AGN,"On the conference call to discuss the merger, analysts pressed AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez for details, including why the tax projection was for 2016 instead of 2015. But U.K. takeover rules restricted what he could say.

"
1685,AGN,"Mergers are usually more popular with investors in the company being acquired than in the acquirer. Since specialty drugmaker Akorn (AKRX) agreed to buy Hi-Tech Pharmacal, however, its stock has gone up.
"
1686,AGN,"Akorn's $640 million payout isn't huge by drug-industry standards, but for that price it will nearly double in size, as both companies' annual revenue is running between $200 million and $300 million. The buyout will also address a need raised by analysts and management alike: diversification.
"
1687,AGN,"Akorn's principal product is Nembutal, known generically as pentobarbital, most famous (and infamous) for its use in execution by lethal injection. It's also used as an anesthetic and sedative, but its homicidal use made it an albatross for its previous owner, Lundbeck, since its home country of Denmark opposes the death penalty.
"
1688,AGN,"A Well-Timed Acquisition
"
1689,AGN,"Akorn acquired Nembutal from Lundbeck in late 2011, at a fortuitous moment after Hospira (HSP) had stopped making sodium thiopental, then the standard drug for lethal injections.
"
1690,AGN,"The controversial nature of the drug was to Akorn's advantage in one sense: It has no generic competitors, even though it's long since off patent. However, Sagent Pharmaceuticals (SGNT) has filed for approval of its own generic version, and in early August CEO Jeff Yordon said it could launch by the end of this year.
"
1691,AGN,"Akorn's buyout of Hi-Tech Pharmacal (HITK) gets around these problems by building up completely different parts of its business. Both companies have a considerable presence in ophthalmology. When Akorn acquired Advanced Vision Research in 2011, it acquired the TheraTears eye drops and MacuTrition supplements, and expanded into making private-label eye products for drugstores.
"
1692,AGN,"With the buyout Akorn will get Hi-Tech's two manufacturing plants, which will further expand its capacity to make opthalmology products. Akorn's management has said it hopes to be the No. 1 player in generic ophthalmics by 2018. The facilities also bring it capabilities it didn't have before, such as in creams, ointments and nasal sprays.
"
1693,AGN,"""We anticipate there is approximately a $500 million addressable market opportunity in the private label over-the-counter business in the categories of cough and cold and allergy oral liquids, nasals and topicals,"" Akorn CEO Raj Rai said in the conference call discussing the merger. ""We believe this would give us the credibility and provide us with cross-selling opportunities with our existing customers and would further enhance our partnerships with the retailers.""
"
1694,AGN,"Although over-the-counter drugs make a large chunk of Hi-Tech's business, its single biggest product is fluticasone, its generic version of Flonase, GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) prescription asthma spray. The drug fueled big growth in 2010 and 2011, but last year new entrants into the market put Hi-Tech on a train of quarterly profit declines from which it never recovered.
"
1695,AGN,"This caused some concern for Deutsche Bank analyst David Steinberg.
"
1696,AGN,"""Specifically, why is AKRX buying a company that 1) is growing considerably more slowly than itself and 2) has a product (fluticasone) which is (about) 37% of FY13 (revenue) that has declined 13% year-over-year?"" he asked in his Aug. 28 research note. ""What if there are more generic entrants?""
"
1697,AGN,"Some other analysts mentioned it in their comments on the merger, but not all were worried about it.
"
1698,AGN,"""We do not envision the pace of new generic Flonase entrants to accelerate going forward, bearing in mind that the market is already crowded and that pricing has already eroded considerably,"" wrote Piper Jaffray's David Amsellem on Sept. 4.

1703,AGN,"Although more buyouts may be in the cards, analysts also see growth potential in Akorn's pipeline. At the end of the second quarter, it had 57 generic-drug applications in process with the FDA, representing an addressable market of about $5.4 billion, according to Craig-Hallum.
"
1704,AGN,"The company has been working on generic versions of Novartis' (NVS) inhaled antibiotic Tobi and Hospira's intravenous sedative Precedex. Akorn has also said it plans to go into veterinary products, starting with ophthalmic products and possibly expanding into injectables later.

1705,AGN,"Hi-Tech brings another 25 pipeline products to the table, with an addressable market of $3.9 billion. It's currently wrangling with Allergan (AGN) for the right to make knock-offs of Allergan's eye products Latisse, Lumigan and Zymar.

"
1709,AGN,"Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) beat analysts' Q2 earnings estimates Wednesday, and raised its guidance to account for its completed acquisition of contact-lens giant Bausch & Lomb.
"
1710,AGN,"The stock, already trading near record highs, hit a new peak of 97.60 early Wednesday before closing at 97.59, up 2%.
"
1711,AGN,"Valeant reported cash EPS of $1.34 a share, up 33% from the year-earlier quarter and 7 cents above analysts' consensus. Sales rose 34% to $1.1 billion, in line with estimates.
"
1712,AGN,"The company closed its $8.7 billion buyout of Bausch & Lomb on Tuesday, and consequently raised its full-year guidance by quite a bit. The management added more than $1 billion to the sales range, now $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion. The EPS range is $6 to $6.20, vs. previous guidance of $5.55 to $5.85. It posted 2012 EPS of $4.51 on sales of $3.55 billion.
"
1713,AGN,"On an earnings conference call with analysts, CFO Howard Schiller said Valeant expects to exceed its $800 million target in cost savings from the merger, and plans to reduce the combined head count by 10% to 15%. Most of this would come from general and administrative expenses, with little impact on the sales force. Although branded pharmaceuticals still make up the majority of the combined business, Schiller pointed out that three-quarters of revenue now comes from cash payments or private insurance, which is significant given the pricing pressures on drugs from government payers, especially in Europe.
"
1714,AGN,"Morningstar analyst David Krempa, in a research report, cautioned that the deal synergies will be partly offset by higher-than-expected interest rates, and that Valeant will still be a relatively small player in ophthalmology vs. rivals such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis (NVS). Nonetheless, he added, ""we still believe Valeant and its exemplary stewardship are being undervalued by the market.""
"
1715,AGN,"The highly acquisitive Valeant is already swollen this quarter from its $344 million buyout of skin-cream maker Obagi Medical Products, which closed in late April. The Obagi buyout in turn complemented last year's $2.6 billion acquisition of Medicis, which brought Valeant Dysport, an anti-wrinkle injection similar to Allergan's (AGN) Botox. On the conference call, Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson said Dysport was gaining market share on Botox and the other rival, Merz's Xeomin.
"
1716,AGN,"Excluding the impact of these and various smaller buyouts, sales rose a more modest 4% in developed markets and 14% in emerging markets. Developed-market sales took a hit from the unexpected early entry of generic competition for herpes cream Zovirax, after Mylan (MYL) won FDA approval for its knock-off in early April. Pearson said this pushed U.S. promoted-product sales down 5%, though apart from Zovirax the rest of the portfolio grew 7%.
"
1717,AGN,"Outside the U.S., Eastern Europe was a standout with 16% organic growth in Russia in the first half of the year, and 11% in Poland. Mexico also did well with 8% organic growth. Pearson noted there had been a slowdown in Latin America's overall market growth, but said Valeant had managed to outperform.
"
1718,AGN,"Pearson also offered up Valeant's annual review of the performance of recent large acquisitions, which in this case covered 17 deals from October 2008 through 2012. Overall, the compound annual growth rate from the acquired companies was 12%. Brazilian nutritionals company Probiotica led the way with 77% growth since its February 2012 buyout.
"
1719,AGN,"Valeant was pulling less than $1 billion in annual revenue as recently as 2009, but Pearson has repeatedly said he plans to turn the company into a large global drugmaker. This led UBS analyst Marc Goodman to ask him on the call whether Valeant was going to have to go into more mainstream products in order to get even bigger.
"
1720,AGN,"Pearson answered that Valeant's strategy remains the same. ""We think we can be successful by not doing what large pharma companies are doing,"" he said. ""We did put a big aspiration out there, but that's our approach, it's motivational to our people and certainly that (is what) we hope to achieve.""Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) beat analysts' Q2 earnings estimates Wednesday, and raised its guidance to account for its completed acquisition of contact-lens giant Bausch & Lomb.The stock, already trading near record highs, hit a new peak of 97.60 early Wednesday before closing at 97.59, up 2%.Valeant reported cash EPS of $1.34 a share, up 33% from the year-earlier quarter and 7 cents above analysts' consensus. Sales rose 34% to $1.1 billion, in line with estimates.The company closed its $8.7 billion buyout of Bausch & Lomb on Tuesday, and consequently raised its full-year guidance by quite a bit. The management added more than $1 billion to the sales range, now $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion. The EPS range is $6 to $6.20, vs. previous guidance of $5.55 to $5.85. It posted 2012 EPS of $4.51 on sales of $3.55 billion.On an earnings conference call with analysts, CFO Howard Schiller said Valeant expects to exceed its $800 million target in cost savings from the merger, and plans to reduce the combined head count by 10% to 15%. Most of this would come from general and administrative expenses, with little impact on the sales force. Although branded pharmaceuticals still make up the majority of the combined business, Schiller pointed out that three-quarters of revenue now comes from cash payments or private insurance, which is significant given the pricing pressures on drugs from government payers, especially in Europe.Morningstar analyst David Krempa, in a research report, cautioned that the deal synergies will be partly offset by higher-than-expected interest rates, and that Valeant will still be a relatively small player in ophthalmology vs. rivals such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis (NVS). Nonetheless, he added, ""we still believe Valeant and its exemplary stewardship are being undervalued by the market.""The highly acquisitive Valeant is already swollen this quarter from its $344 million buyout of skin-cream maker Obagi Medical Products, which closed in late April. The Obagi buyout in turn complemented last year's $2.6 billion acquisition of Medicis, which brought Valeant Dysport, an anti-wrinkle injection similar to Allergan's (AGN) Botox. On the conference call, Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson said Dysport was gaining market share on Botox and the other rival, Merz's Xeomin.Excluding the impact of these and various smaller buyouts, sales rose a more modest 4% in developed markets and 14% in emerging markets. Developed-market sales took a hit from the unexpected early entry of generic competition for herpes cream Zovirax, after Mylan (MYL) won FDA approval for its knock-off in early April. Pearson said this pushed U.S. promoted-product sales down 5%, though apart from Zovirax the rest of the portfolio grew 7%.Outside the U.S., Eastern Europe was a standout with 16% organic growth in Russia in the first half of the year, and 11% in Poland. Mexico also did well with 8% organic growth. Pearson noted there had been a slowdown in Latin America's overall market growth, but said Valeant had managed to outperform.Pearson also offered up Valeant's annual review of the performance of recent large acquisitions, which in this case covered 17 deals from October 2008 through 2012. Overall, the compound annual growth rate from the acquired companies was 12%. Brazilian nutritionals company Probiotica led the way with 77% growth since its February 2012 buyout.Valeant was pulling less than $1 billion in annual revenue as recently as 2009, but Pearson has repeatedly said he plans to turn the company into a large global drugmaker. This led UBS analyst Marc Goodman to ask him on the call whether Valeant was going to have to go into more mainstream products in order to get even bigger.Pearson answered that Valeant's strategy remains the same. ""We think we can be successful by not doing what large pharma companies are doing,"" he said. ""We did put a big aspiration out there, but that's our approach, it's motivational to our people and certainly that (is what) we hope to achieve.""

Biogen shares shot up…
"
1796,AGN,"News on multiple-sclerosis drugs was busting out all over early Friday, as a major conference on the disease wrapped up the week in Amsterdam.The biggest news came from Biogen Idec (BIIB), which reported the much-anticipated full results of the phase-three clinical trial of BG-12, its new oral MS treatment. The study, which tested doses of 240mg twice a day and three times a day, found both dosage levels cut the relapse rate in half.Investors were thrilled. Biogen shares were up 5% late-morning, in enormous volume.Miller Tabak analyst Les Funtleyder told IBD that BG-12 is the leading candidate to compete with Gilenya, the blockbuster drug launched in the U.S. last year by Novartis (NVS). Gilenya was the first oral treatment for a disease that had previously been treated with a regime of injections.""It's a big deal because there haven't been a lot of (MS) drugs on the market until recently,"" he said. ""It's good to have new drugs coming that are more safe, more effective and more convenient.""In other news from the meeting, the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis released a survey of 2,000 MS patients who suffered relapses, and found that 31% of them did not respond to the traditional treatment of corticosteroids. That's bad news for the patients, but good news for Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR), whose lone drug, Acthar, is approved for exactly that purpose.""The data confirm the need for additional treatment options for MS relapses,"" said Questcor's chief business officer, Steve Cartt, in a statement. ""For many of these patients who do not respond adequately to corticosteroid treatment, Acthar can be a viable treatment option.""Questcor was up 3% in late-morning trading.Meanwhile, Allergan (AGN) was up 3% in twice average volume. Late Thursday, news came out that a small study supported the use of botulinum toxin, better known as Botox, to treat arm tremors in MS patients. In addition to the August 2011 FDA approval of Botox to aid bladder control in patients with MS and other neurological disorders, Botox was also granted FDA approval in March 2010 to treat increased muscle stiffness in elbow, wrist, and finger muscles in people 18 years and older with upper limb spasticity. ULS is also common in MS patients.

The Nasdaq and the Dow traded fractionally higher. Volume was sharply lower on both exchanges.With no significant economic data on tap for the day, gold and the dollar both climbed in early trade.Radware (RDWR) jumped 3% in early trade. That put the Israel-based network equipment maker 7% above a 37.03 buy point in a double-bottom base. The stock broke out with a powerful gap-up Dec. 6 after news reports that it might be an acquisition target for Riverbed (RVBD).Mesabi Trust (MSB) climbed more than 2% in strong trade, rebounding for a second day from its 10-week moving average. The stock sold off Wednesday and Thursday, with no clear cause. Shares ended last week down 14%, the iron ore miner's worst week since April.On the downside, TransGlobe Energy (TGA) dropped 2% in fat trade. The Canadian oil producer fell hard over the past two weeks, but may have found support at the 10-week moving average. Shares dropped 20% over the past two weeks and remain 27% below their Dec. 7 high.
"
1800,AGN,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is the lone leader in IBD's medical sector, but it's not the only health care stock that fund managers and strategists see with bright prospects.Mutual funds are a big reason for run-ups in many stocks in the sector.The $84.5 billion Fidelity Contrafund boosted its positions in Valeant and  Celgene (CELG) in its latest disclosure. It began a stake in Illumina (ILMN).The $43.4 million Franklin Templeton Global Allocation opened a stake in Novo Nordisk (NVO). The $1.3 billion Alger Capital Appreciation began a play in HCA Holdings (HCA).Strategists like the fundamentals in those and other individual stocks. Alec Young, global equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, says those fish are swimming in a safe pond. ""Health care is insulation from potential macroeconomic head winds,"" he said.Tim Cunningham, co-manager of $655 million Thornburg Core Growth and of $687 million International Growth , likes Valeant's diversified drug lineup.Valeant builds its menu by acquiring drugs and companies. ""They get smaller stuff that big pharmaceutical firms don't care about,"" Cunningham noted. ""And they don't spend huge amounts on R&D, which often does not pay off. And they have so many drugs, they're not worried about one or two losing patent protection.""Wall Street consensus estimates put Valeant's earnings up 25% in 2013. ""But their earnings will be higher than the Street's estimate,"" Cunningham said. That's because the consensus overlooks the cost-cutting Valeant will do with Medicis Pharmaceutical, which it recently acquired, he adds.Aggressive GuidanceCelgene gapped up on Jan. 2 and again Jan. 8 amid aggressive long-term earnings guidance from the company. ""They said they expect strong revenue performance from three drugs not yet approved, but which it expects to launch in the near term,"" said Steven Silver, S&P Capital IQ analyst. Launches of those drugs will dilute Celgene's reliance on its cancer treatment Revlimid.The firm is trading at a discount to its biotech peers on a price-earnings to growth ratio, Silver says.Dominant PlayerNovo Nordisk has done well because it is the dominant player in treatment of diabetes, which is becoming an epidemic, says David Heupel, a senior health care analyst who follows Novo for Thrivent Funds' large-cap portfolios.And unlike many peers, Novo's drugs have few, if any, patent expiration issues. Also, he likes Novo's pipeline.Herman Saftlas, another S&P Cap IQ analyst, calls Allergan (AGN) one of the stronger players in niche pharmaceuticals.It was a pioneer with Botox. It is poised to exploit new applications in treating several eye ailments, including macular degeneration.All medical stocks, Silver says, face the risk of an unexpected rival's emergence or unexpected adverse effects.Stocks that run up too fast can get unattractively pricey, Saftlas says.""And the sector faces more political hurdles in the next few months,"" Young notes.

1801,AGN,"Investing in drug stocks isn't quite like investing in other stocks. While drugmakers' shares can move on earnings and buyout news like anyone else's, what really gets investors excited is an FDA decision allowing a new drug on the market. Here are some of the most important drugs awaiting approval in the next month.
"
1802,AGN,"Note that these dates are deadlines — sometimes the agency will render its decision earlier.
"
1803,AGN," March 28: It will be showtime for Biogen Idec (BIIB) as the agency decides the fate of its multiple-sclerosis candidate BG-12. Expectations of a blockbuster have been running high on Wall Street as the drug's study results have shown it to be a relatively safe and effective treatment that can go head to head with the new group of oral treatments led by Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya and Sanofi's (SNY) Aubagio. Analysts' consensus calls for $350 million to $400 million in this truncated year alone, expected to ramp into the billions.
"
1804,AGN,"Because the trial data was good, just about everyone expects BG-12 to be approved. The main question is what sort of safety warnings will come on the label. The longer-than-expected review time the FDA has been taking revived stories of a study tying BG-12 to kidney cancer in animals that first emerged some years ago, leading to rumors that it might get the dreaded ""black box"" label that goes on the riskiest drugs. The stock action, however, has underlined investor confidence lately, with shares hitting an all-time high of 178.74 early Friday before retreating slightly.
"
1805,AGN," March 31: As IBD reported last month, United Therapeutics (UTHR) shocked Wall Street by refiling for approval of its previously rejected oral version of bestselling lung drug Remodulin. The FDA not only accepted the filing but gave itself an unusually short six weeks to review the new application. Analysts at the time offered mixed opinions about whether the effort will succeed, but the stock market has been optimistic, with shares rising 14% since the refiling was announced.
"
1806,AGN," Also on March 31, the FDA is set to render a verdict on Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana, a diabetes drug that in clinical trials compared favorably with Merck's (MRK) popular Januvia. This will be interesting because the FDA has been getting hardline about diabetes drugs' safety issues lately. Last month it dismayed investors by demanding more data from Novo Nordisk (NVO) on the heart risks associated with its drug candidate insulin degludec. And on Thursday word got out that the FDA is investigating a possible connection between several diabetes drugs, including Januvia, and pancreatic cancer.
"
1807,AGN," April 15: As Americans turn over a cut of their income to Uncle Sam, investors in Allergan (AGN) are hoping for a return on the company's recent buyout of Map Pharmaceuticals. On this day, the FDA is slated to render a verdict on Map's lead product candidate Levadex, an inhaled treatment for migraine. Allergan made the $958 million deal to extend the migraine franchise it began to develop after it won approval to use its wrinkle treatment Botox for that purpose. Analysts hope this will move Allergan toward a cycle-resistant medical business, making it less dependent on cosmetic procedures.Investing in drug stocks isn't quite like investing in other stocks.

"
1820,AGN,"The rumor mill is showing no signs of letting up, nearly a month after reports first surfaced that generic-drug maker Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) is close to making its biggest buyout ever.
"
1821,AGN,"According to the latest reports, Watson is on track to announce a $6 billion acquisition of Swiss drugmaker Actavis by the end of this month.
"
1822,AGN,"If the deal goes through, it would create one of the world's largest generic-drug makers.
"
1823,AGN,"A recent report from Reuters said banks are lining up to back the transaction, with Bank of America (BAC) said to be the front-runner. Watson reportedly is also being pursued by several other large money-center banks, though officials with the drugmaker have declined comment.
"
1824,AGN,"Rumors of the deal were first reported March 21. Watson's stock price shot up 8.8% that day and 3.8% the next day, closing at 66.10. Shares continue to trade near there.
"
1825,AGN,"Wall Street immediately embraced the deal, despite the fact it's a sizable one for Watson.
"
1826,AGN,"Previous Buyouts
"
1827,AGN,"The company has made big buyouts before. It paid $1.75 billion for Arrow Group in 2009 and $1.9 billion for Andrx three years earlier. But nothing on the scale of $6 billion.
"
1828,AGN,"Still, most analysts say such a transaction makes sense for Watson.
"
1829,AGN,"""While we need additional financial details of the potential transaction, we believe this combination has strong strategic rationale,"" JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott noted in a March 21 report. ""It would be meaningfully accretive to earnings and would give Watson the scale it needs to compete globally.""
"
1830,AGN,"For months, analysts have wondered whether Watson will pursue the kind of large-scale deal that would kick it into a much higher income bracket.
"
1831,AGN,"Following Watson's fourth-quarter earnings report in February, Citigroup analyst John Boris said Watson Chief Executive Paul Bisaro had been ""very vocal on acquisitions. Watson noted it could do one or two 'large transactions.' Watson also indicated that it would be willing to issue equity for a larger 'transformational deal.'""
"
1832,AGN,"A buyout of Actavis would qualify as a transformational deal. The privately held firm's top U.S products include the Oxycodone pain medication, the Kadian brand opioid pain reliever, and generic versions of Ambien CR and Neurontin.
"
1833,AGN,"In a 2006 presentation, Actavis said around 40% of its business was in the U.S. About 25% came from Western Europe, and 20% came from Central and Eastern Europe.
"
1834,AGN,"""Actavis also has operations in Asia and Latin America and was making Latin America a priority in recent years,"" Schott noted.
"
1835,AGN,"One advantage of the deal is that it would help Watson better compete against larger generic-drug firms, such as Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Novartis' (NOV) Sandoz unit.
"
1836,AGN,"Israel-based Teva is the world's largest generic-drug maker with $18.5 billion in sales last year. Sandoz had $9.5 billion in 2011 sales.
"
1837,AGN,"Watson reported $4.6 billion in sales last year. Analysts expect it to log $5.5 billion this year. No details are available on sales at Actavis.
"
1838,AGN,"While much of Wall Street keeps its eye on Watson's possible buy of Actavis, the company itself has kept busy trying to grow its revenue base in other ways.
"
1839,AGN,"On April 10, Watson said the Food and Drug Administration approved its generic version of ViroPharma's (VPHM) Vancocin antibiotic. Although ViroPharma has taken steps to temporarily block generic Vancocin, Watson has started shipping the drug, which logged sales of $332 million for the 12 months ended Feb. 29.
"
1840,AGN,"Watson also recently announced that the FDA approved the company's abbreviated new drug application for a generic version of Roche Holding's (RHHBY) Boniva drug for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
"
1841,AGN,"In a note, Zacks Equity Research said U.S. sales of Boniva were $510 million for the year ended Jan. 31.
"
1842,AGN,"Meanwhile, Watson recently confirmed it has filed an abbreviated new drug application to sell a generic version of Allergan's (AGN) Lumigan and Latisse drugs. Allergan responded by filing a lawsuit against Watson in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
"
1843,AGN,"Financially, Watson has been on a strong run of late. Earnings have grown at least 23% the last three quarters, while revenue has risen at least 22% over the same period.
"
1844,AGN,"Earnings Growth
"
1845,AGN,"Last quarter, Watson earned $1.77 a share, up 90% from the prior year. It was the steepest quarterly earnings gain in years and topped Wall Street views by 2 cents.
"
1846,AGN,"Revenue climbed 62% to $1.54 billion, in line with estimates. Sales of generic drugs showed an 81% increase, to $1.17 billion.
"
1847,AGN,"The quarter also marked Watson's launch of generic Lipitor, the blockbuster cholesterol drug. Lipitor lost its U.S. patent protection on Nov. 30.
"
1848,AGN,"Watson and India's Ranbaxy are the only two companies selling copycat versions of Lipitor now, though other drugmakers are expected to start selling versions in June.
"
1849,AGN,"""Watson has guided to $250 million to $260 million gross profit from Lipitor during exclusivity, which translates into sales of $550 million to $600 million,"" noted Manoj Garg, an analyst at Edelweiss Research. ""We highlight that Watson had launched Lipitor a week prior to Ranbaxy and garnered significant market share.""
"
1850,AGN,"Watson also has a small but growing branded-drug business that posted fourth-quarter revenue of $121 million, up 17% from the prior year.

1851,AGN,"The company is expected to report first-quarter results April 24. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $1.60 a share, up 80% from the prior year.The rumor mill is showing no signs of letting up, nearly a month after reports first surfaced that generic-drug maker Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) is close to making its biggest buyout ever.According to the latest reports, Watson is on track to announce a $6 billion acquisition of Swiss drugmaker Actavis by the end of this month.If the deal goes through, it would create one of the world's largest generic-drug makers.A recent report from Reuters said banks are lining up to back the transaction, with Bank of America (BAC) said to be the front-runner. Watson reportedly is also being pursued by several other large money-center banks, though officials with the drugmaker have declined comment.Rumors of the deal were first reported March 21. Watson's stock price shot up 8.8% that day and 3.8% the next day, closing at 66.10. Shares continue to trade near there.Wall Street immediately embraced the deal, despite the fact it's a sizable one for Watson.Previous BuyoutsThe company has made big buyouts before. It paid $1.75 billion for Arrow Group in 2009 and $1.9 billion for Andrx three years earlier. But nothing on the scale of $6 billion.Still, most analysts say such a transaction makes sense for Watson.""While we need additional financial details of the potential transaction, we believe this combination has strong strategic rationale,"" JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott noted in a March 21 report. ""It would be meaningfully accretive to earnings and would give Watson the scale it needs to compete globally.""For months, analysts have wondered whether Watson will pursue the kind of large-scale deal that would kick it into a much higher income bracket.Following Watson's fourth-quarter earnings report in February, Citigroup analyst John Boris said Watson Chief Executive Paul Bisaro had been ""very vocal on acquisitions. Watson noted it could do one or two 'large transactions.' Watson also indicated that it would be willing to issue equity for a larger 'transformational deal.'""A buyout of Actavis would qualify as a transformational deal. The privately held firm's top U.S products include the Oxycodone pain medication, the Kadian brand opioid pain reliever, and generic versions of Ambien CR and Neurontin.In a 2006 presentation, Actavis said around 40% of its business was in the U.S. About 25% came from Western Europe, and 20% came from Central and Eastern Europe.""Actavis also has operations in Asia and Latin America and was making Latin America a priority in recent years,"" Schott noted.One advantage of the deal is that it would help Watson better compete against larger generic-drug firms, such as Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Novartis' (NOV) Sandoz unit.Israel-based Teva is the world's largest generic-drug maker with $18.5 billion in sales last year. Sandoz had $9.5 billion in 2011 sales.Watson reported $4.6 billion in sales last year. Analysts expect it to log $5.5 billion this year. No details are available on sales at Actavis.While much of Wall Street keeps its eye on Watson's possible buy of Actavis, the company itself has kept busy trying to grow its revenue base in other ways.On April 10, Watson said the Food and Drug Administration approved its generic version of ViroPharma's (VPHM) Vancocin antibiotic. Although ViroPharma has taken steps to temporarily block generic Vancocin, Watson has started shipping the drug, which logged sales of $332 million for the 12 months ended Feb. 29.Watson also recently announced that the FDA approved the company's abbreviated new drug application for a generic version of Roche Holding's (RHHBY) Boniva drug for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.In a note, Zacks Equity Research said U.S. sales of Boniva were $510 million for the year ended Jan. 31.Meanwhile, Watson recently confirmed it has filed an abbreviated new drug application to sell a generic version of Allergan's (AGN) Lumigan and Latisse drugs. Allergan responded by filing a lawsuit against Watson in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.Financially, Watson has been on a strong run of late. Earnings have grown at least 23% the last three quarters, while revenue has risen at least 22% over the same period.Earnings GrowthLast quarter, Watson earned $1.77 a share, up 90% from the prior year. It was the steepest quarterly earnings gain in years and topped Wall Street views by 2 cents.Revenue climbed 62% to $1.54 billion, in line with estimates. Sales of generic drugs showed an 81% increase, to $1.17 billion.The quarter also marked Watson's launch of generic Lipitor, the blockbuster cholesterol drug. Lipitor lost its U.S. patent protection on Nov. 30.Watson and India's Ranbaxy are the only two companies selling copycat versions of Lipitor now, though other drugmakers are expected to start selling versions in June.""Watson has guided to $250 million to $260 million gross profit from Lipitor during exclusivity, which translates into sales of $550 million to $600 million,"" noted Manoj Garg, an analyst at Edelweiss Research. ""We highlight that Watson had launched Lipitor a week prior to Ranbaxy and garnered significant market share.""Watson also has a small but growing branded-drug business that posted fourth-quarter revenue of $121 million, up 17% from the prior year.The company is expected to report first-quarter results April 24. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $1.60 a share, up 80% from the prior year.

2148,AGN,"**Breaking News — 4 am (est)….Turkey intelligence tells us they (Turkey) took out a Russian Fighter Jet that had crossed over into Turkish airspace....early reports suggest that they had warned the fighter jet - yet that warning must have fallen on deaf ears as they shot it out of the sky….US futures turned sharply lower on this news - going from +3 to -10.......European mkts are also now sharply lower FTSE -0.93%, CAC 40 - 1.52%, DAX -0.89%, EUROSTOXX - 1.1%, SPAIN-1.53% and ITALY -1.2%….. more to follow as the darkness turns to light**
"
2149,AGN,"Asian mkts closed mixed  overnight and as noted European mkts are lower following an uninspiring day yesterday here in the states as well as in Asia.  Concerns over terrorist threats and the latest news continues to dominate the conversation - Brussels is on lockdown for the 4th straight day as police hunt for a 'prime suspect' responsible for the Paris attacks, the US and 'allied nations' continue to punish ISIS and the US issues a 'global travel warning' ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.    Yesterday stocks rose at the opening bell only to sell off as we moved into the close. It seemed that neither the bulls nor the bears were really in control as the mkt waffled.  The major indexes finished the day just south of the unchanged line — The Dow lower by 31pts, the Nasdaq unchanged while the S&P 500 slipped 2 points. (The   small cap Russell 2000 was the only bright spot adding 5 pts.) Trading volumes were lighter as so many stuck to the sidelines on the heels of the volatility seen over the past few weeks and concern over some of the upcoming macro data due out today.  Remember — this week is usually a good week for stocks — but I think there is this new concern out there on a number of fronts....……Will Black Friday/Cyber Monday live up to their reputation considering all of the weak macro data of late - and is Black Friday really a thing anyway?  The sales have been going on for weeks now....so it's almost comical to see how all these retailers are positioning themselves and then what the media will have to say about the 'blowout' Black Friday numbers......(Yawn...).  On the other hand - many are now worried over the possibility of more terrorist attacks around the world in the weeks ahead as so many celebrate the holidays over the next five weeks.
"
2150,AGN,"On the deal front - Yesterday brought the news that Pfizer (American based) and Allergan (AGN) (Ireland based)  had in fact reached a 'deal' to combine companies allowing Pfizer (PFE) engage in a 'reverse merger' — taking full advantage of the inversion trade that we spoke about last week.  This deal valued at $150 billion will not only create the world’s biggest drug maker — but it will also result in huge tax savings for the newly combined company that will now be domiciled in Dublin — where corp tax rates are a fraction of the 35% rate here in the states.  The ink was not even dry yet on the morning papers before the screaming started over whose fault this was and how could this happen?  For Pfizer it is a brilliant deal right?  They took full advantage of a broken US corp tax system — a system that has been broken for years but that no one in DC chooses to address.....— yes they may recognize it and may have been talking about it ad naseum but in the end they have done NOTHING and now they are all screaming about it.  GOP frontrunner — The Donald — called the deal 'disgusting' and took direct aim at the politicians saying that ""our politicians should be ashamed of themselves for a tax system that encourages such moves…”  this coincidentally from someone that has used the system to his advantage (via bankruptcy)  a number of times makes you wonder - if he were in a position to do an inversion deal and cut his taxes via a sanctioned loop hole - what would he do???  But he is now running for President — so I guess his perspective changes.  The Democrats — not be out done - jumped on the bandwagon as well with Cousin Bernie (Sanders) — a former US Senator -  calling it 'disgusting' while encouraging the current administration to block it.  Hillary — the former US senator, Secretary of State and first lady — said that she would all of a sudden - 'propose specific business tax proposals while urging Congress to act immediately to make sure the biggest corporations pay their fair share so that the US taxpayer is not left holding the bag' .
"
2151,AGN,"Interesting to note here is that both Sanders and Clinton were members of Congress — and neither one of them chose to make US corp tax policy or individual tax policy a top issue during their tenure…..but now that they are running for President — so I guess their perspective changes as well.  Funny how that works — no?  So with all this political and economic uncertainty hanging around, coupled with the recent volatility - it is no wonder really that trading is lackluster and directionless.  We usually see activity like this when a trend has run its course (in either direction) — when the mkt appears a bit exhausted — when neither side is in control.   This kind of action creates that technical pattern  known as a ‘spinning top candlestick pattern’.  Spinning tops are candlesticks patterns with small real bodies (representing a tight trading range) that represent the tug of war between the bulls and the bears while having rather long tails on both ends - suggesting that both sides had control at one point during the day - but in the end - backed down.  This technical pattern indicates that neither the bulls nor the bears are in control.  They are just 'spinning their wheels'.  The tight trading range suggests that a possible reversal of trend is in the works....and that the possibility of such a reversal is enough to keep traders/investors on the sidelines until the trend stabilizes.  Despite this being a shortened week there will still be a slew of U.S. economic data out over the next few days. We will see reports on home sales and personal consumption - exp of +3.2%....   Today though,  we look for a revised read on 3rd qtr GDP .  The expectation if for the revision to show a rate of 2.1% vs. the initial read of +1.5%.....by now we all know that the initial inventory build component was on the low side in  the first go around so a revised inventory build will be the reason for the increase in the revision.......
"
2152,AGN,"News of the latest attack on a Russian jet will change the course of the conversation and mkt action today.   Unless the macro data today surprises the mkts — I do not expect to break up thru resistance or down thru support — yet this new international headline will be cause for renewed concern and caution forcing mkts lower as the day moves on - because it's all about the new uncertainty and the fact that it was a Russian fighter jet only causes more anxiety that threaten to escalate tensions even more.   Look for support at S&P 2065..... Take good care    Kp

2154,AGN,"If there's one nearly universal experience of getting older, it's failing eyesight. In middle age, many of us start needing glasses to focus on fine details — and for some, the problems get much worse. One of the more severe forms of old-age vision loss is age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The macula is the very center of the retina, so…

2155,AGN,"As per a statement released by media sources, Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is all set to exit its antibacterial and antiviral research program.The Swiss pharma giant also plans to reduce the headcount at Emeryville, CA, campus of Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) by about 140.The company is reportedly in discussions to out-license its preclinical programs as well as antibiotic LYS228. The candidate is being evaluated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) and complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) in phase II studies.Per the company, it is in the process of prioritizing its resources in core areas.The company, however, plans to retain 150 employees in the San Francisco Bay area across the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD) and other functions.Novartis is not the only company to exit this space, which was once deemed promising. Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) too is reportedly looking to sell its infectious disease unit.  Earlier, in 2016, AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) sold its anti-infectives business, primarily outside the United States, to Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report).Novartis is looking to restructure its business, of late. We remind investors that earlier this month Novartis announced that it intends to spin-off its ophthalmology division, Alcon, into a separately-traded standalone company in order to grow as a medicines company solely.The Alcon business wasn’t performing as per management’s expectations. Although it did revive in between, the company decided to spin-off the same in order to focus better on its legacy drug business.Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and Kisqali, which continue to boost its sales. However, it is facing the loss of patent protection for some of the key drugs. Consequently, the company has restructured its business and plans to focus on building its portfolio in markets, which promise potential.Novartis’ shares have declined 2.6% in the year so far compared with the industry’s gain of 1.2%. Novartis is looking to solidify its presence in the gene therapy space. Earlier, it acquired U.S.-based clinical stage gene therapy company, AveXis, Inc.Zacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2156,AGN,"Shares of Adamis Pharmaceuticals (ADMP  -  Free Report) surged 50% after the company announced that it entered into an exclusive distribution and commercialization agreement for its Symjepi (epinephrine) with Swiss pharma giant Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz.Terms of the AgreementPer the agreement, Sandoz will own the commercial rights to Symjepi in the United States, in exchange for an upfront fee and potential performance-based milestone payments. Both companies will share the profits equally. We note that Symjepi Injection 0.3 mg was approved by the FDA in 2017 for use in the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Sandoz will also get commercial rights for Symjepi Injection 0.15mg, upon approval, as the product is under FDA review for now. On the other hand, Adamis will retain the right to commercialize both products in territories outside the United States. Sandoz, however, gets the first right of negotiation for such territories.Adamis also has the option to develop Symject injection platform for additional product candidates, including the naloxone product candidate being developed to treat opioid overdose.How Will Adamis Gain?Adamis will get Novartis as a strong commercial partner, given the latter’s dominant position in the pharmaceutical market. Moreover, the financial terms of the agreement are favorable for Adamis, as it will get an upfront fee and milestone payments.We remind investors that Symjepi competes with Mylan‘s (MYL  -  Free Report) EpiPen, and Adamis had been on the lookout for a commercial partner, for long. Earlier in 2016, Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) had terminated its license agreement to commercialize the product, which was then not approved by the FDA.Hence, the agreement with Novartis bodes well for Adamis. The news boosted investors’ sentiment as well. Adamis’ stock gained 9.1% in the year so far, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2.9%. On the other hand, the addition of Symjepi will further expand Sandoz’s existing portfolio, given the market potential of epinephrine.Zacks RankAdamis currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2157,AGN,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical - Generic Drugs sector have probably already heard of Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Allergan is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Amphastar Pharmaceuticals has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that AGN is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.AGN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.38, while AMPH has a forward P/E of 51.29. We also note that AGN has a PEG ratio of 1.19. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AMPH currently has a PEG ratio of 2.28.Another notable valuation metric for AGN is its P/B ratio of 0.78. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AMPH has a P/B of 2.17.These metrics, and several others, help AGN earn a Value grade of B, while AMPH has been given a Value grade of C.AGN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than AMPH, so it seems like value investors will conclude that AGN is the superior option right now.

2159,AGN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Allergan has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.0. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Allergan’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.However, we should point out that Allergan has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 10.4, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates indicate that the company’s share price will likely appreciate in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Allergan has a P/S ratio of about 3.5. This is marginally higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Nonetheless, as we can see in the chart below, the current level is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, AGN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Allergan currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Allergan a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 4.2, which is far better than the industry average of 14.9.What About the Stock Overall?Though Allergan might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B. This gives AGN a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been trending higher. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen one upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by nearly 1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Allergan plc Price and Consensus  Allergan plc Price and Consensus | Allergan plc QuoteThis somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAllergan is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future. However, the company’s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors, as it has a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 16% out of more than 250 industries). In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2160,AGN,"Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PRTK  -  Free Report) announced that an FDA advisory committee will review the new drug application (NDA) for its lead antibiotic candidate, omadacycline, on Aug 8.The NDA, seeking approval for once-daily, oral and intravenous (IV) dosing of omadacycline, was filed with the FDA in April this year. With the regulatory body granting priority review to the NDA, a decision from the FDA is expected in early October. The candidate is also under review in the EU, with a decision is expected in the second half of this year.Omadacycline has been developed for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and acute bacterial skin plus skin structure infections (ABSSSI). The candidate enjoys Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations for treating CABP and ABSSSI.The NDA was supported by data from three pivotal studies — two in ABSSSI and one in CABP. Omadacycline met primary endpoints in each of these trials and was generally safe and well-tolerated during its evaluation process in both. Omadacycline is also being developed for the therapy of urinary tract infections.Apart from omadacycline, Paratek’s acne candidate, Seysara, is under review in the United States. It has been developed in partnership with Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report).Shares of Paratek have plunged 40.2% year to date, underperforming the industry’s decline of 5.8%. Paratek currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2161,AGN,"Allergan PLC (AGN  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a phase III study, evaluating its pipeline candidate Bimatoprost SR. Bimatoprost SR is Allergan’s investigational implant, developed as the first sustained-release drop-free treatment option for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.The phase III study (n=594) compared Bimatoprost SR applied on patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with timolol eye drops. The trial used two dosages of Bimatoprost SR administered in three cycles (Day 1, Week 16 and Week 32) compared with timolol eye drops, used twice daily for up to 20 months.Data from the study showed that Bimatoprost SR reduced IOP by approximately 30% over the 12-week primary efficacy period, demonstrating non-inferiority in case of timolol.Well received by the patients, Bimatoprost SR showed potential for patients staying on treatment free for more than a year after the last implant was inserted.In glaucoma patients, uncontrolled elevated IOP can lead to vision loss. In order to reduce elevated IOP, patients are prescribed eye drops. However, 80% of glaucoma patients fails to use eye drops as prescribed. Bimatoprost SR, if approved, will provide such patients with an option of a drop-free therapy and free them from daily eye drop regimens. Bimatoprost SR is designed to lower IOP for at least four months.Allergan is expected to report additional data and results from a second phase III study with an identical design in the first half of 2019. A new drug application (NDA) filing to the FDA is also anticipated during the second half of 2019.We would like to remind investors that earlier this week, Allergan announced that its second anti-CGRP candidate, atogepant, met its primary endpoint in a mid-stage study. The CGP-MD-01 study evaluated five doses of atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine over 12 weeks. Atogepant achieved a reduction of statistical significance in monthly migraine/probable migraine (MPM) headache, days from baseline for all doses.Allergan’s another oral anti-CGRP acute migraine treatment, ubrogepant, has already shown positive results in two phase III studies. However, the migraine market is growing extremely competitive. In May, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) received approval for commercializing their anti-CGRP drug, Aimovig, for treating episodic migraine.So far this year, shares of Allergan have increased 4% compared with the industry’s rise of 2.4%. Allergan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2162,AGN,"Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (“CGRP”) candidate, atogepant, met the primary endpoint in the phase II part of the phase IIb/III study. The CGP-MD-01 study was evaluating oral dosages of the candidate for the acute treatment of episodic migraine.Meanwhile, the company has another anti-CGRP candidate, ubrogepant, in its pipeline that demonstrated positive results in two phase III studies, evaluating it for the treatment of single migraine attack. The positive data readouts from the CGP-MD-01 study boosts the company’s anti-CGRP pipeline. The company is currently in discussion with regulatory authorities, following which it will advance atogepant to phase III stage of development.Allergan’s shares have increased 4.5% this year so far against the industry’s rise of 1.2%.The CGP-MD-01 study evaluated 5 doses of atogepant — once daily 10mg, 30mg and 60mg, and twice daily 30mg and 60mg — for the prevention of episodic migraine over 12 weeks. Atogepant achieved a reduction of statistical significance in monthly migraine/probable migraine (“MPM”) headache days from baseline for all doses.Allergan will present additional details at upcoming scientific meetings.Moreover, a potential approval for these candidates will boost the company’s migraine product line, which includes Botox for the treatment of chronic migraine. The oral administration will also help ubrogepant and atogepant gain an advantage over other injectable drugs, if approved.Meanwhile, the migraine space is attracting lot of interest due to its high unmet need. Several companies are developing treatments for this disease. In May, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) received approval for commercializing their anti-CGRP drug, Aimovig, for treating episodic migraine.

2163,AGN,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (“EC”) has approved label expansion of its blockbuster drug, Prolia. The drug is now approved for the treatment of bone loss associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy in adult patients at increased risk of fracture. This is also called glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.This is the third approved indication for Prolia in Europe. The approval is backed by increase in bone mineral density (“BMD”) achieved by the drug in a phase III study.A similar line extension application received approval in the United States last month.Prolia is presently marketed in Europe for the treatment of men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture as well as to increase bone mass in men with prostate cancer receiving hormone ablation.Amgen’s shares have increased 6% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 6.9%. The phase III study evaluated Prolia for improvement in BMD in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment, compared to Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Actonel (risedronate). The study comprises two patient groups – one with patients on sustained glucocorticoid treatment (glucocorticoid-continuing arm) and the second with patients initiating glucocorticoid therapy (glucocorticoid-initiating arm). In both arms, Prolia demonstrated greater improvement in lumbar spine BMD in patients at one year and two years compared to Actonel, the study’s primary endpoint.Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. Per the press release, 30% to 40% of the patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment for the long term have shown vertebral fractures. Although the proportion of eligible patients is small, this line extension is likely to boost sales of the drug further.Prolia is one of the major revenue sources for Amgen and is witnessing growth in market share in both the United States and internationally amid competition from generics of other drugs approved for osteoporosis. In the first quarter of 2018, the drug generated sales of almost half a billion dollars, up 16.5% year over year.The drug faces competition from generics of other branded drugs including Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Evista (alendronate), Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Fosamax (raloxifene) and Novartis’ Zometa (zoledronate).Amgen Inc.

2164,AGN,"This week was ruled by cancer data presentations at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) in Chicago by pharma bigwigs like Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report), among others. JAK inhibitors were in the news this week with Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) finally gaining FDA approval for its rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) candidate Olumiant (baricitinib) in the United States while AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) presented positive top-line data from its fifth late-stage study on upadacitinib in RA.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesUpdate from ASCO: Merck stole the show at ASCO after presenting data from several cancer studies of its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda. Key presentations were from two pivotal lung cancer trials. KEYNOTE-042 study evaluated Keytruda monotherapy in newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients while KEYNOTE-407 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy in difficult-to treat squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both the studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival. Particularly, data from the KEYNOTE- 407 study, which evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC was considered “practice changing” by investors.Four and five years follow-up data presented from two advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit. Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1. Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC.Bristol-Myers and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) presented preliminary data from a mid-stage study evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Bristol-Myers’PD-L1 inhibitor, Opdivo in several tumor types. The response rates in melanoma and kidney cancer patients did not impress investors, resulting in a 42% drop in Nektar’s stock on Monday.  (Read more: Nektar and Bristol-Myers Present Data on Cancer Study)Bristol-Myers also presented data on Opdivo at ASCO. In a late-stage study evaluating Opdivo versus Yervoy in a broad range of patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma, Opdivo demonstrated sustained, superior recurrence-free survival versus Yervoy. In another study, Opdivo plus chemotherapy showed improved PFS versus chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer patients with PD-L1 expression <1%.Novartis (NVS) announced positive data from a combination study on breast cancer drug Kisqali and from two long-term leukemia studies on Tasigna. (Read more: Novartis Announces Positive Data on Kisqali and Tasigna).Roche presented data from a late-stage study, which showed that Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 29% in advanced squamous NSCLC patients versus chemotherapy alone.AbbVie presented early data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of its cancer drugs Imbruvica plus Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The data demonstrated high rates of responses in such patients. Also, interim data from a late-stage study evaluating Imbruvica plus Roche’s Rituxan in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, showed that the combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 80% compared to placebo plus Rituxan.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca and J&J also made some cancer data presentations at the meeting.Lilly Gets FDA Nod for Lower Dose of Olumiant: Eli Lilly and partner Incyte gained FDA approval for the lower dose of (2 mg) of the companies’ JAK inhibitor, Olumiant. The FDA did not approve the higher dose (4 mg) and the drug’s label was approved with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis. Olumiant is already marketed in Europe and Japan and generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. In the United States, Lilly faced significant trouble in getting FDA nod for Olumiant. In April last year, the FDA had issued a complete response letter for the new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant, requesting additional information to determine the most appropriate doses. This year in April, an FDA advisory committee had recommended approval of the lower dose of the drug while not recommending the higher dose of 4 mg on inadequate safety profile to support an approval relative to its benefits. (Read more: Eli Lilly's Olumiant Gets FDA Nod for Rheumatoid Arthritis).AbbVie’s 5th Late-Stage Upadacitinib Study Succeeds: AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, met all primary as well as secondary endpoints in the fifth phase III study from its SELECT program. Top-line data from the study showed thata significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib in both 15 and 30 mg doses achieved superior responses compared to chemotherapy agent methotrexate. AbbVie plans to submit regulatory applications for upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of the year.  (Read more: Abbvie’s Upadacitinib Fifth RA Study Data Positive)Allergan Under Activist Pressure to Split CEO-Chairman Roles: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) was under pressure this week after two hedge-fund firms, Senator Investment Group and Appaloosa, disclosed a letter urging the company to engage in a management and board overhaul. The firms asked the pharmaceutical company to split its chairman and chief executive roles, both presently held by Brent Saunders, among other management changes. Appaloosa run by David Tepper and Senator Investment Group run by Douglas Silverman, suggested an outsider should be hired for either of the roles.

2165,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) issued a statement in response to a letter from public shareholders from Appaloosa and Senator Investment Group of the company expressing disappointment on the recently announced strategic plan to divest the women's health and infectious disease units.Activist investors Tepper from Appaloosa and Douglas Silverman from Senator Investment Group and have requested to split Brent Saunders' responsibilities, who is currently the chairman as well as the chief executive officer (“CEO”). They suggested recruiting a new chairman or CEO who is not from the company, replacement of two additional board members and changes to management of critical operating units. They are of the view that the company needs fresh ideas. They believe the above changes are required to drive returns or else share prices will continue to decline.In its statement, the company stated that its board and management are open to inputs from all shareholders and considers the same while making decisions. They are focused on building a world class company and drive return for shareholders.On its earnings call held in May, Allergan management discussed several strategic plans including divestment and share buybacks. The company recently concluded its strategic review and announced that it will focus on its leading four therapeutic areas – medical aesthetics, CNS, eye care and GI – and will divest the two units mentioned above. In January, the company cut jobs as part of a restructuring process.Moreover, Allergan also mentioned that the board has been refreshed with the addition of three members in the last 16 months.Meanwhile, the shareholders have rejected the proposal of splitting the role of Brent and appointment of an independent chairman during the annual general meeting held in May.So far this year, Allergan’s share price has declined 7% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.4%.We note that Allergan recorded strong earnings in the first quarter and also announced successful results from clinical studies. However, its shares are declining as several of its key products are facing loss of exclusivity, which may have an unfavorable impact on the top line.Restasis, a major revenue contributor, is facing stiff competition with the launch of Shire plc’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) dry eye disease drug Xiidra last year. Its sales have declined more than 17% in the first quarter. A generic version of the drug may also be launched by mid-2018. Meanwhile, Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s (SGYP  -  Free Report) Trulance, which was approved for chronic idiopathic constipation last year is expected to increase competition for Linzess. Several companies are looking to bring generic version of the drug in the market. Moreover, in January, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched the generic version of Estrace vaginal cream, which saw sales erosion of more than 90% in the first quarter.The company estimated that the products losing exclusivity were worth $3 billion in 2017. We expect a significant decline in revenues from these products.Allergan plc Price  Allergan plc Price | Allergan plc QuoteAllergan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2166,AGN,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Allergan plc (AGN. Shares have lost about 4.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AGN due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Allergan Beats on Q1 Earnings & SalesAllergan’s first-quarter 2018 earnings came in at $3.74 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.36 as well as the guided range of $3.20-$3.40. Earnings rose 11.6% year over year driven by higher revenues and lower operating costs.Revenues came in at $3.67 billion, which marginally exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.59 billion as well as the guided range of $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion. Revenues rose 2.8% from the year-ago period. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of M&A and foreign exchange, sales grew 6% in the quarter.Key products like Botox, Juvéderm collection of fillers, Linzess and Lo Loestrin continued to do well in the quarter. However, lower sales of Namenda XR, Estrace, Minastrin and Asacol due to generic competition hurt first-quarter sales by $200 million.First-quarter revenues also benefited from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from Zeltiq (April 2017) acquisitions.Segment DiscussionAllergan reports revenues under three segments – U.S. General Medicine, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics and International.U.S. Specialized Therapeutics’ net revenues increased 6.5% to $1.58 billion driven by continued strong performance of its facial aesthetics products, Botox and Juvéderm collection of fillers.In Facial Aesthetics, Botox (cosmetic) raked in sales of $196.7 million, up 7% year over year while Juvéderm collection of fillers rose 2.5% to $122.8 million. However, sales of Botox (cosmetic) and Juvéderm were hurt by unfavorable timing of promotional offers and year-end physician rebate program in the quarter. However, Allergan is optimistic that their sales trends will normalize over the remainder of the year. On the call, Allergan said that sales for Botox (cosmetic) and Juvéderm are expected to increase at double-digit rates in 2018.In Eye Care, while Ozurdex sales rose 13.3% to $25.5 million, Restasis’ sales decreased 17.2% to $255.8 million hurt by unfavorable trade buying patterns and lower selling price. Botox Therapeutic revenues were $358.5 million, up 16.1% driven by demand growth. In Plastic Surgery, breast implants sales increased 11.8%, which contributed to the upside. In Medical Dermatology, Aczone sales plunged 60.6% in the reported quarter to $16 million due to generic pressure on the branded acne category and higher discounts to maintain formulary coverage and a generic launch of Aczone 5%.LifeCell’s Alloderm added $99.5 million while Zeltiq’s CoolSculpting business added $87.1 million to sales in the quarter.U.S. General Medicine net revenues were down 9.1% year over year to $1.22 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands, Central Nervous System (CNS) and Women's Health franchises. Anti-Infectives sales rose 28.5% to $71.6 million and Gastrointestinal inched up 0.3% to $388.7 million.Lower sales of Namenda XR, Estrace, Minastrin and Asacol due to generic competition hurt sales in this segment, which were partially offset by strong growth from Vraylar, Linzess and Lo Loestrin.Linzess’ sales rose 7.9% to $159.3 million, driven by strong demand. Lo Loestrin sales rose 14.8% to $114.6 million driven by higher average selling prices and increased demand.Among the newer products, Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept, recorded sales of $33.4 million, less than $36.8 million in the previous quarter. Viberzi recorded sales of $35.9 million, also less than $42.9 million in the previous quarter. Vraylar sales were $84.4 million in the first quarter, lower than $87.7 in the previous quarter due to first quarter seasonality and unfavorable payer dynamics. However, Vraylar volume grew 11% on a sequential basis supported by demand growth.Namenda XR sales slumped 66.8% to $40.5 million in the reported quarter due to generic competition following loss of exclusivity in February.Estrace cream sales declined 91.3% to $6.4 million in the quarter.Asacol/Delzicol sales declined 33.7% to $38.2 million due to loss of exclusivity.In the Women’s Health segment, Minastrin 24 revenues plummeted 87.3% to $5.2 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity last March.The International segment recorded net revenues of $864 million, up 17.2% (up 9%, excluding foreign exchange) from the year-ago period, driven by growth in Medical Aesthetics, Botox (therapeutic) and Eye Care.Profits RiseAdjusted gross margin declined 110 basis points (bps) in the quarter to 86.2% hurt by unfavorable product mix due to loss of exclusivity of higher margin products.Adjusted operating income increased 8.7% to $1.76 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted operating margin rose 260 bps in the quarter to 47.9% due to lower operating costs.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 5.2% to $1.05 billion in the first quarter owing to a substantial reduction in selling and marketing spending from the successful execution of the restructuring program.Research and development (R&D) expenses also declined 9.7% to $355.8 million due to pipeline re-prioritization.Other DetailsIn the first quarter, Allergan paid down $3.6 billion in net debt and completed its $2 billion share repurchase program announced in September 2017.2018 OutlookAllergan raised its earnings and sales guidance range for 2018. A better-than-expected first-quarter performance, lower share count and a delay in generic Restasis entry led to the increase in the guidance. A generic version of Restasis is now expected to be launched between May and July versus April to July expected previously, adding $80 million per month to the top-line projections.Allergan lifted its sales guidance to an approximate range of $15.15-$15.35 billion compared with the earlier forecast of $15.0-$15.3 billion.Meanwhile, the company also raised its adjusted earnings expectation in the band of $15.65-$16.25 per share from $15.25-$16.00 guided earlier.The company maintained the guidance range for adjusted tax rate, gross margin, SG&A and R&D costs.Adjusted tax rate is still expected to be approximately 14% in 2018.Adjusted gross margin guidance is expected in the range of 85.5% and 86% which is lower than 2017 levels. Gross margins are expected to be hurt by loss of exclusivity of high-margin products — Restasis, Estrace and Delzicol — and unfavorable product mix.Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion while SG&A spend is expected to be approximately $4.25 billion.Operating margins in 2018 are expected to be in line with 2017 levels.Share count in 2018 is expected to be approximately 345 million shares versus the prior guidance of 350 million shares attributable to the earlier completion of the buyback.Strategic OptionsOn the call, Allergan said it is conducting a strategic review of its business due to the disconnect between its business performance and stock value. Management discussed several strategic options including incremental aggressive share buyback, divesting certain assets to concentrate more on key therapeutic areas, splitting the company and making smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Regarding M&A activity, Allergan said that though a large merger is unlikely, it may make product/pipeline acquisitions that could strengthen its key areas of therapeutic focus. Allergan’s CEO Brent Saunders also said that splitting the company is not quite likely to be the outcome of the strategic review as it could prove complicated and costlySecond-Quarter 2018 OutlookIn second-quarter 2018, revenues are anticipated between $3.85 billion and $4.0 billion while earnings per share are likely to be between $4 and $4.20.On the call, Allergan clarified that first-quarter earnings benefited from favorable timing of operating expenses, which will reverse in the remaining quarters of the year. This suggests that operating costs could be higher in the second quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been 16 revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower. Last month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 5.3% due to these changes.Allergan plc Price and Consensus  Allergan plc Price and Consensus | Allergan plc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, AGN has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B.

2167,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced a nationwide recall of some sample packs of Taytulla softgel oral contraceptive capsules (1mg/20mcg). Allergan said that four non-hormonal placebo pills were erroneously placed where the contraceptive capsules should have been. This instigated the recall following a physician report on the same.Allergan warned that the four inactive pills raise the risk of unintended pregnancy and the patients who have concerns should consult a doctor.Shares of Allergan were down almost 2% on Tuesday following the recall. In fact, so far this year, Allergan’s share price has declined 7.7%, compared with the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Despite a strong first-quarter performance and positive regulatory updates, shares of this pharma company continue to decline this year.We believe that this is because Allergan is facing loss of exclusivity for several of its key products and this will continue through 2018.This is what concerns analysts. While the first generic versions of Alzheimer’s treatment Namenda XR and Estrace cream were launched in the first quarter, that of blockbuster dry-eye drug, Restasis, Allergan’s second best-selling drug, is expected to be launched in the second quarter.A generic version of Delzicol is also expected to be launched in early second-quarter 2018.Allergan estimates that the products facing loss of exclusivity wereworth$3 billion in 2017. Sales of these products are expected to decline significantly in 2018 with the introduction of generics.On the first-quarter conference call, management addressed this disconnect between its business performance and stock value.

2168,AGN,"Shares of Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) have declined 4.4% since it reported its first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30. In fact, so far this year, Allergan’s share price has declined 5.3%, compared with the industry’s decline of 6.8%.Allergan’s first-quarter 2018 results were strong as it beat expectations for both earnings and revenues. Earnings rose 11.6% year over year, driven by higher revenues and lower operating costs. Revenues increased 6% on an organic basis excluding the impact of M&A and foreign exchange. Not only this, Allergan raised its earnings and sales guidance range for 2018.Also, this year, Allergan announced successful study results from two late-stage studies on its anti-CGRP acute migraine candidate, ubrogepant and a line extension study on Vraylar in bipolar I depression. Meanwhile, its anti-infective drug, Avycaz gained FDA nod for a third indication in the United States. It gained EU approval for Mvasi, Allergan and partner Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Avastin.Despite such strong quarterly performance and positive regulatory updates, shares of this pharma company continue to decline this year.We believe this is because Allergan is facing loss of exclusivity for several of its key products and it will continue through 2018.

2169,AGN,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (“GIOP”) in men and women at high risk of fracture or those who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.This is the fifth approved indication for Prolia. The approval is backed by increase in bone mineral density (“BMD”) achieved by the drug in a phase III study.The drug is presently marketed in the United States for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture as well as to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.Shares of Amgen were up 0.1% in after-market trading following the news. The company’s shares have rallied 1.5% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 9.8%.The phase III study evaluated Prolia for the treatment of GIOP patients in men and women at high risk of fracture or those who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy compared to Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Actonel (risedronate). The study comprises two patient groups – one with patients who have received glucocorticoid treatment for less than three months prior to study enrollment (glucocorticoid-initiating arm) and the second with patients who have received glucocorticoid treatment for at least three months (glucocorticoid-continuing arm). In both the arms, the glucocorticoid treatment was continued for at least six months.Data from the study showed that Prolia increased lumbar spine BMD by 3.8% compared with 0.8% by Actonel in glucocorticoid-initiating arm. Lumbar spine BMD in patients treated with Prolia in glucocorticoid-continuing arm increased 4.4% compared with 2.3% for Actonel.Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. This serious condition is presently treated with glucocorticoid treatment, which increases fracture risk within the first three months of treatment. Prolia can now cater to an expanded patient population and drive sales higher.Prolia is a key revenue generator for Amgen and is witnessing market share gains in both the United States and internationally amid competition from generics of other drugs approved for osteoporosis. In 2017, the drug generated sales of $1.97 billion, up 20% year over year.Prolia faces competition from several drugs, especially from generic versions of Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Evista (alendronate), Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Fosamax (raloxifene) and Novartis’ Zometa (zoledronate).Amgen Inc.

2170,AGN,"BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (BDSI  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 18 cents per share for first-quarter 2018, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents. However, in the year-ago quarter the company had recorded earnings of 87 cents per share.BioDelivery’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has declined 40.7% during the period compared with an 11.4% decrease for the industry.Revenues were $11.3 million in the reported quarter, down 61.7% from the year-ago period. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.78 million by a slight margin.The year-over-year decline in revenues was mainly due to the recognition of deferred revenues associated with the termination of a license agreement for Belbuca with Endo Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Endo International Plc (ENDP  -  Free Report).We remind investors that BioDelivery reacquired the worldwide rights to Belbuca in January 2017 from Endo. As a result of this reacquisition, the company started registering product revenues for Belbuca against royalties recorded previously.Excluding the deferred revenues, total sales rose 9% year over year.Quarter in DetailBioDelivery’s opioid-dependence drug, Bunavail, recorded $1.8 million sales in the quarter, down 43.8% year over year. However, revenues from the drug rose 5.9% sequentially.BioDelivery’s second marketed drug, Belbuca, for chronic pain, generated revenues of $8.0 million in the quarter, down 14.9% from the previous quarter. Sales rose 76% year over year.Prescription volume for Belbuca expanded 9% sequentially and 55% year over year supported by improved managed care coverage and expansion of sales force. In the quarter, BioDelivery signed new contracts with Humana, ProCareRx, and CVS/Caremark and improved coverage with UnitedHealthcare.In the month of March, the company recorded an all-time high in prescription volumes to more than 10,000 prescriptions. This marked an increase of nearly 20% from the previous high reached in January. Management seems confident that Belbuca will witness continued strong growth in 2018.Belbuca was made commercially available in Canada by BioDelivery’s partner Purdue Pharma for severe pain in January 2018, which can drive sales further in the future quarters.Research and development expenses declined 7% from the year-ago period to $2.48 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 1.9% year over year to $13.5 million in the quarter.Other Updates Earlier this week, BioDelivery Sciences announced the appointment of Herm Cukier as its new chief operating officer. Cukier was until now serving as the senior vice president at Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report).In February, BioDelivery entered into a settlement agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report), resolving its Belbuca patent litigation.

2171,AGN,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 loss of 83 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 89 cents but wider than the year-ago loss of 62 cents.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Quarter in DetailIn December 2017, Aerie's lead drug Rhopressa was approved by the FDA for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. This approval came two months ahead of the scheduled Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Feb 28, 2018. The launch is underway.In the reported quarter, research and development expenses increased 10.6% to $10.9 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses surged to $21.1 million from $10.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Also, higher operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of  2017 is primarily due to increased activities associated with the expansion of the employee base to support the growth of operations, and preparatory activities associated with Rhopressa commercialization efforts.Aerie is securing formulary contracts to enable commercial coverage in 2018 and Medicare Part D coverage in 2019. The company expects preferred formulary coverage for the majority of commercial plans by the end of 2018, and preferred formulary coverage for the majority of Medicare Part D plans commencing in 2019.Pipeline UpdatesAerie is currently evaluating its second candidate, Roclatan, a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Xalatan. The NDA for Roclatan is expected to be filed in second-quarter 2018.  The company initiated a phase III trial, Mercury 3, in the third quarter of 2017 to prepare for regulatory submission in Europe. The trial is a non-inferiority trial comparing Roclatan with prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort.Meanwhile, pre-IND activities are well underway for the further development of Aerie’s retina program candidates, including AR-13503 (Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor implant) and AR-1105 (dexamethasone steroid implant).OutlookAerie expects Rhopress revenues in the range of $20-$30 million in 2018. Total cash burn is projected in the range of $200-$210 million.Our TakeAerie reported a narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter.Aerie received a significant boost with the approval of lead candidate which will significantly boost its prospects as glaucoma is one of the largest segments in the global ophthalmic market.Aerie’s share price has outperformed the industry over the last 12 months. The stock has gained 24.5% compared with the industry’s upside of 1.7%.  However, Aerie faces a stiff competition from established, branded and generic pharmaceutical companies’ drugs such as Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Simbrinza and Travtan, and Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Lumigan as well as products of other smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical giants. Valeant Pharmaceutical’s (VRX  -  Free Report) Vyzulta is also approved for an open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

2172,AGN,"We expect BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (BDSI  -  Free Report) to beat estimates when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on May 10. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 31.82%.BioDelivery’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has declined 37.3% during the period compared with a 12.3% decrease for the industry.BioDelivery’s earnings history has been a mixed bag with the company surpassing expectations in two of the last four quarters and missing in the other two. It delivered an average beat of 127.29%. BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderBioDelivery’s key products include Belbuca (chronic pain) and Bunavail (opioid-dependence).Bunavail’s sales performance has been lackluster so far. However, BioDelivery is working on improving Bunavail’s performance. The company has reduced the number of sales territories and is focusing on the most growth-oriented territories to improve Bunavail’s profits.The company is also focusing on securing new or improved positioning on other managed care contracts either on an exclusive or preferred status. Bunavail sales growth remained unchanged sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2017. With a reduced cost structure combined with growth opportunities, it remains to be seen if sales of the drug improve in the first quarter.Belbuca’s start has also been slower-than-expected due to pain market pressure. We remind investors that BioDelivery had reacquired worldwide rights to Belbuca in January from Endo Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Endo International. As a result of this reacquisition, the company started recording product revenues for Belbuca against royalties recorded previously.The prescription volumes for Belbuca have shown improvement in the past couple of quarters following the re-acquisition. Sales of Belbuca improved sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe this positive trend will continue through 2018. Belbuca was made commercially available in Canada for severe pain in January 2018, which should support further sales growth of the drug.Earlier this week, BioDelivery Sciences announced the appointment of Herm Cukier as its new chief operating officer. Cukier was until now serving as the senior vice president at Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report). He will be introduced on BioDelivery’s first-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: BioDelivery has an Earnings ESP of +8.70%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of 21 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: BioDelivery has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of BioDelivery’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other health care stocks with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PRTK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.31% and currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release first-quarter results on May 9.Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.

2173,AGN,"The first-quarter earnings season has been relatively strong. However, the stock market’s recent performance is yet to reflect the strength. While positive revisions were seen ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season, the estimate revision trend for the second quarter has been rather underwhelming.As of May 4, 2018, 409 S&P 500 members reported results, according to the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings of these 409 index members increased 24% from the year-ago quarter on a 9.3% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 78% for earnings and 75.6% for revenues.Per the report, first-quarter earnings of the S&P 500 companies (combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies) are expected to grow 23.2% year over year on 8.7% higher revenues.Please note that the broader Medical sector (includes drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record year-over-year growth of 7.1% in revenues and 13.6% in earnings in Q1.The pharma bigwigs that reported last week included Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report). Merck and Pfizer beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. While Pfizer re-affirmed its previously issued guidance for 2018, Merck raised its outlook for both earnings and sales. Both the companies witnessed a relatively weaker top-line performance in the quarter. Allergan beat estimates for both earnings and revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and raised its 2018 guidance for both earnings and sales.Among the big biotechs, Celgene Corporation beat estimates for earnings as well as sales and raised its earnings expectations for the full year. Gilead’s earnings and sales missed estimates on wider-than-expected decline in HCV franchise.Here we have four small biotech/pharma companies that are set to report first-quarter results on May 8.

2174,AGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of 94 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents per share. However, earnings per share declined 11.3% year over year.Revenues came in at $5.1 billion, which also beat the consensus estimate of $4.8 billion. However, sales declined 10% year over year (down 15% excluding impact of currency).Sales were hurt by increased pricing erosion in the U.S. generics market and rapid erosion in sales of Teva’s key multiple sclerosis injection, Copaxone and divesture of some non-core assets. Segment DiscussionAs announced in November last year, Teva no longer reports two separate global groups for its two businesses – generics and specialty medicines. Instead, it reports under new segments based on three regions — North America, Europe and Growth Markets.North America segment sales were $2.5 billion, down 22% year over year due to pricing erosion in U.S. generics market, lower sales of Copaxone and divestiture of some non-core assets in the Women’s Health business. In the United States, revenues declined 23% to $2.4 billion.Lead branded product, Copaxone, posted sales of $476 million in North America, down 40% year over year due to generic competition for the 20 mg as well as the 40 mg formulation.Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is being marketed by Momenta and Sandoz - Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm - since 2015 while Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October 2017. In the same month, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg thrice-weekly formulation, much earlier than expected.With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone. Moreover, a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation (Glatopa) was launched by Sandoz in February this year, much earlier than its scheduled launch in April.On the call, Teva said that despite Mylan's introduction of a 40 mg generic, Copaxone still commands around 85% of volumes in the 40 mg market. However, Teva had to decrease the price of Copaxone by increasing rebates in connection with the generic competition.  The lower pricing helped it maintain its volume share. However, Teva expects tougher competition as the year progresses, which could exert some further pressure on pricing.Sales of other branded products Bendeka, Treanda, ProAir and Qvar increased in the quarter.The newest product in Teva’s branded portfolio, Austedo, recorded sales of $30 million in North America.Austedo (SD-809) was approved and launched in April 2017 for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease and for the second indication, tardive dyskinesia, in the United States in August.Generic products revenues declined 23% to $1.1 billion in the quarter due to lower volumes and price erosion. Significant competitive and pricing pressure is hurting the U.S. generics industry. The consolidation of customers in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Teva launched 10 generic products in the first quarterDistribution revenues, which are generated by Anda, rose 12% in the quarter to $331 million.In August 2016, Teva acquired Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics business – Actavis Generics – and Allergan’s Anda Inc., the fourth largest distributor of generic pharmaceuticals, in October 2016.The Europe segment recorded revenues of $1.44 billion, up 8% year over year. However, in constant currency terms, sales declined 6% due to loss of revenues from the closure of a distribution business in Hungary and divestiture of the women’s health business.Generic products (including OTC products) revenues in Europe rose 2% on a constant currency basis to $997 million due to new product launches and volume growth in OTC, partially offset by price decline. Copaxone sales declined 13% on a constant currency basis to $153 million due to price reductions following the entry of generics.In the Growth Markets, sales rose 4%. However, in constant currency terms, sales were flat in this segment as higher sales in Israel, Japan and Russia were partially offset by the effect of the deconsolidation of subsidiaries in Venezuela and loss of revenues from the sale of the women’s health business in these countries. While Generic products (including OTC) revenues declined 3% in constant currency terms to $488 million, Copaxone sales declined 24% to $16 million.The Other segment (API manufacturing business and certain contract manufacturing services) recorded revenues of $342 million, down 8% year over year due to lower API sales to third parties.Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 460 basis points (bps) to 52.3% in the quarter due to lower profitability in the North America segment. Adjusted research & development expenses declined 31% from the year-ago period to $289 million due to pipeline optimization. Selling and marketing (S&M) expenditure declined 20% from the year-ago level to $715 million due to cost cutting and re-structuring activities. Adjusted operating margin declined 40 bps to 28.3% in the quarter despite lower costs.2018 Outlook UppedTeva raised its 2018 sales and earnings guidance following the first-quarter beat. The revenue outlook was raised from a range of $18.3 - $18.8 billion to a range of $18.5 - $19.0 billion. The earnings guidance was raised from a band of $2.25–$2.50 per share to $2.40-2.65 per share.U.S. Generics sales are expected to decline roughly 20% from 2017 levels to approximately $4 billion in 2018 hurt by ongoing price erosion.Costs are expected to decline $1.5 billion in 2018 as a result of the company’s cost-savings initiatives.Free cash flow guidance was raised to $3.0-3.2 billion from $2.6-2.8 billion.Delay in FDA Approval of Migraine CandidateAlong with the earnings release, the company said it does not expect to get FDA approval for its pipeline candidate, fremanezumab for the prevention of chronic/episodic migraine on its PDUFA date in June. It said it expects a pre-approval inspection to take place soon. Teva expects fremanezumab to be approved and launched before the end of this year.We remind investors that in January, Teva’s partner Celltrion received an FDA warning letter for a facility in South Korea, following an inspection of the fill/finish side of the facility. This facility manufactures API for fremanezumab. In EU, a regulatory application for fremanezumab is under review.Please note that Lilly and Amgen are also on track to launch a new migraine treatment this year.Our TakeTeva beat expectations for both earnings and sales in the first quarter and also raised its full-year outlook for both the metrics. However, Teva’s stock declined more than 4% since the earnings release.Teva’s shares have declined 5.9% this year so far compared with the industry’s decline of 12.4%.The Israel-based generic drug maker had a tough 2017 as it faced significant challenges in the form of accelerated generic competition for Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches and a massive debt load of more than $30 billion.  Mylan’s earlier-than-expected launch of the first generic version of the 40-mg strength of Copaxone was a major setback for Teva.Teva divested some non-core assets last year (mainly in the Women’s Health business) to cut its significant debt load. The company also has a new organizational structure in place, is closing plants, cutting down its generics portfolio, eliminating low-value R&D projects, and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years as part of a restructuring plan it revealed in December last year. Teva is progressing well on these re-structuring activities and still expects to save almost $3 billion by the end of 2019 from these initiatives. Despite the progress on the restructuring activities and the fact that its financial position seems more stable than before, we believe Teva has a long way to go before gaining stability.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

2175,AGN,"First-quarter results of pharma bigwigs like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) stole the limelight this week. Other than that, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for the second indication of its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah. While AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) submitted a regulatory application in the EU for its psoriasis candidate, risankizumab, Merck’s PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda gained FDA’s Priority Review status for yet another label expansion application.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMixed Q1 Results for Merck & Pfizer: Both the pharma giants beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. While Pfizer re-affirmed its previously issued guidance for 2018, Merck raised its outlook for both earnings and sales. Both the companies witnessed a relatively weaker top-line performance in the quarter.For Merck, strong sales of Keytruda, Gardasil and Bridion were partially offset by lower sales of other key therapies – RotaTeq, Zepatier and Zostavax. Meanwhile, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs also hurt the top line.While for Pfizer, the top-line was hurt by decline in sales of key drugs like Lyrica, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, and Enbrel, loss of exclusivity for some products like Viagra and Pristiq and continued supply shortages in legacy Hospira products.Allergan beat estimates for both earnings and revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and raised its 2018 guidance for both earnings and sales.Novartis’ Kymriah Gets FDA Approval for Second Indication: Novartis’ supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) looking to get its CAR-T therapy Kymriah approved for the second indication was granted approval by the FDA. With the latest approval, Kymriah suspension has been approved for intravenous infusion for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma.Kymriah was the first CAR-T therapy to obtain FDA approval in August 2017 for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse.Separately, Novartis announced that the FDA has given a complete response letter to its BLA for its proposed biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Rituxan.Merck’s Keytruda in News: Merck’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) looking to get overall survival data from the phase III KEYNOTE-189 study included on the label of the PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda was granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA will give its decision on Sep 23, 2018.The study evaluated Keytruda, in combination with Lilly’s Alimta (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. The combination treatment improved overall survival regardless of PD-L1 expression including in patients whose tumors tested negative for PD-L1.Notably, in May 2017, this combination therapy was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. The approval was based on tumor response rate and PFS data from the KEYNOTE-021 study. Hence, the positive readouts from the KEYNOTE-189 confirmatory study will help the company gain continued approval for the combo therapy, which should support uptake and sales.Merck also announced interim data from another pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda, which met a pre-specified secondary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) in an early cohort of participants. The phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC.AbbVie Submits Application for Psoriasis Candidate in EU: AbbVie submitted a marketing application to the European regulatory authorities for investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, risankizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) is supported by data from four pivotal phase III studies. Data from these studies have shown that more than half of the patients receiving risankizumab achieved complete skin clearance at one year.Meanwhile, AbbVie also announced commencement of a self-tender offer for up to $7.5 billion of its common stock at a price not less than $99.00 per share and not more than $114.00 per share.United Therapeutics to Acquire SteadyMed: United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) announced a definitive merger agreement with SteadyMed Ltd. per which United Therapeutics will acquire the latter for $216 million including contingent payments. With the deal, United Therapeutics will add SteadyMed’s drug device pipeline product, Trevyent for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients to its portfolio. The product could have posed competition to United Therapeutics’ RemoSynch implantable pump, which is under review in the United States.Trevyent is a single-use, pre-filled pump that has been developed by SteadyMed to deliver a two-day supply of treprostinil subcutaneously using SteadyMed’s PatchPump technology to treat PAH. Though SteadyMed received a refuse-to-file letter from the FDA for want of further information, SteadyMed intends to resubmit its NDA by the end of 2018.Allergan’s Ubrogepant Succeeds in 2nd Phase III Study: Allergan announced that the second of two pivotal phase III studies evaluating its oral anti-CGRP acute migraine treatment ubrogepant met its co-primary endpoints. The phase III data showed ubrogepant displaying strong efficacy and a clean side effect profile.The ACHIEVE II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of orally administered ubrogepant (25 mg and 50 mg) for treating a single migraine attack of moderate-to-severe headache intensity.The study data demonstrated that a “significant greater percentage of patients” treated with ubrogepant, at both the doses, were free from pain at two hours after the initial dose as compared to those treated with placebo. Also, a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients taking the 50 mg dose experienced absence of the “most bothersome migraine-associated symptom” -- either photophobia, phonophobia or nausea -- at two hours after the initial dose compared to those treated with placebo. However, the 25 mg dose failed to demonstrate statistical significance in this endpoint.J&J Seeks Label Expansion of PAH Drug: J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Actelion submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA seeking approval for a label expansion of its PAH drug, Opsumit (macitentan) to include treatment of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).Also, J&J announced a definitive agreement to acquire private biotech, BeneVir Biopharm. BeneVir, which makes oncolytic immunotherapies utilizing its proprietary, T-Stealth Oncolytic Virus Platform and has potential in the treatment of solid tumorsThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 2.5% in the last five trading sessions.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Here is how the seven major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions:All stocks declined last week except AstraZeneca, which rose 1.4%.

2176,AGN,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IRWD  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 16 cents. However, the company had reported adjusted loss of 33 cents in the year-ago period.Total revenues (collaborative revenue) in the quarter amounted to $69.2 million, up 32.7% from the year-ago period, and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.5 million.Quarter in DetailAs reported by partner Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report), Ironwood’s key marketed product – Linzess (linaclotide) – generated U.S. net sales of $159.3 million, up 7.9% year over year.Please note that Ironwood and Allergan have an equal share in brand collaboration profits or losses. Ironwood's share of net profits from the sales of Linzess in the United States (included in collaborative revenues) was $61.2 million in the first quarter, up 23.7% year over year. Sales of linaclotide active pharmaceutical ingredient to the company’s Japanese partner Astellas Pharma added $5.4 million to revenues.According to data provided by IMS Health, Linzess prescriptions filled during the quarter were more than 764,000, up 9% from the year-ago period. The drug’s uptake continued to grow in 2018 following a strong performance in 2017 and it remained a market leader among branded prescription drugs.In January, Ironwood and Allergan settled a patent litigation related to an abbreviated new drug application of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, seeking approval of a generic version of Linzess. Per the settlement agreement, Sun Pharmaceuticals will be allowed to market an authorized generic version from Feb 1, 2031.Zurampic and Duzallo, approved for uncontrolled gout, generated sales of $0.6 million in the quarter. Duzallo was launched in October 2017 as an oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout.During the reported quarter, selling and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 11.4% to $61.9 million. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $37.1 million, up 8.3% from the year-ago periodRestructuring InitiativeIn a separate press release, Ironwood announced its intent to split the company into two separate entities. One entity, which will continue with the current name, will focus on the three commercial drugs and gastrointestinal (“GI”) pipeline development. The other entity will focus on the development of the Soluble Guanylate Cyclase pipeline for the treatment of serious and orphan diseases.The company expects to achieve increased operational performance and strategic flexibility following the completion of the restructuring process.The separation is expected to close in the first half of 2019.2018 GuidanceIronwood expects to incur charges related to its restructuring initiative. Hence, the company did not provide any financial guidance for the full year and plans to provide an update in the second-quarter earnings release.Pipeline UpdatesLinzess is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (“CIC”). Ironwood and Allergan are looking to broaden Linzess’ label into additional symptoms and develop the drug as a non-opioid, pain-relieving agent in IBS patients.A phase III study to evaluate Linzess in additional abdominal symptoms is expected to start in mid-2018. The companies are also in discussion with the FDA to start a phase IIb study to evaluate a delayed release formulation of linaclotide for treating all subtypes of IBS, including IBS-mixed and IBS with diarrhea.A label expansion of Linzess in the chronic constipation indication is under review in Japan. In China, Hong Kong and Macau, Ironwood has an agreement with AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) for Linzess. The regulatory filing in China for IBS-C is under review. The company expects the review to be completed in the first half of 2018.The company is also developing three candidates – IW-3718, Praliciguat (IW-1973) and Olinciguat (IW-1701) – for gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetic nephropathy and sickle cell disease, respectively. Ironwood expects to advance IW-3718 in phase III studies in the third quarter of 2018. Two phase II studies to evaluate Praliciguat in diabetic nephropathy and heart failure are currently enrolling patients.Our TakeThe company’s first-quarter loss was wider than estimated and sales also missed expectations. However, the stock was up 3.2% on May 1 on restructuring news. The prospect of the new Ironwood with its sole focus on marketed drugs and GI pipeline is more attractive with lower potential R&D costs.A look at the company’s share price movement shows that the stock has outperformed the industry this year so far. Ironwood’s shares have gained 24.7% during this period, while the industry declined 3.4%.Ironwood is focused on expanding Linzess’ label and its geography. Linzess’ sales growth is expected to continue in 2018, which will boost the top line. A potential approval in China will further boost sales of the drug.Meanwhile, we expect the new Ironwood to be able to be turn profitable faster as revenues grow and operating expenses decline after restructuring.Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2177,AGN,"U.S. stock markets ended in negative territory on Monday as a broad-based decline pushed all three major indexes in red. Slide into the healthcare and industrial stocks more than offset gains from several merger and acquisitions (M&A) except a telecom mega deal. Moreover, strong first quarter earnings results also failed to uplift investor’s sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,163.15, declining 0.6% or 148.04 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.8% to close at 2,648.05. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,066.27, decreasing 0.8%.

These three sectors led a broad-based market decline.Shares of Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) declined 4.5% after a Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) report stated that the company will require one-to-three years more to resubmit its applications for the U.S. approval of the company’s critical drug ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis.Shares of Allergen plc (AGN  -  Free Report) plunged 5.2% after its Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders expressed his view’s that he is opposed to any changes of the company’s fundamental business structure.

Net earnings came in at $0.09 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.03. Revenues generated $1,659 million exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,549 million. Investors were expecting more especially after President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel.Concern on Telecom Mega Deal Overshadows Slew of M&AsA number of M&As announcements helped markets advance in the initial hours of trading. Shares of Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) increased 1.3% after the retail giant’s U.K. arm, ASDA Group Ltd., agreed to merge with British supermarket chain J Sainsbury plc.

2178,AGN,"Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings came in at $3.74 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.36 by 11.3%.

Revenues also surpassed the past projection between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion.Key products like Botox and Juvéderm collection of fillers and new products like Vraylar, Viberzi and Namzaric did well in the quarter under review. However, sales erosion of Namenda XR and Aczone and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin, hurt the top line.First-quarter revenues also benefited from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (April 2017) acquisitions.Shares of Allergan increased almost 4% on Apr 30 in pre-market trading. The stock has lost 3.1% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s decline of 6.1%. Segment DiscussionThe company reports revenues under three segments, namely U.S. General Medicine, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics and International.U.S. Specialized Therapeutics’ net revenues increased 6.5% to $1.58 billion, driven by a consistently strong performance of its facial aesthetics products, Botox and Juvéderm Collection of fillers.Botox (cosmetic) raked in sales of $196.7 million (up 7% year over year).

Anti-Infectives sales rose 28.5% to $71.6 million and Gastrointestinal inched up 0.3% to $388.7 million.Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Namzaric, Viberzi and Vraylar did well in the first quarter. Linzess’ sales rose 7.9% to $159.3 million, driven by strong demand. Lo Loestrin sales rose 14.8% to $114.6 million, backed by strong demand trends.Among the newer products, Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept, recorded sales of $33.4 million, up 41.5% compared with the year-ago figure. Viberzi recorded sales of $35.9 million, up 14% year over year.Namenda XR sales slumped 66.8% to $40.5 million in the reported quarter due to loss of patent exclusivity for Namenda XR this February.Asacol/Delzicol sales declined 33.7% to $38.2 million due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in August 2016.In the Women’s Health segment, Minastrin 24 revenues plummeted 87.3% to $5.2 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity last March.The International segment logged net revenues of $864 million, up 17.2% from the year-ago period, driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics, Botox (therapeutic), Eye Care and the addition of CoolSculpting.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 5.2% to $1.05 billion in the first quarter owing to a substantial reduction in selling and marketing spending including the impact of previous restructurings.Research and development (R&D) expenses also declined 9.7% to $355.8 million due to reprioritization of R&D programs.2018 Outlook RaisedAllergan lifted its sales guidance in the approximate range of $15.15-$15.35 billion compared with the former forecast of $15.0-$15.3 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric in the current year is pegged at $15.22 billion.Meanwhile, the company also raised its adjusted earnings expectation in the band of $15.65-$16.25 per share from $15.25-$16, guided earlier.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally administered ubrogepant across two doses (25 mg and 50 mg) compared with placebo in a single migraine attack in adults.Data from the study demonstrated that a “significant greater percentage of patients” treated with ubrogepant under both dosages (25 mg and 50 mg) was free from pain at 2 hours after the initial dose as compared to those treated with placebo. Also, the 50 mg dose showed a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients achieving absence of the “most bothersome migraine-associated symptom” at 2 hours after the initial dose in comparison to patients treated with placebo. The company expects to submit a regulatory application for ubrogepant to the FDA in 2019.Allergan plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Allergan plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Allergan plc Quote Zacks Rank & Key PicksAllergan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2181,AGN,"We expect Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%.Allergan’s share price has declined 2.3% this year so far, compared with the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Allergan’s earnings performance has been strong, with the company beating expectations in each of the past four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 1.81%.Allergan plc Price and EPS Surprise  Allergan plc Price and EPS Surprise | Allergan plc QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOn the fourth-quarter 2017 conference call, the company guided first-quarter 2018 revenues  between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion while earnings per share are expected to be between $3.20 and $3.40. These numbers indicate the lowest revenue and earnings quarter for the year.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the favorable timing of physician rebating program benefited sales of Allergan’s facial aesthetics products. This benefit was absent in the first quarter of 2018, which will hurt revenues. As such, the company expects first-quarter revenue growth rate to be somewhat lower than the annual 2018 growth rate. Also, generic competition for Estrace and Namenda XR will hurt sales sharply in the first quarter.While a generic version of Namenda XR was launched by Indian company, Lupin in February that of Estrace cream was launched by Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) in January.Allergan expects a generic version of Restasis, its second best-selling drug, to be launched between April and July of 2018. Meanwhile, a generic version of Delzicol is expected to be launched in early second-quarter 2018.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments on the potential impact of generic competition on key growth drivers, Restasis and Namenda XR. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Restasis is $295 million.Nonetheless, Allergan’s established products like Botox, Linzess, Lo Loestrin and Juvéderm collection of fillers and new products like Juvéderm collection of fillers should support sales in Q1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Botox is $771 million.In fact, recent label expansions for Botox (FDA approval for forehead line treatment) and Vraylar (FDA approval for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia) and Avycaz (FDA approval for HABP/VABP) should add to sales of these drugs in Q1. Meanwhile, the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from Zeltiq (April 2017) acquisitions should continue to support the top line in the quarter.However, we believe sales erosion of Aczone due to generic pressure on the branded acne category and loss of exclusivity (LOE), mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin 24, will continue to hurt the top line.We remind investors that on the Q4 call, the company had said that it does not expect any significant M&A activities in 2018. Allergan expects to reevaluate its M&A strategy in the second half of the year once it gets through the LOEs. An update is expected at the upcoming conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.37 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.36 per share) is +0.14%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allergan has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Allergan’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some large-cap health care stocks worth considering per our model. These also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.82% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is also slated to announce financial figures on May 1.

2182,AGN,"We expect biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after market close. Amgen delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.93% in the last quarter.Amgen shares have declined 0.6% in the past year. Still, this compares favorably with the 8.4% decrease registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been modest, with the company delivering a positive surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 2.93%.Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayThe first-quarter usually generates the lowest product sales for Amgen.Amgen’s newer products like Prolia, Kyprolis, Xgeva and Blincyto are likely to perform well backed by higher demand. This will make up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.In 2017 and early 2018, Amgen gained FDA approval to include overall survival data in the labels for Kyprolis and Blincyto, which may reflect in first-quarter sales of these drugs. In January, Xgeva gained FDA approval for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma. The label extension can boost sales of the drug.Neulasta demand is being hurt by competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapiesNeupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States, mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of NeupogenWe expect Neulasta and Neupogen first-quarter sales to be hurt by competitive dynamics. Neulasta and Epogen are expected to start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year. Also, Sensipar sales are likely to decline sharply the soon-to-be reported quarter as the drug lost patent exclusivity in March 2018.Enbrel sales are expected to be hurt by increased pricing and competitive pressure. Enbrel is one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues.On the fourth-quarter conference call, Amgen said that sales of Enbrel in the first quarter are expected to be the lowest in 2018, representing approximately 20% of full-year sales. Also Repatha sales in the first quarter are expected to be relatively flat sequentially hurt by insurance verifications and patient out-of-pocket costs. Also investors will be keen to know if sales of Repatha have improved with the inclusion of FOURIER outcomes data on its label.Amgen and partner Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug Avastin, Mvasi was approved in EU in January, which should boost first-quarter sales of the drug.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments on the preparations for the potential launch of migraine candidate, Aimovig. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Aimovig biologics license application (BLA) in mid-May.Meanwhile, higher investments to support product launches is likely to result in higher SG&A costs in the to-be reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.34 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.23 per share) is +3.34%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2183,AGN,"Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) shares have fallen 5.8% on the day, while Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) is up 3.4% so far. These fluctuations come in light of a $50 billion dollar acquisition deal for Shire that is now taking a competitive turn.Shire is a pharmaceutical company responsible for the manufacturing of ADHD medications such as Adderall. On Thursday Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. , a Japanese company, saw its $60 billion cash and stock buyout offer rejected by Shire. The offer was priced at $66.16 a share, a 50% premium to Shire’s stock price from late March.In conjunction with the third rejected offer from Takeda, Allergan, a company famous for making Botox, has announced it would consider producing an offer for the drug maker. Following the announcement, Allergen shares immediately began to drop, most likely due to investor concern that the company will overpay to overtake Shire.In contrast, Shire share prices began to take off today. This comes as a result of increased investor confidence, facilitated by the mega-pharmaceutical fight for the company, and the hopes of a high buyout as a result.Takeda, in order to bounce back from this rejection, needs to find a means of acquiring a much greater capacity of wealth if it wishes to purchase Shire, which currently holds a higher market valuation, and compete with Allergan.Riding this wave of media spotlight has helped raise share prices 7.9% at peak trading on the day, and unlike Allergan and Takeda, Shire’s earnings outlook in the short term is seemingly positive, regardless of this deal.Currently Shire holds a “B” grade for Growth, and a “B” grade for Value based in our Style Scores system.Shire’s P/E of 10.7, P/B of 1.4, and P/S of 3.3 all come in at discounts to their respective industry averages and help show why the stock leaves investors with a strong value option. And if this buyout goes well, this could only be more of a discounted purchase, assuming the investor gets in now.The company’s growth prospects look strong as well. A debt/equity ratio of 0.5 shows that Shire is financially sound, and a cash flow of $22.71 per share compared to the -$0.51 industry average helps show investors the financial stability of the company in an unstable industry.This being said, Shire is expected to witness EPS growth of a modest 8.35% on an annualized basis over the next three to five years. Analyst estimate revisions point to a negative trend as well. Although all current quarter EPS estimates (3) in the past 60 days have been positive, current year EPS estimates within the same time range (6) are at a 100% agreement to the downside. This is why the pharmaceutical company currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2184,AGN,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and partner Neurocrine Biosciences announced that the FDA has extended the review period of marketing application for the companies’ pipeline candidate, elagolix, by three months. As a result, the regulatory body will now announce its decision by the third quarter of 2018 instead of the previously anticipated second-quarter 2018 timeline.AbbVie is looking to get elagolix approved as an oral medicine for pain management associated with endometriosis.Last September, the FDA accepted AbbVie's new drug application (NDA) for elagolix and subsequently, granted priority review status in October. However, the regulatory body requested for an extended time frame to review additional information, provided by AbbVie along with its NDA pertaining to liver function test results.Notably, management showed confidence in the company’s data provided to the FDA and continues to work with the regulatory body to bring elagolix to the U.S. market.We remind investors that the NDA filing was supported by positive results from two replicate pivotal phase III trials, evaluating elagolix for the aforementioned indication. The detailed data from the study, presented last October, showed that treatment with elagolix resulted in statistically significant reductions in menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared with placebo.Data from the studies also demonstrated superiority as compared to placebo in alleviating pelvic pain, non-menstrual pelvic pain and painful intercourse associated with endometriosis.Endometriosis affects an estimated one in 10 women of reproductive age and is associated with pain symptoms. At present, there is no cure for the disease. The pain associated with it is currently managed with oral contraceptives, progestins, danazol, NSAIDS, opioids and GnRH agonists. Many medicines are not specifically indicated for treating endometriosis. If approved, elagolix will be the first option for patients in need of an additional treatment to apprehend the disease.AbbVie’s share price has surged 45.4% in a year, comparing favorably with the industry’s 7.5% gain. Meanwhile, Elagolix is also being evaluated in two phase III programs for preventing heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids.Importantly, another pharma company Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) also has a pipeline candidate, ulipristal acetate, in its portfolio, which is currently under evaluation for treatment of uterine fibroids. Here too, the FDA in February requested to extend the review period of the company’s NDA for the candidate to August 2018.AbbVie Inc. Price AbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

2186,AGN,"The FDA’s refusal to review Alkermes plc’s (ALKS  -  Free Report) depression candidate ALKS 5461 this week was a major setback for the company. The decision sent Alkermes’ stock tumbling more than 21%.ALKS 5461, a once-daily oral medication has been developed for the adjunctivetreatment of major depressive disorder (“MDD”) in patients, who have not responded to standard antidepressant therapies.The FDA refused to review the candidate stating that the new drug application (“NDA”) did not have enough evidence that the oral medication will work. The FDAwas of the opinion that additional studies should be conducted to ascertain the drug’s effectiveness for the proposed indication.It goes without saying that unexpected pipeline setbacks like these, shift investors’ focus to companies that market or are developing drugs for the treatment of depression. Alkermes’ latest pipeline setback has shifted investors’ focus to this market. Depression and Types Depression is a medical condition that affects the brain. Individuals with depression feel melancholic and have intricacy in enjoying routine activities. Factors such as stress and brain chemistry are the most common causes of depression. It can also be genetic.There are different forms of depression such as persistent depressive disorder, perinatal depression disorder, psychotic depression, seasonal affective disorder and bipolar depression. Psychotic depression, persistent depressive disorder and bipolar disorder are the most severe forms of depression. According to WHO as of May 30, 2016, an estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression and have been seen to carry suicidal tendencies. Thus, there rose a pressing need to develop drugs for this condition. Known as antidepressants, these drugs are instrumental in identifying the signs and symptoms of the ailment.Several pharma and biotech companies are involved in developing and selling of anti-depressantdrugs.4 Stocks in FocusLet us look at some of the companies that are actively pursuing the development of treatment for various types of depression.Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, looks well-positioned in the depression market. The company has quite a few products in its portfolio including Vraylar (schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder), Viibryd (major depressive disorder) and Saphris (bipolar I disorder). These drugs are also in several label expansion studies. Earlier this week, Allergan announced that a pivotal study evaluating Vraylar for the treatment of adults with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression) met the primary endpoint.Moreover, Allergan moved rapastinel, its NMDA receptor modulator, into phase III development for major depressive disorder. Rapastinel, a potentially game-changing treatment, is expected to be launched in 2021. The drug is expected to generate revenues of $1-$2 billion. Rapastinel was granted breakthrough therapy status for adjunction major depressive disorder by the FDA in 2016.Allergan is also evaluating its flagship product, Botox, for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Allergan has outperformed the industry year to date. The company’s shares have moved up 1.7% against the industry decline of 4.7%.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report): Healthcare giant, J&J has a strong presence in the neuroscience segment, which is one of its core therapeutic areas. While the company has products like Risperdal Consta (schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder) in its portfolio, one of the most promising candidates in J&J’s pipeline is esketamine, an investigational antidepressant medication with blockbuster potential. Esketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, which has a novel mechanism of action, got breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide in 2016. Esketamine has been granted breakthrough therapy designation for treatment-resistant depression and a regulatory application for this indication in the United States is expected to be filed this year.J&J, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has underperformed the industry year to date.

2187,AGN,"Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PRTK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted two new drug applications (NDAs), seeking approval of its antibiotic candidate, omadacycline. The NDAs were granted priority review, thus speeding up the review process. A decision is expected in October 2018.The NDAs are seeking approval of once-daily oral and intravenous (""IV"") dosing of omadacycline for treating community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (“CABP”) and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (“ABSSSI”).The candidate already enjoys Qualified Infectious Disease Product and Fast Track designation for both the indications.Shares of the company were up almost 3% in after-market trading on Apr 4. However, Paratek’s shares have declined 25.7% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 7.4% in the said period.The NDAs submitted included positive data from phase III program evaluating omadacycline in ABSSSI and CABP patients. The candidate was also well tolerated.In April 2017, Paratek had announced non-inferiority of omadacycline to Bayer’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) CABP drug, Avelox, in a phase III study.The chief medical officer of Paratek stated that resistance to antibiotics is on the rise, increasing the need for new antibiotics.Paratek is also planning to file a marketing authorization in the European Union for omadacycline in similar indications.The candidate is also being developed for the treatment of urinary tract infections.However, there are approved therapies available for the treatment of CABP and ABSSSI, which includes Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Teflaro. Moreover, Nabriva Therapeutics plc (NBRV  -  Free Report) is evaluating its antibiotic candidate lefamulin in late stage studies in CABP and ABSSSI.Apart from omadacycline, Paratek’s acne candidate, Seysara, is under review in the United States.Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2188,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) and Hungary-based partner Gedeon Richter Plc. have announced positive top-line results from the third pivotal study, evaluating the companies’ schizophrenia drug Vraylar (cariprazine) for an expanded indication. Both entities are looking to get Vraylar approved for the treatment of adults with major depressive episodes related to bipolar I disorder.Notably, Vraylar is already approved in the United States and the EU for the acute therapy of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder as well as for schizophrenia. Additionally, the FDA approved the drug in November 2017 for an expanded use as a maintenance therapy for treatment of schizophrenia.Shares of Allergan have inched up 0.7% this year so far against the industry’s decrease of 5.9%. The phase III (RGH-MD-53) study was investigating two doses of Vraylar (1.5 mg and 3 mg) in 493 adult patients with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression) compared with placebo. The study met its primary as well as secondary endpoints.Though Vraylar’s 1.5 mg dosage showed a significantly greater improvement than placebo on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline to week 6, the 3 mg dose failed to reach statistical significance. However, the drug was generally well-tolerated in the trial. We also note that around 5% of the total patients, under Vraylar treatment, discontinued the trial due to adverse events in comparison to 3% treated with placebo.We remind investors that last December, Allergan and Gedeon produced positive top-line results from the second pivotal phase III (RGH-MD-54) program, examining Vraylar for treatment of bipolar I depression. This study also met its primary endpoint.Based on the above reported data, the company is planning to submit regulatory applications to the FDA in the second half of 2018.Allergan has a licensing agreement with Gideon Richter, a Hungarian multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, to co-develop and market Vraylar in the United States as well as Canada.The schizophrenia drug performed well in 2017, recording sales of $287.8 million compared with $94.3 million in 2016. It is likely to be a key driver of Allergan’s top line in 2018.Per National Alliance of Mental Illness, bipolar disorder is one of the most common mental diseases and the third most frequent cause of hospitalization in the United States for both youth and adults aged between 18 and 44 years. Moreover, 2.6% of adults in the country are affected with bipolar disorder. Hence, approval of the drug for the expanded indication will provide the company with access to a wider patient population base suffering bipolar issues.Other players in the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia treatment market include AstraZeneca plc's (AZN  -  Free Report) Seroquel XR, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) Risperdal Consta and Alkermes plc's (ALKS  -  Free Report) Aristada.Allergan plc Price Allergan plc Price | Allergan plc Quote Zacks RankAllergan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2189,AGN,"It was a week that saw Protagonist stock crashing on news of discontinuation of a phase IIb study, Amgen’s Reptha getting a positive CHMP opinion, Verona Pharma stock rallying on positive top-line data from COPD study and the FDA accepting sBLA for Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo.Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important StoriesProtagonist Plummets on Study Results: Shares of Protagonist Therapeutics (PTGX  -  Free Report) plummeted on announcement of the discontinuation of phase IIb study — PROPEL — on its ulcerative colitis (""UC"") candidate, PTG-100. The company decided to discontinue the study as a planned interim analysis of PROPEL study by an independent Data Monitoring Committee determined that the study will not be able to achieve its primary endpoint of clinical remission.The interim analysis was done on data from first 65 patients who had completed the 12-week treatment with PTG-100. The total patient population of the study was 240. The company has notified that it will stop further treatment of patients currently in the study. Protagonist has also postponed its decision to initiate a phase II/III on PTG-100 in patients with chronic pouchitis, as it awaits full review of the interim data from the PROPEL study (Read more: Protagonist Therapeutics Stalls Ulcerative Colitis Study)Amgen’s Repatha Gets Positive CHMP Opinion: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) rendered a positive opinion on the company’s regulatory application seeking approval to include data from the cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER, on the European label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha.The application seeks for a new indication in the Repatha label for adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) to reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels. Concurrently, the CHMP gave a positive opinion for the marketing authorization to Amgen and Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report), ABP 980, a biosimilar of Roche’s oncology drug Herceptin. The biosimilar has been recommended for approval for the treatment of the same three types of cancer — HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, HER2-positive early breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. (Read more: Amgen's Repatha Gains CHMP Nod to Include Outcomes Data)Verona Pharma Surges on Study Results: Shares of Verona Pharma plc (VRNA  -  Free Report) surged following positive top-line data from its phase IIb study evaluating pipeline candidate, RPL554.  RPL554, a first-in-class, inhaled, dual inhibitor is being evaluated as a maintenance treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). The study met its primary endpoint as RPL554 demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements in lung function at all dose levels.Additionally, secondary endpoints were also met and support the potential clinical benefits of RPL554 for the treatment of COPD. The positive results from the study support the progression of RPL554 into later stage development as an inhaled treatment for COPD patients. Verona Pharma doesn’t have any approved product in its portfolio and the successful development and commercialization of the drug will significantly boost results.Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo sbLA Accepted by the FDA: The FDA accepted Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for blockbuster drug Opdivo in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of adults with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. The agency has also granted the application priority review and set an action date of Jul 10, 2018. The combination is already approved for a variety of oncology indications.Seattle Genetics Gets Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Enfortumab: Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) and partner Astellas Pharma Inc. announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC”) enfortumab vedotin, for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with checkpoint inhibitors (“CPI”). The candidate is being studied in a pivotal clinical trial, EV-201 (NCT03219333), as monotherapy in this patient setting and in an early-phase clinical trial in combination with CPI therapy, EV-103 (NCT03288545). Both companies are also evaluating enfortumab vedotin in other solid tumors, including ovarian and non-small cell lung carcinoma.Biohaven Pharma Plunges Despite Positive Trial: Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. ’s (BHVN  -  Free Report) shares plunged significantly despite the company announcing positive top-line results from two phase III trials (BHV3000-301 and BHV3000-302) on migraine candidate rimegepant (formerly known as BHV-3000). Rimegepant is an oral CGRP receptor antagonist which is being evaluated for the acute treatment of migraine. CGRP receptor antagonists represent a novel class of drug candidates for the treatment of migraine.The results were statistically significant and clinically meaningful across multiple outcome measures as the candidate met the co-primary efficacy endpoints of superiority to placebo, at two hours post-dose, on pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome symptom. The company is on schedule to submit an NDA for rimegepant in 2019. However, the investors were not much impressed with the data when compared to rival Allergan’s migraine candidate ubrogepant.Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index lost 4.98% over the last five trading sessions.

2190,AGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given a positive recommendation to its regulatory application seeking approval to include data from the cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER, on the European label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha.With the label expansion application, Amgen is looking to get Repatha approved to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in Europe.Though Amgen’s shares have declined 1.8% so far this year, it is still better than the 5.7% decrease registered by the industry.The FOURIER outcomes data is already included in the U.S. label of Repatha, following FDA approval in December last year.Data from the phase III FOURIER study presented last year had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes on treatment with Repatha compared with the current best therapy alone.Repatha significantly reduced risk of hard MACE (heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death) by 20% compared to the standard treatment with statin therapy. For individual components, risks of heart attack, stroke and coronary revascularization were reduced by 27%, 21% and 22%, respectively.Uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent. The priority for Amgen right now is to improve patient access to Repatha.The outcomes data (FOURIER) is the key to the commercial success of Repatha as it would broaden the use of the drug. With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label, patient access to Repatha is expected to improve.However, some analysts believe that though data from the study looks good, it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data.In a separate press release, Amgen and partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the CHMP has also given a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for ABP 980, their biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Herceptin. Amgen/Allergan are looking to get ABP 980 approved in the EU for the same cancer indications as the reference product, including HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, HER2-positive early breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.The companies’ application to get biosimilar Herceptin approved in the United States is under review with a decision from the FDA expected in May.Meanwhile, Amgen and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s another cancer drug Avastin, was approved in the United States in September last year and in the EU early this year.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2191,AGN,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and partner Neurocrine Biosciences announced that the second of the two pivotal phase III studies evaluating its pipeline candidate, elagolix uterine fibroids, met the primary endpoint. AbbVie is looking to get elagolix approved as an oral medicine for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids.Elagolix is already under review in the United States for management of endometriosis with associated pain.AbbVie’s shares have increased more than 1% on Mar 13, following the news release. Moreover, so far this year, AbbVie’s share price has increased 24.5%, comparing favorably with a gain of 0.5% recorded by the industry.Coming back to the latest release, data from the phase III ELARIS UF-II (M12-817) study demonstrated that elagolix, in combination with low-dose add-back therapy, reduced heavy menstrual bleeding in 76.2% of women with uterine fibroids compared with 10.1% in placebo at month six. The safety profile of the candidate was also found to be consistent with the first phase III study (ELARIS UF-I) results. The study met its secondary endpoints as well. Data from the ELARIS UF-II study will support regulatory submissions for elagolix for the aforementioned indication.Note that, positive top-line data from the first phase III ELARIS UF-I study were announced in February 2018. This study also met the primary endpoints.Per the company’s press release, uterine fibroid affects around 20-80% of women by age 50. Out of them, 25% may experience symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, painful periods, vaginal bleeding at times other than menstruation and anemia. At present, there are limited non-surgical treatment options for women suffering from the disease. Uterine fibroid is currently managed with oral contraceptives, progestins and GnRH agonists. Many of these medicines are not specifically indicated for the treatment of uterine fibroid. Hence, approval of the candidate will provide the company access to patients who are in need of an additional treatment option to apprehend the disease.Meanwhile, pharma company Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) also has a pipeline candidate, ulipristal acetate, in its portfolio which is being evaluated for treatment of uterine fibroids. It might be the first oral treatment to hit the market, as it is under review in the United States with a response expected from the regulatory agency in August 2018.AbbVie Inc. Price AbbVie Inc.

Earnings rose 24.6% year over year driven by higher revenues and lower R&D costs and lower share count, which offset the impact of lower gross margins and higher SG&A spend.Revenues came in at $4.33 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.28 billion by 1.2%. Revenues rose 12% from the year-ago period.Key products like Botox and Juvéderm collection of fillers and new products like Vraylar, Viberzi and Namzaric did well in the quarter. However, sales erosion of Namenda XR and Aczone and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin, hurt the top line.Fourth-quarter revenues also benefited from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (April 2017) acquisitionsSegment DiscussionAllergan reports revenues under three segments – U.S. General Medicine, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics and International.U.S. Specialized Therapeutics’ net revenues increased 19.8% to $1.88 billion driven by continued strong performance of its facial aesthetics products, Botox and Juvéderm Collection of fillers.Botox (cosmetic) raked in sales of $228.4 million (up 14.5%). Botox Therapeutic revenues were $367.2 million, up 17.1%. In addition, Juvéderm Collection of fillers rose 14.7% to $139.5 million. In Eye Care, Ozurdex sales increased 16.8% to $26.4 million while Restasis’ sales rose 1.8% to $400.3 million. In Plastic Surgery, breast implants sales increased 21.5% to $69 million, which contributed to the upside. In Medical Dermatology, Aczone sales declined 37.9% in the quarter to $38 million due to generic pressure on the branded acne category and higher discounts for formulary coverage.LifeCell’s Alloderm added $97.9 million while ZELTIQ’s CoolSculpting business added $94.4 million to sales in the fourth quarter.U.S. General Medicine net revenues were flat at $1.5 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands and Women's Health franchises. Anti-Infectives sales rose 14.8% to $66.6 million, Gastrointestinal rose 2% to $453.2 million and Central Nervous System sales rose 2.9% to $349 million.Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Namzaric, Viberzi and Vraylar did well in the quarter. Linzess’ sales rose 12.2% in the quarter to $194.8 million, driven by strong demand. Lo Loestrin sales rose 17.7% to $126.5 million backed by strong demand trends and higher selling prices.Among the newer products, Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept, recorded sales of $36.8 million, almost flat with $37 million in the previous quarter. Viberzi recorded sales of $42.9 million, higher than $40.9 million in the previous quarter. Vraylar sales were $87.7 million in the fourth quarter, higher than $80.2 in the previous quarter driven by demand growth.Namenda XR sales declined 30.7% year over year to $97.8 million in the quarter due to lower demand and generic pressure.Asacol/Delzicol sales declined 32% to $42.8 million due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in August 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol.In the Women’s Health segment, Minastrin 24 revenues declined 93.2% to $5.3 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in March last year.The International segment recorded net revenues of $915.9 million, up 16.8% from the year-ago period, driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics, Botox (therapeutic), Eye Care and the addition of CoolSculpting.Profits RiseAdjusted operating income increased 16.4% to $2.17 billion in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margin rose 190 basis points in the quarter to 50.3% quarter due to improved operating leverage and lower R&D costs.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 6.2% to $1.13 billion in the quarter, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions. R&D expenses declined 4.7% to $405.7 million due to cost control and reprioritization of R&D programs.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $15.94 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.89 billion. Revenues were within the guidance of 15.875 billion to $16.025 billion. Sales rose 9.4% year over year.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $16.35 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.27 per share and were within the guided range of $16.15–$16.45. Earnings rose 21% year over year.2018 OutlookIn 2018, Allergan expects lower revenues and earnings than 2018 as it faces generic competition to Restasis.Allergan maintained its previously issued total sales guidance in the range of approximately $15.0 billion – $15.3 billion assuming the generic Restasis is launched between April and July of 2018.Meanwhile, the company said that it expects adjusted earnings in the range of $15.25 - $16.00 per share in 2018. In January, Allergan had said that it expected earnings of at least $15.25 per share in 2018.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 14% in 2018.Adjusted gross margin guidance is expected in the range of 85.5% and 86% which is lower than 2017 levels. Gross margins are expected to be hurt by loss of exclusivity of high-margin products - Restasis, Estrace and Delzicol, and unfavorable product mix.Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion while SG&A spend is expected to be approximately $4.25 billion.Operating margins in 2018 are expected to be in line to slightly below 2017 levels.On the call, the company said that it does not expect any significant M&A activities in 2018. Allergan expects to reevaluate its M&A strategy in the second half of the year once it gets through the LOEs.First-Quarter 2018 OutlookIn the first-quarter 2018, revenues are expected to be between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion while earnings per share are expected to be between $3.20 and $3.40. These numbers represent the lowest revenue and earnings quarter for the year.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the favorable timing of physician rebating program benefited sales of Allergan’s facial aesthetics products. This benefit will be missing in the first quarter of 2018. As such, the company expects first quarter revenue growth rate to be somewhat lower than the annual 2018 growth rate. Also, generic competition for Estrace and Namenda XR will hurt sales sharply in the first quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to four lower.Allergan plc Price and Consensus  Allergan plc Price and Consensus | Allergan plc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, AGN has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for growth investors than those looking for value and momentum.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

2193,AGN,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter 2017 loss of $1.38 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29 and the year-ago loss of 72 cents.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Quarter in DetailIn December 2017, Aerie's lead drug Rhopressa was approved by the FDA for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. This approval came two months ahead of the scheduled Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Feb 28, 2018.In the reported quarter, research and development expenses more than doubled to $38.1 million. General and administrative expenses surged 51.5% to $22.2 million. Also, higher operating expenses in the reported quarter reflect increased activities associated with the expansion of employee base to support operational growth and preparatory activities associated with the Rhopressa commercialization efforts apart from a $24.8-million research and development expense related to the Envisia asset acquisition.For 2017, loss per share came in at $3.37, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.27.Pipeline UpdatesAerie currently evaluates its second candidate, Roclatan, a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Xalatan. The NDA for Roclatan is expected to be filed in second-quarter 2018.  The company has initiated a phase III trial, Mercury 3, in the third quarter of 2017 to prepare for regulatory submission in Europe. It will be a non-inferiority trial comparing Roclatan with prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort.Meanwhile, Aerie plans to launch the drug Rhopressa in mid second-quarter 2018. The company has hired all regional sales directors and district managers as well as more than 30 of an expected 100 territory managers.The company expects to gain preferred formulary coverage for the majority of commercial payers for Rhopressa by late 2018 with most of the Medicare Part D coverage expected to commence in 2019.OutlookAerie expects Rhopress revenues in the range of $20 million to $30 million in 2018.Our TakeA wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter was due to higher operating expenses.Aerie received a significant boost with the approval of lead drug Rhopressa. The FDA nod came ahead of the PDUFA date in February. This regulatory agency approval will significantly boost Aerie's prospects as glaucoma is one of the largest segments in the global ophthalmic market. Aerie’s share price has outperformed the industry over the last 12 months. The stock has gained 6.8% versus the industry’s decline of 0.09%.However, Aerie faces a stiff competition from established, branded and generic pharmaceutical companies’ drugs such as Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Simbrinza and Travtan, and Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Lumigan as well as products of other smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical giants. Valeant Pharmaceutical’s (VRX  -  Free Report) Vyzulta was recently approved for an open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Rhopressa will confront a tough time in gaining market share due to competition from these products.Zacks RankAerie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2194,AGN,"AbbVie Inc. ((ABBV  -  Free Report)) along with partner Neurocrine Biosciences, announced that the phase III study oftheir late stage candidateelagolix met its primary endpoint in women with uterine fibroids. Top-line results from the first of the two pivotal phase III studies on elagolix (ELARIS UF-I) revealed that at six month, elagolix, in combination with low-dose add-back hormone therapy, reduced heavy menstrual bleeding compared to placebo. 68.5% (p<0.001) of women with uterine fibroids achieved clinical response.The study also met all ranked secondary endpoints at month six.Hypoestrogenic effects, such as hot flush and reduction in bone mineral density, from elagolix treatment, were observed in the study. However, the overall safety profile for elagolix was consistent with what was observed in phase II studies in uterine fibroids. Data from the phase III study will support regulatory submissions for elagolix and will be presented at an upcoming medical conference. Elagolix is under review in the United States for the management of endometriosis with associated pain.So far this year, AbbVie’s shares price have returned 92.1%, comparing favorably with 11.1% gain recorded by the industry. We note that there are many other companies that have pipeline candidates being evaluated for uterine fibroids.

2195,AGN,"Israel-based drugmaker, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) is in a major mess right now. The question now is how will the world’s largest generic maker recover?Teva carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The company has seen its earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 decline by 20% and 16%, respectively over the past 30 days.Teva’s shares have slumped 45.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 32.5%.Teva is facing significant challenges in the form of rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone - its blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches and a massive debt load.A generic version of Copaxone 20 mg is being marketed by Momenta Pharmaceutical, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) and Sandoz – Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm - since 2015 while Mylan (MYL) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October 2017. In the same month, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg thrice-weekly formulation, much earlier than expected. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone. Moreover, a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation was launched by Sandoz in February this year, much earlier than expected in April.In 2017, Copaxone generated sales of $3.8 billion, down 10% from 2016 levels. In 2018, Teva expects Copaxone to generate sales of $1.8 billion globally, significantly lower than $3.8 billion in 2017 as the franchise continues to erode.Meanwhile, other drugs in the Specialty segment are also facing generic pressure. A generic version of Azilect was launched in the United States in January 2017 and sales have started to decline sharply, while ProAir is also expected to see generic competition during the second half of 2018The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure, thereby hurting sales in Teva’s Generic segment. An increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation are resulting in additional competitive pressure in the industry. The ongoing consolidation of customers in the generics industry led to increasing price erosion. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Accelerated FDA approval of additional generic versions of competing off-patent medicines, increased competition for its largest product - Concerta authorized generic, lower-than-expected contribution of generic launches and stringent government regulations are also hurting sales of the Generics segment.The challenges in the U.S. generics market are expected to continue in 2018. Management expects lower revenues and profits in U.S. Generics unit in 2018 and potentially in 2019 due to generic industry pressure.In fact, U.S. Generics segment sales are expected to decline roughly 20% from 2017 levels in 2018 due to ongoing price erosion and generic Concerta.Teva’s debt was approximately $32.5 billion at the end of 2017, much higher than approximately $10 billion at the end of 2015 due to the $27 billion debt to finance Allergan's (AGN  -  Free Report) Actavis Generics acquisition. With increased debt, the company’s borrowing costs have increased significantly, which is hurting profits.As if all these recurring issues were not enough, on the fourth-quarter conference call, Teva announced a potential delay in the approval of fremanezumab, its anti-CGRP for episodic and chronic migraine. In January, Teva’s partner Celltrion received an FDA warning letter for a facility in South Korea. This facility manufactures the API for fremanezumab. A remediation of the issue by Celltrion could result in a delay in approval of fremanezumab.Teva’s new CEO Kare Schultz announced a restructuring plan in December to turn around the company’s fortunes. Teva has a new organizational structure in place, is closing plants, cutting down its generics portfolio, divesting non-core assets, eliminating low-value R&D projects, and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years to revive growth.However, resumption of organic growth seems unlikely prior to 2019, especially as Teva faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone.The revelation that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns a big stake in the company recently gave a boost to the stock. However, we believe this is only a temporary impact. The downtrend in share price will continue this year as well with nothing going right for the stock.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2196,AGN,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IRWD  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 14 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 21 cents. However, the company had reported adjusted loss of 12 cents in the year-ago period.Total revenues (collaborative revenue) in the quarter amounted to $94.2 million, up 7.8% from the year-ago period, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $86.24 million.The Quarter in DetailAs reported by partner Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report), Ironwood’s key marketed product – Linzess (linaclotide) – generated U.S. net sales of $194.8 million, up 12.2% year over year.Please note that Ironwood and Allergan have an equal share in brand collaboration profits or losses. Ironwood's share of net profits from the sales of Linzess in the United States (included in collaborative revenues) was $76.6 million in the fourth quarter, up 22% year over year. A $19.1 million milestone payment related to approval of Linzess in Japan was included in revenues.According to data provided by IMS Health, Linzess prescriptions filled during the quarter were more than 806,000, up 12% from the year-ago period. The drug’s uptake continued to grow in 2017 and it remained a market leader among branded prescription drugs.During the reported quarter, selling and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 37.3% to $61.8 million. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $37.1 million, down 1.2% from the year-ago periodZurampic and Duzallo, approved for uncontrolled gout, generated sales of $1.6 million in the quarter. In August, the FDA approved Duzallo as an oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients. The drug was launched in October 2017.Combined prescriptions for both the drugs filled during the quarter were 3000, higher than 2066 prescriptions filled only for Zurampic in the previous quarter.2017 PerformanceRevenues for the full year were $298.3 million, up 8.9% from the year-ago period. Revenues included $39 million received as milestone payment from Astellas Pharma related to approval of Linzess in Japan. Loss per share widened 69.1% year over year to 93 cents. R&D expenses increased 6.3% year over to $148.2 million and SG&A expenses rose 34.5% to $233.1 million. The company ended 2017 with $221 million in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities.2018 Guidance The company expects to use less than $75 million for operations in 2018. The company provided its R&D and SG&A expense guidance for 2018 in the range of $160–$180 million and $230–$250 million, respectively.Pipeline UpdatesLinzess is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (“CIC”). Ironwood and Allergan are looking to broaden Linzess’ label into additional symptoms and develop the drug as non-opioid, pain-relieving agent in IBS patients.A phase III study to evaluate Linzess in additional abdominal symptoms is expected to start in 2018. The companies are also in discussion with the FDA to start a phase IIb study to evaluate a delayed release formulation of linaclotide for treating all subtypes of IBS, including IBS-mixed and IBS with diarrhea.Ironwood’s partner in Japan, Astellas Pharma submitted a supplemental new drug application in Japan in September for the label expansion of Linzess in chronic constipation. In China, Hong Kong and Macau, Ironwood has an agreement with AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) for Linzess. The regulatory filing in China for IBS-C is under review. The company expects the review to be completed in the first half of 2018.The company is also developing three candidates – IW-3718, IW-1973 and IW-1701 – for gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetic nephropathy and sickle cell disease, respectively. Ironwood expects to advance IW-3718 in a phase III study in the second half of 2018.In December 2017, Ironwood announced encouraging top-line data from a phase IIa study, evaluating IW-1973 in patients with type II diabetes with hypertension. The candidate reduced blood pressure and improved metabolic parameters like fasting plasma glucose and cholesterol in diabetic hypertension patients compared to baseline.Our TakeThe company’s fourth-quarter loss was narrower than estimated and sales also beat expectations. Ironwood’s shares gained almost 7% on Thursday on better-than-expected results. However, a look at the company’s share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the industry this year so far. Ironwood’s shares have lost 8.7% during this period, while the industry registered an increase of 0.8%.Ironwood is focused on expanding Linzess’ label and its geography. The company is also progressing well other pipeline candidates.Moreover, sales growth of Linzess is expected to continue in 2018, which will boost top-line. A potential approval in China will be a further boost sales for the drug.Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2197,AGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 93 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents per share and came ahead of the guided range of 70 cents-80 cents. However, earnings per share declined 32% year over year.Revenues were $5.46 billion, which marginally beat the consensus estimate of $5.42 billion. However, sales declined 16% year over year (down 12% excluding impact of currency).Sales were hurt by increased pricing erosion and volume declines in the U.S. Generics unit and rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone - Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection - in the Specialty segment.Segment DiscussionTeva revised its segment structure following the Actavis acquisition. The Generics segment now includes revenues from the OTC business as well as the API business.Generic Medicines segment revenues were $3.1 billion, down 16% year over year.Revenues from the U.S. generics business declined 15% to $1.2 billion due to significant competitive and pricing pressure in the generics industry. The ongoing consolidation of customers in the generics industry led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Accelerated FDA approval of additional generic versions of competing off-patent medicines, increased competition for Concerta authorized generic, and stringent government regulations also hurt sales.European generic revenues were $1.1 billion, flat year over year. However, sales declined 8% in local currency terms from the year-ago period mainly due to absence of revenues from the generic business of Actavis in the United Kingdom, which was divested in January 2017.Rest of the world (ROW) generic revenues declined 31% to $864 million in the quarter. On a local currency basis, sales rose 2% mainly due to higher sales in Russia and Israel.API revenues were flat at $181 million. OTC revenues were down 46% to $217 million (up 9% in local currency terms).Specialty Medicines revenues were $1.8 billion, down 19% from the year-ago period due to lower sales of its central nervous system (CNS) products and divesture of some non-core assets in the Women’s Health business. Among Teva’s various therapeutic areas, CNS sales declined 21% to $984 million due to lower sales of Copaxone.Sales of respiratory products declined 10% to $293 million, oncology product sales rose 6% to $283 million, and women’s health business recorded a 44% decrease in revenues to $68 million. Other specialty revenues declined 32% to $167 million.Worldwide revenues of Copaxone declined 19% to $821 million mainly due to lower sales in the United States. Sales declined 25% in the United States to $622 million mainly due to the generic competition, which resulted in higher rebates and lower volumes.Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is being marketed by Momenta (MNTA  -  Free Report) and Sandoz - Novartis’ generic arm - since 2015 while Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October 2017. In the same month, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg thrice-weekly formulation, much earlier than expected. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone. Moreover, a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation is expected to be launched in April this year.Ex-U.S. sales of Copaxone were flat on a local currency basis at $199 million.Among other products, Azilect sales declined 55% to $40 million as a generic version of the drug was launched in the United States in 2017. ProAir declined 27% to $102 million and QVAR declined 47% to $61 million, both hurt by negative net pricing effects. Combined Treanda and Bendeka revenues rose 5% to $157 millionThe Other segment (distribution and other activities) recorded revenues of $550 million, down 4% year over year as the company sold-off some distribution businesses.Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 720 basis points (bps) to 52.2% in the quarter. Research & development expenses declined almost 40% from the year-ago period to $310 million. Selling and marketing (S&M) expenditure declined 28% from the year-ago level to $791 million. Adjusted operating income declined 29% to $1.4 billion in the quarter despite lower costs.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $22.4 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion and also came ahead of the guided range of $22.2 - $22.3 billion. Sales rose 2% year over year, gaining from the inclusion of Actavis Generics revenues.Teva acquired Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics segment, Actavis Generics and also its U.S. generic distribution business, Anda, in 2016Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $4.01 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.84 per share and exceeded the guided range of $3.77–$3.88 per share. Earnings declined 22% year over year.2018 Outlook Below ExpectationsTeva expects revenues in the range of $18.3 - $18.8 billion, which fell short of the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.17 billion. The company expects earnings in the band of $2.25–$2.50 per share in 2018, also short of the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.93 per share.In 2018, Teva expects Copaxone to generate sales of $1.8 billion globally, significantly lower than $3.8 billion in 2017 as the franchise continues to erode.U.S. Generics sales are expected to decline roughly 20% from 2017 levels to approximately $4 billion in 2018 hurt by ongoing price erosion and generic Concerta. Also, ProAir franchise is expected to see generic competition during the second half of 2018.Costs are expected to decline $1.8 billion in 2018.Our TakeThough Teva beat expectations for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter, its stock crashed more than 10% on Thursday, as the company issued a weak outlook for 2018, wherein it expects sales and profits to decline further this year.Teva’s shares have slumped 42.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 29.3%.The Israel-based generic drug maker had a tough 2017 as it faced significant challenges in the form of accelerated generic competition for Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches and a massive debt load of more than $32 billion.  Mylan’s earlier-than-expected launch of the first generic version of the 40-mg strength of Copaxone was a major setback for Teva.Teva divested some non-core assets (mainly in the Women’s Health business) to cut its significant debt load. The company also has a new organizational structure in place, is closing plants, cutting down its generics portfolio, eliminating low-value R&D projects, and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years as part of a restructuring plan it revealed in December. Though the company expects to save almost $3 billion by the end of 2019from these restructuring initiatives, a clear path to growth is not visible.These efforts might not be enough to revive the company’s fortunes during this challenging period, especially as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone. Other than that, divestures and pricing pressure in the U.S. generic business will continue to hurt the top line in 2018.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2198,AGN,"Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $4.86 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.74 by 2.5%. Earnings rose 24.6% year over year driven by higher revenues and lower R&D costs.Revenues came in at $4.33 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.28 billion by 1.2%. Revenues rose 12% from the year-ago period.Key products like Botox and Juvéderm collection of fillers and new products like Vraylar, Viberzi and Namzaric did well in the quarter. However, sales erosion of Namenda XR and Aczone and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin, hurt the top line.Fourth-quarter revenues also benefited from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (April 2017) acquisitionsSegment DiscussionThe company reports revenues under three segments – U.S. General Medicine, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics and International.U.S. Specialized Therapeutics’ net revenues increased 19.8% to $1.88 billion driven by continued strong performance of its facial aesthetics products, Botox and Juvéderm Collection of fillers.Botox (cosmetic) raked in sales of $228.4 million (up 14.5%). Botox Therapeutic revenues were $367.2 million, up 17.1%. In addition, Juvéderm Collection of fillers rose 14.7% to $139.5 million. In Eye Care, Ozurdex sales increased 16.8% to $26.4 million while blockbuster dry-eye drug, Restasis’ sales rose 1.8% to $400.3 million. In Plastic Surgery, breast implants sales increased 21.5%, which contributed to the upside. In Medical Dermatology, Aczone sales declined 37.9% in the quarter to $38 million.LifeCell’s Alloderm added $97.9 million while ZELTIQ’s CoolSculpting business added $94.4 million to sales in the fourth quarter.U.S. General Medicine net revenues were flat at $1.5 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands and Women's Health franchises. Anti-Infectives sales rose 14.8% to $66.6 million, Gastrointestinal rose 2% to $453.2 million and Central Nervous System sales rose 2.9% to $349 million.Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Namzaric, Viberzi and Vraylar did well in the quarter. Linzess’ sales rose 12.2% in the quarter to $194.8 million, driven by strong demand. Lo Loestrin sales rose 17.7% to $126.5 million backed by strong demand trends and higher selling prices.Among the newer products, Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept, recorded sales of $36.8 million, almost flat with $37 million in the previous quarter. Viberzi recorded sales of $42.9 million, up 12.9% driven by higher selling prices.Namenda XR sales declined 30.7% to $97.8 million in the quarter due to lower demand and generic pressure.Asacol/Delzicol sales declined 32% to $42.8 million due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in August 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol.In the Women’s Health segment, Minastrin 24 revenues declined 93.2% to $5.3 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in March last year.The International segment recorded net revenues of $915.9 million, up 16.8% from the year-ago period, driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics, Botox (therapeutic), Eye Care and the addition of CoolSculpting.SG&A Costs Rise, R&D DeclinesSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 6.2% to $1.13 billion in the quarter, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions. R&D expenses declined 4.7% to $405.7 million due to cost control and reprioritization of R&D programs.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $15.94 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.89 billion. Revenues were within the guidance of 15.875 billion to $16.025 billion. Sales rose 9.4% year over year.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $16.35 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.27 per share and were within the guided range of $16.15–$16.45. Earnings rose 21% year over year.2018 OutlookAllergan maintained its previously issued total sales guidance in the range of approximately $15.0 billion – $15.3 billion.Meanwhile, the company said that it expects adjusted earnings in the range of $15.25 - $16.00 per share in 2018. Last month, Allergan had said that it expected earnings of at least $15.25 per share in 2018.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 14% in 2018.Migraine Candidate Succeeds in Phase III StudyAllergan announced that a phase III study evaluating its migraine candidate, ubrogepant met its co-primary endpoints. The ACHIEVE I study evaluated the efficacy and safety of orally administered ubrogepant for treating a single migraine attack of moderate-to-severe headache intensity. The study data demonstrated that a “significant greater percentage of patients” treated with ubrogepant, at both the doses (50 mg and 100 mg), were free from pain at two hours after the initial dose as compared to those treated with placebo. Also, a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients experienced absence of the “most bothersome migraine-associated symptom” at two hours after the initial dose compared to those treated with placebo.Our TakeAllergan’s fourth-quarter results were strong as it beat expectations for both earnings and revenues on strong demand for its key drug, Botox. This, in addition to the positive top-line data from ubrogepant study, pushed up the share price by 1.2% in pre-market trading. However, in the past year, Allergan’s share price has declined 29.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 27.8%.Allergan is facing potential loss of exclusivity for several of its key products in 2018 including Namenda XR and Restasis. While a generic version of Namenda XR is expected to be launched in early first quarter, a generic version of Restasis, Allergan’s second best-selling drug, is expected to be launched in the second quarter. Also, in December 2017, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched the first generic version for Estrace cream while a generic version of ulcerative colitis drug Delzicol is expected to be launched in early second quarter.Meanwhile, new competition for key growth drivers, Botox, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. In December, Revance Therapeutics’ next-generation neuromodulator, RT002 demonstrated substantial reduction in severity of glabellar lines in phase III studies with a longer duration of efficacy compared to the currently marketed neuromodulators including Botox. The product is being considered a potential threat to Botox, which is marketed for the same indication.Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (SGYP  -  Free Report) Trulance (plecanatide) was launched in 2017 for chronic idiopathic constipation, which could pose competition to Linzess.Nonetheless, Allergan’s products like Botox and Linzess and new products such as Viberzi and Vraylar support sales growth. It also boasts a strong branded pipeline while biosimilars also represent significant opportunity. Also, last month, Allergan announced a cost-saving and restructuring program. Allergan is laying off over 1,000 employees to protect it from potential revenue declines.Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Allergan PLC. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Allergan PLC.

2200,AGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the divestment of its global women’s health business to privately-held private equity firm, CVC Capital Partners. The deal was closed for $703 million in cash.The divested portfolio includes products across contraception, fertility, menopause and osteoporosis categories. The drugs in the portfolio include Ovaleap, Zoely, Seasonique, Colpotrophine and Actonel, which are sold outside the United States. These products will now be sold by Theramex, a women’s health unit previously held by Teva.The sale is part of Teva’s planned divestment of specialty products in women’s health.We remind investors that Teva had signed a definitive agreement for this sale with CVC Capital Partners in September 2017. Moreover, the company also signed another definitive agreement with Foundation Consumer Healthcare for the sale of its Plan B One-Step and brands of emergency contraception.CVC Capital Partners has appointed Anish Mehta, former head of International Business Development at Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report), as Theramex’s chief executive officer.In a separate SEC filing, Teva reported that it has entered into a settlement agreement with Allergan, jointly dismissing the working capital dispute arbitration. Allergan will pay Teva $700 million as part of the settlement.Teva’s shares rose 3.8% on Feb 1, following the news. However, shares of the company have declined 38.5% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 24.9%. Teva’s decline can be attributed to industry pressure, generic competition for its blockbuster drug, Copaxone, and a massive debt load. Teva also suffered a another setback in October 2017 as Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its generic version of the 40 mg formulation of Copaxone, much earlier than expected.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderTeva carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Zoetis Inc.

2201,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion of its anti-infective drug, Avycaz (ceftazidime and avibactam). With this nod, the drug is now approved for treatment of patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) due to gram-negative bacteria. This approval marks the third therapeutic indication for the drug in the United States.Notably, Avycaz is marketed for treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by designated susceptible pathogens consisting of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Avycaz is also indicated for curing adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in combination with metronidazole.We remind investors that the company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Avycaz was accepted by the FDA under priority review in October 2017 based on a preceding Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation for the aforementioned indication.Importantly, Avycaz is the first gram-negative antibiotic approved in the United States to treat HABP/VABP in over 15 years.Allergan’s shares have lost 22.2% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s decline of 24.4%. The approval was based on non-inferiority data from a pivotal phase III REPROVE study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of Avycaz on adult patients with HABP/VABP. The trial met its primary endpoints and showed that the drug was non-inferior to meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, in reducing death risks irrespective of the cause.The drug also showed in vitro (study in controlled environment outside human body) activity against certain gram-negative bacteria causing HABP/VABP.Significantly, Avycaz is jointly marketed by Allergan and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). While Allergan has commercialization rights to Avycaz in North America, rights to the rest of the world are owned by Pfizer.Avycaz raked in sales of $42.7 million in the nine months ending Sep 30, 2017, up 58.7% from the year-ago figure. The FDA approval for the expanded patient population should improve its commercial potential.Per the company’s press release, HABP/VABP is the second most common type of nosocomial (hospital originated) infection in the United States, mainly in the intensive care unit. Hence, the potential market opportunity for Avycaz is huge in the country.Apart from Avycaz, Allergan’s anti-infectives portfolio comprises antibiotics namely Teflaro and Dalvance.Allergan PLC.

2202,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 earnings on Feb 6, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.22%.Allergan’s share price has declined 21.4% in the past year while the industry witnessed a decline of 22.9%.Allergan’s earnings performance has been strong, with the company beating expectations in each of the past four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 1.95%.Allergan PLC. Price and EPS Surprise  Allergan PLC. Price and EPS Surprise | Allergan PLC. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAllergan’s established products like Botox, Linzess, Lo Loestrin and Restasis and new products like Vraylar and Namzaric should support sales in the fourth quarter. In fact, label expansions for Botox (FDA approval for forehead line treatment) and Vraylar (FDA approval for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia) are likely to boost sales of these drugs in the fourth quarter. However, we believe sales erosion from Namenda XR due to lower demand and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin, will again hurt the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Botox, Linzess and Namenda XR are pegged at $837 million, $206 million and $103 million, respectively.In third quarter, some new products like Viberzi and Kybella performed below expectations. It remains to be seen if sales of these products rise this time aroundThe addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (April 2017) is expected to support the top line in the quarter.Higher promotional expenses for key products, increased costs to support an advancing pipeline and the acquisition of lower margin LifeCell and ZELTIQ can put pressure on Allergan’s margins.Investor focus will be on management’s comments on the impact of new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess. We remind investors that on the third quarter call, Allergan said that it will refrain from any M&A activities for the next few months until its gets a better handle on the Restasis situation. Allergan is facing potential loss of exclusivity for Restasis, its second-best selling product. In October 2017, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis, potentially opening doors for early generic competition. Though Restasis patents are scheduled to expire in August 2024, a generic version may be launched in the second quarter of 2018.Also, the company said that a split of the company is not in the cards at the moment. An update on these strategies is expected on the fourth-quarter call.We expect management to also comment on the cost-saving and restructuring program it announced earlier this year. In the regulatory filing, Allergan said it is laying off over 1,000 employees to protect it from potential revenue declines. Allergan also said that it plans to eliminate an additional 400 open positions. While the company estimates to incur costs of approximately $125 million, the job cuts and other cost-savings measures are expected to save operating costs between $300 and $400 this year. Also, the majority of the costs, primarily due to severance, will be reflected in the fourth-quarter results.Also, investors expect management to comment on the weaker-than-expected sales outlook for 2018, which Allergan announced in early January.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at $4.75, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $4.74. This results in an Earnings ESP of +0.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allergan has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2203,AGN,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that its fully human monoclonal antibody, Aimovig (erenumab), met all primary and secondary endpoints in a unique phase IIIb study for prevention of patients with episodic migraine, who have failed multiple prior preventive treatments.Notably, Aimovig is the only investigational therapy designed to selectively block the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, which plays a significant role in migraine activation.Aimovig is under review in both the United States and the EU for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. A decision from the FDA is expected on May 17, 2018.Moreover, shares of the company are up 25.8% in a year, comparing favorably with the industry’s an increase of 8.6%. The phase IIIb LIBERTY study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aimovig in a broad spectrum of migraine patients ranging from those without a preventive treatment as well as those, who have tried and failed such therapies.Results from the study demonstrated that at least 50% of patients achieved reduction of monthly migraine, days from the baseline over the last four weeks compared with placebo, the primary endpoint of the study. Data from the trial also showed consistent efficacy, safety and tolerability of Aimovig across a wider spectrum of migraine patients including those with complicated cases.We remind investors that Amgen developed Aimovig in collaboration with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report). The companies have now agreed to combine capabilities to co-commercialize the candidate in the United States. Incidentally, Amgen retains its exclusive commercialization rights in Japan. Novartis, which retains its existing commercialization rights in rest of the world, has exclusive rights to commercialize Aimovig in Canada under the expanded deal.Per the World Health Organization, migraine is one of the most debilitating illnesses. Approximately 10 million Americans’ daily activities are affected by frequency or severity of migraine. Around 3.5 million subjects are undergoing a preventive therapy, of which, 80% discontinues the treatment within a year. Hence, approval of Aimovig will provide the company a much-needed access to a huge patient population in the United States, who are in need of additional curative options to apprehend the disease.However, several companies including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) among others are also developing migraine treatments targeting CGRP.Amgen Inc.

2204,AGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that two phase III studies evaluating the subcutaneous formulation of its asthma injection, Cinqair (reslizumab) did not meet their primary endpoints.Cinqair is already available in the market in an intravenous formulation to treat patients with severe asthma and elevated blood eosinophils.The phase III registration study evaluated subcutaneously administered reslizumab at a fixed-dose of 110 mg in a pre-filled syringe in patients with uncontrolled asthma and elevated blood eosinophils. Top-line results from the study showed that reslizumab was unsuccessful in significantly reducing the frequency of clinical asthma exacerbations (CAEs), thereby failing to meet the primary endpoint.The other phase III claim-support study evaluated the subcutaneous dosing option in patients with oral corticosteroid (OCS) - dependent asthma. Here too, reslizumab failed to meet its primary endpoint of reduction in daily OCS dose. Teva stated it will determine the subsequent course of action after a full review of the data.Teva’s shares have slumped 35.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 17.1%.Teva is facing significant challenges in the form of generic competition for its largest branded drug, Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches and a massive debt load.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure, which is hurting the company’s top line.Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone’s sales have been declining for quite some time now. In October, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg formulation, much earlier than expected. Meanwhile, Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is marketed by Momenta and Sandoz, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, since 2015. Mylan also launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Copaxone sales are expected to erode rapidly.Additionally, the company’s debt burden increased as a result of the $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generic unit, Allergan Generics in 2016. With nearly $35 billion in debt, the company’s borrowing costs have increased significantly, which is hurting profits.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years. However, a clear path to growth is not visible.

2205,AGN,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission has granted marketing approval to its biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab), Mvasi. The drug was approved in the United States in September.Mvasi is approved in the EU for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. Note that Mvasi is the first bevacizumab biosimilar to be approved in the European Union.The approval was in line with expectations considering the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) had rendered a positive opinion for the approval of Mvasi in November/The approval was supported by a comprehensive data package that demonstrated similarity of Mvasi with bevacizumab.Amgen has collaborated with Allergan for the worldwide development and commercialization of four oncology antibody biosimilar medicines. Other than Mvasi, Amgen/Allergan’s portfolio also includes biosimilar versions of Herceptin (under review in the United States and EU) and Rituxan (in late stage studies)Overall, Amgen has 10 biosimilars in its pipeline including biosimilar versions of Johnson and Johnson/Merck’s Remicade and Alexion’s Soliris. Amgen’s biosimilar version of Abbvie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, Amjevita, was approved by the FDA in September 2016 and in the EU (trade name: Amgevita) in March 2017 for the same indications as Humira.Amjevita is the first biosimilar version of Humira to be approved by the FDA as well as Amgen’s first biosimilar medicine to be approved. Per a settlement agreement with AbbVie, Amgen will begin selling Amjevita in most countries in the EU this year and in the United States from January 2023.Amgen’s biosimilar opportunity is likely to translate into annual revenues of more than $3 billion. Amgen has also partnered Daiichi Sankyo for the commercialization of nine biosimilars in Japan.In the past year, Amgen’s shares have returned 21.3% compared with 4.2% increase registered by the industry. Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2206,AGN,"The biosimilar space was in focus in 2017 on key FDA approvals.Biosimilars contain a version of the active substance of an already approved original biological drug. Development of biosimilars is technically more challenging than the development of generic drugs as the former requires clinical studies in patients and are engineered to match the reference drug in quality, safety and efficacy. Due to the complex nature of the product, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics. A biosimilar is usually less expensive than the branded drug. Thus, the market for the same is highly lucrative. With the acceleration in approvals of biosimilars, the market has thus attracted a lot many players which are witnessing rapid growth. Here we go through the progress report for 2017.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade (infliximab), in the United States in July 2017 after approval in April. The FDA also granted tentative approval for Lusduna Nexvue, the biosimilar version of Lantus, basal insulin in a pre-filled dosing device. Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Remicade has been seeing intense competition in the biosimilars space of late. We note that Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) supplies Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Remicade. Pfizer is a strong player in the biosimilars market. In December 2017, Pfizer got FDA approval for another of its Remicade’s biosimilar, Ixifi, as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. The company has a portfolio of three marketed biosimilar medicines outside the United States, including Inflectra, Retacrit (epoetin zeta) and Nivestim (filgrastim) along with a strong pipeline of 13 distinct biosimilar molecules in various stages of development. Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Generic leader Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) is also exploring the biosimilars market — that has the potential to grow to $20 billion by 2020. Early last December, Mylan and partner Biocon Ltd. announced the FDA approval of Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst), a biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab). Ogivri has been approved for all indications included in the label of the reference product, Herceptin, including the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and metastatic stomach cancer. Ogivri is the first FDA-approved biosimilar of Herceptin and the first biosimilar from Mylan and Biocon's joint portfolio. Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) won FDA approval for the biosimilar version of Avastin in September 2017 for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. We note that Mvasi is the first biosimilar approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer. Amgen’s biosimilar version of Humir, Amjevita, is already approved by the FDA and will be launched in the United States on Jan 31, 2023, after the company resolved litigation with the AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) The companies have also submitted a BLA to the FDA for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin in July 2017. We note that the companies are collaborating on four oncology biosimilars, including ABP 980, which is the second to be submitted for FDA approval. The companies also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for the candidate in 2017. We note that Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its pipeline, two of which have been approved by the FDA. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Boehringer Ingelheim’s Cyltezo (adalimumab-adbm), another biosimilar of Humira, was also approved by the FDA in August 2017. Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % ReturnConclusionOwing to the slew of FDA approvals, we expect investors to remain focused on this space in the near future.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2207,AGN,"The week has been pretty slow with key announcements including Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) job cut announcement and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) collaboration agreements with companies like Sangamo and Arvinas.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAllergan Announces Job Cuts: At the time of announcing third quarter results in November, Allergan had said that it would have to look at cost reduction in order to deal with the impact of loss of exclusivity (“LOE”) on key products including Restasis. This week, the company announced a cost cutting and restructuring program which will lead to the elimination of more than 1,000 currently filled positions, primarily in commercial and other functions. About 400 open positions will also be eliminated. Restructuring costs of about $125 million, primarily due to severance, will be recorded mostly in the fourth quarter of 2017 with overall operating expense savings expected in the range of $300 to $400 million compared to 2017. The company expects to achieve additional cost reductions through non-headcount spending rationalization (Read more: Allergan to Cut Jobs Amid Loss of Exclusivity for Key Drugs).Pfizer in Protein Degradation Deal with Arvinas: Pfizer has agreed to shell out up to $830 million to private biotech company, Arvinas, which is focused on creating a new class of drugs based on protein degradation. The companies announced a research collaboration and license agreement for the discovery and development of drug candidates using Arvinas’ proprietary PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras) platform, a novel technology that is used for the creation of small molecule therapeutics aimed at degrading disease-causing cellular proteins.The multi-year agreement, which covers different therapeutic areas, will see Arvinas drive discovery efforts, while Pfizer will be responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of any products resulting from this collaboration.The $830 million covers upfront and milestone payments that depend on the achievement of specified preclinical, clinical and commercial milestones. The deal terms include tiered royalties as well.Protein degradation is an area that has been attracting the interest of large cap companies – Arvinas has an agreement with Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) as well.Pfizer-Sangamo Sign Another Collaboration Agreement: Pfizer has signed another collaboration agreement with Sangamo for the development of a potential gene therapy using zinc finger protein transcription factors (ZFP-TFs) for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (“FTLD”) linked to mutations of the C9ORF72 gene. The agreement will see Pfizer shelling out an upfront payment of $12 million as well as milestone payments worth up to $150 million plus tiered royalties on net sales.While Sangamo will be responsible for the development of ZFP-TF candidates, Pfizer will be operationally and financially responsible for subsequent research, development, manufacturing and commercialization for the C9ORF72 ZFP-TF program and other resulting products.Sangamo and Pfizer already have a collaboration agreement that was announced last year for the development and commercialization of gene therapy products for hemophilia A, including SB-525 (Read more: Pfizer Collaborates With Sangamo for Gene Therapy).Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2208,AGN,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report) announced that the parties in the cases of Basile v. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. et al. (Case No. 14-cv-02004-DOC) and Timber Hill LLC v. Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P., et al. (Case No. 17-cv-04776-DOC) have agreed to resolve the claims of the litigation with Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) for $290 million, subject to the court's approval.Under the terms of a recently revised Litigation Management Agreement with the other defendants, the company will pay $96.25 million or 33% of the settlement while Perishing will pay the remaining. Valeant was earlier required to pay 60% of the claims of the litigation.We remind investors that in December 2014, Anthony Basile, an alleged shareholder of Allergan filed a lawsuit on behalf of a putative class of Allergan shareholders against Valeant, Pershing Square, PS Management, GP, LLC, PS Fund 1 and William A. Ackman in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Valeant’s stock has rallied 28.4% in the last six months against the industry’s decline of 5%.The company has been mired in various controversies due to price hike of specialty drugs, erroneous financial reporting and termination of contracts with Philidor Rx Services. Valeant started a rebuilding process with the new CEO, Joseph C. Papa in 2016.Even though it is still too early to comment on its reformation but the company’s efforts to sell non-core assets and clear huge levels of debt are commendable and should bode well in the upcoming quarters.Valeant sold its equity interests in Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to the China-based Sanpower Group Co. Ltd. It has also announced plans to divest Obagi. Additionally, the company sold iNova Pharmaceuticals for $930 million.The company is also divesting Sprout Pharmaceuticals and ADDYI businesses. As of Nov 7, 2017, the company lowered debt by approximately $6 billion since the end of first-quarter 2016.

2209,AGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted its biologics license application (BLA) seeking approval for its monoclonal antibody candidate, fremanezumab, as a preventive treatment for migraine. With the FDA granting priority review designation to the BLA, a decision from the FDA is expected in mid-2018. Teva looks to launch fremanezumab next year.The BLA submission was supported by positive data from two phase III studies under HALO program, which evaluated the candidate in patients with episodic migraine (""EM"") and chronic migraine (""CM"").Fremanezumab is also being evaluated in late-stage studies (ENFORCE) for the prevention of chronic and episodic cluster headache. In the latest press release, the company also said the FDA has granted fast track designation for fremanezumab for the prevention of cluster headache. In addition, recently a phase II clinical program in post-traumatic headache has also been initiated.Meanwhile, Teva’s restructuring plan announced last week, which aims to lay off more than 25% of its global workforce and shut down some plants, has resulted in massive protests and strikes in Israel by employees as well as the country’s main public-sector labor union. The strikes briefly shut down the Ben-Gurion airport, banks, stock exchange and government offices on Sunday. Teva is one of Israel's biggest employers,Last month, Teva’s new chief executive officer, Kare Schultz announced a new organizational and leadership structure to save costs and increase productivity. The organizational changes included the departure of heads of three divisions.Teva’s shares have slumped 48.9% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 26.1%.Teva is facing significant challenges in the form of generic competition for its largest branded drug, Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from new generic launches and a massive debt load.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure, which is hurting the company’s topline.Meanwhile, Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone’s sales have been declining for quite some time now. In October, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg formulation, much earlier than expected. Meanwhile, Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is marketed by Momenta and Sandoz, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, since 2015 while Mylan also launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Copaxone sales are expected to erode rapidly.Additionally, the company’s debt burden increased as a result of the $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generic unit, Allergan Generics in 2016. With nearly $35 billion in debt, the company’s borrowing costs have increased significantly, which is hurting profits.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load. It remains to see if the latest corporate shake-up, planned layoffs and divestures are enough to revive the company’s fortunes during this challenging period, especially as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2210,AGN,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its lead candidate, Rhopressa (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% for the lowering of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.The news comes as a significant boost for Aerie given that the company had no approved products in its portfolio. The FDA approval comes two months ahead of the scheduled Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of Feb 28, 2018.Aerie plans to hire a sales force of 100 representatives in the first quarter of 2018 and plans to launch the drug by mid-2018.An approval was in the cards as the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted in favor of Rhopressa’s approval in October 2017. Members of the committee unanimously agreed that the trials support the efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In addition, majority of the members agreed that the Rhopressa’s efficacy outweigh safety risks.The news will surely relieve investors. In October 2016, Aerie withdrew its NDA for Rhopressa in the United States which was submitted in the third quarter of 2016. A third party manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL, not being ready for pre-approval inspection led to the withdrawal. The contract drug product manufacturer had previously informed Aerie and the FDA that it will be prepared for the inspection in January 2017 but then delayed it further. The manufacturer clarified that the delay is not a result of any new finding but the additional time needed to complete the validation of new equipment.Glaucoma is one of the largest segments in the global ophthalmic market. According to the National Eye Institute, it has been estimated that more than 2.7 million individuals in the United States suffer from glaucoma. This number is expected to reach 4.3 million by 2030.  Aerie’s share price has increased 15.4% in the last six months as against the industry’s 2.1% rally.However, Aerie faces stiff competition from established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies, such as Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Simbrinza and Travtan, and Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Lumigan, as well as other smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Valeant Pharmaceutical’s (VRX  -  Free Report) Vyzulta was recently approved for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Rhopressa will face a tough time in gaining market share due to competition from these products.Meanwhile, Aerie’s second product candidate, Roclatan (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005%, which is a fixed dose combination of Rhopressa and latanoprost, achieved its primary efficacy endpoint in two phase III registration trials, named Mercury 1 and Mercury 2, and also achieved successful 12-month safety and efficacy results in Mercury 1.

2211,AGN,"Irish pharma giant Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) has recently inked a definitive agreement to acquire a Texas-based development stage biopharmaceutical company, Repros Therapeutics . Repros is focused on developing new drugs to treat hormonal and reproductive system disorders.Shares of Allergan have declined 18.2% this year so far, comparing favorably with the industry’s decrease of 28.1%. Although Repros’ shares plunged 49.7% so far this year, the same jumped more than 40% following the news on Dec 12. Pursuant to the agreement, Allergan will execute the acquisition through its subsidiary for a cash tender offer of $0.67 per share of Repros’ common stock. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Repros anticipates completion of the buyout during the first quarter of 2018.Notably, the agreement will add two late stage candidates, Proellex and enclomiphene, to Allergan’s pipeline. Repros plans to initiate a phase III study on Proellex for treatment of uterine fibroid. On one hand, the company currently evaluates Proellex, a selective progesterone modulator (SPRM), in a phase IIb study for uterine fibroids by vaginal delivery. On the other, enclomiphene is under evaluation for treating low testosterone levels in overweight men. Notably, the company had submitted regulatory applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in September 2016, subsequently accepted by the regulatory body.On a positive note, addition of these candidates would boost Allergan’s pipeline and that bodes well for the company’s long-term growth.We remind investors that acquisitions form an integral part of Allergan’s expansion strategy as the company completed four major takeovers (Arrow, Specifar, Actavis Group and Warner Chilcott) apart from the Forest and Allergan Inc. deals in the past few years. This year so far, Allergan has burgeoned its medical aesthetics business into regenerative medicine and body sculpting through the accretive acquisitions of LifeCell and ZELTIQ, respectively.These buyouts not only provided Allergan with operational expertise but also aided the company to enhance its commercial presence and fortified its foothold in the key markets.Allergan PLC.

2212,AGN,"The market reacted negatively to speculation surrounding the likely retention of the alternate minimum tax (AMT) in the amended tax reform bill passed by the Senate, last Saturday. The latest draft awaits finalization by a conference committee of House and Senate members.The inclusion of AMT in the final bill will weigh on corporate earnings as companies will have to pay tax on reinvested and deferred cash earnings. It is believed that tax reforms — which aim to lower the corporate tax rate to stimulate economic as well as employment growth — will not prove beneficial to large-cap entities.However, the proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of drugs/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last. It goes without saying that significant uncertainty regarding the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform has cast a pall on the future of the biotech sector.In fact, the drugs/biotech space, which picked up this year after the 2016 debacle, has been witnessing a correction since October. The sector has lost 5.6% so far in the fourth quarter (Oct 1 to date). A major factor that resulted in this correction is the uncertainty surrounding the passing of the tax reform.The drugs/biotech market has witnessed a decline of 1.6% so far this week due to the broader market pressure. The S&P 500 is down 0.1% in the same time frame.Although the market and the drugs/biotech sector are down this week, there are still quite a few hidden biotech treasures that have witnessed a significant upside.3 Stocks on the RiseHere are three stocks that have gained this week. These have excellent prospects and can prove to be good bets going forward. Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (RVNC  -  Free Report)Revance is a California-based biotechnology company that has soared 18.4% so far this week. The increase was supported by positive top-line results from two pivotal phase III studies evaluating Revance’s next-generation neuromodulator, RT002 (daxibotulinumtoxin), for reducing wrinkles between the brows (glabellar lines).Data from the study showed that RT002 achieved substantial reduction in severity of glabellar lines for a long-acting duration of six months. Notably, the time taken by RT002 in treating glabellar lines is better than the currently marketed neuromodulators including Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Botox.Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Shares of Rockville, MD-based Sucampo have risen 21.8% so far this week. Rumors of a takeover probably pushed its share price up this week. Sucampo’s shares have been rising over the last couple of months backed by several positive developments.In late September, Sucampo announced that a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the company’s marketed drug, Amitiza has been accepted and granted priority review by the FDA. It is currently approved for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) among adult women and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.The company is looking to get the drug’s label expanded to include children aged 6 to 17 years with pediatric functional constipation. A decision is expected on Jan 28, 2018. Moreover, strong earnings in the third quarter coupled with increased earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 led to the consistent rise of the stock.VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc. (VTGN  -  Free Report)VistaGen is a California-based biopharmaceutical company. Shares of the company have surged 150.7% so far this week. The increase in share price was driven by a patent granted by U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to its mid-stage candidate, AV-101, regarding its method of production.The candidate is currently being evaluated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Notably, in early November, VistaGen announced that AV-101 has been granted a European patent.The patent granted in the United States and the EU strengthens the company’s strategy for intellectual property.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2213,AGN,"Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced positive results from a phase III study, IMmotion 151 on immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq.The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq and Avastin versus Sutent in renal cell carcinoma patients.The study met its co-primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and demonstrated that the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin provided a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction of disease worsening or death (PFS) in patients with PD-L1 protein compared with Sutent for first-line treatment of patients suffering from advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.Top-line results from the co-primary endpoint of overall survival are not mature.IMmotion151 is the second successive positive phase III study of Tecentriq that includes an Avastin combination component as an initial treatment. The study followed the positive phase III non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) IMpower150 study that revealed that Tecentriq and Avastin plus chemotherapy had a PFS advantage over Avastin plus chemotherapy.We note that Tecentriq is already approved in the European Union, United States for previously treated metastatic NSCLC and metastatic urothelial cancer. So far this year, shares of the company have moved up 12.3% compared with the industry’s gain of 20.4%.In addition, Roche announced positive results from the randomised phase II GO29365 study that compared polatuzumab vedotin in combination with bendamustine plus MabThera/Rituxan (BR) against BR alone in patients suffering from relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant.The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that the addition of polatuzumab vedotin to BR increased complete response rates from 15-40% (p=0.012) at the end of treatment, as measured by positron emission tomography and assessed by an independent review committee.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are already facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis AG NVS has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) have also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer. The biosimilar to be marketed by the trade name Mvasi is the first cancer biosimilar approved in the United States.Zacks Rank Roche currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2214,AGN,"The market reacted negatively to speculation surrounding the likely retention of the alternate minimum tax (AMT) in the amended tax reform bill passed by the Senate, last Saturday. The latest draft awaits finalization by a conference committee of House and Senate members.The inclusion of AMT in the final bill will weigh on corporate earnings as companies will have to pay tax on reinvested and deferred cash earnings. It is believed that tax reforms — which aim to lower the corporate tax rate to stimulate economic as well as employment growth — will not prove beneficial to large-cap entities.However, the proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of drugs/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last. It goes without saying that significant uncertainty regarding the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform has cast a pall on the future of the biotech sector.In fact, the drugs/biotech space, which picked up this year after the 2016 debacle, has been witnessing a correction since October. The sector has lost 5.6% so far in the fourth quarter (Oct 1 to date). A major factor that resulted in this correction is the uncertainty surrounding the passing of the tax reform.The drugs/biotech market has witnessed a decline of 1.6% so far this week due to the broader market pressure. The S&P 500 is down 0.1% in the same time frame.Although the market and the drugs/biotech sector are down this week, there are still quite a few hidden biotech treasures that have witnessed a significant upside.3 Stocks on the RiseHere are three stocks that have gained this week. These have excellent prospects and can prove to be good bets going forward. Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (RVNC  -  Free Report)Revance is a California-based biotechnology company that has soared 18.4% so far this week. The increase was supported by positive top-line results from two pivotal phase III studies evaluating Revance’s next-generation neuromodulator, RT002 (daxibotulinumtoxin), for reducing wrinkles between the brows (glabellar lines).Data from the study showed that RT002 achieved substantial reduction in severity of glabellar lines for a long-acting duration of six months. Notably, the time taken by RT002 in treating glabellar lines is better than the currently marketed neuromodulators including Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Botox.Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Shares of Rockville, MD-based Sucampo have risen 21.8% so far this week. Rumors of a takeover probably pushed its share price up this week. Sucampo’s shares have been rising over the last couple of months backed by several positive developments.In late September, Sucampo announced that a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the company’s marketed drug, Amitiza has been accepted and granted priority review by the FDA. It is currently approved for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) among adult women and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.The company is looking to get the drug’s label expanded to include children aged 6 to 17 years with pediatric functional constipation. A decision is expected on Jan 28, 2018. Moreover, strong earnings in the third quarter coupled with increased earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 led to the consistent rise of the stock.VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc. (VTGN  -  Free Report)VistaGen is a California-based biopharmaceutical company. Shares of the company have surged 150.7% so far this week. The increase in share price was driven by a patent granted by U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to its mid-stage candidate, AV-101, regarding its method of production.The candidate is currently being evaluated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Notably, in early November, VistaGen announced that AV-101 has been granted a European patent.The patent granted in the United States and the EU strengthens the company’s strategy for intellectual property.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2215,AGN,"Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) member, Genentech announced that the FDA has converted accelerated approval for Avastin (received in May 2009) for previously treated glioblastoma, most aggressive form of brain cancer, to full approval.The full approval was based on data from the phase III EORTC 26101study in which Avastin-based treatment increased the time to disease progression or death compared to chemotherapy alone. The study, however, did not meet the primary endpoint as there was no significant increase in overall survival with Avastin-based treatment.However, it showed that patients were able to completely stop intake of corticosteroids while on treatment in the Avastin arm compared to the control arm. The evidence from the study, which showed that Avastin treatment delayed disease progression and reduced the need for corticosteroids, led to the conversion of the provisional approval to a full one.Apart from the recent approval, the drug is already approved in the United States  for various indications that include- first- or second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, advanced nonsquamous non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic kidney cancer and advanced cervical cancer and recurrent ovarian cancer.So far this year, shares of the company have increased 8.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 15%.However, the drug has been facing competition and has been witnessing declining sales. In September 2017, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA approved their biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer. The biosimilar to be marketed by the trade name Mvasi is the first cancer biosimilar approved in the United States. It is also the first biosimilar for Avastin in the same country.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderRoche carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2216,AGN,"Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (RVNC  -  Free Report) shares surged more than 33% on Dec 5 after the company announced positive top-line results from two pivotal phase III studies, evaluating its next-generation neuromodulator, RT002 (daxibotulinumtoxin), for reducing wrinkles that lies between the brows (glabellar lines).Both the phase III studies, SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2, met their primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating highly statistically significant improvement in severity of glabellar lines with RT002 against placebo. Data from the study showed that RT002 delivered substantial reduction in severity of glabellar lines for a long-acting duration of six months. The candidate was generally well tolerated in both the trials.Notably, the duration achieved by RT002 in treating glabellar lines is better than any other marketed neuromodulators which demonstrates a duration of three-four months. It is important to note that Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) shares dropped almost 2% following the news release as RT002 is considered a potential threat to the company’s lead drug, Botox, which is marketed for the same indication. RT002 has a longer duration compared with Allergan’s Botox of five months.Revance’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has soared 66.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 0.9% in the same time frame.Notably, the company is conducting a long-term safety trial, SAKURA 3, on RT002 that already enrolled more than 2,500 patients across 66 sites in the United States and Canada. The study is expected to complete in the second half of 2018. If the study is successful, plans are afoot to submit regulatory applications to the FDA in the first half of 2019 with a potential launch in 2020. Per the company, RT002 will be the first neuromodulator with a long-acting duration of six months, if approved.Per the data from Global Industry Analysts, the global aesthetic market represented revenues of about $1.6 billion in 2016 for treatments with neuromodulators. Moreover, patients and physicians consider the effect of treatment duration as the most significant component for any injectable neuromodulator. Hence, approval of the candidate is expected to cater to the hugely unmet needs of patients preferring longer duration for treatment of glabellar lines.We remind investors that RT002 is also being evaluated in other clinical programs for different indications. Revance plans to initiate a phase III study on RT002 for treating cervical dystonia (a neurological muscle movement disorder) in 2018. RT002 was recently granted an orphan drug designation for cervical dystonia indication in the United States. Moreover, it also plans to release results from a phase II study, evaluating RT002 for management of plantar fasciitis by this year-end.Revance Therapeutics, Inc. Price Revance Therapeutics, Inc.

2217,AGN,"Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT  -  Free Report) have been rising for the past six months. The biotech company’s stock has rallied 72.4%, significantly outperforming the 0.6% rise of the industry in this period.The company has only one marketed product in its portfolio, Exondys 51, which received accelerated approval last year in September. The drug is approved for treating patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”), a rare genetic disorder affecting children, who have confirmed mutation of the DMD gene susceptible to exon 51 skipping.The company has progressed well with the commercialization of Exondys 51 and development of pipeline candidates in the past six monthsExondys 51 Picks Up WellCombined sales of the drug in these two quarters were $81 million, with sales increasing 31.4% sequentially in the third quarter. Sarepta has increased its revenue guidance for the fiscal in its second and third quarter results due to impressive adoption of Exondys 51 among patients. The company expects to end the year with total sales in the range of $150 million to $155 million, indicating sequential growth of 15%-25% in the fourth quarter.In July, Sarepta had launched a Managed Access Program in Europe and Americas to increase the reach of the drug.In July 2017, Sarepta settled an ongoing global patent litigation with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) regarding the exclusive license on a patent pertaining to exon skipping technology used in DMD therapies. The settlement removes a major overhang for Sarepta as BioMarin has granted global exclusive rights to its DMD patent estate for Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products to Sarepta.Pipeline ProgressSarepta is looking to build its DMD pipeline beyond Exondys 51 by developing other exon-skipping treatments.Sarepta’s lead candidate, golodirsen, has demonstrated 100% response rate with 10.7 times increase in mean dystrophin protein from baseline in DMD patients in a phase I/II study. The data were reported in September 2017.We remind investors that Exondys 51 had achieved nearly three times increase in mean dystrophin protein from baseline. The better efficacy shown by golodirsen in dystrophin production has increased investors skepticism about its potential to become a new and better treatment option for DMD patients.Sarepta has also entered into a gene therapy research collaboration with French Muscular Dystrophy Association, Genethon to gain access to the latter’s micro-dystrophin gene therapy that is capable of targeting majority of DMD patients.Meanwhile, in June, the company appointed Douglas Ingram as its new president and CEO. Ingram has extensive experience in leading a biotech company as he had worked in various capacities at Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report). It remains to be seen how Ingram uses his expertise to help Sarepta achieve its potential.Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. Price  Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. Price | Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.

2218,AGN,"After a couple of quiet weeks, the cancer space witnessed some activity with FDA actions on label expansion and positive data readouts on major drugs from several companies. Meanwhile, a biosimilar for a blockbuster cancer drug received approval in Europe. A new drug was also granted approval for the treatment of leukemia.Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis, received FDA nod to include overall survival (“OS”) data from the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study on its label. The first CAR-T therapy to receive approval, Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah, got a boost as the FDA accepted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking label expansion in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”). Moreover, AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Lynparza got the FDA nod for label expansion in metastatic breast cancer. Teva Pharmaceutical also announced approval of label expansion of its acute promyelocytic leukemia drug, Trisenox injection, in first-line setting, in combination with tretinoin.Moreover, Amgen and partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced the approval of Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin in Europe.Data readouts included encouraging data on Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda from confirmatory phase III lung cancer study and Exelixis, Inc.’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) Cabometyx from phase III hepatocellular carcinoma study. Apart from these, BioLineRx Ltd (BLRX  -  Free Report) also announced encouraging partial results from a phase IIa COMBAT study in pancreatic cancer on its lead pipeline candidate, BL-8040. Partial data from the study showed that BL-8040 as a monotherapy is safe and well- tolerated in patients with the given indication.Let’s see the news in details.Amgen’s Kyprolis Gets a Label Update; Avastin’s Biosimilar Approved: The FDA approved a regulatory application to include OS data from ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis.

2219,AGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of Trisenox injection to include first-line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (“APL”) patients in combination with tretinoin.The eligible APL patients should have t(15;17) translocation or PML/RAR-alpha gene expression.Trisenox is currently approved for a similar indication in patients who are refractory/relapsed to retinoid and anthracycline chemotherapy.The drug is already approved in the EU as both first-line and second-line treatment for this indication.Teva’s shares have declined 35% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 19% in that period.According to the company, Trisenox, in combination with retinoic acid, can increase survival rates, dramatically reduce the risk of relapse, and help avoid chemotherapy-related side effects in low-to-intermediate risk APL patients. It has been seen in clinical studies that Trisenox, in combination with retinoic acid, can lead to a 99% overall survival rate with almost no relapse after more than four years (50 months) of median follow-up.Teva’s oncology portfolio includes five drugs, which performed well in the third quarter of 2017. It registered year-over-year growth of 12% to reach $302 million. The label expansion of Trisenox is expected to further boost the portfolio’s performance in the coming quarters.However, Teva is facing headwinds due to pricing pressure in the generics industry. Also, the approval of Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) generic version of its key drug, Copaxone, in October last year had a negative impact on its fourth quarter revenue guidance.Moreover, the Israeli firm is also facing a huge debt load, which swelled with the acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generic division in 2016.In a bid to get rid of its problems, the company brought in a new chief executive officer (“CEO”), Kare Schultz, who had played an instrumental role in the turnaround of Denmark’s H. Lundbeck A/S, which was struggling with a string of losses. He also worked as the chief operating officer of another Denmark based drug giant, Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report).The new CEO announced restructuring plans in December 2017 in order to reduce cost and improve business performance, profitability, cash flow generation and productivity. Teva has announced to cut about 14,000 job cuts (more than 25% of the company’s global workforce) over the next two years with the majority expected in 2018. The company will also shut down many of its offices and R&D facilities around the globe and divest the assets. The moves are expected to reduce its $16.1 billion cost base (estimated for 2017) by $3 billion at the end of 2019.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteZacks RankTeva carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2220,AGN,"Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) stock was up 19% in 2017, which compared favorably with a gain of 2.8% recorded by the industry.Last year’s share price surge was supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies and rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.The positive trend is likely to continue this year as well.What Backed the Stock’s Rally in 2017?A few new products were approved last year. While the FDA approved Mvasi -  Amgen and Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Avastin - and Parsabiv for secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), EU approved Amgevita, Amgen’s biosimilar version of Humira,Amgen also gained approval for several line extensions - FDA approval to include a new indication - risk reduction of major cardiovascular events data – on Repatha’s labeland overall survival datafrom the TOWER study on leukemia drug Blincyto’s label; approval for arefined indication for metastatic colorectal cancerdrug Vectibix and EU approval for a pediatric formulation of Mimparafor secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive their sales higher in future quarters.In 2017, Amgen made several data presentations from studies evaluating line extensions on key marketed products, Repatha and Kyprolis- both with blockbuster potential - and other studies on its pipeline candidates, tezepelumab(asthma) and Evenity(osteoporosis)Factors Likely to Support the Stock in 2018With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock is likely to continue.This year, Amgen expects regulatory approval for pipeline candidates, Aimovig/erenumab(prevention of episodic and chronic migraine) and Evenity and label expansion for Prolia and Kyprolis. This month, Amgen already received FDA approval for an expanded patient population for Xgeva - multiple myeloma patients. In the biosimilars portfolio, Amgen expects EU approval for Mvasi and FDA/EU approval for the biosimilar version of Roche’s other cancer drug, Herceptin.Also, Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are performing well, a trend expected to continue next year, which should drive sales. Sales of other newer products like Kyprolis, Repatha and Blincyto are expected to pick up in 2018 as they were approved forlabel expansions last year.Besides this, Amgen’s restructuring plan is making it leaner and more cost efficient,which should lend support to the bottom line.Though Amgen faces some challenges, given the presenceof biosimilar competition, slowdown in sales of mature drugs, mainly its blockbuster drug Enbrel, the positives are expected to outweigh the headwinds.Amgen markets Enbrel in partnership with Pfizer, Inc.

2221,AGN,"Quite a few pharmaceutical industry mergers – including some large deals - may be in the cards in 2018 now that the tax reforms are in place. The tax bill was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in December last yearThe tax rate for corporates will now go down from 35% to 21%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%. Also the tax cuts are expected to prevent inversions, which were rampant in the drug industry.These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been few in 2017 compared to 2016.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion were the only two noteworthy deals of 2017.This week, senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical/biotech companies discussed the impact of tax reform on mergers and acquisition and their plans to use the excess cash at the JP Morgan HealthCare conference.What the CEOs Said?Brent Saunders, chief executive officer (CEO) of Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) said that the first half of the year is likely to see smaller deals such as the one by Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) while the bigger high profile mergers of large pharmaceuticals/biotech companies would probably happen in the latter half of the year or next year.Last week, Celgene announced that it has offered to buy a small cancer drug developer, Impact Biomedicines. (Read More: Celgene to Acquire Impact Biomedicines to Boost Pipeline).Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) CEO Dave Ricks and J&J’s Chief Financial Officer, Dominic Caruso said that with the tax cuts, American companies can compete better with their foreign counterparts, which operate in better tax environments. Caruso said the new tax law provides “more flexibility and ease of analysis in terms of getting a transaction done”.Along the same lines, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO, Meg Tirrell, said that having access to overseas cash will give it more financial flexibility to “think about different ways to go about the M&A transactions”. Tirrell, however, confidently said that even before the new tax law was implemented, the company had “enough power in their balance sheet” to make the bolt-on acquisitions it wanted to do.Michel Vounatsos, Biogen's (BIIB  -  Free Report) CEO, smartly argued that though the tax overhaul may spur some M&A activity, the rationale behind any M&A activity should not be the cash available. He went on to say that they are looking at “all sets of potential targets”.Gilead CEO, John Milligan, said that the tax reform is good for the company as it “allows to plan for the long term” since the FDA approval process is quite lengthy. Meanwhile, it maintained its goal of investing in M&A to replenish the pipeline. He also said that the excess cash will allow it to clean up its balance sheet by repaying debt.Conclusion Overall, it is quite clear that the drug industry is optimistic that the tax reform will fuel greater M&A activity in 2018.As it is, major drug/biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buyouts. Strategic M&A and licensing deals are therefore inevitable for innovation starved drug/biotech companies looking for growth in a highly competitive and global marketplace.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. What matters for companies looking to buy a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of the latter’s drugs/products, prospects of sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2222,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report), in a regulatory filing, announced that it is laying off over 1,000 employees as part of a cost-saving and restructuring program to protect it from potential revenue declines.Allergan said the job cuts will impact employees in commercial functions that revolve around products and categories already facing or will face loss of exclusivity. Allergan also said that it plans to eliminate an additional 400 open positions.While the company estimates to incur costs of approximately $125 million, the job cuts and other cost-savings measures are expected to save operating costs between $300 and $400 this year. Also, the majority of the costs, primarily due to severance, will be recorded in the fourth quarter.Allergan currently employs more than 18,000 people.The job cuts come at a time when Allergan is facing potential loss of exclusivity for several of its key products in 2018 including Alzheimer’s treatment, Namenda XR and blockbuster dry-eye drug, Restasis, which is expected to hurt sales.Allergan is adopting different ways of protecting Restasis, its second best-selling drug, from generic competition. Restasis recorded sales of $1.06 billion in the first nine months of 2017.Allergan came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe under which the latter obtained the rights to six patents covering Restasis and Allergan was granted exclusive licenses to Restasis products. Lawmakers questioned the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect Restasis from generic competition. The deal with the Tribe has raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drug makers from making cheaper versions of expensive drugs.However, in October 2017, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis, potentially opening doors for early generic competition. Though Restasis patents are scheduled to expire in August 2024, a generic version may be launched as early as mid-2018.Also, this year, Allergan faces loss of patent exclusivity for Estrace vaginal cream and ulcerative colitis drug Delzicol. Last week, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched the first generic version for Estrace cream.Also, new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s (SGYP  -  Free Report) Trulance (plecanatide) was launched last yearfor chronic idiopathic constipation, which could pose competition to Allergan’s Linzess.In the past year, Allergan’s shares have declined 22.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 26.8%. The job cuts are aimed to save some dollars at a time when Allergan is facing competitive and generic pressure related to some of its highest revenue generating products.Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2223,AGN,"Key announcements this week include a couple of acquisition announcements and regulatory updates from Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRoche to Buy Cancer-Focused Ignyta for $1.7 Billion: Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report), which has a strong presence in the cancer market, announced its intention to acquire Ignyta in a deal valued at $1.7 billion ($27 per share). Ignyta is focused on the development of precisely targeted therapeutics guided by diagnostic tests for cancer patients. This acquisition will add entrectinib, a selective CNS-active tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) to Roche’s pipeline. Entrectinib, which is being developed for tumors that harbor ROS1 or NTRK fusions, is currently in a pivotal phase II study that could support dual NDA submissions if successful. Entrectinib has Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the United States and PRIME designation in the EU. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Roche Clinches $1.7-Billion Deal to Acquire Ignyta). Roche is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mallinckrodt to Boost Rare Disease Portfolio with $1.2 Billion Sucampo Acquisition: Another acquisition deal was announced this week with specialty pharma company, Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report), saying that it will acquire Sucampo for approximately $1.2 billion ($18 per share). The deal, if it closes in the first quarter of 2018, is expected to boost Mallinckrodt’s 2018 earnings by at least 30 cents per share and 2019 earnings by at least 60 cents per share. The deal will add marketed products, Amitiza and Rescula, to Mallinckrodt’s portfolio and a couple of phase III assets, VTS-270 (Niemann-Pick type C - NPC) and CPP-1X/sulindac (familial adenomatous polyposis - FAP), to its pipeline.The peak net sales potential of VTS-270 is estimated to be more than $150 million while that of CPP-1X/sulindac is estimated to be more than $300 million. The target is to file for VTS-270 in 2018 (potential approval in 2019) and CPP-1X/sulindac in early 2019 followed by potential approval later in the year.The acquisition, in addition to boosting Mallinckrodt’s rare disease portfolio, shows the company’s efforts to diversify its marketed products portfolio (Read more: Mallinckrodt to Buy Sucampo for $1.2B to Diversify Portfolio).Regulatory Updates from Novartis: The FDA has expanded the label of Novartis’s Tasigna so that treatment-free remission (“TFR”) data is now part of the label. The inclusion of this data provides an additional and novel option in the management of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP).Novartis also announced that its Tafinlar + Mekinist combination therapy has been granted priority review by the FDA for the adjuvant treatment of stage III BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. Approval would make Tafinlar + Mekinist the first adjuvant targeted therapy combination to demonstrate a significant clinical benefit in patients with a BRAF V600 mutation. With the FDA granting priority review, the agency is expected to respond within six months from the date of submission of the application instead of the usual ten months.Novartis has gained 15.7% year to date, compared to the 16.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Allergan Announces Combigan Ruling: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) suffered a setback with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruling that certain Combigan patents are valid but not infringed. The court said that Sandoz's proposed generic version of Combigan does not infringe the '149 and '976 patents covering Combigan and reversed an earlier district court decision that the generic product infringes the '425 patent. Allergan intends to file petitions within 30 days.

2224,AGN,"Shares of Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) have declined 42.3% in 2017 as against the industry’s 5.2% rally.  Intercept’s lead drug, Ocaliva was approved in the United States, in combination with ursodeoxycholic (UDCA) for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults who are unable to endure UDCA in 2016. The drug was also granted conditional approval by the European Commission.The initial uptake of the drug was encouraging. In third-quarter 2017 Ocaliva recorded $40.9 million of sales, up from $30.4 million recorded in the second quarter.However, prescription demand softened following the Dear Health Care Provider letter and the FDA safety communication on Ocaliva. The FDA reported 19 deaths due to Ocaliva and stated that the drug may also affect the liver. However, Intercept conducted an analysis and concluded that these patients were prescribed once daily doses of Ocaliva, which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose. The analysis was conducted in consultation with the FDA. Consequently, Intercept issued the Dear Healthcare Provider letter. Thereafter, the FDA issued their own safety communication to reinforce recommended label dosing. Intercept is also working with the FDA on further updates to Ocaliva’s label for safety purposes.Thus, such news are likely to dent the sales potential.Meanwhile, Ocaliva is being evaluated for other indications including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The company has earlier stated plans to initiate a phase III trial on Ocaliva in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017. We expect the trial to start in 2018.The FDA has approved a redesign of the phase III trial, REGENERATE on Ocaliva for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis. The company now needs to achieve only one co primary endpoint- either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared with the earlier target of achieving both. The sample size of the trial has also been reduced to approximately 750 patients or about 250 patients per arm. The company completed enrolment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial (data readout in the first half of 2019). NASH market has huge potential and a tentative approval will boost Ocaliva’s prospects.  However, bigwigs like Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) have FXR agonists in phase II or earlier stages of clinical development that can be used to treat PBC, NASH and the other liver diseases.  Gilead is conducting multiple phase III trials in NASH patients of various disease severity with selonsertib, an inhibitor of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1. The company is also exploring additional studies in NASH for GS-0976, a small molecule allosteric inhibitor that acts at the protein-protein homodimer interface of acetyl-CoA carboxylases acquired from Nimbus Therapeutics, LLC, and an FXR agonist known as GS-9674. Gilead is also studying a number of compounds in other liver diseases including PBC and PSC.Allergan Plc (AGN  -  Free Report) also has an ongoing phase III trial of cenicriviroc, an immunomodulator that blocks C-C chemokine receptor type 2 and type 5, for the treatment of NASH. Thus this can pose a stiff competition to Intercept.It is unlikely that the stock will turnaround in 2018. A tentative approval in NASH might boost investore sentiment though.Zacks RankIntercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2225,AGN,"Key announcements this week include the FDA approval of an eye disease drug as well as a diabetes treatment and label expansions for existing products. Regulatory and pipeline updates were also provided by companies like AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAerie’s Rhopressa Gains FDA Approval: Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI  -  Free Report) got a boost with the earlier-than-expected FDA approval of Rhopressa for the lowering of elevated intraocular pressure (“IOP”) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. While approval was expected considering a favorable advisory panel vote in October, approval came about a couple of months ahead of the Feb 28, 2018 PDUFA (Prescription Drug User Fee Act) goal date. Rhopressa is the first product in Aerie’s portfolio and the company expects to launch the product by mid-second quarter of 2018 (Read more: Aerie Gets Early FDA Approval for Lead Drug Rhopressa).Merck/Pfizer’s Diabetes Drug Gets FDA Nod: SGLT2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin), which has been developed by Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), gained FDA approval for the treatment of type II diabetes. Steglatro will be entering the highly crowded diabetes market which already has other SGLT2 inhibitors in the form of Invokana, Farxiga and Jardiance. Steglatro has also been approved for use in combination with metformin under the brand name Segluromet and with Januvia under the brand name Steglujan.Priority Review for AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso Label Expansion: AstraZeneca’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of Tagrisso (osimertinib), for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) whose tumors have EGFR mutations has been granted priority review by the FDA. Approval for this indication would expand the patient population significantly (Read more: AstraZeneca's Tagrisso Label Expansion Filing Accepted by FDA).J&J’s Janssen in CAR-T Deal, Priority Review for Apalutamide: J&J’s Janssen Biotech has inked a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Legend Biotech USA Inc. and Legend Biotech Ireland Limited, subsidiaries of Genscript Biotech Corporation, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of a chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) T-cell drug candidate, LCAR-B38M. LCAR-B38M, which specifically targets the B-cell maturation antigen (“BCMA”), is currently under regulatory review in China for multiple myeloma (“MM”).Meanwhile, clinical studies are being planned for the United States. Under the terms of the deal, global net trade sales, excluding the Greater China area, will be recorded by Janssen. The companies will split costs and profits equally except in Greater China, where Janssen and Legend will have a 30/70% cost-sharing/profit-split arrangement. The deal terms also include a $350 million upfront payment from Janssen and additional payments on the achievement of development, regulatory and sales milestones.This is the latest agreement in the field of CAR-T, which has been attracting a lot of interest in recent quarters.Janssen also announced that it got priority review status from the FDA for its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for apalutamide, the company’s investigational, next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”). With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out in April 2018. Given that there are no FDA-approved treatments currently available for this patient population, timely approval would be a boost for the company’s cancer portfolio.J&J has gained 22.4% year to date, compared to the 16.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Allergan Provides Updates on Vraylar & Seysara: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) provided a couple of updates on the pipeline front. The company and its partner Gedeon Richter said that Vraylar (cariprazine) met the primary endpoint in a late-stage in adults with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression). The companies plan to seek label expansion into this indication in the second half of 2018 (Read more: Allergan's Vraylar Positive for Bipolar Disease in Phase III).Allergan also announced that the NDA for Seysara has been accepted for review. Allergan and partner Paratek Pharmaceuticals are looking to get the antibiotic approved for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older. Approval could come in the second half of 2018.FDA Expands Label of Pfizer’s Bosulif, Grants BTD to Bavencio: The FDA has given its nod for the label expansion of Pfizer’s Bosulif for its use in newly-diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph+ CML) patients. Bosulif‘s initial approval was for use in patients with chronic, accelerated or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.The expanded indication will increase the addressable patient population significantly. According to the American Cancer Society, about 9,000 new CML cases were diagnosed in the United States in 2017.Pfizer also announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) for Bavencio (avelumab) for use in combination with Inlyta in treatment-naïve patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). Avelumab is partnered with Merck KGaA. Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s).This is the second time that Bavencio has received BTD for a hard-to-treat cancer, the first time being for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) whose disease has progressed after at least one previous chemotherapy regimen.Label Expansion and Clinical Trial Collaboration for BMY’s Opdivo: Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo, gained FDA approval for yet another indication. The regulatory agency granted approval to Opdivo for intravenous use for the adjuvant treatment of patients with completely resected melanoma with lymph node involvement or metastatic disease. Opdivo is already approved for a wide range of indications alone as well as in combination with other agents and is currently in several studies as well.In fact, the company also announced a clinical trial collaboration with TARIS Biomedical for the evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of TARIS’ TAR-200 (GemRIS) in combination with Opdivo. A phase Ib study will evaluate the combination in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (“MIBC”) who are scheduled for radical cystectomy. Opdivo is one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’s portfolio with the product bringing in sales of $3.6 billion in the first nine months of 2017.Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up slightly (0.4%) over the last five trading sessions.

2226,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) along with partner Paratek Pharmaceuticals (PRTK  -  Free Report) announced that its new drug application (NDA) for its investigational, once-daily, Seysara (sarecycline) has been accepted for review by the FDA for treatment of patients aged nine years and above with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. The company expects a response from the FDA in the second half of 2018.A look at Allergan’s share price movement so far this year shows that the stock has outperformed the industry. Though the stock has lost 21.1%, the industry has decreased 27.9%. Also shares of Paratek were up 15.2% during the period.Allergan completed its NDA submission for Seysara in October, based on positive data from two phase III (n=2002) studies — SC1401 and SC1402 — respectively. The trials met the primary endpoints and revealed that patients treated with Seysara (1.5 mg/kg) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in acne severity compared with placebo at week 12.Notably, Allergan owns the rights for development and commercialization of Seysara in the United States while Paratek retains the rights in the ex-U.S. markets.Among other players conducting trials on candidates in the same space, Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (FOMX  -  Free Report) is developing FMX101 in late-stage studies for treating moderate to severe acne.We remind investors that Allergan has more than 55 projects in mid-to-late stage development.

2227,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report), along with partner Gedeon Richter, announced positive top-line results from a second pivotal phase III study on its schizophrenia drug Vraylar.The study evaluated Vraylar (cariprazine) for treatment of adult patients with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression).Notably, Vraylar is already approved in the United States and the EU for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder as well as for schizophrenia. Additionally, the FDA approved the drug last month for an expanded use as a maintenance therapy for treatment of schizophrenia.Shares of Allergan have declined 18.6% this year so far, comparing favorably with the industry’s decrease of 26%.The phase III (RGH-MD-54) study was investigating two doses of Vraylar (1.5 mg and 3 mg) in a total of 488 patients with bipolar I depression. The study met its primary endpoints and showed a significant improvement in patients compared with placebo. The drug was generally well-tolerated in the study. However, we also note that of the total number of patients, around 5.0% being treated with Vraylar discontinued the trial due to adverse events in comparison to 2.5% treated with placebo.Based on the above reported data, the company is planning to submit regulatory applications to the FDA in the second half of 2018.Significantly, Allergan has a licensing agreement with Gideon Richter, a Hungarian multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, to co-develop and market Vraylar in the United States as well as Canada.Vraylar has performed well in the first nine months of 2017, recording sales of $200.1 million compared with $51.1 million, registered in the same period a year ago. The drug is likely to be a key driver of Allergan’s top line in 2018.Per National Alliance of Mental Illness, bipolar disorder is one of the most common mental diseases and the third most common cause of hospitalization in the United States for both youth and adults aged between 18 and 44 years. Moreover, 2.6% of adults in the country live with bipolar disorder. Hence, approval of the drug for the expanded indication will provide the company with access to a wider patient population base with bipolar issues.Other players in the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia treatment market include AstraZeneca plc's (AZN  -  Free Report) Seroquel XR, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) Risperdal Consta and Alkermes plc's (ALKS  -  Free Report) Aristada.Allergan PLC.

2228,AGN,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line data from a phase IV study evaluating its marketed drug, Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium bromide 400 mg, twice-daily), for an expanded indication.The phase IV ASCENT was conducted to expand the label Tudorza to include patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”) with cardiovascular risk factors. The post-marketing requirement (PMR) study was requested by the FDA and was conducted on a total of 3630 patients. The study met its both primary efficacy and safety endpoints. Data from the study demonstrated that treatment with Tudorza led to a statistically significant reduction in the annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared with placebo.Notably, Tudorza is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) which is also marketed under the brand name Eklira and Bretaris for treatment of COPD in more than 50 countries globally including the United States.AstraZeneca’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 17.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 15.5% in the same time frame.A full evaluation of the ASCENT data is underway and further results will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting. Based on positive ASCENT data AstraZeneca expects to submit a supplemental new drug application (NDA) to the FDA to expand the label of Tudorza.The potential label expansion of Tudorza will provide the company with access to a wider patient-population base suffering from COPD.We remind investors that in March 2015, AstraZeneca acquired the rights to Allergan's (AGN  -  Free Report) branded respiratory business, which added Tudorza in its portfolio.In April, the company entered into a strategic collaboration with Circassia Pharmaceuticals Plc for development and commercialization of Tudorza and another COPD drug Duaklir in the United States.AstraZeneca’s COPD products in the market include Symbicort, Pulmicort et al. Sales of its respiratory portfolio have declined 5% in the first nine months of the year due to pricing pressure and competition in the United States and the EU.Importantly, the company’s promising respiratory treatments in the pipeline include tralokinumab in phase III studies for severe asthma and PT010, also in phase III studies for treating COPD. AstraZeneca expects to launch four new respiratory medicines between 2017 and 2020.It remains to be seen if these candidates can improve the company’s respiratory sales upon approval.Per the company’s press release, COPD is a progressive serious lung disease, commonly found to affect approximately 329 million people worldwide. Moreover, cardiovascular risks are seen to have the biggest effect on patients with COPD, representing a significant need for such therapies.Astrazeneca PLC Price Astrazeneca PLC Price | Astrazeneca PLC QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, it was down 6.2% at the close of trade on Monday following broader market pressures. In fact, Ironwood’s shares have fallen 10.2% in the past six months, underperforming the industry’s gain of 0.4% in that period.The sGC candidate was evaluated in two separate phase IIa studies in diabetic patients with hypertension. One study evaluated two dosing regimens – once daily 40 mg for 14 days and 20 mg daily two times for first seven days, followed by once daily 40 mg for the next seven days. The other one was a dose escalating study.Data from the studies showed that IW-1973 reduced blood pressure by 6.3 mmHg from baseline against 1.6 mmHg for placebo. Moreover, the candidate reduced fasting glucose and cholesterol levels by 32.5 mg/dL and 24.7 mg/dL, respectively, from baseline.The patient population treated with IW-1973 kept their existing treatment regimen intact. The treatment regimens included separate medications for hypertension and diabetes. The encouraging results achieved by the candidate may pave the way for a potential single medication for treating both the diseases. The candidate will also be able to treat other metabolic abnormalities like high cholesterol and serum lipid levels.Apart from these two studies, Ironwood is also developing the candidate in phase II studies for treating diabetic nephropathy and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.Along with pipeline progress, Ironwood’s key marketed product, Linzess, is also growing on the back of broad payer access and continued demand. However, Ironwood shares its brand collaboration profits or losses equally with Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report).  Meanwhile, a potential approval to Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s (SGYP  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application in January next year seeking approval for label expansion of Trulance in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation will increase competition.Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2230,AGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) new chief executive officer, Kare Schultz announced a new organizational and leadership structure to save costs and increase productivity. The organizational changes that include the departure of heads of three divisions will be effective immediately.Shares of Teva rose 7.6% on Monday. However, shares have slumped 59.6% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 30.3%.The Israeli drugmaker will no longer have two separate global groups for its two businesses – generics and specialty medicines. Instead, Teva will now operate through three regions —North America, Europe and Growth Markets — which will include generics, specialty, and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines.The Generic R&D and Specialty R&D organizations will be combined into one consolidated Global R&D unit.  It will be headed by Dr. Hafrun Fridriksdottir, who was until now serving as President of Global Generics R&D. A Marketing & Portfolio function has been formed that will take care of the interface between regions, R&D and operations.However, Schultz, who joined Teva on Nov 1, made no mention of the workforce reductions, rumors of which have been doing the rounds lately. Last week, an Israeli newspaper published a report, which stated that Teva will cut its U.S. workforce by “tens of percents” and its Israeli workforce by 20-25%.  However, the company did say that it is working on a detailed restructuring plan, details of which will be shared next month.The Israeli newspaper report also said its current head of R&D and chief scientific officer, Michael Hayden will be removed. In the latest press release, Teva confirmed the rumor stating that Hayden will retire at the end of this year along with Dr. Rob Koremans and Dipankar Bhattacharjee, head of its Specialty Medicines and Generic Medicine groups, respectively. Teva also announced some top leadership changes including Michael McClellan as executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective immediately.Teva is facing significant challenges in the form of generic competition for its largest branded drug - Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from new generic launches and a massive debt load.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure, which affects the company’s top-line performance. An increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation are resulting in additional competitive pressure in the industry. The challenges in the U.S. generics market are expected to continue through the rest of this year and probably in the next.Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone’s sales have been declining for quite some time now. Last month, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg formulation, much earlier than expected. Meanwhile, Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is marketed by Momenta and Sandoz, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, since 2015 while Mylan launched its version of the 20 mg formulation last month. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Copaxone sales are expected to erode rapidly.Additionally, the company’s debt burden accrued as a result of the $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generic unit, Allergan Generics in 2016. With nearly $35 billion in debt, the company’s borrowing costs have increased significantly, which is hurting profits.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load. It remains to see if the latest corporate shake-up, rumored layoffs and divestures are enough to revive the company’s fortunes during this challenging period, especially as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2231,AGN,"According to an Israeli newspaper, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) is expected to reduce its workforce by about 4000. Consequently, shares of the company were up by more than 5% in the pre-market trading on Nov 20. However, so far this year, the stock has been down 62.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 30.2%. As per the daily, Teva is also planning to lay off its current president of global research and development and its chief scientific officer, Michael Hayden.Meanwhile, the company is facing significant challenges in the form of generic competition for Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from new generic launches and a massive debt load.The U.S. generics industry is also confronting significant competitive and pricing pressure, thereby affecting the company’s top-line performance. Also, an increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation are resulting in additional competitive pressure in the industry. The challenges in the U.S. generics market are expected to continue this year and probably in the next as well.The company’s lead branded drug, Copaxone, is witnessing declining sales for quite some time now. In October 2017, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg formulation much earlier than expected, which was a in a major blow to Teva.Since 2015,  Glatopa — a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg — is already being marketed by Momenta and Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz, while Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October.Additionally, the company’s profitability is hurt by a huge debt burden accrued as a result of Teva’s $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generic unit, Allergan Generics, in 2016.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load.

2232,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for label expansion of its schizophrenia capsule, Vraylar (cariprazine), for maintenance treatment.Notably, Vraylar is already approved in the United States for acute treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is also approved in Europe for the given indication.Shares of Allergan have declined 16.9% this year so far, comparing favorably with the industry’s decrease of 31.5%.The FDA approval was based on new data from a 72-week study in the prevention of relapse in adult patients with schizophrenia. Data from the study demonstrated that long-term treatment with Vraylar delayed time to relapse compared with placebo over the course of up to 72 Weeks.Significantly, Vraylar has performed above expectations in 2016, recording sales of $94.3 million in the year. The drug is likely to be a key driver of Allergan’s top-line growth in 2017.Per the company’s press release, approximately 2.4 million people are affected by schizophrenia in the United States. Also, the disease relapses in 60-70% patients within a year if no maintenance treatment is taken. Hence, Vraylar’s label expansion as a maintenance therapy will cater to the hugely unmet need of patients, requiring a long-term treatment option for the disease.Other players in the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia treatment market are AstraZeneca plc's (AZN  -  Free Report) Seroquel XR, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) Risperdal Consta and Alkermes plc's (ALKS  -  Free Report) Aristada.Allergan PLC.

Amgen is looking to get Nplate approved for use in pediatric patients (one year of age and older) who are refractory to other treatments like corticosteroids and immunoglobulin.The positive opinion was based on five studies demonstrating that Nplate reduces the rates of bleeding in children with this rare blood disorder.Amgen’s shares have rallied 17.8% this year so far, better than the industry’s growth of 2.3%.In a separate press release, Amgen and partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the CHMP has rendered a positive opinion for the marketing application of its biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Avastin, ABP 215. According to the companies, this may be the first bevacizumab biosimilar, which has been recommended for approval in the EUThe Avastin biosimlar was approved in the United States in September and will be marketed by the trade name of Mvasi.We remind investors that Amgen and Allergan have collaborated for the worldwide development and commercialization of four oncology antibody biosimilar medicines including Roche’s Avastin, Herceptin and Ritixan.In fact, Amgen has 10 biosimilars in its pipeline. Its biosimilar version of Abbvie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, Amjevita, was approved by the FDA last year and in the EU in March this year for the same indications.

2234,AGN,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter 2017 loss of 71 cents per share (including stock-based compensation), wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 62 cents and the year-ago loss of 67 cents.Being a development-stage company, Aerie has not generated any revenues from product sales yet.  Aerie’s share price has increased 59.2% in the last six months as against the industry’s 2.7% decline. Last month, Aerie’s stock price has surged on positive news for its lead drug, Rhopressa.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, research and development expenses declined 2.2% to $12.4 million. General and administrative expenses surged 86.1% to $19.7 million. Higher operating expenses in the quarter were attributed to expansion of the employee base to support operations and commercialization preparatory activities, including commercial manufacturing costs for Rhopressa.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Pipeline UpdatesAerie resubmitted a new drug application (NDA) for lead candidate Rhopressa 0.02% in Feb 2017 and expects a review period of 12 months after withdrawing the NDA filed in September 2016 as a third party manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL was not ready for pre-approval inspection by the FDA. The company initiated preparations to bring a second contract manufacturer online in 2018.On Oct 13, the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted in favor of Rhopressa’s approval. The members of the committee unanimously agreed that the trials support the efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.In addition, majority of the members agreed that the Rhopressa’s efficacy outweigh safety risks.The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Feb 28, 2018. We note that the FDA is not bound by the Advisory Committee’s guidance but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing drugs.Apart from Rhopressa, Aerie is evaluating Roclatan, a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan. The NDA for Roclatan is expected to be filed in second-quarter 2018.  The company also initiated Mercury 3 to support filings in Europe. The trial will be a non-inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort (a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol), marketed by Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) in Europe.Our TakeThe narrower-than-expected loss in the third quarter was encouraging. We are encouraged by the company's efforts in developing its pipeline candidates. A potential approval of Rhopressa in early 2018 will significantly boost growth prospects.Zacks Rank & Key Pick                                                   Aerie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector worth considering is Exelixis, Inc.

The company expects the review to be completed in the first quarter of 2018.In July, Ironwood reported positive data on IW-3718 from a phase IIb study conducted in patients with uncontrolled GERD.

2237,AGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.00 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 per share by 4.8% and declined 24% year over year.Revenues of $5.61 billion were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales increased 1% year over year (up 4% excluding impact of currency), mainly due to the inclusion of an extra month of revenues from Actavis acquisition compared with the third quarter of last year.Teva acquired Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics segment, Actavis Generics and also its U.S. generic distribution business, Anda, Inc. last year.Excluding the benefit from the Actavis generics acquisition, the core sales performance was below expectations. Sales in the quarter were hurt by increased pricing erosion and volume declines in the U.S. Generics unit, ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela and loss of exclusivity in the Specialty segment in the quarter.Segment DiscussionFrom the fourth quarter of 2016, Teva revised its segment structure following the Actavis acquisition. The Generics segment now includes revenues from the OTC business as well as the API business.Generic Medicines segment revenues were $3 billion, down 8% year over year.Revenues from the U.S. generics business declined 9% to $1.2 billion due to significant competitive and pricing pressure in the generics industry. The ongoing consolidation of customers in the generics industry has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Moreover, accelerated FDA approvals of additional generic versions of competing off-patent medicines and increased competition for Concerta authorized generic, also hurt sales.European generic revenues were $985 million, up 6% (1% in local currency) from the year-ago period. This was due to the inclusion of three months revenues from the generic business of Actavis versus two month in the year-ago quarter.Rest of the world (ROW) generic revenues declined 18% to $843 million in the quarter. On a local currency basis, sales rose 5% mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from Actavis.API revenues declined 10% to $171 million. OTC revenues were down 22% to $306 million (up 15% in local currency terms).Specialty Medicines revenues were $2.03 billion, down 1% from the year-ago period due to lower sales of its central nervous system (CNS) products. Among Teva’s various therapeutic areas, CNS sales declined 12% to $1.15 billion due to lower sales of multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, Teva’s lead branded product.Sales of respiratory products rose 30% to $351 million, oncology product sales rose 12% to $302 million, and women’s health business recorded a 9% increase in revenues to $119 million. Other specialty revenues rose 18% to $116 million.Worldwide revenues of Copaxone declined 7% to $987 million mainly due to lower sales in the United States. Sales declined 8% in the United States to $802 million due to lower volumes of the 20 mg formulation and negative net pricing effects despite the 7.9% price increase taken in January.Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is being marketed by Momenta and Sandoz, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, since 2015 while Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation last month. In a major blow to Teva, last month, Mylan also launched its generic version of the 40 mg thrice-weekly (3TW - three times a week) formulation - much earlier than expected. The 40 mg formulation of Copaxone accounted for more than 85% of total Copaxone scrips in the United States at the end of the reported quarter.Ex-U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 1% to $185 million.Among other products, Azilect sales declined 64% to $36 million as a generic version of the drug was launched in the United States this year. ProAir rose 31% to $155 million, combined Treanda and Bendeka revenues declined 21% to $181 million and QVAR declined 1% to $95 million.The Other segment (distribution and other activities) recorded revenues of $569 million, up 122.2% year over year. The segment mainly gained from the inclusion of distribution revenues from Anda.Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 800 basis points (bps) to 53% in the quarter due to the addition of the low-margin Anda distribution business and low margins in both the Generic Medicines and Specialty Medicines segments. Research & development expenses declined 6.2% from the year-ago period to $381 million. Selling and marketing (S&M) expenditure declined 9.4% from the year-ago level to $805 million. Adjusted operating margin declined 600 bps in the quarter to 26.2%, despite lower costs.2017 Outlook SlashedTeva lowered its 2017 sales and earnings outlook for the second time this year. Teva now expects revenues in the range of $22.2 - $22.3 billion compared with $22.8 - $23.2 billion expected previously. The company expects earnings in the band of $3.77–$3.88 per share in 2017, significantly lower than $4.30–$4.50 per share expected previouslyIncreased price erosion and volume declines in the U.S Generics market, lower than expected contribution from new generic launches in the United States and the accelerated erosion in Copaxone sales following the earlier-than-expected launch of the 40 mg generic resulted in the guidance cut.With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Teva estimates a negative impact of at least 30 cents per share on fourth-quarter earnings, higher than Teva’s previous assumption of 25 cents.Meanwhile many other filers, including Momenta are also looking to get approval for their generic versions of the 40-mg formulation, which if approved, will erode sales further.Teva now expects new product launches to contribute $400 million to revenues compared with $500 million expected previously.Our TakeAmid already lowered expectations, Teva’s disappointing third-quarter results and the slash in outlook led to a sharp decline in share price.Shares declined almost 20% on Thursday, hitting a 52-week low of $10.85. In fact, shares have slumped 69% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 31.4%.Teva’s branded drug pipeline is progressing decently and it has also divested some non-core assets, mainly in the Women’s Health business, including Paragard and Plan B One-Step contraceptives, to cut its significant debt load. However, it might not be enough to revive the company’s fortunes during this challenging period, particularly as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone.It will be interesting to see how its new chief executive officer, Kåre Schultz, guides the Israel-based generic drug maker to post a turnaround.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Also, the company will be entitled to sales-based milestone payments of up to $211 million from Sep 1, 2017 to Nov 30, 2019. However, under the new agreement, AGI will not pay any royalties to AstraZeneca, which was a condition in the older agreement.Notably, the new deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have gained 19.5%, comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 16%.AstraZeneca has been regularly divesting non-core assets or marketing rights to some treatments so that it can focus its resources on three main therapy areas including oncology and respiratory.In June 2017, the company sold the global rights of migraine treatment drug Zomig outside Japan to Grünenthal, a German pharmaceutical company.In March, it sold the U.S. commercialization rights to its inhaled respiratory medicines — Tudorza and Duaklir — for COPD to Circassia Pharmaceuticals.

2240,AGN,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) opened more than 15% higher on Monday after the struggling drugmaker picked H. Lundbeck (HLUYY  -  Free Report) chief Kare Schultz to fill its long-vacant CEO role.Schultz, who has been at the helm of H. Lundbeck since May 2015, is set to take over at Teva, a generics giant that has been without a permanent CEO for more than seven months. The new job promises to present several interesting challenges for Schultz, as changing industry trends and an increasingly competitive market environment have led to significant headwinds for Teva.In fact, Teva’s debt load has swelled to a whopping $35 billion following its acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics division, and the company is now under pressure to shed assets in an effort to pay down some of this debt.According to Bloomberg, Schultz will likely be encouraged to consider splitting the company—with one business focused specifically on specialty medicines and another maintaining its generics operations.Last month, reports emerged that Teva was considering the sale of Medis, an Iceland-based generic drug manufacturer. Other rumors suggested that the company is considering the sale of its respiratory treatment assets. Regardless, it’s clear that more deals will need to come.In the wake of Teva’s lackluster Q2 earnings, management slashed its full-year outlook, cut its dividend by 75%, and said that asset sales will likely generate at least $2 billion—well above the $1 billion level that was previously forecasted.However, Teva’s scramble to pay down its debt has not satisfied everyone. Recently, Moody’s said that Teva’s debt reduction has been slower than expected and lowered its credit rating. Of course, investors have also punished the company. Prior to today, Teva shares were down more than 57% year-to-date, and the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Nevertheless, Schultz seems up to the task. Speaking to Bloomberg Television earlier today, the new CEO said that he is “the kind of person who likes challenge and [is] inspired by challenges.” Schultz continued by saying that “it’s important to work very fast and create a clear strategy and bring the company on strategic course.”Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2242,AGN,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Allergan PLC (AGN  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 8.3% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Allergan Beats Q2 Earnings & Sales TopAllergan’s second-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $4.02 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.95 by 1.8%. Earnings rose 20% year over year driven by higher revenues, lower share count and interest expense, which offset lower gross margins and higher tax rates.Revenues came in at $4.01 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago period, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.95 billion by 1.4%.While key products like Botox and new products like Vraylar, Namzaric and Viberzi did well in the quarter, sales were once again hurt by sales erosion from Namenda XR and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin. Also, lower sales of Restasis and Aczone hurt the top line.Second-quarter revenues, however, gained from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (Jan 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (Apr 2017) acquisitions.Segment DiscussionAllergan reports revenues under three segments – U.S. General Medicine, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics and International.U.S. Specialized Therapeutics’ net revenues increased 15.2% to $1.72 billion driven by strong growth in Botox and the addition of LifeCell’s Alloderm and ZELTIQ’s CoolSculpting businesses. Botox (cosmetic) raked in sales of $210.3 million (up 10.7%). Botox Therapeutic revenues were $346.9 million, up 17.2%. In addition, Juvéderm Collection of fillers rose 7.3% and Ozurdex sales increased 15.8%, which contributed to the upside. Alloderm added $84.6 million while CoolSculpting added $78.9 million to sales in the second quarter.Importantly, Restasis sales declined 9.4% to $336.4 million in the quarter due to unfavorable trade buying patterns. The company expects stable Restasis revenues this year.U.S. General Medicine net revenue declined 1.5% to $1.43 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands, Women's Health, and the Gastrointestinal franchises. Anti-Infectives sales rose 7.4% to $67.8 million while Central Nervous System sales rose 9.2% to $346.6 million.Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Viberzi, Namzaric and Vraylar did well in the quarter. Linzess’ sales rose 11.5% in the quarter to $167.8 million, driven by strong demand and continued OTC conversion.  Lo Loestrin sales rose 11.9% to $113.0 million backed by strong prescription growth.However, lower Namenda XR sales hurt the performance of the CNS franchise. Namenda XR sales declined 28.7% to $118.7 million in the quarter due to lower demand, lower pricing and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric. The company does not expect a generic version of Namenda XR to be launched until first quarter of 2018, delayed from the prior expectation of fourth quarter of 2017. Also, Allergan does not expect any generic version of Estrace Cream to be launched this year.Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept, recorded sales of $33.4 million compared with $23.6 million in the previous quarter. Continued conversion from Namenda XR and higher demand following an expanded label with new dosages pulled up sales of Namzaric.Asacol/Delzicol sales declined 61.9% to $45.6 million due to a generic competition for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in Aug 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol.In the Women’s Health segment, Minastrin 24 revenues declined 86.3% to $11.4 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in Mar 2017.The International segment recorded net revenue of $858.8 million, up 16.2% (excluding currency impact) from the year-ago period, driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics, Botox Therapeutic and the addition of LifeCell and CoolSculpting.Profits DeclineAdjusted operating income increased 16% to $1.9 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted operating margins, however, declined 330 basis points in the quarter to 47.1% quarter due to higher operating expenses and the addition of lower margin LifeCell and ZELTIQ acquisitions.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 17.1% to $1.22 billion in the quarter, primarily due to higher foreign exchange transactional losses, costs related to acquisitions and promotional expenses for key products. R&D expenses increased 14.2% to $393.9 million to support an advancing pipeline.2017 OutlookThe company raised its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2017 following a strong first-half performance and solid outlook for the rest of the year.Allergan expects total revenue in the range of $15.85 billion to $16.05 billion compared with $15.8 billion to $16.0 billion previously. Currency headwinds are now not expected to hurt revenues versus a negative impact of approximately $100 million expected previously.The company said that revenues are expected to be the highest in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by seasonality and formulary coverage dynamics, while third quarter revenues are expected to be at similar levels to the second quarter.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $16.05–$16.45 compared with $15.85–$16.35 previously. Adjusted earnings guidance continues to reflect strong double-digit growth in the range of 17% to 22%.Adjusted gross margin is expected between 86.5% and 87% slightly more than 86% and 87% expected previously due to higher-than-expected gross margins in the first half. Second half gross margins are expected to be lower than the first half.R&D expenses are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion (maintained). SG&A spend is expected between $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion compared with $4.45 billion and $4.55 billion previously. Meanwhile, SG&A and R&D expenses are expected to be higher in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. Higher promotional activities given the timing of new launches and continued strong promotion for key brands is expected to lead to higher sales and marketing costs in the third quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to eight lower.Allergan PLC. Price and Consensus  Allergan PLC. Price and Consensus | Allergan PLC.

This makes Kymriah the first CAR-T cell treatment to be approved in the United States. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T cells to fight cancer. ALL, a cancer of the bone marrow and blood, progresses quickly and is the most common childhood cancer in the United States. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 3,100 patients (20 years and younger) are diagnosed with ALL every year. Kymriah not only provides these patients with a new treatment option, it has also shown promising remission and survival rates in studies.Novartis intends to seek label expansion for Kymriah later this year for additional indications including the treatment of adult patients with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Also read: Novartis CAR-T Therapy Kymriah Receives FDA Approval).

Including these charges, the company reported a loss of $12.05 per share compared with a loss of $1.15 per share in the year-ago quarter.Last month, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering dry eye drug Restasis, Allergan’s second best-selling drug, potentially opening doors for early generic competition. Restasis patents are scheduled to expire in August 2024. However, a generic may be launched much earlier. Along with the earnings release, the company said that it has filed a notice of appeal with the court.The impairment charge for Restasis was in relation to this adverse ruling while that for Aczone was in response to generic pressure in the branded acne category.Revenues came in at $4.03 billion, up 11.4% from the year-ago period, and in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Key products like Botox and Restasis and new products like Vraylar, Namzaric and Viberzi did well in the quarter. However, sales erosion from Namenda XR and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin hurt the top line.Third-quarter revenues also benefited from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (April) acquisitionsSegment DiscussionThe company reports revenues under three segments – U.S. General Medicine, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics and International.U.S. Specialized Therapeutics’ net revenues increased 18.7% to $1.72 billion driven by continued strong performance of Botox and higher sales of Juvéderm Collection of fillers and Restasis.Botox (cosmetic) raked in sales of $189.7 million (up 8.7%). Botox Therapeutic revenues were $352.1 million, up 15.3%. In addition, Juvéderm Collection of fillers rose 10.1% and Ozurdex sales increased 17.7%, which contributed to the upside. Restasis sales rose 2.9% to $366.8 million in the quarter. Aczone sales declined 32.3% in the quarter to 46.7%.LifeCell’s Alloderm added $84.6 million while ZELTIQ’s CoolSculpting business added $83.4 million to sales in the third quarter.U.S. General Medicine net revenues were flat at $1.5 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands and Women's Health franchises. Anti-Infectives sales rose 28% to $67.2 million, Gastrointestinal rose 2.8% to $443.5 million and Central Nervous System sales rose 9.1% to $355.2 million.Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Namzaric and Vraylar did well in the quarter. Linzess’ sales rose 16.1% in the quarter to $190.9 million, driven by strong demand and favorable trade buying patterns. Lo Loestrin sales rose 13.5% to $120 million backed by strong prescription growth and higher selling prices.However, lower Namenda XR sales hurt the performance of the CNS franchise. Namenda XR sales declined 22.5% to $114.3 million in the quarter due to lower demand, lower pricing and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric.Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept, recorded sales of $37.0 million compared with $33.4 million in the previous quarter. Continued conversion from Namenda XR and higher demand following an expanded label with new dosages pulled up sales of Namzaric.Asacol/Delzicol sales declined 31.4% to $49.5 million due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in August 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol.In the Women’s Health segment, Minastrin 24 revenues declined 95.8% to $3.6 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in March.The International segment recorded net revenue of $807.8 million, up 13.7% from the year-ago period, driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics, Eye Care and the addition of CoolSculpting.Costs RiseSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 9.2% to $1.10 billion in the quarter, primarily due to higher foreign exchange transactional losses and costs related to acquisitions. R&D expenses increased 4.9% to $405.3 million to support an advancing pipeline.2017 Outlook TightenedThe company narrowed its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2017.Allergan expects total revenue in the range of $15.875 billion to $16.025 billion compared with $15.85 billion to $16.05 billion previously.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $16.15–$16.45 compared with $16.05–$16.45 previously.Adjusted gross margin guidance was maintained in the range of approximately 86.5% and 87%.The company maintained its R&D and SG&A expenses guidance. R&D expenses are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion while SG&A spend is expected between $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion.Our TakeAllergan’s third-quarter results were mixed as the company beat expectations for earnings while delivering in-line revenues. While the company slightly lowered its sales guidance, it raised the lower end of the earnings guidance. This probably boosted investor confidence at a time when Allergan is facing multiple challenges. Shares were up 1.5% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Allergan’s share price is down 15.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 29.4%.Allergan is facing patent challenges for quite a few of its products including Generess Fe, Namenda XR and Asacol HD.Other than the adverse ruling related to Restasis, Allergan also recently came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe to protect Restasis from generic competition. Lawmakers questioned the unconventional move adopted by the company. The deal with the Tribe has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drug makers from making cheaper versions of expensive drugs.Meanwhile, new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (SGYP  -  Free Report) Trulance (plecanatide) has been launched this year for chronic idiopathic constipation, which could pose competition to Linzess.Nonetheless, Allergan’s products like Botox and Linzess and new products such as Viberzi and Vraylar support sales growth. It also boasts a strong branded pipeline while biosimilars also represent significant opportunity.Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Allergan PLC.

The average negative earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 0.36%.Currently, Allergan has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), but that could definitely change following the company’s earnings report which was just released.

2246,AGN,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) is expected report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1. Last quarter, the company reported a narrowed-than-expected loss.In fact, Aerie’s performance over the last four quarters has been decent. The company reported a narrower-than-expected loss in three of the trailing four quarters while posting wider-than-expected loss in the remaining one, with an average positive surprise of 0.64%. Aerie’s share price has increased 40.8% year to date as against the industry’s 5.6% decline. Earlier in the month, Aerie’s stock price surged on positive news for its lead drug, Rhopressa.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates Aerie to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen which is the case here.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.61%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 61 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 62 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aerie has a Zacks Rank #3, which is favorable. The combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP indicates a likely positive surprise. Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Factors at PlayWith no approved product in its portfolio, Aerie depends heavily on its late-stage candidates — Rhopressa and Roclatan. Hence, we expect investor focus on pipeline updates.Aerie’s lead candidate, Rhopressa, a once-daily formulation for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) is being evaluated in patients suffering from open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. On Oct 13, the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted in favor of Rhopressa’s approval. The members of the committee unanimously agreed that the trials support the efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.In addition, majority of the members agreed that the Rhopressa’s efficacy outweigh safety risks.The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Feb 28, 2018. We note that the FDA is not bound by the Advisory Committee’s guidance, but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing drugs.Apart from Rhopressa, Aerie is also evaluating Roclatan. Aerie initiated a phase III study — Mercury 3 in Europe for its other pipeline candidate Roclatan 0.02%/0.005%. Roclatan is a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan, is being evaluated to lower IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The company plans to submit its NDA for the same in the first half of 2018.The trial is a non-inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort (a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol), marketed by Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) in Europe.We expect investors to focus on further pipeline updates on the call. Cash burn for the year is projected at $110 million, up from $100 million due to further pipeline development.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2248,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 1, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.77%.Allergan’s share price has declined 14.1% this year so far, outperforming the 27.6% decline witnessed by the industry.Allergan’s earnings performance has been mixed so far, with the company beating expectations in three of the past four quarters and missing on one occasion. The average negative earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 0.36%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAt the Q2 call, Allergan had said that third-quarter revenues are expected to be at similar levels to the second quarter. Second-quarter revenues rose 8.8% year over year. Third quarter revenues are likely to be driven by new products like Vraylar, Namzaric and Viberzi, international growth and growth from key established products like Botox and Linzess.However, Namenda IR is facing generic competition, which will continue to hurt sales of the drug. Meanwhile, Namenda XR sales also declined in the previous quarters due to lower demand and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept. The company does not expect a generic version of Namenda XR to be launched until first quarter of 2018.Investors will be interested to find out how Namzaric performed in the quarter. Last quarter, Allergan saw improved sales of Namzaric due to continued conversion from Namenda XR and higher demand following an expanded label with new dosages. The positive trend is expected to continue.Meanwhile, the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (Jan 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (Apr 2017) acquisitions are likely to support the top line in the quarter.However, loss of exclusivity of Asacol HD and Minastrin may remain an overhang on the top line.Higher promotional expenses for key products, increased costs to support an advancing pipeline and the addition of lower margin LifeCell and ZELTIQ acquisitions can put pressure on Allergan’s margins. In fact, at the Q2 call, Allergan mentioned that SG&A and R&D expenses will be higher in the third quarter compared with the fourth quarter. Higher promotional activities, given the timing of new launches and continued strong promotion for key brands, are expected to lead to higher sales and marketing costs in the third quarter.Investors will also be keen to know management’s plans to protect Restasis, its second best-selling drug, from generic competition. Earlier this month, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis, potentially opening doors for early generic competition. Restasis patents are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024.Allergan also came under fire recently for its agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. Lawmakers questioned the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect Restasis from generic competition. The deal with the Tribe has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper versions of expensive drugs.Investors will also be interested to know the impact of new competition on Allergan’s key products – Restasis and Linzess. Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy’s Trulance (plecanatide) was launched in the second quarter for CIC, which could pose competition to Linzess.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at $4.03, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $4.06. This results in an Earnings ESP of -0.69%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allergan has a Zacks Rank #4. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the biotech/pharma sector that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (ACOR  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Oct 31, has an Earnings ESP of + 5.53% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2249,AGN,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off third quarter earnings season for the pharmaceutical sector on a strong note with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. While focus remained on J&J’s strong earnings results, companies like Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) were also in the news regarding patent litigation.   Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&J Q3 Results Impress, Raises Outlook: J&J’s Q3 earnings results were strong with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. All three segments (Consumer, Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals) did well with oncology recording robust growth. Results included contribution from pulmonary hypertension products which became a part of the company’s portfolio following its acquisition of Actelion. Based on solid third quarter results, J&J raised its outlook for the year as well (Read more: J&J Beats on Q3 Earnings, Actelion Buyout Drives Sales).The company has gained 23.3% year to date, compared to the 20.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Sanofi’s Dupixent Tops in Allergic Inflammatory Disease Study: Sanofi and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals announced positive phase II results on Dupixent (dupilumab) in adults with active moderate-to-severe eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic, allergic inflammatory disease. Patients receiving Dupixent weekly reported a significant improvement in the ability to swallow versus placebo (Read more: Sanofi/Regeneron's Dupixent Succeeds in Phase II Study). The market could be huge for Dupixent if it gains timely approval given the lack of any FDA-approved treatments. Dupixent has orphan drug status in the United States for this indication.Dupixent, which has blockbuster potential, is currently approved for eczema and is being evaluated for additional indications apart from eosinophilic esophagitis. In fact, last month, the companies had announced positive top-line data from a late-stage study on Dupixent for uncontrolled persistent asthma.  Regeneron and Sanofi are also collaborating with Aimmune Therapeutics, a clinical-stage company focused on the development of treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. Under the clinical collaboration, Aimmune’s AR101 will be evaluated with adjunctive Dupixent in peanut-allergic patients in a mid-stage study that is scheduled to commence next year. The study will be sponsored by Regeneron while Aimmune will provide clinical supply of AR101 and food challenge materials.Data on Merck’s Keytruda, Priority Review for Lynparza sNDA: Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) presented updated overall survival (“OS”) data on its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of patients suffering from metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with high levels of PD-L1. The company said that the additional six months of available data continued to show a reduction in the risk of death by 37% for Keytruda compared to chemotherapy. Keytruda more than doubled median OS compared to chemotherapy after two years of follow up.Keytruda is a key product in Merck’s portfolio with the drug bringing in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017.Merck and partner AstraZeneca also announced that they have been granted priority review by the FDA for their supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of PARP inhibitor Lynparza tablets in patients with gBRCA, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”) who have been previously treated with chemotherapy either in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic settings. A response from the agency is expected in the first quarter of 2018.Novo Nordisk Diabetes Drug Gets FDA Panel Support: Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) got a boost with an FDA advisory panel (the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee) voting unanimously (16-0) in favor of approving once-weekly semaglutide for use in type II diabetes patients. Given the favorable vote, chances of gaining FDA approval look pretty high. On its second quarter call, Novo Nordisk had said that it expects a decision from the FDA by year end. Semaglutide’s approval would be a major positive for the company with the drug expected to be a key growth driver.Novo Nordisk is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Priority Review for BMY Drug Label Expansion: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) immuno-oncology therapy, Opdivo, has been granted priority review by the FDA for label expansion into the treatment of melanoma patients who are at high risk of disease recurrence following complete surgical resection. Opdivo, one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’ portfolio, brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017 (Read more: Bristol-Myers Gets Priority Review for Opdivo Label Expansion).Adverse Ruling for Allergan in Restasis Patent Litigation: Allergan continues to make headlines related to its blockbuster eye drug, Restasis. This time round, the company announced that it has received an adverse ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas regarding four patents covering the drug. The court found the patents to be invalid. Allergan intends to appeal the ruling and said that the FDA is yet to approve any generic version of the drug. However, ophthalmology-focused company, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, announced that it is working on making lower-cost alternatives to Restasis available. The company said that initial prescriptions will be 99 cents for a one month supply while refills will start at $79 per month, including shipping.According to Allergan, the Restasis patents are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024. Allergan, which entered into a settlement agreement with a generic challenger recently (InnoPharma), has been adopting different ways to protect Restasis from generic competition. The company came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect the drug from generic competition. Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. The deal has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs.Impax to Combine with Amneal: Specialty pharma company Impax Laboratories  will be merging with privately-held generic company Amneal Pharmaceuticals in an all-stock transaction. With this merger, the combined company will have high-value generic product pipelines and a growing specialty business. The deal is expected to boost Impax’s stand-alone earnings per share in the first 12 months and generate double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth over the three years following the close of the transaction. Annual cost synergies of about $200 million are expected to be achieved within three years. The merger is expected to go through in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Impax Laboratories and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Agree to Merge).PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 1% this week with the sector reacting positively to J&J’s Q3 results.

2251,AGN,"Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report) announced the appointment of Keith W. Marshall as executive vice president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.Notably, Marshall has over fifteen years of experience in finance, operations and business advisory roles. Also, he was an agent on private placements for private biotechnology companies and an advisor to buyers and sellers in biotechnology as well as pharmaceutical company transactions.Therefore, the company is banking on Marshall’s contributions as it aims at completing its four ongoing phase IIb studies for its lead candidate, emricasan, besides expanding its pipeline.Meanwhile, Conatus is focusing on its efforts to develop emricasan. In January 2016, the company started ENCORE-NF study under the ENCORE program for potential improvements in fibrosis and steatohepatitis in patients with fibrosis caused by Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Top-line data is expected in the first half of 2019.In May 2017, Conatus also initiated another study, ENCORE-LF. It is a phase IIb trial, studying EMRI monotherapy on patients with decompensated NASH cirrhosis. Top-line data from the study is expected in 2019. Going forward, the company plans to initiate a new study — ENCORE-XT — a planned extension study in patients who completed the ENCORE-PH or ENCORE-LF studies with continued monitoring for efficacy, safety, clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life.In fact, the ENCORE studies are being conducted to provide clinically relevant efficacy, dosing, and safety data to support the initial registration of emricasan for chronic administration in patients with NASH cirrhosis and potentially support future label expansion.In December 2016, Conatus signed an exclusive option, collaboration and license agreement with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) for the worldwide development and commercialization of emricasan, which is a positive. This strategic agreement with Novartis not only lends expertise to Conatus but will also provide the company with much needed funds for the development of emricasan.Yet, Conatus has had its share of pipeline setbacks. In 2008, the FDA had placed a clinical hold on emricasan while it was being developed by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) due to a preclinical observation. However, the clinical hold was lifted in 2013.Currently, several studies on emricasan are ongoing with data readouts scheduled over next couple of years. Also, stiff competition remains a threat. In fact, several companies like Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report), Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics and Enanta Pharmaceuticals are working on developing treatments for NASH.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2252,AGN,"Shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) have moved up 15.8% in the last one week on positive news for its lead drug, Rhopressa.In fact, Aerie’s stock has surged 71.4% year to date, compared with the industry’s gain of 3.4%.On Oct 13, the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted in favor of Rhopressa’s approval. The members of the committee unanimously agreed that the trials support the efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.In addition, majority of the members agreed that the Rhopressa’s efficacy outweigh safety risks.The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Feb 28, 2018. We note that the FDA is not bound by the Advisory Committee’s guidance, but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing drugs.Rhopressa is designed to lower intraocular pressure  (IOP) in patients through novel mechanisms of action ( MOAs). The company believes that Rhopressa represents the first new MOAs for lowering IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years.A potential approval of the drug will significantly boost Aerie’s growth prospects.  However, Rhopressa is expected to face tough competion from established branded and generic drugs like such as Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Simbrinza and Travtan, and Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Lumigan, as well as other smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.Meanwhile, Aerie initiated a phase III study — Mercury 3 in Europe for its other pipeline candidate Roclatan 0.02%/0.005%. Roclatan is a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan, is being evaluated to lower IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

2253,AGN,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IRWD  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 28 cents per share, wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents and the year-ago loss of 16 cents.Total revenue (collaborative revenue) in the quarter amounted to $65.1 million, up 19.7% from the year-ago period but below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $68.5 million.Ironwood’s shares gained 2.16% in afterhours trading on Aug 3 on positive pipeline updates. In fact, a look at the company’s share price movement shows that the stock has outperformed the industry this year so far. Ironwood’s shares have gained 8.8% during this period, while the industry registered an increase of 0.9%.The Quarter in DetailAs reported by partner Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report), Ironwood’s key marketed product – Linzess – generated U.S. net sales of $167.8 million, up 11.5% year over year.Please note that Ironwood and Allergan have an equal share in brand collaboration profits or losses. Ironwood's share of the net profits from the sales of Linzess in the U.S. (included in collaborative revenues) was $43.8 million in the second quarter, up 11% year over year.According to data provided by IMS Health, Linzess prescriptions filled during the quarter crossed 750,000, up 15% from the year-ago period.During the reported quarter, selling and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 56.5% to $57.8 million, and research and development (R&D) expenses were $37.3 million, up 17.9% from the year-ago periodZurampic, Ironwood’s second commercial product for the treatment of uncontrolled gout, was launched in Oct 2016.Zurampic raked in sales of $0.5 million in the quarter. Zurampic prescriptions filled during the quarter were 1500, higher than 900 prescriptions filled in the previous quarter.Pipeline UpdatesLinzess is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C; 290 mcg) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC; 145 mcg & 72 mcg). Ironwood and Allergan are looking to broaden Linzess’ label by expanding the targeted patient population and gaining approval for additional indications. The partners are also developing a delayed release version of Linzess for IBS-C and non-constipated subtypes of IBS.Ironwood has a partnership with Astellas Pharma to market Linzess in Japan. Astellas is looking to submit regulatory application for label expansion in chronic constipation with the Japanese regulatory authorityIn China, Hong Kong and Macau, Ironwood has an agreement with AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) for Linzess. The regulatory filing is under review in China for IBS-C. The company expects the review to be completed in the first quarter of 2018.This year, Ironwood expects to launch Duzallo, the fixed-dose combination of Zurampic and allopurinol. The new drug application for Duzallo is under review in the U.S. The FDA’s decision is expected in the second half of 2017 and the drug is expected to be launched in late 2017. If approved, Duzallo would become the first dual-mechanism treatment for patients with uncontrolled gout.2017 Guidance MaintainedThe company continues to expect to use less than $100 million for operations in 2017. This is however much higher than the 2016 levels. This is due to the full year of commercial expenses related to the launch of Zurampic and to support the potential launch of Duzallo and pipeline advancement.The company also maintained its R&D expenses and SG&A expenses guidance for 2017 in the range of $145–$160 million and $235–$250 million, respectively.Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2254,AGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 99 cents per share (including equity compensation expenses), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 per share by 6.6%. The year-ago adjusted earnings were $1.22 per share.Revenues of $5.69 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.85 billion by 2.8%. Sales, however, increased 13% year over year (up 17% excluding impact of currency), mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics segment, Actavis Generics, including AndaTeva acquired Actavis Generics in Aug 2016 and also Allegan’s U.S. generic distribution business Anda, Inc. in Oct 2016.Excluding the benefit from the Actavis generics acquisition, the core sales performance was below expectations. Sales in the quarter were hurt by increased pricing erosion in the U.S. Generics unit, ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela and loss of exclusivity in the Specialty segment in the quarter.Segment DiscussionBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, Teva revised its segment structure following the Actavis acquisition. The Generics segment now includes revenues from the OTC business as well as the API business.Generic Medicines segment revenues rose 20% to $3.08 billion, mainly attributable to the inclusion of revenues from the Actavis generics business.Revenues from the U.S. generics business rose 45% to $1.3 billion due to the inclusion of revenues from the generic business of Actavis.European generic revenues were $957 million, up 24% (28% in local currency) from the year-ago period. This was due to the inclusion of revenues from the generic business of Actavis.Rest of the world (ROW) generic revenues declined 7% to $831 million in the quarter. On a local currency basis, sales rose 13% mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from Actavis.API revenues declined 1% to $204 million. OTC revenues rose 6% to $283 million (up 40% in local currency terms).Excluding the benefit from the Actavis generics acquisition, the core sales performance of the segment was poor due to accelerated U.S. generic drug price erosion and decreased volumes. Meanwhile, delays in the launch of some new generic drugs and increased competition for some others also hurt sales in the segment.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure. An increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation is resulting in additional competitive pressure in the generics industry.The drug price erosion is expected to accelerate in the second half of this year. Teva said that the price erosion in the U.S. generics business is expected to be in the high single digits range in 2017.Specialty Medicines revenues declined 9% from the year-ago period to $2.1 billion due to lower sales of its central nervous system (CNS) and oncology products. Among Teva’s various therapeutic areas, CNS sales declined 18% to $1.16 billion due to lower sales of multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, Teva’s lead branded product.Sales of respiratory products rose 3% to $322 million, oncology product sales declined 16% to $280 million, and women’s health business recorded a 2% decline in revenues to $115 million. Other specialty revenues rose 107% to $190 million.Worldwide revenues of Copaxone declined 10% to $1 billion. Sales in the U.S. declined 12% to $843 million due to lower volumes of the 20 mg formulation, which is facing generic competition and negative net pricing effects despite the 7.9% price increase taken in January. In Jun 2015, Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz launched Glatopa, a once-daily generic version of 20 mg formulation of Copaxone.Ex-U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 3% to $180 million.The 40 mg thrice-weekly (3TW - three times a week) formulation of Copaxone accounted for more than 85% of total Copaxone scrips in the U.S. at the end of the reported quarter. We note that Teva is facing patent challenges for the 40 mg formulation.Companies like Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals are looking to get approval for their generic versions of the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone. In late January, Teva suffered a major setback with the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware invalidating four of the five Orange Book patents protecting Copaxone 40 mg. Teva intends to appeal against the decision. However, generic versions of the 40 mg formulation have not been launched yet. The FDA approval of Momenta’s generic version of Copaxone has been delayed owing to manufacturing issues.Teva does not expect any generic competition for Copaxone 40 mg this year. However, the company said that in case, a generic version was launched for a full quarter this year, it will hurt earnings by 20 – 25 cents.Among other products, Azilect sales declined 69% to $34 million as a generic version of the drug was launched in the U.S. ProAir declined 9% to $123 million, combined Treanda and Bendeka revenues declined 21% to $163 million and QVAR declined 8% to $107 million.The Other segment (distribution and other activities) recorded revenues of $543 million, up 158.6%. The segment mainly gained from the inclusion of distribution revenues from Anda.Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 570 basis points (bps) to 56.8% in the quarter due to the addition of the low-margin Anda distribution business and low margins in the Generic Medicines segment. Gross margin rose in the Specialty segment. Research & development expenses increased 21.6% from the year-ago period to $450 million. Selling and marketing (S&M) expenditure was up 1% from the year-ago level to $906 million. Adjusted operating margin (excluding equity compensation expense) declined 330 bps in the quarter to 28.1%.2017 Outlook SlashedTeva slashed its previously issued 2017 sales and earnings guidance. Increased price erosion in the U.S Generics market, delays in generic launches in the U.S.and greater instability in the Venezuela market led to the cut in guidance.The revenue guidance was cut to a range of $22.8-$23.2 billion from $23.8–$24.5 billion. Earnings are expected in the band of $4.30 - $4.50, much lower than $4.90–$5.30 per share expected previously.Teva expects continued sales erosion for Copaxone in 2017 due to increased competition.Management said that the Venezuelan business is not expected to contribute anything to earnings in the last two quarters of 2017.Dividend CutTeva announced a 75% cut in dividend for the second quarter to 8.5 cents per share from 34 cents per share paid in the first quarter.Our TakeTeva’s second-quarter earnings and sales were dismal as the U.S. generics industry continues to face significant competitive and pricing pressure. The Israel-based generic drug maker also slashed its 2017 earnings and sales outlook to reflect the challenging environment in the U.S. Generics business and Venezuela devaluation. The U.S. generic industry pressure is expected to persist and management expects lower revenue and profits in U.S. Generics in 2018 and potentially 2019.The major cut in dividend - to help pay down debt and invest in business - was a big disappointment. Also, the company did not provide any update on a new chief executive officer (CEO) saying “this is a process we are not going to rush”.  Teva’s CEO, Erez Vigodman, had stepped down in February this year. Teva’s Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh, also retired in June.Shares declined 24% on Thursday, hitting a 52-week low of $23.33 per share. In fact, shares have slumped 34.5% so far this year compared with the industry’sdecline of 1.9%.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2255,AGN,"This week, companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) and Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results. While Pfizer reported a mixed quarter, Allergan topped expectations. Teva, however, had a tough quarter. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) announced immune-oncology (IO) focused deals including an acquisition.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Big companies like Pfizer, Allergan and Teva reported second quarter results this week. Pfizer surpassed earnings estimates but missed on revenues raising concerns about the company’s top-line growth prospects. While Prevnar and Enbrel sales declined during the quarter, Pfizer is facing two key loss of exclusivities (LOEs) in the U.S. -- Viagra later this year and Lyrica at the end of 2018 (Read more: Pfizer Surpasses Q2 Earnings Estimates, Misses Sales).Meanwhile, Allergan topped both earnings and sales estimates and raised its outlook as well (Read more: Allergan Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, Restasis Sales Down).Teva’s shares fell 24% on a dismal quarter with the company missing on earnings and sales reflecting the performance of the U.S. generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela. The generics business was hit by accelerated price erosion and lower volume mainly due to customer consolidation, higher competition, and delayed new product launches. Teva lowered its outlook for the year and slashed its dividend as well. The company also expects to exit 45 markets across the globe by year end and will be cutting its headcount by about 7,000 since the closing of the Actavis Generics business deal. Teva has lost 34.5% of its value year to date versus the 7.6% decline of its industry.J&J, AbbVie Drug Gets FDA Nod for cGVHD: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and AbbVie’s BTK inhibitor Imbruvica gained FDA approval for its first non-cancer indication -- chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) in adults after failure of one or more systemic lines of therapy. This makes Imbruvica the first and only approved treatment for this patient population. This marks the sixth indication for Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J stock has gained 15.8% year to date, outperforming the 10.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Bristol-Myers in Acquisition Deal Worth Up to $2.3B: Bristol-Myers announced that it will be acquiring IFM Therapeutics, a venture-backed biotech company working on treatments that modulate novel targets in the innate immune system to treat cancer, autoimmunity and inflammatory disorders.With this acquisition, Bristol-Myers will gain full rights to IFM’s preclinical STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and NLRP3 agonist programs that are focused on cancer. The STING agonist program includes a lead asset while the NLRP3 agonist program includes a potential first-in-class pipeline candidate.This acquisition, scheduled to close in the third quarter, will strengthen Bristol-Myers’ immune-oncology (IO) pipeline. The deal will see Bristol-Myers shelling out $300 million upfront while additional payments of up to $1.01 billion will be made for each of the first products from the two programs on the achievement of certain milestones.Additional milestone payments could be made for further products resulting from these programs.Bristol-Myers signed another IO focused deal this week -- the company signed a clinical collaboration agreement with Clovis Oncology under which its immunotherapy Opdivo will be evaluated in combination with Clovis’ PARP inhibitor Rubraca in mid- and late-stage studies for different types of tumors.Meanwhile, Opdivo’s label was expanded in the U.S. this week for the treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Accelerated approval was granted on the basis of overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response.However, we note that Merck’s Keytruda gained approval earlier this year for patients with MSI-H or dMMR in a wider patient population -- Merck’s label includes patients with solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options as well as colorectal cancer patients whose disease has progressed following treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs.J&J RA Drug Fails to Get FDA Advisory Panel Support: J&J’s investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor, failed to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns. The company is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Considering the safety concerns raised by the panel, the agency could well ask for additional information before granting approval.Pfizer Drug Gets Advisory Panel Support: Pfizer’s supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) for its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz (5 mg twice daily) and Xeljanz XR (11 mg once daily), for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), got the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee. The advisory panel voted 10 to 1 in favor of approving the proposed dose of Xeljanz for the PsA indication. A decision from the FDA should be out by Dec 2017. Xeljanz, currently approved for RA, brought in sales of $587 million in the first half of 2017.Priority Review for AstraZeneca BTK Inhibitor: AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) investigational BTK inhibitor, acalabrutinib, was granted priority review by the FDA. The company is looking to get the drug approved for use in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. A response from the agency is expected in the first quarter of 2018. Acalabrutinib was also given Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for this indication.AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi also got BTD this week for the treatment of patients with locally-advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.Positive Data on Lilly Migraine Drug: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) presented late-stage data on its investigational migraine drug, lasmiditan, saying that it met the primary endpoint as well as key secondary endpoints. The results were consistent with results presented from an earlier late-stage study. Lilly expects to file for FDA approval in the second half of 2018.Lilly is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

2256,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis, Allergan’s second bestselling drug. This potentially opens the doors for early generic competition. Shares of the company fell almost 3.5% in response on Monday.The company is disappointed with the court’s ruling and is planning to appeal against it. However, if this ruling is upheld even after the appeal, it will negatively impact Restasis sales. The invalidated patents —‘111, ‘048, ‘930 and ‘191 — which are listed in the Orange Book were set to expire in Aug 27, 2024.Restasis is approved for the treatment of chronic dry eye.Allegan’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. While the company’s stock fell 5.6%, the industry was down 23.5% in that period.In 2015, Allergan had filed patent infringement lawsuits against a group of generic drug manufacturers which include Teva Pharma (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) among others. The companies are seeking approval for generic versions of Restasis in the United States. Meanwhile, last week, Allergan settled with InnoPharma, granting the latter the right to market generic Restasis beginning Feb 24, 2024.Moreover, in a bid to dismiss inter partes review for Restasis, Allergan signed an agreement last month with Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, to gain sovereign immunity. However, court litigation is out of the purview of sovereign immunity. This unconventional move by the company has been questioned by many lawmakers and was criticized by generic manufacturers. Such deals to gain sovereign immunity will make the launch of generics a lengthy and complex legal process, curbing competition.Restasis generated $676.4 million in sales worldwide in the first the six months of 2017. The FDA’s approval to Shire PLC’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) Xiidra last year has already increased competition for the drug. Any earlier-than-expected generic entry following the invalidation of these patents will further increase competition.Allergan PLC. Price and Consensus  Allergan PLC.

2257,AGN,"Companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) were in the news this week – while Pfizer is mulling strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business, Merck said that it will not file its CETP inhibitor.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPfizer to Divest Consumer Healthcare Segment? Pfizer is currently reviewing different strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business which includes a full or partial separation via a spin off or sale. The company could also ultimately decide to retain the business. This is not the first time that Pfizer has decided to spin off or sell a non-core business segment. Some of the strategic steps taken by Pfizer include the sale of the Hospira infusion systems business to ICU Medical (February 2017), the spin-off of the animal health business that led to the creation of Zoetis (2013) as well as the divestment of the nutrition business to Nestle in 2012. Before that, Pfizer had sold off its Capsugel business to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.The divestment of the Consumer Healthcare business would help Pfizer focus on its Innovative Health segment and would also bring in funds that the company could use for returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends (Read more: Pfizer Considering Sale/Spin-Off of Consumer Healthcare Unit).Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company has gained 11.9% year to date, compared to the 18.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Merck Collaborates with KalVista: Clinical-stage pharma company, KalVista Pharmaceuticals saw its shares shoot up 38.6% on a collaboration agreement with Merck for KVD001 and future oral diabetic macular edema (“DME”) compounds based on plasma kallikrein inhibition.KVD001, an investigational intravitreal (IVT) injection, is scheduled to move into a phase II proof-of-concept study later this year. Merck has the option to acquire rights to the candidate following the completion of the study. Merck has a similar option for certain other DME candidates.KalVista will receive a non-refundable upfront payment of $37 million as well as payments associated with the exercise of the options by Merck and the achievement of milestones for each program that could add up to $715 million. The company also stands to receive tiered royalties on net sales for candidates commercialized under the deal. Merck also acquired a 9.9% ownership stake in KalVista worth $9.1 million. Another Pipeline Setback for Lilly: Lilly suffered a setback with its recently approved breast cancer drug, Verzenio, failing to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage study in KRAS-mutated, advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  While the CDK4 and 6 inhibitor failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”), an analysis of the secondary endpoints of progression-free survival (“PFS”) and overall response rate (“ORR”) showed evidence of monotherapy activity (Read more: Lilly's Verzenio Fails in Phase III Lung Cancer Study).Meanwhile, Verzenio has been granted priority review by the FDA for use in the initial treatment of advanced breast cancer. This means a response from the agency should be out within eight months of receiving the regulatory application instead of the usual timeframe of 12 months.J&J Seeks FDA Nod for New Prostate Cancer Treatment: Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Biotech is seeking FDA approval for apalutamide, an investigational, next generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor for men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”). There is significant unmet need for this patient population given the absence of FDA approved treatments for these patients.Prostate cancer, the most common cancer among American men, is expected to be diagnosed in more than 161,000 men in 2017, as per the American Cancer Society.Apalutamide became a part of J&J’s pipeline following its 2013 acquisition of privately-held Aragon Pharmaceuticals. Apalutamide’s approval would strengthen and expand J&J’s presence in the prostate cancer market – the company currently sells Zytiga, which is approved for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”). J&J is looking to expand Zytiga’s label into earlier stages of metastatic prostate cancer.Allergan Settles Restasis Litigation with InnoPharma: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) entered into a settlement agreement with InnoPharma related to litigation regarding Restasis patents. The challenged patents are listed in the Orange Book and are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024.Under the settlement agreement, InnoPharma can start selling a generic version of the eye drug in the United States from Feb 24, 2024 or earlier under certain circumstances. Moreover, under certain circumstances, InnoPharma will be allowed to launch an authorized generic version of Restasis on Aug 28, 2024.Allergan is adopting different ways of protecting Restasis from generic competition. The company recently came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect the blockbuster eye drug from generic competition. Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. In fact, the Tribe is filing to dismiss the ongoing inter partes review (“IPR”) of the Restasis patents based on their sovereign immunity from IPR challenges.The deal with the Tribe has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs. Allergan has been asked by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to provide certain documents and information about the deal by Oct 17, 2017.Merck Will Not File Anacetrapib: Merck has decided that it will not seek regulatory approval for its investigational CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib. The company’s decision was based on a thorough review of the clinical profile of the drug. We note that Merck is not the first company to drop a CETP inhibitor from its plans. Companies like Lilly, Roche and Pfizer have all had high profile setbacks with their CETP inhibitors and the class was more or less written off (Read more: Merck Will Not Seek Approval for CETP Inhibitor Anacetrapib).CRL for AcelRx’s Dsuvia: AcelRx Pharmaceuticals’s (ACRX  -  Free Report) shares plunged 59.8% with the company getting a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for Dsuvia (sufentanil sublingual tablet). The FDA said that it cannot approve the regulatory application in its current form and has asked for additional safety data. The agency has also asked the company to make certain changes to the Directions for Use to ensure the proper administration of the tablet. AcelRx has been asked to validate the same through a human factors study. AcelRx is looking to get Dsuvia approved for the reduction of moderate-to-severe acute pain and dosing errors associated with IV administration via its non-invasive single-dose applicator (“SDA”) in medically supervised settings.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 0.5% this week.

2258,AGN,"Big-time investors of late have been investing a substantial portion of their R&D sources for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). The market for NASH is poised to witness rapid growth unlike other lucrative but saturated markets like cancer.A chronic liver disease, NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver which in turn is known as steatosis. NASH is known to affect up to 15 million people in the United Stated and could lead inflammation, hepatocellular injury, progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. It is expected to be the leading cause for liver transplantation by 2020. Notably, it is currently the leading cause of liver transplants for people under 50 in the United States.NASH patients are also known to be affected by obesity and type II diabetes. The disease is prevalent in European countries along with developing countries. The market for this disease is projected around $20-$35 billion. With no treatments currently approved for this disease, the market opportunity is significant.Let us take a look at the companies whose candidates are being evaluated at present for the treatment of NASH.Intercept Pharmaceuticials, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) is presently evaluating lead drug Ocaliva. The drug is already approved in the United States for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with an inadequate response to or intolerant to the standard of care, UDCA. The company currently has an ongoing phase III trial, REGENERATE, in non-cirrhotic NASH patients with liver fibrosis and top-line data from interim analysis is expected in the first half of 2019.The company also completed a phase II trial, CONTROL, to evaluate the lipid metabolic effects of Ocaliva and cholesterol management effects of concomitant statin administration in NASH patients. The company also plans to initiate a phase III trial in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017. Given the success of the phase II trial, we expect Intercept to be one of the first companies to obtain an approval for NASH.Biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) also has quite a few programs for patients diagnosed with NASH along with advanced fibrosis. These include selonsertib (ASK-1 inhibitor; phase III), GS-9674 (FXR agonist; phase II) and GS-0976 (ACC inhibitor; phase II). The company plans to initiate combination studies with three agents in 2017.Given the increasing competition in once lucrative hepatitis C market, Gilead is looking to diversify its portfolio and foray into emerging fields of CAR T therapy and NASH. The company earlier acquired Phenex’s farnesoid X receptor program comprising small molecule FXR agonists for the treatment of liver diseases including NASH.Another major player in the biotech space, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) has a mid-stage candidate in the NASH space. BMS-986036, an investigational pegylated analogue of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a key regulator of metabolism, in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3) achieved its primary endpoint of significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo in April. The company was entitled the rights to research, develop and commercialize BMS-986036 from Ambrx, Inc.Swiss major Novartis Inc. (NVS  -  Free Report) entered into a clinical trial agreement with Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) to conduct a phase IIb study in April, involving the combination of a Novartis FXR agonist and Allergan's cenicriviroc for the treatment of NASH. The company has a collaboration and license agreement with Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report) for the global development and commercialization of emricasan for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by NASH.Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnBottom Line Given the potential in the market, there are many other big pharma and biotech companies having pipeline candidates for the treatment of NASH. We expect a lot of activity in the space going forward. A potential approval of any drug for NASH will attract more players.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2259,AGN,"Ardelyx, Inc. (ARDX  -  Free Report) announced meeting the primary endpoint in a second phase III study — T3MPO-2 — evaluating tenapanor in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Based on the positive top-line data from this study as well as previously completed T3MPO-1 study, the company is planning to file a new drug application (“NDA”) in the second half of 2018.Ardelyx’s stock surged more than 36% in after-market trading on Wednesday, following the announcement. However, shares of the company are down 62% so far this year, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 0.7% in the period.Data from the T3MPO-2 study showed that the candidate achieved the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoint with statistical significance. The candidate reduced abdominal pain by 30% in greater number of patients compared to placebo (36.5% vs. 23.7%) and increased one or more complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) in the same week for at least six weeks in the 12-week treatment period. The improvements were consistent over the 26 weeks of study.In May, the company had announced positive data from the first phase III study (T3MPO-1) on tenapanor for the same indication. Meanwhile, another phase III study, T3MPO-3, is evaluating the candidate in this indication where patients are treated for up to one year. The study is expected to be complete by 2017. Data from this study will also be included in the NDA.Ardelyx is currently focusing on finding a collaboration partner to expand its reach through successful commercialization.The candidate is also being evaluated in a phase III study in hyperphosphatemia in patients who are suffering from end-stage renal disease and are on dialysis.IBS-C is a gastrointestinal disorder in which patients suffer from significant abdominal pain and constipation. Ardelyx estimates 11 million patients with IBS-C in the United States.However, there are other companies marketing or developing drugs for the treatment of IBS-C in the United States. Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IRWD  -  Free Report) along with its partner Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) markets Linzess for IBS-C.

2261,AGN,"United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) has recently approved the authorization of a new $200 million share buyback plan in a bid to boost shareholder value. However, the number and value of shares along with time to repurchase them will be decided by the company, alongside depending on various factors.As of Sep 14, 2017, United Natural had roughly 50.6 million outstanding shares, which are to be bought back according to the applicable securities laws.Notably, the company will repurchase shares with cash from operations and borrowings from its credit facility in addition to the available cash funds.Apart from United Natural, Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) and Autobytel Inc.  have recently sanctioned stock repurchase program to reward shareholders. While Allergan authorized a fresh $2-billion share repurchase program, Autobytel approved to repurchase additional $3 million of its common stock.United Natural’s PerformanceWe note that United Natural has been gaining from increased consumer preference for natural and organic brands, in spite of the ongoing industry challenges. Such headwinds include stiff competition, aggressive promotional spending and tight margins.Recently, United Natural reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues lagged. In fact, the company’s top line has missed estimates for 11 consecutive quarters now.Nevertheless, management expects net sales for fiscal 2018 in the range of $9.6-$9.8 billion, signifying an increase of 3.8-5.8% over the net sales of fiscal 2017. Also, earnings are envisioned in the band of $2.67 to $2.77 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate, which has moved up by 6 cents in the last 30 days, is currently pegged at $2.70 for fiscal 2018.Moreover, acquisitions have been one of the primary growth drivers for United Natural in the past few years. Such acquisitions have aided the company to expand distribution network, footprint and customer base in key markets, along with the launch of new brands. Also, management remains focused on reducing operating expenses and enhancing operating efficiency.Consequently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have rallied 13.4% in the past month, as against the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry’s decline of 2.3%. Currently, the industry is placed at the bottom 32% (175 out of 256) of the Zacks classified industries.We believe that the latest share buyback program would significantly boost the stock and shareholder return, reflecting the company’s healthy balance sheet and free cash flow.A better-ranked stock in the same industry includes McCormick and Company, Inc.

2262,AGN,"This week, companies like Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report), Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) were in the limelight. While Mylan and Teva were in the news related to the FDA approval of Mylan’s generic versions of Teva’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone, Allergan is under fire for its agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe for Restasis.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAllergan’s Restasis Deal under Fire: Allergan’s deal with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, announced early in September, has come under fire with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect its blockbuster eye drug, Restasis, from generic competition. Under the terms of the deal, Allergan transferred six patents related to Restasis to the Tribe while being granted exclusive licenses to the patents. In return, Allergan will pay $13.75 million upon execution of the agreement as well as annual royalties of $15 million.Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. While one of the original patents on the drug's active ingredient was set to expire in 2014, Allergan filed additional patents extending protection to 2024.Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. In fact, the Tribe is filing to dismiss the ongoing inter partes review (“IPR”) of the Restasis patents based on their sovereign immunity from IPR challenges.The deal has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs.Allergan has been asked by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to provide certain documents and information about the deal by Oct 17, 2017.Mylan’s Gain, Teva’s Loss: In a major development, Mylan gained FDA approval for its generic version of Teva’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone, for multiple sclerosis. Mylan gained approval for the 40 mg (thrice weekly) dosage as well as the once-daily 20 mg formulation. With Mylan being among the first applicants to challenge the 40 mg patent, the company could, therefore, enjoy 180 days of exclusivity though a formal communication from the FDA regarding the same is yet to come. Mylan has launched both products. According to QuintilesIMS, brand sales for the 20 mg and 40 mg doses were approximately $700 million and $3.64 billion, respectively, for the 12 months ending Jul 31, 2017. Mylan also gained approval for the 40 mg dose in the EU.While the FDA approval of generic Copaxone is a big boost for Mylan, it is a major blow for Teva which is currently facing a whole lot of challenges. Teva issued a statement saying that the launch of the 40 mg formulation before the final resolution of pending patent infringement lawsuits with Mylan will be treated as an “at-risk” launch which means Mylan would have to pay significant damages if the court upholds the patents protecting the drug.The entry of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation (Sandoz and Momenta have been on the market for quite a while with Glatopa, a generic version of the 20 mg dose) is expected to cut Teva’s 4Q earnings by at least 25 cents per share. Additional details should be out when the company announces third quarter results on November 2. The entry of generic Copaxone just adds to the existing list of problems being faced by Teva (Read more: Teva Shares Plummet After Mylan's Copaxone Generic Gets FDA Approval).Novo Nordisk Gets FDA Approval for Fiasp: Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report), which has a strong presence in the diabetes market, provided some regulatory updates on its diabetes franchise. The company gained FDA approval for Fiasp, a fast-acting mealtime insulin, for the treatment of adults with diabetes. The approval process was not exactly smooth with the company receiving a complete response letter last year when the agency had asked for additional information related to the assay for the immunogenicity and clinical pharmacology data (Read more: Novo Nordisk's Fiasp Gets FDA Nod for Diabetes in Adults).Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency’s (“EMA”) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) endorsed the company’s plan to update the EU label of Tresiba to include results from the DEVOTE study showing a significant reduction in the risk of severe hypoglycemia.Novo Nordisk is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sanofi/Regeneron Score a Win in PCSK9 Inhibitor Litigation: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron got a major boost with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ordering a new trial related to Amgen’s claims regarding patents for PCSK9 inhibitors. The court also vacated the permanent injunction in the lawsuit which means Sanofi and Regeneron can continue selling their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, in the United States.Favorable Court Ruling for Lilly: Another company that got a positive ruling on the patent front is Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report). The company said that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) ruled in its favor regarding the vitamin regimen patent for cancer therapy, Alimta (pemetrexed for injection). If the patent is upheld, Alimta will be safe from generic competition until May 2022. This decision has removed an overhang on the shares. Alimta brought in sales of more than a billion dollars in the first half of 2017.This week, Lilly also gained FDA approval for a new cancer treatment, Verzenio, for use in women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer.Lilly has gained 19.2% year to date, compared to the 17.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 1.9% so far this week.

2263,AGN,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) opened more than 13% lower on Wednesday, plunging close to their 52-week low in the process. The struggling Israeli pharma firm, which has faced significant pressure to reduce its debt load, is sliding once again—this time because of a brand new competitor.Indeed, the big news rocking the pharmaceutical world today is that Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report)—another major drugmaker wrapped up in its own chaos over the past year or so—has received FDA approval to sell a generic version of Teva’s multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.Mylan said that it wants to quickly introduce a slew of new generics to the market in an effort to curb rising drug costs. Today’s approval will certainly help the company’s top line, but it will also be the first step in this new plan—which should contribute to Mylan’s ongoing efforts to regain public trust after being embroiled in its EpiPen price hike scandal.Shares of Mylan opened about 15% higher and touched a nearly two-month high of $38.14. Teva, on the other hand, plummeted to $16.33 per share and is now down more than 54% on the year.Mylan had missed out on approval of a Copaxone generic twice this year, and company management was recently forced to lower its earnings forecast due to a delay in launching key drugs. In a note this morning, Wells Fargo analysts said the new generic should add 13 cents per share to Mylan’s quarterly earnings, so long as the FDA grants the company a 180-day exclusivity period.For Teva, this new competition could have serious consequences, as Copaxone generated more than $1 billion in sales in the second quarter alone.“The ongoing challenges to its generics business and that with FDA approval of Mylan's generic of Copaxone, earnings/cash flow are likely to affected,” Jefferies analyst David Steinberg wrote in a note. “[Although Copaxone] has been a strong contributor to cash flow over the last two decades, growing generic competition to this franchise has been an overhang on TEVA shares in recent years.”Fresh generic competition from Mylan only adds to Teva’s growing list of problems. Over the past few months, the Israeli firm has been desperately scrambling to ramp up assets in an effort to preserve its credit rating and cut its mounting debt.After completing its deal to buy Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics division last year, Teva’s debt pile swelled to a whopping $35 billion. In August, on the same day that the company reported lackluster Q2 earnings, slashed its full-year outlook, and cut its dividend by 75%, Teva CEO Yitzhak Peterburg said that asset sales will likely generate at least $2 billion, well above that $1 billion level that was previously forecasted.For now, Teva remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, the company will need to improve performance in its own generics unit and pare down its debt quickly if it wants to lift share prices anytime soon.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2264,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its Botox Cosmetic product for a third indication — temporary improvement of moderate to severe forehead lines in appearance, associated with frontalis muscle activity in adults.So far this year, Allergan’s share price has slipped 0.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 19.8%.Approved for therapeutic and aesthetic use, Botox is a key top-line driver for Allergan. Its cosmetic indications include improvement in appearance of glabellar lines (frown lines between the brows) and severe crow’s feet. This latest FDA approval makes Botox Cosmetic the only neurotoxin treatment approved for three facial aesthetic treatments — forehead lines, crow’s feet wrinkles at the outer corner of eyes and glabellar lines.Botox’s therapeutic diseases include overactive bladder, cervical dystonia, chronic migraine and strabismus among others.The drug generated $1.53 billion sales in the first half of 2017, an increase of 12.7% year over year, driven by strong demand trends. The latest label expansion approval for forehead line treatment, which enjoys a pent-up demand, should drive the sales further.We remind investors that Botox became a part of Allergan’s portfolio following the March 2015 $77 billion acquisition of Allergan Inc. Having previously commanded a strong presence in the generics market, Allergan with the merger has found place on the top 10 list of world-wide pharma companies based on sales. Later, Allergan sold its generics business as well as the Anda distribution arm to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) in 2016. However, in April 2016, Pfizer, Inc.

2265,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for its anti-infective drug, Avycaz, has been accepted and granted priority review by the FDA.We remind investors that Avycaz is currently approved for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (""cUTI""), including pyelonephritis. The drug, in combination with metronidazole, is approved for treating complicated intra-abdominal infections (""cIAI"").The company is looking to get the label of the drug expanded to include hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP). A decision from the FDA is expected in first-quarter 2018.Allergan shares are up 0.5% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s decline of 19.8% in the same period.The sNDA submission was based on non-inferiority data from a pivotal REPROVE study, which evaluated safety and efficacy of Avycaz in adult patients with HABP/VABP. The study showed that Avycaz was non-inferior to meropenem in reducing death irrespective of cause.The drug also showed in vitro (study in controlled environment outside human body) activity against certain gram negative bacteria, which causes HABP/VABP.We remind investors that the FDA issued a refusal-to-file letter last month to the sNDA for Vraylar to expand its label to include negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia.However, boosting its generic portfolio, the company received approval in September for the biosimilar version of Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Avastin for the treatment of five types of cancer.Allergan PLC.

2266,AGN,"We issued an updated research report on Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) on Sep 26.Allergan boasts dominant growth franchises in several areas and is strengthening its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions. In 2017 so far, through the accretive acquisitions of LifeCell and ZELTIQ, Allergan has expanded its medical aesthetics business into regenerative medicine and body sculpting, respectively.Allergan sold its generics business in Aug 2016 and the Anda distribution business to Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) in Oct 2016. Following the closure of the Teva deal, Allergan can now focus on the branded segment and is using the proceeds to buy back shares, pay down debt and pursue additional deals.Key products like Botox and Linzess and new products such as Viberzi and Vraylar are supporting sales growth at Allergan. In fact, at the second quarter conference call, Allergan raised its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2017, following a strong first-half performance and solid outlook for the rest of the year.Allergan also boasts a strong branded pipeline with meaningful data read-outs in the next few months. The company has more than 65 projects in mid-to-late stage development including six key phase III programs. This year, Allergan is extending its R&D pipeline to adjacent categories like NASH, Parkinson's disease, and gene therapy with many promising phase II/III programs in development. Allergan has nine product launches planned for 2017.Biosimilars also represent significant opportunity. Allergan and Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) have a collaboration agreement for the worldwide development and commercialization of biosimilar versions of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs, Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. The biosimilar version of Avastin, to be marketed by the trade name of Mvasi, received FDA approval this month, making it the first cancer biosimilar to get FDA nod.However, while we remain optimistic about the company’s growth prospects, it is facing generic competition for legacy brands like Namenda and Asacol HD as well as patent challenges for some of the other products in its branded portfolio.Meanwhile, new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. Shire’s dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, poses strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy’s Trulance (plecanatide) was launched in the second quarter for CIC, which could pose competition to Linzess.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

2267,AGN,"On Sep 26, 2017, we issued an updated report on Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report).With no approved product in Conatus’s portfolio at the moment, the company is yet to generate revenues. However, it is focused on developing the lead candidate emricasan, an orally active pan-caspase protease inhibitor.Emricasan is being developed for treating patients with chronic liver disease. There are now four ongoing emricasan phase IIb clinical studies. These comprise three ENCORE studies on patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in various patient populations and a fourth ENCORE program on POLT-HCV-SVR patients. Data from all these studies are expected to be released between 2018 and 2019.Results of the combined ENCORE studies are expected to support the undertrial candidate’s efficacy and safety in phase III. Further, the strength of this outcome would determine discussions with regulatory agencies to secure a potential accelerated approval for the candidate.With no treatments currently sanctioned for NASH fibrosis, the market opportunity for emricasan seems significant. NASH is predicted to be the leading cause for liver transplantation by 2020.However, emricasan is still quite a few years away from entering the market, if at all. Any setback in developing emricasan will pull the stock down substantially.Notably, several companies are working to develop treatments for NASH namely, Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT  -  Free Report), Galectin Therapeutics and Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA  -  Free Report) among others. Hence, emricasan is expected to face some intense competition once approved.Another candidate in the company’s portfolio other than emricasan is IDN-7314, currently undergoing a phase II assessment for treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). In June, the FDA had granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to IDN-7314 for the indication.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2268,AGN,"Key highlights in the pharma sector include a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) investigational rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment and FDA approval for Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCRL for J&J RA Drug: J&J’s Janssen Biotech got a CRL from the FDA for sirukumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA. The agency has asked for additional data on the safety of sirukumab. This does not come as a surprise considering the investigational treatment failed to get the support of an FDA advisory panel last month. Given the safety concerns raised by the panel, the request for additional data was more or less expected. J&J intends to meet with the agency to determine the requirements for gaining approval for the IL-6 inhibitor.Meanwhile, the company has submitted a new drug application (“NDA”) for the first darunavir-based single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV. Approval would make this combination the only complete regimen with the potential to deliver the advantages of a single table regimen with the high genetic barrier to resistance of darunavir and the demonstrated safety profile of TAF.Another FDA Nod for Merck’s Keytruda: Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, has gained FDA approval for yet another indication. The cancer therapy, which is already available for a wide range of indications, can now be used in previously-treated patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1. This marks the tenth new indication for Keytruda over a three-year period.Keytruda is a key product in Merck’s portfolio with the drug bringing in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017. The company is working on expanding the label of the drug which is currently in more than 550 studies covering a wide range of cancers and treatment settings (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Gets FDA Nod for Advanced Gastric Cancer).Merck is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Allergan Announces Share Buy Back, CFO Departure: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) continues to work on returning capital to its shareholders with the company announcing its intention to buy back shares worth $2 billion. This comes shortly after the company completed a $15 billion share buyback program. Allergan also reaffirmed its commitment to increase its cash dividend every year while reiterating its commitment to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and paying down $3.75 billion of debt in 2018.The company also announced the departure of Tessa Hilado, executive vice president and chief financial officer (""CFO""), who will be retiring from the company once a successor is appointed.Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo Gets Another Approval: Bristol-Myers also gained approval for another indication for its immune-oncology therapy, Opdivo. With the latest approval, Opdivo can now be used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients previously treated with Nexavar (sorafenib). This makes Opdivo the first and only immuno-oncology agent to be approved for this patient population (Read more: Bristol-Myers Opdivo Gets Approval for Liver Cancer).The company also gained approval in Japan for the use of Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer which has progressed after chemotherapy. Gastric cancer is highly prevalent in Asian countries and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in Japan.Bristol-Myers also entered into a clinical trial collaboration with AbbVie under which a combination of Opdivo and AbbVie’s investigational antibody drug conjugate ABBV-399 will be evaluated in c-met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Bristol-Myers stock has gained 8.1% year to date, compared to the 17.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Priority Review for Aradigm Drug: Aradigm got priority review for Linhaliq for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) patients with chronic infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). A response from the agency regarding the approval status of the drug should be out by Jan 26, 2018. NCFBE, a severe, chronic and rare disease, affects more than 150,000 people in the United States and over 200,000 people in Europe. With no drug currently approved for the treatment of this condition, there is significant unmet need.

2269,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has issued a refusal-to-file (RTF) letter to its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Vraylar (cariprazine). The company is looking to get Vraylar’s label expanded to include new data, which supports the drug’s use as a maintenance treatment.Vraylar is presently approved in Europe for treatment of schizophrenia.Allergan’s share price is down 2.5% this year so far, comparing favorably with the industry’s decrease of 22.3%.The FDA said that the sNDA was not sufficiently complete to allow a substantive review. The company plans to meet the FDA officials to understand what additional information will be required.We remind investors that earlier in March, the FDA had accepted the company’s sNDA for Vraylar. The sNDA was based on data from a phase III study, evaluating Vraylar for maintenance of efficacy in adults with schizophrenia. Data from the study showed that Vraylar has significantly delayed the time to relapse compared with placebo. Also, relapse occurred in nearly twice as many placebo patients (47.5%) in comparison to those treated with Vraylar.Vraylar has performed above expectations in 2016, recording sales of $94.3 million in the year. The drug is likely to be a key driver of Allergan’s top-line growth in 2017.Other players in the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia treatment market include AstraZeneca plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Seroquel XR, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Risperdal Consta and Alkermes plc’s (ALKS  -  Free Report) Aristada.In a separate press release, Allergan announced new data from the CENTAUR phase IIb study, evaluating its pipeline candidate cenicriviroc (CVC) for treating liver fibrosis in adult patients with NASH.These phase IIb data supports continued development of cenicriviroc (CVC) in the ongoing phase III AURORA study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the candidate for liver fibrosis in adult patients with NASH.The CENTAUR study demonstrated no significant difference in fibrosis improvement being observed between CVC and placebo in the second year for patients administered with CVC for a couple of years. Some patients switched over to CVC in year two after remaining on placebo for a year. 20% of such patients receiving CVC achieved the combined endpoint of reduction in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of NASH. This find lies in straight comparison to 13% of those remaining on placebo.Allergan PLC. Price Allergan PLC. Price | Allergan PLC. QuoteZacks RankAllergan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2270,AGN,"The Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) space has been in the spotlight of late due to a number of developments. Earlier in the month, Swiss pharma company Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) suffered a setback when its ophthalmology candidate, lampalizumab, failed to achieve the primary endpoint in late-stage studies. The candidate was being evaluated for the treatment of geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of AMD.  Lampalizumab did not reduce mean change in GA lesion area compared to sham treatment for 1 year (48 weeks).Last month, Ophthotech Corporation (OPHT  -  Free Report) also announced disappointing results from a phase III study, OPH1004. The study evaluated its pipeline candidate Fovista (an anti-PDGF therapy) in combination with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (REGN  -  Free Report) Eylea (aflibercept) or Roche’s Avastin (bevacizumab) for the treatment of wet AMD.AMD and its TypesAMD is a disorder of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, which might lead to blindness. There are two forms of AMD — dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD can lead to wet AMD. GA is a progressive and irreversible form of AMD.Per American Academy of Ophthalmology, dry AMD occurs when parts of the macula get thinner with age and tiny clumps of protein grow. Although dry AMD is the most common form of AMD, there are no approved therapies in the United States and Europe to treat this condition.On the other hand, wet AMD occurs when new, abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina, which in turn leak blood or other fluids, scarring of the macula. Anti-VEGF drugs help in treating wet AMD by reducing the number of abnormal blood vessels in the retina apart from laser therapy.Drugs AvailableA number of drugs have been made available to treat this disorder. The leading among them is Regeneron’s Eylea.  The drug is approved for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion among others. Sales of the drug in the United States came in at $3.3 billion in 2016, up from $2.7 billion in 2015 which highlights the huge market potential of this indication. Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report)/Roche’s Lucentis is also an anti-VEGF therapy approved for various ocular indications, which includes neovascular age-related macular degeneration, visual impairment due to DME among others. Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Roche’s Avastin is also used for wet AMD. Roche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Pipeline CandidatesGiven the huge potential of the market, several companies have a host of candidates lined up in their pipelines. Novartis is developing RTH258 (brolucizumab) for wet AMD. The candidate is expected to pose competition to Eylea. Earlier in 2017, Novartis released positive data on RTH258. The candidate met the primary and key secondary endpoints in two phase III studies, HAWK and HARRIER. However, Novartis expects to complete the pharmacokinetic study with the final manufacturing process to enable filing in 2018. Hence, the candidate is not likely to hit markets before 2019 giving Eylea a breather.Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) is also developing Abicipar pegol (anti-VEGF-A-DARPin) for wet AMD and related conditions.  The company also has other candidates like bimatoprost SR, brimonidine SR for dry AMD. Allergan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, Ophthotech is also developing Zimura in combination with an anti-VEGF drug for the treatment of wet AMD in treatment-naïve patients.  Ophthotech currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Medical Sector 5YR % Return Medical Sector 5YR % ReturnBottom LineGiven the potential in the AMD market, and the number of companies developing treatments for the same, we expect investors to keep an eye on new approvals.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2271,AGN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Allergan has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.3. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Allergan’s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint (which is 18.3) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Allergan has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Allergan’s stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Allergan’s P/CF ratio of 3.9 is significantly lower than the industry average of 14.8, which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Allergan currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AGN a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Allergan is just 1.1, a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, AGN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Allergan might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A. This gives JWN a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days and six lower, while the full year estimate has seen eleven upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped about 0.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Allergan PLC. Price and Consensus  Allergan PLC. Price and Consensus | Allergan PLC. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAllergan is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 6% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

2272,AGN,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA approved their biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab), for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer. The biosimilar will be marketed by the trade name Mvasi.Mvasi is the first cancer biosimilar approved in the United States. It is also the first bevacizumab biosimilar in the country. Notably, Amgen has also submitted regulatory applications for the same in the EU.We remind investors that in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee had unanimously voted to recommend approval of Mvasi.Amgen’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has plunged 29.6% versus the broader industry’s 15.4% rally.The approval was supported by a comprehensive data package that demonstrated similarity of Mvasi with bevacizumab. Data also included results from a phase III comparative efficacy, safety and immunogenicity study, confirming no clinically meaningful difference between Mvasi and the reference product.Amgen and Allergan are also developing biosimilar versions of Roche’s Herceptin (ABP 980 — under review in the United States and the EU) and Rituxan (ABP 798 in phase III).Amgen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s Humira Amjevita, was approved by the FDA in September last year. However, Amjevita has not been launched yet due to an ongoing litigation. Others under development include Amgen’s biosimilar versions of Alexion’s Soliris, Lilly’s Erbitux and Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)/Merck’s Remicade. Interestingly, biosimilar endeavors offer a lucrative opportunity of annual revenues worth $3 billion above for Amgen. The company has also collaborated with Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo for commercialization of nine biosimilars in Japan.With accelerating approvals of biosimilars, a number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies are working on to bringing biosimilars in the market.  Though many biosimilars are marketed in the EU, very few are available in the United States. Last November, Pfizer had launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Remicade. Sandoz also markets Zarxio, the first biosimilar to be approved in the United States. The product is in turn a biosimilar of Amgen’s Neupogen. In July 2016, Merck had launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade in the United States.In August last year, Sandoz had gained an FDA approval for Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen’s Enbrel. However, the product is on hold due to ongoing litigation and is yet to be unveiled in the United States.Amgen Inc. PriceAmgen Inc. Price | Amgen Inc.

2273,AGN,"Several important developments were reported this week with key highlights including the termination of a hepatitis C virus deal, the approval of the first cancer biosimilar in the United States and the presentation of data by companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) among others.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAchillion Down on HCV Deal Termination: Achillion Pharmaceuticals’s (ACHN  -  Free Report) shares fell on the termination of the company’s partnership agreement with Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals for hepatitis C virus (""HCV""). Janssen said that it will not continue with the development of JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir. The decision to discontinue development does not come as a big surprise given the intense competition and pricing dynamics in the HCV market. Achillion intends to focus on the development of advanced multiple small molecule factor D inhibitors of the complement alternative pathway (Read more: Achillion's HCV Partnership with J&J Terminated, Stock Falls).First Cancer Biosimilar Gets FDA Nod: The FDA approved Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) and Amgen’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). Mvasi can be used for all eligible indications of the reference product. Approval was in line with expectations considering the favorable vote the biosimilar got from an FDA advisory panel recently. The approval is quite a boost for the companies as well as the effort to lower drug prices though so far biosimilars are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States. Mvasi is under review in the EU.Pfizer’s Xtandi PROSPERs in Late-Stage Study: Pfizer and partner Astellas Pharma could well be on the path to boost sales of their prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, with the companies announcing positive top-line data from a late-stage study (PROSPER) in patients with non-metastatic (M0) castration-resistant prostate cancer (""CRPC""). The companies plan to discuss this data with regulatory authorities for the expansion of the drug’s label. Xtandi sales, which have been under pressure, should receive a boost on approval for this patient population.Bristol-Myers Signs Deal, Presents Cancer Data: Bristol-Myers Squibb presented data at the European Society for Medical Oncology (""ESMO"") 2017 Congress showing that treatment with Opdivo led to superior recurrence-free survival (35%) compared to Yervoy in patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Read more: Bristol-Myers Reports Positive Results from Melanoma Study).Meanwhile, the company has signed a deal with Halozyme for the latter’s ENHANZE technology. The global collaboration and license agreement is focused on the use of Halozyme’s technology for the subcutaneous administration of Bristol-Myers’s immuno-oncology drugs thereby providing patients with more flexible and convenient treatment delivery options.Bristol-Myers will shell out $105 million upfront plus make future milestone and royalty payments. The dilutive transaction is expected to hit Bristol-Myers’s 2017 and 2018 earnings by a penny and 2019 earnings by five cents.Lilly’s Baricitinib Fares Well in Mid-Stage Eczema Study: Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Incyte presented new safety and efficacy data from a mid-stage study on baricitinib for eczema at the annual meeting of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (""EADV""). Baricitinib, when combined with a mid-potency topical corticosteroid (""TCS""), significantly improved the signs and symptoms of eczema compared to TCS alone. The companies intend to commence a phase III program for the eczema indication later this year. Baricitinib is currently approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant for moderate-to-severe-active rheumatoid arthritis. However, approval is yet to come in the United States where a regulatory filing will be resubmitted by Jan 2018. Lilly stock has gained 12.9% year to date, compared to the 16% rally of the industry it belongs to.Teva Appoints New CEO: Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) has finally ended its search for a Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) with the company announcing the appointment of Kare Schultz as the company’s President and CEO.

2274,AGN,"The biosimilar space remains in the spotlight as a number of regulatory decisions are pending. While generic drugs are follow-on versions of chemically synthesized molecules, biosimilars contain a version of the active substance of an already approved original biological drug.Development of biosimilars is technically challenging than the development of generic drugs as the former requires clinical studies in patients and are engineered to match the reference drug in quality, safety and efficacy. Due to the complex nature of the product, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics.A biosimilar is usually less expensive than the branded drug. Thus the market for the same remains highly lucrative. With the acceleration in approvals of biosimilars, the market has thus attracted a lot of players which is witnessing rapid growth. Here are a few latest developments from this space:Leading the biosimilar space is Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm Sandoz, which is a strong player in the biosimilar market with five marketed biosimilars (Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States.).The company plans to launch five major oncology and immunology biosimilars between 2017 and 2020. This includes a biosimilar version of Rituxan (rituximab), which was approved by the European Commission in June 2017 (marketed as Rixathon).Recently, the FDA accepted its Biologics License Application (BLA) for a proposed biosimilar version of Rituxan. In August 2016, Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Enbrel gained approval in the United States for five indications. Erelzi was also approved by the European Commission in 2017.In May 2017, the European Medicines Agency also accepted the company’s Marketing Authorization Applications for biosimilar versions of Humira (adalimumab) and Remicade (infliximab) for review. Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Generic leader Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) is also exploring the world of biosimilars, a market that has the potential to grow to $20 billion in 2020. The FDA recently notified Mylan and partner Biocon that the target action date for a biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) has been extended to Dec 3, 2017.A decision from the FDA was expected by Sep 3 but the FDA extended the review period due to review of some of the clarificatory information submitted to the agency as part of the application review process. We note that the Biocon partnership includes six biosimilar programs such as biosimilar versions of Herceptin, Neulasta, Humira, Avastin, Enbrel and Neupogen and three insulin analogs (Lantus, Humalog and NovoLog).Mylan has a collaboration agreement with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) to develop, manufacture and commercialize up to six of Momenta’s current biosimilar candidates, including Momenta’s biosimilar candidate, Orencia (abatacept). Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Meanwhile, Amgen and Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) have also submitted a BLA to the FDA for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin in Jul 2017. We note that both the companies are collaborating on four oncology biosimilars, including ABP 980 which is the second to be submitted for FDA approval.Both companies have also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for the candidate earlier in 2017. We note that Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its pipeline, one of which has been approved by the FDA. In March 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to Amgevita, a biosimilar version of Humira in all available indications. The companies have an important event lined up as the FDA is expected to give a decision on the approval of ABP 215, a biosimilar version of Avastin shortly. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Last month, biotech major Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission granted a marketing authorization for Imraldi, a biosimilar version of Humira. This is the third anti-TNF biosimilar from Biogen to receive a marketing authorization in the European Union following the approval of Benepali, a biosimilar of Enbrel and Flixabi (infliximab), a biosimilar version of Remicade. Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In July 2017, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade in the United States which was approved by the FDA in April. The FDA also granted tentative approval for Lusduna Nexvue, the biosimilar version of Lantus, basal insulin in a pre-filled dosing device. Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Medical Sector 5YR % Return  Medical Sector 5YR % ReturnConclusion Given the fact that so much is happening in this space, we expect investor focus on upcoming approval dates.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.

2275,AGN,"On Aug 11, 2017, we issued an updated report on Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report).Conatus’s shares have significantly underperformed the industry so far this year, having lost 4.9% as against the industry’s 17.5% increase.With no approved product in Conatus’s portfolio at the moment, the company has yet to generate revenues. However, it is focused on developing the lead candidate emricasan, an orally active pan-caspase protease inhibitor.Emricasan is being evaluated through various phase IIb studies for treatment of chronic liver disease, including NASH fibrosis. Ongoing studies include ENCORE-PH and ENCORE-NF, evaluating emricasan on patients with compensated or early decompensated NASH cirrhosis and for potential improvements in fibrosis and steatohepatitis, respectively. Data from ENCORE-PH trial is expected in 2018 and from ENCORE-NF, in 2019.In May, Conatus initiated another study — ENCORE-LF — a phase IIb trial, examining emricasan as a monotherapy on patients with decompensated NASH cirrhosis. The company also plans to soon initiate an additional study called ENCORE-XT, on emricasan under the ENCORE program.Conatus is also conducting another phase IIb study — POLT-HCV-SVR — evaluating emricasan on patients with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, post liver transplant. Top-line data from the study is anticipated next year.Results of the combined ENCORE studies are expected to support the undertrial candidate’s efficacy and safety in phase III. Further, the strength of this outcome would determine discussions with regulatory agencies to secure a potential accelerated approval for the candidate.With no treatments currently sanctioned for NASH fibrosis, the market opportunity for emricasan seems significant. NASH is predicted to be the leading cause for liver transplantation by 2020.However, emricasan is still quite a few years away from entering the market, if at all. Any setback in developing emricasan will pull the stock down substantially.Notably, several companies are working to develop treatments for NASH namely, Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT  -  Free Report), Galectin Therapeutics and Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA  -  Free Report) among others. Hence, emricasan is expected to face some intense competition once approved.Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. Price and Consensus Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc.

2276,AGN,"Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) announced that it has submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for lifitegrast for the treatment of dry eye disease in Europe. In fact, the application has been validated by the UK as the Reference Member State, involved in the Decentralized Procedure (DCP).If approved, lifitegrast will be the first and only treatment among a new class of drugs. Consequently, it will give a significant boost to Shire’s efforts to build an ophthalmology unit. Notably, the MAA for the drug was supported by data from five clinical trials, including 2,500 patients.Shares of the company have declined 13.3% compared with the Zacks classified industry’s fall of 2.4% on a year-to-date basis.It is to be noted that Lifitegras was launched in August 2016 in the U.S. under the brand name Xiidra.  In fact, Shire received a major boost when the FDA approved its Xiidra 5%, a twice-daily eye drop solution indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease (DED) in adults.  Per the company, Xiidra is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of this condition. Approximately 16 million adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with dry eye disease, underscoring significant need for treatments in this field. Xiidra also strongly competes with Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) eye care drug Restasis.Meanwhile, the company has a deep pipeline in ophthalmology comprising early-, mid- and late-stage candidates gained through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Also, it remains committed to continued innovation in ophthalmics, where there are opportunities to address unmet need, and improve the lives of patients.Shire PLC Price Shire PLC Price | Shire PLC QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderShire currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2277,AGN,"We issued an updated research report on Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) on Aug 14.The leading biotech beat estimates on both earnings & sales in the second quarter, the results of which were announced on Jul 25. While Amgen slightly tightened the sales guidance, it raised the earnings outlook backed by its strong performance in the first half.Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva,Kyprolis,Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well backed by strong demand.Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline including biosimilar drugs. Important pipeline candidates include Aimovig/erenumab (prevention of migraine – under review in the U.S.), CNP520 (BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease – phase III) and omecamtiv mecarbil (heart failure – phase III).Amgen has 10 biosimilars in its pipeline. The company has collaborated with Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) for the worldwide development and commercialization of three oncology antibody biosimilar medicines – Roche’s Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan.However, the company has some challenges in store given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products. Volume growth of new products may not be enough to offset the lost sales due to the decline in mature brands like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.While Neulasta sales are being hurt by competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies, Neupogen sales are going down due to biosimilar competition in the U.S. from Zarxio. Zarxio is Sandoz’s (Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm) biosimilar version of Neupogen, which was launched in the U.S. in Sep 2015The company expects Neulasta and Neupogen sales to continue to be hurt by competitive dynamic through the rest of 2017. Meanwhile, Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition next year.Also the softness in Enbrel’s sales due to stiff competitive pressure is a key cause of concern. Pricing pressure and stiff competition are hurting sales of Enbrel, one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues this year.Meanwhile, uptake of Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent.In the second quarter, however, the company did notice some improving share trends for the drug, following the presentation of the outcomes study (FOURIER) data in March this year. The data showed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes. The company filed regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in Jun 2017 with a FDA decision expected on Dec 2, 2017.Lastly, Amgen has had its share of pipeline setbacks. The latest being the complete response letter (CRL) received from the FDA for Evenity/romosozumab (osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture) in July, following the heart-related safety issue that emerged from the otherwise successful ARCH results. The FDA asked for safety and efficacy data from two pivotal phase III studies - ARCH and BRIDGE - to be included in the original application, which was filed only on the basis of the pivotal FRAME study.  This will lead to a delay in the drug’s approval.Amgen Inc.

2278,AGN,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report), a favorite for investors chasing large dividend yields, fell more than 4.4%—and hit a 10-year intraday low—on Wednesday. Just says after the company reported sluggish Q2 earnings, investors are continuing to ditch the stock amid reports that Teva is desperately trying to sell off assets.According to sources cited by Bloomberg, Teva is looking to ramp up asset sales in an effort to preserve its credit rating and cut its mounting debt. The report claims that Medis, an Iceland-based generic drug manufacturer, is one of the Teva units on the table.Bloomberg also claimed that Teva is considering the sale of its respiratory treatment assets, although the publication’s anonymous sources said that a decision to sell has not been finalized and considerations are still at an early stage.“Teva is looking at every opportunity to focus our business and streamline operations processes and structure,” the company said in a statement. “Beyond this update, Teva is not in a position to comment on market speculation.”Teva is under increasing pressure to reduce its debt load, which has swelled to a whopping $35 billion following its acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics division. Any new asset sales would come in addition to the pending offloading of Teva’s women’s health and European cancer and pain treatment units.Just last week, on the same day that the company reported lackluster Q2 earnings, slashed its full-year outlook, and cut its dividend by 75%, Teva CEO Yitzhak Peterburg said that asset sales will likely generate at least $2 billion, well above that $1 billion level that was previously forecasted.Also last week, Moody’s said that Teva’s debt reduction has been slower than expected and lowered its credit rating. Moody’s hasn’t been the only analyst firm to question Teva recently, as Morgan Stanley’s David Risinger also chimed in this week.“We believe that Teva’s disappointing generic business performance will take more time to improve given a combination of the generic industry’s intensifying secular challenges and Teva’s own difficulty in executing on its pipeline,” Risinger said in a note.Risinger downgraded Teva to “underweight” and cut its price target to $16, which would represent a further 8.5% slide from Wednesday’s close.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2279,AGN,"Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $4.02 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.95 by 1.8%. Earnings rose 20% year over year driven by higher revenues and operating profitsRevenues came in at $4.01 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago period, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.95 billion by 1%.While key products like Botox and new products like Vraylar, Namzaric and Viberzi did well in the quarter, sales were once again hurt by sales erosion from Namenda XR and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin. Also, lower sales of key dry eye disease drug, Restasis hurt the top line.Second-quarter revenues, however, gained from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (Jan 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (Apr 2017) acquisitions.Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $1.9 billion in the quarter.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 17.1% to $1.22 billion in the quarter, primarily due to higher promotional spend to support new product launches. R&D expenses increased 14.2% to $393.9 million to support an advancing pipeline.Segment DiscussionThe company reports revenues under three segments – U.S. General Medicine, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics and International.U.S. Specialized Therapeutics’ net revenues increased 15.2% to $1.72 billion driven by strong growth in Botox and the addition of LifeCell’s Alloderm and ZELTIQ’s CoolSculpting businesses. Botox (cosmetic) raked in sales of $210.3 million (up 10.7%). Botox Therapeutic revenues were $346.9 million, up 17.2%. In addition, Juvéderm Collection of fillers rose 7.3% and Ozurdex sales increased 15.8%, which contributed to the upside. Alloderm added $84.6 million while CoolSculpting added $78.9 million to sales in the second quarter.Importantly, Restasis sales declined 9.4% to $336.4 million in the quarter due to unfavorable trade buying patterns. We remind investors that Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) launched its dry eye disease drug, Xiidra last year. There have been investor concerns about Xiidra posing strong competition for Restasis. The company expects stable Restasis revenues this year.U.S. General Medicine net revenue declined 1.5% to $1.43 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands, Women's Health, and the Gastrointestinal franchises. Anti-Infectives sales rose 7.4% to $67.8 million while Central Nervous System sales rose 9.2% to $346.6 million.Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Viberzi, Namzaric and Vraylar did well in the quarter. Linzess’ sales rose 11.5% in the quarter to $167.8 million, driven by strong demand and continued OTC conversion.However, lower Namenda XR sales hurt the performance of the CNS franchise. Namenda XR sales declined 28.7% to $118.7 million in the quarter due to lower demand, lower pricing and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric. The company does not expect a generic version of Namenda XR to be launched until first quarter of 2018, delayed from the prior expectation of fourth quarter of 2017. Also, Allergan does not expect any generic version of Estrace Cream to be launched this year.Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept, recorded sales of $33.4 million compared with $23.6 million in the previous quarter.Asacol/Delzicol sales declined 61.9% to $45.6 million due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in Aug 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol.In the Women’s Health segment, Minastrin 24 revenues declined 86.3% to $11.4 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in Mar 2017.The International segment recorded net revenue of $858.8 million, up 16.2% from the year-ago period, driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics, Botox Therapeutic and the addition of LifeCell and CoolSculpting.2017 Outlook UpThe company raised its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2017.Allergan expects total revenue in the range of $15.85 billion to $16.05 billion compared with $15.8 billion to $16.0 billion previously. Currency headwinds are now not expected to hurt revenues versus a negative impact of approximately $100 million expected previously.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $16.05–$16.45 compared with $15.85–$16.35 previously.Adjusted gross margin is expected between 86.5% and 87%. R&D expenses are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion (maintained). SG&A spend is expected between $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion compared to $4.45 billion and $4.55 billion previously.Our TakeAllergan did fairly well in beating estimates for both earnings and sales in the second quarter. The company also raised its 2017 outlook. Shares were down slightly in pre-market trading. However, so far this year, Allergan’s share price is up 19.2% against the industry’s decline of 1.9%.Allergan is reshaping its portfolio through strategic acquisitions. The drugmaker sold its generics and Anda distribution business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) in Aug and Oct 2016, respectively in order to focus on its branded segment.Allergan also boasts a strong branded pipeline with nine product launches planned for 2017. Allergan is extending its R&D pipeline to adjacent categories like NASH, Parkinson's disease, and gene therapy with many promising phase II/III programs in development.We are also encouraged by Allergan’s focus on building its biosimilars pipeline. Allergan has a collaboration agreement with Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) for the worldwide development and commercialization of three oncology antibody biosimilars, which include biosimilars of Roche’s cancer drugs Herceptin and Avastin.However, generic competition for legacy brands like Namenda IR/XR and Asacol HD as well as new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern.Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2282,AGN,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter 2017 loss of 82 cents per share (including stock-based compensation), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 84 cents and the year-ago loss of 87 cents.Being a development-stage company, Aerie has not generated any revenues from product sales yet.We note that shares of Aerie have rallied 39.9% in the year so far outperforming the industry‘s 2.9% rally.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, research and development expenses declined 20.3% to $10.6 million as the company completed trials in the U.S. General and administrative expenses increased 82.7% to $17.1 million. The higher operating expenses in the quarter were attributed to expansion of the employee base to support operations and commercialization preparatory activities, including commercial manufacturing costs for Rhopressa.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuotePipeline UpdatesOn Feb 28, the company resubmitted a new drug application (NDA) for lead candidate Rhopressa 0.02% and expects a review period of 12 months. We note that Aerie withdrew the Rhopressa NDA filed in September as a third party manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL was not ready for pre-approval inspection by the FDA. The company initiated preparations to bring a second contract manufacturer online in 2018.Apart from Rhopressa, Aerie is evaluating Roclatan, a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan. The company reported positive top-line 90-day efficacy and safety data from the second phase III clinical trial, Mercury 2. Data from Mercury 1 is expected in third-quarter 2017. If Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 are successful, the NDA for Roclatan is expected to be filed in early 2018.The company also expects to commence a trial, Mercury 3, in the third-quarter of 2017, in Europe to support filings there. The trial will be a non-inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort (a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol), marketed by Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) in Europe.Meanwhile, the company recently inked acollaboration agreement with DSM with primary focus on the potential of Aerie compounds to treat retinal diseases.Our TakeThe narrower-than-expected loss in the second quarter was encouraging. We are encouraged by the company's efforts in developing its pipeline candidates. A potential approval of Rhopressa in early 2018 will significantly boost growth prospects.Zacks Rank & Other Key PickAerie currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Gilead Sciences.

2283,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) will be reporting second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 3, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.90%.Allergan’s share price is up 20.5% this year so far, outperforming the 0.4% increase witnessed by the industry.Allergan’s earnings performance has been mixed so far, with the company beating expectations in three of the past four quarters and missing on one occasion. The average negative earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 0.27%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWhile revenues are likely to be driven by new product launches, international growth and growth from key established products like Botox, Linzess, Restasis, earnings growth will likely be driven by revenues and operating expense management.The performance of new products like Avycaz (treatment for adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections), Vraylar (bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia), Kybella (double chin reduction) and Viberzi (adults suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea) will also be in focus. Viberzi, and Vraylar did well in the past three quarters and we expect the trend to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well. Viberzi was approved in Canada in May this year, which is likely to contribute to sales.However, Namenda IR is facing generic competition, which will continue to hurt sales of the drug. Namenda XR sales also declined in the previous quarters due to lower demand and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept. Investors will be interested to hear about Namzaric’s performance in the quarter. At the first quarter conference call, management had mentioned that Namzaric sales are benefitting from increased use of combination therapy as patients are transitioning from monotherapy Aricept to Namzaric.Asacol/Delzicol sales will also continue to be hurt by reduction in demand for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in Aug 2016. Minastrin 24 revenues are also likely to be hurt by loss of exclusivity in Mar 2017.Meanwhile, recent acquisitions of LifeCell (closed in Feb) and Zeltiq Aesthetics (closed in Apr) should support the top line in the quarter.At the first-quarter call, the company had hinted that operating margins will improve in the remaining quarters of the year as revenues grow.For the second quarter, the company expects revenues of approximately $33.9 billion to $4 billion. SG&A expenses are expected to be the highest in the second quarter due to continued strong promotion of key brands, the addition of Zeltiq, and the launch of Rhofade cream for rosacea.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.94, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.95. This results in an Earnings ESP of -0.25%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allergan’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Allergan PLC. Price and EPS Surprise  Allergan PLC. Price and EPS Surprise | Allergan PLC. QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the pharmaceuticals sector that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Aug 9, has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2284,AGN,"Last week, several pharma majors reported second quarter results. Meanwhile, important study data was released by Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Big pharma companies like Merck, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Glaxo, Roche, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca reported second quarter results last week. Bristol-Myers, Lilly and Merck all beat expectations. While Merck maintained its outlook for the year (Read more: Merck Beats on Q2 Earnings and Sales, Keeps 2017 View), Bristol-Myers updated the same (Read more: Bristol-Myers Beats on Q2 Earnings, Tweaks 2017 View). Lilly was hit by its baricitinib update despite reporting a “beat and raise” quarter (Read more: Key Takeaways from Lilly's Q2 Call: Baricitinib, Cancer Pipeline). Meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s results were over-shadowed by disappointing MYSTIC data on Imfinzi in treatment-naïve non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the company’s shares falling 14.9% (Read more: AstraZeneca Beats on Q2 Earnings, Falls on Failed Study).British drugmaker Glaxo set out new priorities for the company with the company deciding to allocate 80% of capital to priority assets in two current (respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases) and two potential (oncology and immuno-inflammation) therapy areas. Glaxo also said that more than 30 pre-clinical and clinical programs will be stopped (Read more: GlaxoSmithKline Beats on Q2 Earnings, Lowers Guidance).Lilly and Merck are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Merck’s Keytruda Misses Endpoint in HNSCC Study: There were a lot of updates from Merck last week in addition to the earnings results. The company was hit by disappointing results from a late-stage study evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The study failed to meet the pre-specified primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). This is the latest Keytruda-related setback for Merck. Earlier this month, the company had announced that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on three combination studies (KEYNOTE-183, KEYNOTE-185 and KEYNOTE-023) being conducted with Keytruda for multiple myeloma (MM).Meanwhile, a look at Merck’s second quarter results shows that Keytruda remains strong in the lung cancer setting. Keytruda is currently in more than 550 studies including more than 300 combination studies.Merck-AstraZeneca Sign Oncology Collaboration: Merck and AstraZeneca will be collaborating for the global development and commercialization of Merck’s Keytruda and AstraZeneca’s PARP inhibitor Lynparza for different types of cancer. Lynparza, currently approved for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer in multiple lines of treatment, is in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. The deal will cover the evaluation of PARP and MEK inhibitors with PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors. AstraZeneca stands to receive up to $8.5 billion including an upfront payment of $1.6 billion, $750 million for certain license options and up to an additional $6.15 billion on the achievement of regulatory and sales milestones.Merck stock has gained 8.9% year to date (YTD), lagging the 10.5% rally of the industry it belongs to while AstraZeneca has gained 10.8% YTD.J&J’s Janssen Inks Deal with Bavarian Nordic: Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies and Denmark-based biotech company Bavarian Nordic entered into an additional worldwide exclusive license and collaboration agreement under which Janssen will get exclusive rights to Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN technology for two additional programs targeting vaccines against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV-1.J&J will make an upfront payment of $10 million and an equity investment worth $33 million. Bavarian Nordic will also be eligible to receive milestone payments worth up to $836 million plus tiered royalties on future sales.With this deal, the companies are now collaborating for four programs combining Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN technology with Janssen’s AdVac technology platform.Pfizer-Astellas’ Xtandi Breast Cancer Program Dropped: Astellas, which reported results last week, provided an update on its pipeline which showed that the company and its partner, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), have decided to drop the development of Xtandi for breast cancer. The development program included a phase III study for triple negative breast cancer and a phase II study for ER/PR positive, HER2 positive breast cancer. Astellas said that the decision was based on discussions with Pfizer, the change in the competitive landscape, need for further diagnostic development and new phase II data.Ongoing programs for Xtandi include non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (phase III), prostate cancer in patients with non-metastatic biochemical recurrence (phase III), metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (phase III) and hepatocellular cancer (phase II).PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.8% over the last five trading sessions.

2285,AGN,"Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PRTK  -  Free Report) announced positive results from a phase III study (OASIS-2) comparing its antibiotic candidate omadacycline to Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Zyvox for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI).The study met the key primary and secondary endpoints and Paratek Pharma looks set to file a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA in the first half of 2018. Shares were up more than 5% in after-hours trading.The OASIS-2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of an oral once-daily dose of omadacycline against a twice daily dose of Zyvox.The study met the FDA specified primary efficacy endpoint of statistical non-inferiority (NI) at early clinical response (ECR), 48 to 72 hours after the first dose of the drug in the study. The ECR for omadacycline was found to be 87.5% compared to 82.5% for Zyvox.Additionally, the study met statistical NI in European Medicines Agency specified co-primary endpoints for post-treatment evaluation (PTE). The clinical success rates in modified intent-to-treat population for the omadacycline and Zyvox arms were 84.2% and 80.8%, respectively. The rates were 97.9% for omadacycline versus 95.5% in Zyvox arm in the clinically evaluable populations.We remind investors that omadacycline has now shown positive results in three phase III studies, namely OASIS-2, OASIS-1 and OPTIC studies.The OASIS-2 study data shows that omadacycline can be prescribed as an oral-only dosing regimen in the outpatient setting. This is expected to reduce the need for hospital admission for the treatment of ABSSSI.Data from OASIS-1 announced last year showed that the candidate met the FDA specified primary efficacy endpoint of ECR. The ECR for omadacycline was found to be 84.8% compared to 85.5% in the Zyvox arm.Data from the OPTIC study announced in Apr 2017 demonstrated statistical non-inferiority of omadacycline to Bayer AG’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) Avelox for the treatment of adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) at ECR of 72-120 hours after initiation of therapy. It was also found to be statistically non-inferior to Avelox in the post-treatment evaluation.Paratek intends to present results from these studies along with data for the secondary endpoints at an upcoming scientific congress.The NDA for omadacycline will be for the treatment of both ABSSSI and CABP and will include data from all three studies. We note that omadacycline enjoys Fast Track status in the U.S.The company also intends to file for FDA approval for another pipeline candidate, sarecycline, for the treatment of acne, in the second half of the year. Paratek is developing this candidate along with Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) and announced positive results in the first quarter of 2017. The study met its primary endpoint.The positive developments have pushed up Paratek’s share price by 62% so far this year. It outperformed the Zacks classified Medical – Generic Drugs industry, which increased 8.7% in the same period.Zacks RankParatek currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2286,AGN,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner, Biocon Ltd. announced that the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) unanimously recommended approval of its biosimilarversion of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) breast cancer drug Herceptin (trastuzumab).In fact, the FDA’s ODAC voted 16 to 0 in favor of biosimilar candidate, which has been developed to treat HER2-positive breast cancer that is a more aggressive form of the disease.Notably, shares of Mylan inched up about 0.41% following the news release. However, the company has outperformed the Zacks categorized Medical-Generic Drugs industry in the year so far, with the stock gaining 2.8% against the industry’s decline of 0.3%.Meanwhile, the data presented to ODAC included results that showed that the proposed biosimilar trastuzumab is highly similar to Herceptin, in line with the FDA’s assessment provided in the pre-meeting briefing documents. Per ODAC, there is no clinically meaningful difference between Mylan’s biosimilar candidate and Herceptin in terms of safety, purity and potency.Biosimilar trastuzumab is also under review by regulatory authorities in Australia, Canada, Europe and several emerging markets.While this is good news for Mylan, it is a blow for Roche because Herceptin is one of its key drugs. Last week, another biosimilar of Roche was put under review by the ODAC. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner, Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for its candidate, ABP 215, a biosimilar to Roche’s another cancer  drug Avastin, will also be reviewed by ODAC.  Both Herceptin and AVastin are key drugs for Roche and biosimiar versions of these drugs, once approved, will hurt the sales of the drugs. Mylan N.V.

2287,AGN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for 2018as it faces potential loss of exclusivity for some of its key products in 2018.Allergan expects total sales in the range of approximately $15.0 billion – $15.3 billion, which falls short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.76 billion. Meanwhile, the company said that it expects adjusted earnings of at least $15.25 per share. Though not directly comparable, the earnings projection also appears short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.98 per share.Allergan is facing potential loss of exclusivity for several of its key products in 2018 including Alzheimer’s treatment, Namenda XR and blockbuster dry-eye drug, Restasis. In the latest press release, the company said that it expects a generic version of Namenda XR to be launched in early first quarter while that of Restasis, Allergan’s second best-selling drug, is not expected to be launched prior to the second quarter.We remind investors that in October 2017, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis. The patent loss opened doors for early generic competition for Restasis whose patents were scheduled to expire in August 2024. Please note that no generic version of Restasis has been approved yet.We also remind investors that on the third-quarter earnings call, Allergan had said that if a generic version of Restasis is launched in mid 2018, adjusted earnings per share would be no less than $16. Also, the company said that if a generic enters the market on Jan 1, 2018, adjusted earnings per share will be more than $15 per share.Also, this year, Allergan faces loss of patent exclusivity for Estrace vaginal cream and ulcerative colitis drug, Delzicol. In December last year, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched the first generic version for Estrace cream while a generic version of Delzicol is expected to be launched in early second quarter.Last week, Allergan, in a regulatory filing, announced that it is laying off over 1,000 employees as part of a cost-saving and restructuring program. In the latest press release, Allergan said its cost reduction efforts should reduce  operating  expenses  by  $300  million  to  $400  million  in  2018 from  2017.Also, new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) dry eye disease drug, Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s (SGYP  -  Free Report) Trulance (plecanatide) was launched last year for chronic idiopathic constipation, which could pose competition to Allergan’s, Linzess.In the past year, Allergan’s shares have declined 22.5% compared with the industry’sdecline of 25.5%.Allergan also provided some other updates along with issuing 2018 outlook. The company said that the impact of the tax reforms will be broadly neutral to its adjusted effective tax rate over time with a moderate increase in the 2018 rate from 2017 levels. Allergan guided an adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% in 2018.Under the new $2 billion share buyback plan announced in September last year, Allergan said it has already bought back approximately 20% of the authorized amount in the three months ended December 2017. Also, the company said it plans to sell its remaining stake in Teva securities this year.Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.
