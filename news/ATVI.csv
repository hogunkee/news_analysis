1,ATVI,"Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) recently inked a multi-year deal with Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) to air the Overwatch E-sports league on ESPN prime time, Disney XD, and various Disney-owned streaming services.Reportedly, the company also signed deals with Chinese media companies.Activision introduced Overwatch e-sports league in January this year and the league drew more than 10 million viewers in the opening week. Notably, Overwatch has currently more than 40 million players.Activision’s league coverage began on Jul 11 and will conclude on Jul 27-28 with the live coverage of Grand Finals, taking place at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, NY. Additionally, the agreement also includes a recap of Grand Finals highlights on Jul 29 on ABC. The company noted that “this is just the start of a multi-year agreement”.Activision Cashing in on Growing E-sports PopularityE-sports has been gaining popularity in the last few years and is currently worth more than $500 million. Approximately, more than 130 million people follow various tournaments around the world.Activision’s Overwatch league follows the model similar to that of other professional leagues.In the first season, it featured 12 city-based teams split into two divisions. The groups paid $20 million per team to reserve franchise spots this season. Moreover, there are already rumors that the new teams expected to join next season could pay even more.The overall e-sports economy is expected to total $906 million in 2018, up from $696 million in 2017, according to market research firm Newzoo and scale up to $1.5 billion by 2020.The firm also noted that 77% of the revenues will be generated directly from marketing, sponsorships, and media rights.We believe Activision is well poised to benefit from this strong growth prospect. Its partnerships with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch and Disney are expected to enhance popularity of the Overwatch league.E-sports already enjoys strong viewership. Hence, the partnership also makes sense for Disney’s ESPN division as it is trying to gain more advertising dollars.Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteCan Activision Standout Among its Peers?Activision’s competitors Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive have also boosted their partnerships in the e-sports space.EA and ESPN have several deals for FIFA 17 Ultimate and Madden NFL 18. Moreover, Take-Two and the NBA’s inaugural NBA 2K League season are currently streaming on Amazon’s Twitch.Furthermore, e-sports growth has been largely tied to games such as Tencent-owned League of Legends and other multiplayer battle games.In such a scenario, we believe the growing popularity of Overwatch along with increasing viewership, thanks to the Disney deal, will provide a competitive edge to Activision.Currently, Activision holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2,ATVI,"Shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) surged over 3.8% following an announcement that it landed a multi-year deal with Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) that will see its esports Overwatch League broadcast live on both ESPN and ABC during the July postseason and beyond. Now let’s dive into why this deal matters not only for Activision Blizzard but for Disney and the future of live TV as well.The Deal Activision Blizzard and Disney announced on Wednesday that this year’s Overwatch League playoffs, which begin Wednesday night, will be broadcast across ESPN, ESPN2, Disney XD, ABC, and various Disney-owned streaming services through the end of July. The deal also includes Overwatch League Season 2 and will amount to hundreds of hours of live coverage and highlights, some of which will be broadcast in primetime on ESPN.The deal marks the continuation of ESPN’s push into esports, which currently includes podcasts and its own vertical on ESPN.com. “The Overwatch League Grand Finals is by far our most comprehensive television distribution for an esports event over a single weekend: 10 total hours over four networks and three days,” ESPN executive Justin Connolly said in a statement.“This overall collaboration with Disney/ABC, ESPN and Blizzard represents our continued commitment to esports, and we look forward to providing marquee Overwatch League coverage across our television platforms for fans.”Disney secured the deal for an undisclosed amount, and it is worth noting that its TV and streaming contract will not impact existing rights agreements the Overwatch League has with partners such as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) widely popular Twitch streaming platform.Why It Matters The Overwatch League is set to conclude its inaugural season this summer. The league is a huge step in the right direction for esports, which have been on the rise for years, since it features city-based teams competing in a regular season followed by a postseason. This could prove key to converting non-gamers and sports fans into esports watchers.Activision Blizzard’s league already features 12 teams, spread across the U.S., Europe, and Asia—including Los Angeles, London, and Shanghai. The league also boasts some big name owners, from New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft to Los Angeles Rams and  Denver Nuggets owner Stan Kroenke, with all the groups having paid $20 million per team to reserve franchise spots this season. And there are already rumors that the new teams expected to join next season could pay even more.That might seem rather crazy to people who don’t know much about esports, but the Overwatch League said it would hand out $3.5 million in performance bonuses during the first season, including $1 million during the postseason. On top of that, all the players started on a league minimum salary of $50,000, plus health insurance and retirement plans—which already puts them up with some WNBA and MLS players.Meanwhile, the overall esports economy is expected to total $906 million in 2018, up from $696 million in 2017,according to market research firm Newzoo—with the potential to hit $1.5 billion by 2020.The firm also noted that 77% of this revenue will be generated directly from marketing, sponsorships, and media rights.Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report), and HP (HPQ  -  Free Report) all sponsored Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch League during the first season, which is set to run from last December’s preseason through the All-Star weekend in August.Disney’s push into esports demonstrates just how important live sports are, because even if some don’t see esports as a “real” sport, they are games that have that all-important live aspect. This is why Amazon spent millions to broadcast the NFL again over the next two seasons, and why both Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) have continued their push into live sports in the age of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), where advertisers are willing to spend big on anything and everything live.Bottom Line Disney hopes to continue to gobble up more and more content as it aims to launch its own over-the-top streaming service in late 2019, while also bolstering its ESPN streaming offerings. And Disney is not alone, with Amazon’s Twitch currently streaming Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and the NBA’s inaugural NBA 2K League season.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

As consumers are increasingly spending more on smart phones and portable devices compared to traditional devices for playing online games, mobile games have become one of the fastest growing segments in the video game market.The trend is evident from market research Newzoo’s data, which states that; more than 50% of the revenues will come from mobile games by 2020. Therefore, to cash in on the booming mobile games market, EA plans to expand its mobile portfolio after the success of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and FIFA Mobile.The company also launched The Sims Mobile worldwide on iOS and Android devices in the March quarter. Notably, The Sims is one of the most important revenue generators for EA with 80 million active Sims players across PC and mobile in fiscal 2018. Additionally, it is also gearing up to release a few more mobile games in the coming months.Electronic Arts Inc. Price and Consensus Electronic Arts Inc. Price and Consensus | Electronic Arts Inc. QuoteCloud Gaming to Improve Mobile & Portable User EngagementIn May, EA acquired the cloud gaming technology assets and personnel of a wholly owned subsidiary of Gamefly Inc. Cloud gaming or streaming of video games or Gaming-as-a-Service (GaaS) refers to games that are stored on a company’s cloud platform rather than on the gamers’ device.Extensive availability of high-speed Internet and increasing adoption of mobile and portable devices are driving demand for cloud gaming. This shift is benefiting consumers as the cost of purchasing games is significantly lower when compared with a subscription package.Per data from ResearchandMarket.com, the cloud gaming market is projected to witness CAGR of 26.12% during 2017-2023 to reach a total market size of $4.28 billion.EA is gaining strength from digital revenues (70% of total revenues) backed by live services and mobile games. In the last reported quarter, revenues from live services (44%) increased 37% to $698 million driven by Ultimate Team, The Sims 4 and Battlefield 1.Revenues from mobile games (11%) increased 4% year over year to $172 million on the back of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and FIFA Mobile. The company expects the digital business to remain a tailwind.Competition Remains IntenseEA faces stiff competition from Activision’s (ATVI  -  Free Report) expanding mobile gaming portfolio, which includes Candy Crush. Additionally, Take-Two (TTWO  -  Free Report) poses serious threat with its acquisition of free-to-play mobile game developer, Social Point,. The buyout will help the company to quickly penetrate the robust mobile gaming market.Moreover, Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report) is also planning to introduce mobile games on the Snapchat platform, which is expected to intensify competition further.Currently, EA carries a Zacks Rank #3.

4,ATVI,"On Jul 5, we issued an updated research report on Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report).The company, one of the leading developers and publishers of console and online games, has been continuously drawing strength from its well-known franchises and engaging content releases.The content addition makes it more attractive to players, increases its engagement levels and thereby leads to higher in-game purchases.Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same in the remaining quarter. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 27.98% and came up with a positive earnings surprise of 8.57% in the last reported quarter.Moreover, shares of Activision have gained 34.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 26.3% rally.Popular Franchises Drive Top-Line GrowthActivision’s outperformance is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which will continue to fuel top-line growth. It currently has eight franchises worth $1 billion. Call of Duty is one of the biggest growth drivers for the company. King Digital’s Candy Crush also continues to contribute significantly to the company’s revenues.Notably, Call of Duty: WWII was the top-selling console video game in 2017 globally. The launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 this October is expected to further driver user engagement.We note that at the end of the last reported quarter, Activision had 51 million Monthly Average Users (MAU), up 7% year over year and 12% sequentially, driven by Call of Duty: WWII, Destiny 2 and Crash Bandicoot. Additionally, the company set a new first-quarter record of $1 billion in-game net bookings across its portfolio of franchises.Improving User Engagement PositiveMoreover, the company is leaving no stone unturned to boost its user experience.Last month, it announced the inclusion of a battle royale (BR) game mode called Blackout in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4. This is not only expected to boost Activision’s competitiveness against its traditional rivals but also Fortnite, a free game played by more than 45 million people worldwide. In September 2017, Epic Games introduced a BR mode for Fortnite on computers and gaming consoles.Additionally, the company is strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market and it also has a strong gaming lineup for the second half of the year.However, the growing craze for Epic Games’ Fortnite is an overhang on Activision as we fear a decline in engagement levels.Also, significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) is a concern.Zacks RankActivision currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

5,ATVI,"Shares of JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) are riding high on strategic mergers and joint ventures, collaboration with popular brands and movie franchisees. Moreover, efforts to enter new categories, and create a solid portfolio of new and existing licenses bode well. Evidently, the stock has surged 45.5% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 15.7% rally. Stocks such as Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry, has also gained 14%, 9.1% and 25.6%, respectively, in the same time frame.Let’s delve deeper and find out the reasons that have kept this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company ahead of its peers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Hidden CatalystsJAKKS Pacific has emerged as a diversified consumer products company buoyed by a string of acquisitions over the past few years.  We consider the company’s ability to successfully identify, close, and integrate acquisitions to be one of its primary competitive advantages. It continues to leverage from the acquisitions of Maui, Inc. and the joint ventures with Meisheng Culture & Creative Corp., NantWorks LLC and DHX Brands. Through such innovative partnerships JAKKS Pacific intends to enter new categories and gain market share in a competitive industry.Notably, since the beginning of 2017, JAKKS Pacific entered into multiple licensing agreements spanning across varied product lines, which have been hitting stores throughout the year. Furthermore, developlment of product specifically for alternative sales channels — including drug and grocery stores as well as specialty stores — has proved conducive to domestic and international customers.Also, JAKKS Pacific remains committed toward expanding its footprint outside the United States. Consistent with its endeavors, the company has opened sales offices and expanded distribution agreements for its products. Since management expects to benefit from geographical expansion, it started full-fledged operations at its newest sales office in Germany and France last year.Meanwhile, its partnership with Meisheng is expected to result in solid growth across Asia. After launching Tsum Tsum in key international markets like Latin America and Asia, the company plans to expand its distribution in new territories moving ahead. These expansion initiatives are likely to strengthen its international presence and customer base, which in turn, should boost sales growth, profit margins and the company’s access to attract licenses.Moreover, JAKKS Pacific has regularly brought in novelty in its products to cope with the changing play pattern of children and boost demand. Recently, demand for physical toys has been declining due to younger children’s preference for digital games and other electronic learning tools. Consistent with this trend, the company has also introduced a number of mobile gaming apps and digital games besides the physical toys, which may help it cash in on the demand for smartphone gaming. In addition, JAKKS Pacific is taking initiatives to connect with  customers through digital videos, display banners and social ads, which are likely to improve customer experience. Such investment in digital innovation should help the company in brand building apart from allowing it to capitalize on lucrative technology-based gaming market.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

8,ATVI,"Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) is trying to lure away gamers from Fortnite by including a battle royale (BR) game mode in the highly anticipated game, Battlefield V that is set to release on Oct 19.In a similar move, last month EA’s biggest rival Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) announced a BR mode called Blackout in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 that is set to release on Oct 12.Notably, Fortnite is a free game that has been played by more than 45 million people worldwide. In September 2017, Epic Games introduced a BR mode for Fortnite on computers and gaming consoles. According to Superdata, Fortnite generated $296 million in sales in April, up from $223 million in March.We believe given the tremendous success of BR, the addition of the mode in Battlefield will help the company boost competitiveness.Shares of EA have returned 31.2% on a year-to-date basis compared withthe industry’s rally of 17.8%.  Battlefield — Key Growth DriverBattlefield is one of the biggest growth drivers for EA.

Most of the rally was driven by the resurgence of the FAAMNG stocks and the strength in chipmakers, thanks to robust earnings, a rising interest rate scenario and solid demand for cutting-edge technology.Notably, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) are setting new milestones in recent trading sessions. Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) also supported the rally (read: Social Media ETFs to Gain as Twitter Prepares for S&P 500).Additionally, latest bouts of upbeat data, which indicates that the economy has been on a strong path, boosted confidence and investors’ risk appetite.As a result, Invesco QQQ (QQQ  -  Free Report), which serves as a proxy for the index, has climbed 12.4% so far this year.

11,ATVI,"Investors in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the June 15, 2018 $4.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Activision Blizzard shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Activision Blizzard is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Bottom 4% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, eight analysts have decreased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have increased their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 46 cents per share to 38 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Activision Blizzard right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

Shares have added about 6.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ATVI due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsActivision Blizzard posted first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 78 cents per share, which increased 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.Including GAAP deferrals, adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents and increased 22.6% from the prior-year quarter.   Revenues (including deferrals) of $1.38 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 billion.Activision is primarily riding on its well-known franchises like Call of Duty and Overwatch, which fueled top-line improvement in the quarter. King Digital’s Candy Crush continues to contribute significantly to the company’s revenues.Quarter DetailsExcluding deferral revenues, Activision reported sales of $1.97 billion, up 13.9% year over year.   Segment wise, product sales (36.6% of total net revenues) were $720 million, up 41.5%.

The company had over 374 million monthly active users (MAUs) at quarter end.Activision Publishing’s revenues increased 31% year over year to $312 million.  Activision had 51 million MAUs, up 7% year over year but up 12% sequentially, driven by the Call of Duty: WWII, Destiny 2 and Crash Bandicoot. The release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 will drive engagement further.Blizzard’s revenues of $480 million increased 8% from the year-ago quarter driven by in-game content, strong presales of World of Warcraft, and Overwatch League.

13,ATVI,"Shares of Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The stock has declined 16.6% against the industry’s rise of 11.9%. However, stocks such as Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry, have witnessed a sharp gain of 14.5%, 42.4% and 24%, respectively, in the same time frame. Yet, the company seems to be banking on its strategic investments in emerging markets and key power brands — Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price — to drive growth. Let’s delve deeper and find out whether Mattel can match its peers performance in the near term.Hidden CatalystsSince the U.S. toy market is somewhat saturated, toy companies like Mattel are exploring growth opportunities abroad. This is because international markets offer greater potential based on the pace of economic growth that they currently enjoy. In fact, Mattel has been seriously focusing on expanding its presence in Europe, Latin American and Asian countries. Meanwhile, emerging markets continue to demonstrate strong growth and long-term potential, mainly Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Particularly, to succeed in China, Mattel has adopted a solutions-based and digital-first method to localize products, which has aided the company to scale swiftly in the past five years.Additionally, the company remains focused on achieving cumulative cost savings through its current cost savings program to boost margins. Also, it is simplifying organization structure, and optimizing processes and supply chain to generate savings across operations.This apart, Mattel continues to make progress in its $650 million Structural Simplification cost savings initiatives and prioritized investments. Subsequently, the company expects to achieve 40% of the $650 million in 2018, with savings heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. In the first quarter, it has already taken actions toward achieving this goal. These actions are expected to result in full-year run-rate savings of approximately $165 million, which includes $85 million in SG&A, $50 million in cost of goods sold, and $30 million in advertising.Given a strong product line-up that includes core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations, Mattel remains well positioned for growth. In fact, the company’s premier brand like Hot Wheels has been the category leader in multiple product segments for several years owing to its popularity among young boys and girls. Mattel has also forayed into other consumer product categories such as apparel, fashion and accessories to build the brands.  Hurdles to CrossTighter retail inventory management significantly affected Mattel’s first-quarter 2018 sales and may continue to hamper revenues, going forward. Moreover, due to a simplified cost savings initiative that included write-downs of excess owned inventory and impairment of assets, the company’s adjusted gross margin in 2017 contracted 850 basis points (bps). This downtrend is likely to persist in the short term. Further, costs related to marketing and promotional initiatives, for cleaning up inventories, coupled with the development of digital platforms are likely to keep margins under pressure, moving ahead.Moreover, Mattel’s net revenues in the first quarter of 2018 declined 7% year over year (on a constant-currency basis) due to Toys ""R"" Us liquidation. It also led to sales decline across every brand under Mattel. We believe that the effect of this liquidation will linger further as Toys “R” Us was the last major chain fully dedicated to selling toys, and the overall industry is expected to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time.Mattel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

17,ATVI,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, Ben Rains speaks with Ted Pollak of the ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (GAMR  -  Free Report) about the success of the video game industry and its future, from mobile gaming to virtual reality.Pollak’s wealth of knowledge about the video game industry led him to the idea of an industry-focused ETF, which has performed very well.The video game industry has grown immensely over the last couple of decades. More recently, the proliferation of mobile gaming, driven by the likes of Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) and industry giants such as Nintendo (NTDOY  -  Free Report), has helped take the industry to heights few could have anticipated.The big names like Nvidia NVDA, Intel INTC, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) will continue to benefit from their gaming presence. Meanwhile, video game-specific companies, including Take-Two Interactive TTW, Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Tencent (TCEHY  -  Free Report), and Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), should also be able to expand their offerings.Looking ahead, the rise of esports and virtual reality-based gaming offers companies the chance to grow even more. The popularity of free games, such as Fortnite, and streaming content on Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch demonstrates how powerful professional video game players are these days.Just last month, esports star Tyler Blevins—known as Ninja—had more social media interactions than soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo across Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Instagram, and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report).Make sure to listen to the full episode for more about the ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF and the future of the video game industry.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

18,ATVI,"Take Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 results on May 16.The company beat the Zack Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 78.5%.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.26 per share increased 46.5% from the year-ago quarter.The company's net revenues came in at $480.8 million, marginally higher than $476.5 million reported in the year-ago period.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company expects net bookings to be in the band of $410–$460 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $443.9 million.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayTake Two is likely to benefit from its popular offerings like Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto online, NBA 2K18 and WWE 2K18. The company banks on growth in digital revenues driven by higher sales of full-game download and increase in recurrent consumer spending.Per SuperData’s March 2018 report, NBA 2K18 and GTA V ranked among the top 10 digital game sales on console. In fact, increased sales of the digital version of the games are adding to the company’s margins.Additionally, the acquisition of game developer, Social Point, which enabled the company to foray into free-to-play games space, has been a positive. Games like Dragon City and Monster Legends, which were also updated in the soon-to-be reported quarter are expected to drive results.Further, Take Two remains optimistic about its new publishing label Private Division, the publisher of the popular simulation game, Kerbal Space Program, which released new contents in the fourth-quarter.However, the growing popularity for Epic Games’ Fortnite is an overhang on Take Two. This is evident from SuperData’s February report, which states that monthly active users of Fortnite were more than that of GTA V.Rising competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Zynga  remains a headwind.

24,ATVI,"Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 36.06%.In the last reported quarter, the company’s non-GAAP earnings were 49 cents per share, which increased 36.1% from the year-ago quarter. Including GAAP deferrals, adjusted earnings of 94 cents per share matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 2 cents from the prior-year quarter.    Revenues (including deferrals) of $2.64 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 billion. Excluding deferral revenues, Activision reported sales of $2.043 billion, up 20.2%. The top line was driven by strength in digital revenues, Overwatch, Call of Duty: World War II and Destiny 2.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.    Factors to ConsiderActivision’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which will continue to fuel top-line growth. Call of Duty is one of the biggest growth drivers for Activision. Notably, Call of Duty: World War II was the top-selling console video game in 2017, globally.In the last-reported quarter, Activision recorded 55 million monthly active users (MAUs) up 12% sequentially. This increase can primarily be attributed to Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Activision Publishing’s net revenues stands at $364 million, up 69.3% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.The acquisition of King Digital Entertainment has also worked in favor of the company. King Digital had 290 million MAUs at the end of the last reported quarter, backed by Candy Crush.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kings’ net revenues is pegged at $520 million, up 9.7% from the figure reported a year ago.Additionally, the company is strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market. Notably, Overwatch League had a scintillating start with more than 10 million viewers watching the event in the first week of the inaugural season. We note that the launch of Overwatch League is driving viewership, corporate sponsorships and media coverage for Activision.However, the growing craze for Epic Games’ Fortnite is an overhang on Activision as many analysts fear that engagement will decline due to this.Also, higher adoption of free-to-play games and significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) are concerns.Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteWhat Does Our Model Say?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

The company’s diverse gaming portfolio, which includes titles like Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Design Home and Covet Fashion are driving top-line growth. Addition of new features and live operations are keeping the interest of users alive.However, due to the end of the MBL season, management anticipates Tap Sports Baseball to decline at an increasing rate in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, as observed in the prior years.The company launched MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2018 on the App Store and Google Play at the end of the quarter and thus no contribution is expected from it in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Unfortunately, Glu’s other celebrity titles like Restaurant Dash: Gordon Ramsay is also losing popularity.Moreover, rising competition from established players like Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) remains a concern. Furthermore, we anticipate significant investment in sales and marketing to remain an overhang on margins.Glu Mobile Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Glu Mobile Inc.

27,ATVI,"The picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season, which has now crossed the halfway mark, is one of all-around strength, with Q1 earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in 7 years.This is a good showing, but two aspects of this earnings season hold us back from calling it a great performance. First, estimates for the current period have failed thus far to go up, as had been the case ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. Second, positive surprises are tracking above historical periods, but they remain below what we had seen in the preceding earnings season, particularly on the revenue front.Many of you will justifiably look at these issues as nothing more than nit-picking and we acknowledge the all-strength and growth momentum as well. But we can’t ignore the fact that Q1 performance lags what we saw in the preceding earnings season in some respects, particularly how the 2018 Q2 revisions trend is shaping up, as the chart below shows.A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes, which was obviously a one-off development. Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes, we would have seen only EPS estimates go up, with no changes to revenue estimates. But that wasn’t the case, as revenue estimates had gone up as well, which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction.We have a busy reporting docket this week, with more than 900 companies reporting Q1 results, including 142 S&P 500 members, and the revisions trend could turn around. But if we haven’t seen evidence of positive revisions thus far, the odds are that we wouldn’t see them in the coming days either.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) are the more notable of the 142 index members coming out with results this week. Other major companies this include Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) on Tuesday, May 1st, MasterCard (MA  -  Free Report) on Wednesday May 2nd and Activision-Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) on Thursday May 3rd.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) – McDonald’s is the notable of the 12 S&P 500 members reporting Q1 results on Monday, April 30th. The fast-good giant is expected to earn $1.67 per share on $4.93 billion in revenues, up +13.6% and down -13.8% from the year-earlier period, respectively. The revisions trend has been stable, though estimates have modestly come down over the last two months. The stock has struggled since late January, down -7.2% in the year-to-date period, lagging the S&P 500 index’s almost flat showing in the same period.Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) – Apple will be in the spotlight on a very busy reporting day on Tuesday, May 1st. The iPhone maker is expected to earn $2.69 per share on $61.1 billion in revenues, up +28.1% and +15.5% from the year-earlier period, respectively. The revisions trend has been negative, with the current $2.69 EPS estimate down from $2.71 a month back and $2.84 three months back. As always, the focus will be on iPhone sales, which are expected to have reached 52.94 million in Q1, up from 50.76 million units in the year-earlier quarter. The company came up short of iPhone shipments expectations in the December quarter when it sold 77.3 million versus expectations of 79.8 million. The stock has lagged the Tech sector in the year-to-date and trailing 12-month period.  Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard (as of Friday, April 27th)Total earnings for the 267 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up +25.1% from the same period last year on +10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating EPS estimates and 73.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 61.4%.To put these results in a historical context, the charts below compare the results thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 267 index members in other recent periods.As mentioned earlier, earnings and revenue growth rate and the proportion of positive EPS surprises is tracking above what we have been seeing from the same group of 267 index members. But revenue surprises aren’t as widespread as was the case in the preceding earnings season.In other words, the revenue growth momentum that we have been seeing over the last couple of earnings seasons is still in place, but revenue surprises are tracking below what we had seen in the preceding period and only in-line with the 4-quarter period, as the chart below shows.Tech Sector ScorecardFor the Tech sector, we now have Q1 results from 64.7% of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Tech companies are up +31.3% from the same period last year on +11.4% higher revenues, with 92.9% beating EPS estimates and 89.3% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the sector’s Q1 performance thus far in a historical context.Expectations for 2018 Q1 As a WholeLooking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be up +22.6% from the same period last year on +8.4% higher revenues. This would follow the +13.4% earnings growth on +8.6% revenue growth in the 2017 Q4 earnings season, the best quarterly performance in 7 years.The chart below shows 2018 Q1 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see, the growth pace is expected to accelerate in Q2 and continue in the following quarters.As you can imagine, expectations for full-year 2018 are for an impressive showing, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be +18.5% from the year-earlier level on +5.5% higher revenues. If achieved, this will be the highest annual growth pace for the index since 2010.The table below shows the summary picture for 2018 Q1, contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period.As you can see, the Energy sector remains a big growth contributor in Q1, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +70.8% from the year-earlier period on +15.4% higher revenues. But growth for the quarter would still be in double-digits even on an ex-Energy basis (last row in the table above).What is driving the strong Q1 growth isn’t the Energy sector, but rather the breadth of growth across all sectors, with double-digit earnings growth for 13 out of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Technology and Finance.For the Technology sector, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +27.9% on +12.5% higher revenues, which would follow the sector’s impressive +24.2% earnings growth on +11.1% higher revenue growth.The Finance sector, which sat out the preceding quarter with an essentially flat showing, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +26.4% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues.Driving the Finance sector’s strong growth in Q1 and beyond is the combined effect of tax cuts, higher interest rates and an improved domestic growth environment. Finance sector’s earnings were only up +1.2% in full-year 2017 and in low single digits in the three years prior to that, but are on expected to be up an impressive +25.9% in full-year 2018.The Technology sector, on the other hand, has already been on stronger ground, with full-year 2017 earnings for the sector up +15.8% and expected to be up +17.4% in 2018. The enterprise spending environment was expected to improve this year even before the tax cuts, with the tax windfall expected to give a much needed boost to those trends. On top of these we have the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data that are expected to remain growth areas in the space.Please note that Technology and Finance aren’t just any two sectors out of the 16 in the S&P 500 index; these two sectors combined are the twin pillars of index’s total profitability, bringing in more than 40% of the index’s total earnings this year. The Energy sector’s outlook has improved, but the sector simply lacks the heft of these two. The Energy sector is expected to bring in about 5% of the index’s total earnings this year.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

Adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share missed the consensus mark of 31 cents. Also, the bottom line declined sharply from 54 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Net revenues of $716.3 million lagged the consensus mark of $825 million and also decreased 16% from the prior-year quarter. Decline in revenues can be primarily attributed to liquidation of Toys “R” Us in the United States and the U.K. and ambiguity over other operations. Unsold inventory in Europe also hampered the company’s quarterly numbers. In fact, the company witnessed revenue decline at all of its Brand Portfolio.In the past six months, the stock has declined 10.9% against the industry’s gain of 1.8%. Brand Portfolio PerformancesThe Franchise Brand portfolio posted revenues of $361.7 million, down 19% year over year.

29,ATVI,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to zero in on stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main aspects that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc.

GameOn is the e-commerce and web hosting power’s latest foray into the multibillion-dollar gaming industry and should be a further sign to investors that the video game market is rapidly expanding.Amazon’s new service aims to allow developers and gamers to integrate and create competitions natively across mobile devices, PCs, and gaming consoles. GameOn, which was built on Amazon’s AWS cloud infrastructure, will also allow gamers to win prizes, most of which Amazon will offer through its e-commerce site.Amazon sees its new cloud gaming division as a way to profit from the proliferation of gaming and the rise of esports. The basic idea is that millions of people play video games and want to experience high-level competition with real monetary benefits on the line, but not all of them are at the level of professional gamers.“Game developers have consistently told us they are looking for ways to increase player engagement and retention,” Amazon’s Director of Competitive Gaming, Marja Koopmans, said in a statement. “We built Amazon GameOn to give developers simple, yet powerful tools to foster community through competitive gameplay.”Some relatively well-known gaming companies and esports teams, including nWay, Game Insight, and Millennial Esports’ Eden Games, are currently using GameOn.Amazon’s new competitive gaming platform comes nearly four years after the company purchased esports streaming platform Twitch for nearly $1 billion.The esports ecosystem is expected to expand by almost 40% in 2018 to become a $905.6 million business, based on new estimates from market research firm NewZoo. A majority of this money is set to come from non-endemic sponsors, advertisers, and media companies.This year, HP (HP  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Toyota (TM  -  Free Report), and T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report) all sponsor Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI  -  Free Report) new “Overwatch League,” which models its structure on major U.S. professional sports leagues. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) have also bolstered their partnerships with more mainstream sports.Amazon looks poised to capitalize on esports while also infusing its e-commerce business with another potential revenue stream through GameOn-based prizes. The company is also set to take on Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) quickly expanding gaming unit.Microsoft recently purchased a similar tournament and leaderboard-based gaming service called PlayFab, and also just launched its own cloud-based gaming division.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

33,ATVI,"Perhaps no entertainment medium is as universally beloved as video games. From the days of arcade cabinets to the console revolution and the advent of virtual-reality gaming, people around the world have always loved video games.Today, the global gaming industry is adjusting to its latest trend: esports. Video games tend to be competitive by nature, but esports bring the intensity of this competition to the next level. And just like a traditional physical contest like a soccer game or boxing match, esports require high-level training, sportsmanship, and clutch performance.Competitive gaming at a professional level is a relatively new concept, but money is already flowing into the industry at a rapid pace. Pro gamers are now facing off in international tournaments, racking up corporate sponsorships, and battling for multi-million dollar prizes.But is this just another quirky trend, or should investors consider esports a legitimate growth industry? There are certainly plenty of publicly-traded video game companies, but will any of them feel the effects of esports? Is there any money to be made here? Let’s take a closer look.Market SizeThe global esports economy is expected to grow to more than $905 million in 2018, according to market research firm Newzoo. That figure would represent year-over-year growth of roughly 38%.About 77% of this cash will be generated directly through sponsorships and advertising and indirectly through media rights and content licenses. Game publisher fees are expected to account for 13% of this year’s economy, while merchandise and event ticketing will bring in about 10%.“As a business, esports is now entering a new and critical phase toward maturity. Big investments have been made, new league structures have been launched, sponsorship budgets have moved from experimental to continuous, and international media rights trade is starting to heat up,” said Newzoo CEO Peter Warman.But as one would expect with any young business, rising revenue does not necessarily mean profits are being realized yet.“Profitability and return on investment is, for many organizations at the heart of the Esports Economy, a challenge,” Warman added.Nevertheless, we can see that the scope of the esports industry—and its rapid rate of growth—should put it every investor’s radar. With this much money pouring in, people need their own strategies if they want to be among the first wave that profits from esports.Investment IdeasOne low-exposure method for investing in esports is buying shares in Wall Street darling Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report). This trendy company makes high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) that are marketed towards PC gamers. These GPUs are a top choice for professional gamers, who understandably need their machines to perform at the highest level.Nvidia has attracted attention because of its investments in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars, but gaming is still the company’s core business. The rise of esports promises to generate even more interests in its GPUs, and the stock is already sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The more direct approach to investing in esports is through the video game publishers. Millions of people are tuning in to watch professional gamers play some of the world’s most-popular games, which increases brand awareness and drives licensing fees for these companies. And these brands are certainly looking for ways to cash in further from this business.For example, Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) recently launched its “EA Competitive Gaming Division.” This new group focuses on operating professional leagues for games like FIFA, Madden NFL, and Battlefield. Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) partnered up the National Basketball Association to launch the “NBA 2K eLeague,” which will feature a team operated by each of the NBA’s 30 franchises (also read: Esports Goes Mainstream with NBA, FIFA Deals).Another video game publisher that stands to benefit from esports is Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report). Activision recently purchased a major esports company, Major League Gaming, for $46 million.  ATVI also just started a professional league for its immensely-popular Overwatch game. The new “Overwatch League” is the first pro league of its kind, with 12 teams representing cities from around the globe.But one of the most promising “esports stocks” right now is Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY  -  Free Report). Tencent owns Riot Games, the developer of one of the world’s most-popular games, League of Legends. According to Newzoo, League of Legends was the second-most watched game on Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch streaming platform during the month of January.Tencent is also uniquely positioned to succeed in Asian markets, which continues to be the hottest region for esports. Tencent is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want more market analysis from this author?

34,ATVI,"Electronic Arts’ (EA  -  Free Report) Maxis division recently launched The Sims Mobile — the much awaited latest version of the popular The Sims franchise — worldwide on iOS and Android devices.Notably, The Sims is one of the most important revenue generators for EA. The Sims FreePlay recorded enormous success in the last quarter.Moreover, player base for the PC and Console-version The Sims 4 grew more than 35% year over year driven by the launch of “highest performing expansion pack to date”.Markedly, the company’s strength in digital business is boosted by live services and mobile games. In the prior quarter, a 12% improvement in Digital net bookings year over year was driven by 39% and 5% increase in Live services and Mobile delivery net bookings, respectively. In fact, net bookings from Live services’ were backed by robust performance by The SIMS 4 and Ultimate Team.Mobile Games – A Key Growth DriverAfter the success of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile, EA has been gearing up to expand its mobile business.Per market research firm Newzoo, by 2020, more than 50% of the revenues will stem from mobile games. Therefore, to cash in on the booming mobile games market, EA plans to expand its mobile portfolio with the launch of two games this year and more in the coming years.In fact, FIFA Mobile is one of the key growth drivers for the company. Last quarter, it added 26 million players.Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Electronic Arts Inc. QuoteNew Titles to Provide Competitive EdgeEA has two other games slated to release in the current quarter. Burnout Paradise Remastered will be available from Mar 16 on Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One. Meanwhile, A Way Out is scheduled to be released on Mar 23.In February, EA and Swedish studio Zoink Games released Fe for players on Xbox One, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and Origin for PC. EA also launched UFC 3 for Xbox One and PS4 in the same month.We believe the new titles will help EA to counter intensifying competition and offset lackluster performance from Star Wars Battlefront 2, which had been a setback for the company. In a year’s time, shares of EA have surged 42.9% underperforming its peers like Activision (ATVI  -  Free Report), Take-Two (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Gluu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) that gained 52.5%, 87.1% and 106.8%, respectively.Currently, EA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

35,ATVI,"Investors in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the March 9, 2018 $60 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Activision Blizzard shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Activision Blizzard is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Bottom 44% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased its earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 42 cents per share to 37 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Activision Blizzard right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

36,ATVI,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. This week we take a look at the growth of esports and how deals between gaming companies and leagues such as the NBA will help expand professional video gaming’s appeal.The esports ecosystem is expected to expand by almost 40% in 2018 to become a $905.6 million business, based on new estimates from market research firm NewZoo. A majority of this money is set to come from non-endemic sponsors, advertisers, and media companies.This year, HP (HP), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Toyota (TM  -  Free Report), and T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report) all sponsor Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI  -  Free Report) new “Overwatch League,” which models its structure on major U.S. professional sports leagues. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) have also bolstered their partnerships with more mainstream sports.Take-Two and the NBA’s new “NBA 2K League” is set to tip off its inaugural season this spring. When it does, the NBA will become the first major North American sports league to run an esports league.The NBA’s new esports league does yet have a media rights partner. There are, however, a few likely frontrunners. The league already works with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch platform to stream G League games, and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) are both actively trying to expand their streaming content options.At the same time, the most popular sport in the world, soccer, is hoping to grow its reach through joint ventures between EA’s FIFA video game and pro leagues around the world, including the MLS.Esports have been on the rise for years. Yet, its growth has been largely tied to games such as Tencent-owned (TCEHY  -  Free Report) League of Legends and other multiplayer battle games. Now, esports have the chance to become even bigger with the successful adoption and integration of widely popular games for mainstream sports, like Madden and NBA 2K.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

38,ATVI,"CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15, after the closing bell.In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings beat of 3.7%. The bottom line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether CBS will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $1.15, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 3.6%. In the past 30 days, the consensus estimate has moved down by 2 cents.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,714 million up from $3,518 million in the prior-year quarter. The current estimate reflects a sequential growth of 17.1%.Factors Influencing This QuarterFrom the above estimates, it is apparent that CBS’ top and bottom lines are expected to grow year over year. We believe the company is likely to gain from increasing demand for content, rise in retransmission rates, expansion of direct-to-consumer business, sturdy digital presence, upfront fees from traditional distribution partners and higher international content licensing fees. Also, with the launch of Showtime's streaming service; online news channel, CBSN; and over-the-top service, CBS All Access, the company has started generating incremental revenues.CBS’s sustained focus on increasing subscription-based revenues is likely to drive long-term growth as well. In the fourth quarter, analysts surveyed by Zacks anticipate revenues from affiliate and subscription fees to increase by more than 15% year over year to $888 million. Furthermore, the company has an extensive library of premium content that it monetizes over multiple platforms.Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues from adverting to be $1,779 million, down 0.9% year over year. Meanwhile, CBS remains highly vulnerable to the advertising market as it derives a major portion of revenues from the sale of advertising on its broadcast and cable networks and television, syndicated programming and online properties. Additionally, broadcast TV is losing ground to the internet and digital media.CBS Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise CBS Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CBS Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that CBS is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CBS has an Earnings ESP of -0.61%. Although, the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Activision Blizzard, Inc.

45,ATVI,"Shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) closed slightly lower on Wednesday, just one day before the company is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report. With digital revenues on the rise and highly-anticipated releases like Call of Duty: WWII occurring during the ever-important holiday quarter, investors can bet that ATVI will command the attention of Wall Street when it reports.So what does Activision have in store for its fourth-quarter report? Well, based on our current consensus estimates, we expect the company to report adjusted earnings of $0.93 per share and adjusted revenues of $2.61 billion. These results would represent modest year-over-year growth rates of 1.1% and 6.4%, respectively.But earnings and revenue only paint part of the picture. In today’s quickly-changing entertainment landscape, video game publishers have to be on top of current trends—and ready to capitalize when the next trend emerges.That means that investors will also be interested in how specific segments of Activision Blizzard’s overall business performed in the holiday quarter. To prepare for this, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file.The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.First up, Activision Blizzard’s King Digital segment is always important to track. Activision shelled out $5.9 billion for King, the publisher of the popular Candy Crush mobile games, in a deal that closed in Feb. 2016. The acquisition was seen as a massive bet on the future of mobile gaming, and investors are still interested in seeing whether it has paid off.Our consensus estimate file is calling for ATVI to report total King Digital revenues of $492 million, up about 12.9% year-over-year. Last quarter, the company reported growth of 15.0% in this segment. It is also worth noting that mobile gaming is significantly less impacted by cyclical trends compared to Activision’s other businesses, so year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter comparisons are a bit more useful here.Meanwhile, our current consensus estimates are projecting that Activision Blizzard will post total Activision-brand revenues of $1.351 billion, which would represent growth of about 17.4% from the year-ago period. Activision is the business segment that published the new Call of Duty game, so investors will be hoping for a strong quarter on the back of a decent opening for the popular franchise’s latest iteration.Finally, Activision Blizzard will hope to display strength in its Digital channel. The vast majority of gamers are buying their games online these days, especially considering the rise of PC gaming and the explosion of digital game sales on consoles.Based on our current consensus estimates, we expect Activision to report total Digital revenues of $1.451 billion, accounting for nearly 55.6% of total revenues.Make sure to check back here for our full analysis once Activision Blizzard reports tomorrow!Want more analysis from this author?

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ATVI in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ATVI, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +4.99% heading into earnings season.Activision Blizzard, Inc Price Activision Blizzard, Inc Price | Activision Blizzard, Inc Quote Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

47,ATVI,"Web.com Group Inc. (WEB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8.Notably, the Internet services and online marketing solutions provider for small businesses delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.85% in the trailing four quarters.Last quarter, the company delivered GAAP earnings of 16 cents per share compared with 7 cents in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, Web.com reported revenues of $189.8 million, slightly better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $189 million. However, the figure declined 1.6% on a year-over-year basis.For fourth-quarter 2017, Web.com projects non-GAAP revenues between $188.5 million and $191.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $190.8 million. Web.com Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Web.com Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Web.com Group, Inc. Quote Factors to ConsiderWeb.com’s top line is likely to benefit from increasing brand awareness. During the quarter, the company launched its new website that enhances customer experience.Moreover, the company’s focus on higher-ARPU and differentiated value-added solutions are expected to drive the top line.Retail business is expected to be strong on the back of robust demand for security and e-mail products. Management noted that post the Equifax breach, security has become imperative for small businesses to have a successful online presence. Web.com’s simple-to-use security products and consultative approach is likely to boost sales of the security products.Moreover, the completion of the Yodle integration is likely to bolster Lead Stream and vertical market solution results.Additionally, strong demand for real estate solution TORCHx is expected to drive conversion and retention rate, which will eventually boost total revenues. The company’s strategic partnerships with RE/MAX (one of the largest real estate brokerage franchisors) and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices are expected to boost TORCHx’s adoption rate.We also expect robust performance from Lighthouse 360 and Web Brand Networks (WBN) to drive quarterly results.Notably, Web.com has been undertaking strategic acquisitions to boost operations. The company’s acquisition of Donweb.com last year and Scoot in 2014 will continue to accelerate overseas expansion.However, an increasingly competitive business environment is a major concern. Moreover, declining subscriber base is a headwind. Web.com stated that overall retention rate may decline due to the increased mix shift towards value-added services subscribers who inherently have a higher churn rate than low-cost domain customers.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.

51,ATVI,"Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 200.00%. Moreover, it has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 100.36% in the trailing four quarters.However, the mobile game maker posted revenues of $86 million in the last reported quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81 million.For fourth-quarter 2017, Glu Mobile expects bookings to be in the range of $75–$77 million.We note that the company’s shares have gained 40.3% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s 49.8% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderGlu Mobile’s roster of games, especially evergreen titles, is one of its biggest positives.In the last reported quarter, Glu’s significant bookings performance was driven by the remarkable growth of its social interactive interior design game, Design Home. The company is optimistic about the opportunities that Design Home and Covet Fashion offer in the genres of home and fashion.Apart from that, MLB Tap Sports Baseball '17 and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood were a big contributor to revenues. Notably, the company’s Tap Sports Baseball generated $40 million in bookings in the third quarter, up 55% year over year. Bookings from Kim Kardashian: Hollywood increased 6% sequentially.However, due to end of the MBL season, management anticipates TAP Sports Baseball to decline at an increasing rate in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, as observed in the prior years as well. Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is also not faring well when compared on a year-over-year basis.Unfortunately, Glu’s other celebrity titles like Cooking Dash and Restaurant Dash: Gordon Ramsay is also losing popularity.Therefore, the company’s latest shift toward developing a social networking app called The Swift Life for popular pop star Taylor Swift is prudent in our view. The app launched in December will enable the company to gain the support of the wide fan base of the singer. However, we don’t expect a significant contribution from it in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, rising competition from established players like Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) remains a concern. Furthermore, we anticipate significant investment in the research and development of new game titles to be a potential headwind for the company and put pressure on margins.Glu Mobile Inc.

52,ATVI,"VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8.We note that the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 4%.Last quarter, VeriSign’s earnings of $1 per share outpaced the consensus mark by a couple of cents. The bottom line increased 7.2% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues increased 1.7% year over year to $292.4 million, which was slightly ahead of the consensus estimate. The improvement was driven by increase in the domain name registration in the global market.For fourth-quarter 2017, VeriSign expects revenues between $1.161 billion and $1.166 billion.Factors to ConsiderVeriSign holds a dominant position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. In fact, the company is an exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Additionally, it experienced a combined growth of 1.2% year over year to 145.8 million in domain name registrations for .com and .net. Notably, there were 8.9 million new registrations for .com and .net, gained 7.2% compared with 8.3 million in the year-ago-quarter. Per VeriSign, .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).VeriSign’s “The Domain Name Industry Brief” stated that domain name registration declined slightly 0.4% sequentially to approximately 330.7 million across top-level domains (TLDs) at the end of the third quarter. However, the same increased 3.7 million or 1.1% year over year.Additionally, Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs) increased 3.2% year over year and 0.3% sequentially to 144.7 million in the third quarter.Meanwhile, the company is benefiting from strong gTLD prospects. Markedly, new gTLDs (ngTLD) represent 6.4% of total domain name registrations. Further, gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties are likely to boost results.Improving trade in bitcoin and cryptocurrency sectors is also a favorable contributing factor for rising domain name registrations.For 2017, VeriSign has revised the guidance for its domain name base growth rate. Per the company’s prediction, the metric is expected to grow in the range of 2.8% to 3.1%, up from its earlier forecast of 2% to 2.75%. The domain name registration is likely to increase within a range of 0.4 million to 0.9 million in the to-be-reported quarter.VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  VeriSign, Inc.

53,ATVI,"News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether the company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, this diversified media conglomerate outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 88.2%.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions to get a clear view of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable in the last 30 days and is currently pegged at 19 cents, flat year over year. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenue of $2,133 million, up from $2,116 million in the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing Q2News Corporation is diversifying its revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement. The company is expanding its digital offerings, emphasizing on real estate businesses and augmenting digital subscriber base. Further, it has been concentrating on cost cutting.However, advertising, which forms a major part of total revenues, continues to be highly vulnerable to the economic conditions. Advertising revenues in the News and Information Services segment remained flat during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This is because contributions from the buyouts of Australian Regional Media and Wireless Group, favorable foreign currency fluctuations and modest rise in digital advertising revenues were offset by sluggishness in the print advertising market and lower free standing insert revenues at News America Marketing.Previously, management had highlighted that FOX SPORTS Australia is likely to struggle against higher costs during the second quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year.Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues from News and Information Services division to decline marginally by 1%. However, revenues in Cable Network Programming and Digital Real Estate Services segments are expected to increase 10.6% and 13.6%, respectively. Book Publishing division is expected to register revenue growth of 1.5%.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that News Corporation is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

54,ATVI,"The New York Times Company (NYT  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. In the trailing four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 49.2%. In the preceding quarter, this diversified media conglomerate delivered a positive earnings surprise of 44.4%. Therefore, investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the company surpasses earnings estimate even this time.Analysts polled by Zacks expect fourth-quarter revenues to be $467 million, up more than 6% from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the bottom line is anticipated to remain flat year over year. Being stable in the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at 30 cents.Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Strategic Endeavors on TrackThe New York Times Company has been realigning cost structure and streamlining operations to increase efficiencies. It has offloaded assets that bear no direct relation with the core operations in order to concentrate on online activities. The company is fast acclimatizing to the changing face of the multiplatform media universe, and has already included mobile and reader application products in its portfolio.Furthermore, the company is concentrating on online activities as evident from its pay-and-read model. Notably, its pricing system for NYTimes.com was launched on Mar 28, 2011. The company notified that the number of paid digital subscribers reached 2,487,000 at the end of the third quarter of 2017 — rising 154,000 sequentially and 59.1% year over year.Apart from gearing up to become an optimum destination for news and information, The New York Times Company is now focusing on service journalism with verticals like Cooking, Watching and Well. In this regard, it acquired The Wirecutter and its sister site — The Sweethome — that recommends people about technology gear, home products and other consumer services.Ad Revenue a ConcernThe U.S. newspaper publishing industry has been grappling with sinking advertising revenues. This downturn in the industry witnessed in the last few years aggravated with a fall in print readership as readers started opting for online news. Consequently, the print-advertising model became increasingly redundant.The New York Times Company’s print advertising revenues fell 20.1% in the third quarter of 2017, following a decline of 10.5% in the preceding quarter. Total advertising revenues decreased 9% during the quarter under review. The company had earlier hinted that total advertising revenues in the final quarter are likely to decline in the high-single digits.New York Times Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  New York Times Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | New York Times Company (The) QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model shows that The New York Times Company is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

55,ATVI,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 financial numbers, before the opening bell on Feb 8. In the previous quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 40%.The company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters by an average of 7.4%. Here’s a discussion of the determinants of the fourth-quarter results.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether World Wrestling Entertainment will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 20 cents, in comparison with year-ago quarter earnings of 10 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by a penny over the past 7 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $206 million compared with $194.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterHaving garnered stellar revenues in 2017, WWE has become investors’ favorite now. In the first, second and third quarter of 2017, the company registered top-line growth of 10%, 8% and 13.5%, respectively. We believe WWE will continue to garner record revenues as it has not only extended its earlier deal but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program — Raw and SmackDown — in different countries. Further, subscriber growth and worldwide increase in TV rights fees are likely to provide an impetus to the top line further.Revenues from international sponsorship, which increased 29% in the first nine months of 2017, will receive an additional stimulus from WWE’s agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports. We believe with increasing subscription-based video streaming services, WWE Network, through its vast presence in more than180 countries, will be able to capitalize on the trend.Moreover, management is optimistic about achieving another great year of adjusted OIBDA growth. For the fourth quarter, adjusted OBIDA is projected in the range of $31-$35 million buoyed by top-line growth, WWE Network subscribers and contractual television rights fees.However, WWE which distributes home entertainment content in both physical (DVD and Blu-Ray) as well as digital formats has been reeling under lower revenues. In 2016, home entertainment net revenues came in at $13.1 million in comparison with $13.4 million and $27.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Further, the trend continued in the first, second and third quarter of 2017, with home entertainment revenues declining 27%, 3.2% and 8%, respectively. The decline can be attributed to consumers’ consistent shift to digital formats, downloaded or streamed over the Internet. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

58,ATVI,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report), which has agreed to sell some of its properties to The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 7. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%.Notably, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.2% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Twenty-First Century Fox will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is currently pegged at 41 cents, which reflects a year-over-year decline of nearly 22.6%. We note that the rate of decline is likely to accelerate from 3.9% witnessed in the preceding quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $7,968 million compared with $7,682 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterThe company’s Cable Network Programming segment, which impressed investors in fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 owing to rising affiliate fees, is likely to witness robust performance in 2018 too. Management expects domestic affiliate fee to increase at least in high single-digit in all the quarters of fiscal 2018. Affiliate fees are a dominant source of revenues for the Cable Network segment and a major contributor to total revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from affiliate fees is currently pegged at $3,179, up 9.4% year over year. Moreover, advertising revenues are also likely to increase 1.9% to $2,593 from the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues from Cable Network Programming segment to increase 9.2% to $4,331 million. However, growth in Cable Network Programming is likely to be partially offset by weakness in Television and Film Entertainment segments, which are expected to report revenues of $1,876 million and $2,266 million, down 0.1% and 2.2%, respectively.However, increase in cost at Cable Network Programming has been worrying investors. In fiscal 2017, it increased 7% to $16,130 million. Expenses at Cable Network Programming segment increased 11% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 attributable to rise in global sports programming costs on account of the inaugural broadcasts of Big Ten college football at FS1 and Argentine Football Association matches at Fox Networks Group International (FNG International) as well as contractual rights increases for Major League Baseball at the domestic sports channels and higher CONMEBOL soccer rights at FNG International. We believe that an increase in expenses due to higher sports programming costs may hurt the company’s margins and affect its bottom line in the coming quarters.Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

59,ATVI,"Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF.A  -  Free Report), producer and distributor of motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video release, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8, after the closing bell. Over the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 75.5%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing the QuarterLions Gate’s strategic acquisitions and alliances to enhance its competitive position and maximize returns, along with building a diversified portfolio, bode well for the company. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the Media Networks segment formed after the acquisition of Starz reported revenue growth of 7% year over year, largely gaining from strong subscription growth at Star.  Incidentally, Starz witnessed subscription growth of 400,000 on a sequential basis, aided by Power and Outlander. Notably, the addition of Starz is aiding Lions Gate to emerge as a major player in the TV space and helping it regain lost ground in the streaming network. Moreover, the company has invested in The Immortals to capitalize on the increasing popularity of eSports. It expects the eSports market to grow more than$1 billion in 2018.However, fewer movie releases in fiscal 2018 compared with the previous year might hurt Motion Pictures revenue performance. Dismal television production performance in the past few quarters has also been a concern for investors. In the fiscal second quarter, Television Production revenues declined 4.7%, following a fall of 18.6% in the preceding quarter. Further, the escalating cost of motion picture production and marketing in recent years may jeopardize Lions Gate’s margins.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lions Gate is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Lions Gate has an Earnings ESP of -4.19% as the Most Accurate estimate is at 20 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 21 cents.

The company’s earnings have beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 675%.In the last quarter, the company reported earnings of 9 cents per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a penny. Revenues increased 19% year over year to $222.4 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $221 million.For fourth-quarter 2017, total revenues are expected between $211 million and $216 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA is projected between $39 million and $42 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Yelp Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Yelp Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Yelp Inc. Quote Key FactorsYelp is benefiting from the growing total addressable market (TAM), expanding mobile reach, high quality content and improving user engagement. We believe that growth in cumulative reviews — up 23% year over year to 142 million in the third quarter — reflects expanding local content, which is a significant driver.Additionally, accelerating consumer traffic across app and mobile is a positive.  Last quarter, app unique devices rose 21% year over year to almost 30 million.Moreover, the partnership with GrubHub (GRUB  -  Free Report) is a key catalyst. The collaboration increases the number of delivery and takeout restaurants available for food ordering on the platform.This is likely to boost user base, which will drive advertising and transaction revenues for the platform. Moreover, management expects the partnership to improve Yelp's per-order profitability. In the last quarter, paying advertising accounts improved 18% year over year to almost 155,000.Further, acquisitions of Nowait and Turnstyle present significant growth opportunity. The takeovers boost Yelp’s connection with business owners. Notably, consumer-friendly services like reservations, waitlist and Wi-Fi marketing along with Yelp transaction platform, cash back and Request a Quote is likely to drive subscriptions in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

We note that increasing digital revenues and strength in franchises are primarily responsible for this strong growth.For the third quarter, the company expects net bookings to be in the band of $610–$660 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $673 million.Notably, shares of Take Two have gained 124.5% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 49.8% rally. Factors at PlayTake Two’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises. The company expects continued strength in games like Grand Theft Auto (GTA) V, GTA Online, NBA 2K17& 2K18, Monster Legends and XCOM 2 to continue to fuel top-line growth.In the third-quarter of fiscal 2018, which includes the important holiday season, Take Two released a number of new games.In October, the much awaited WWE 2K18 was launched on PS4 and Xbox One, which garnered positive reviews.In November, it launched new versions of L.A. Noire, the highly popular detective thriller game, on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In December, the company also launched a rebuilt version for virtual reality and named it L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files for HTC Vive.The quarter will also include the full sale of NBA 2K18 that was released on Sep 15, 2017. The Dec 12 launch of GTA Online: The Doomsday Heist is also noteworthy.In fact, increased sales of the digital version of the games are adding to the company’s margins. Take-Two continues to expect growth in digital revenues driven by higher sales of full-game downloads and increase in recurrent consumer spending.The company forayed into free-to-play games space with the acquisition of game developer, Social Point. The buyout is likely to boost its performance. Management expects Social Point to contribute 5% of total revenues in the current fiscal.However, rising competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Zynga  remains a headwind.  Also, increase in operating expenses due to higher acquisition costs as well as higher R&D expenses remain an overhang on the bottom line.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

62,ATVI,"Stocks are down on Friday morning amid a mixed jobs report and varied earnings results from top tech companies like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report). Nevertheless, earnings season has been strong across the board, and as Wall Street heads toward the last wave of Q4 reports, many market-moving companies are slated to announce their latest results soon.After a remarkable 2017, the pressure was on the technology sector to deliver a solid Q4 report season and set the tone for another strong year. So far this season, 73% of the 553 already-reported companies in our “Computers and Technology” group have met or surpassed earnings estimates, so in many ways, the sector has done just that.But several major tech companies have yet to report, and the upcoming week promises to be another busy stretch. Luckily, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest technology reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of February 5.1.       Tesla Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report)Electric car giant Tesla is scheduled to release its latest quarterly results after the market closes on Feb. 7. While not technically a “technology” company, tech investors will want to pay close attention to this report given the company’s ability to serve as a bellwether for emerging trends. Shares of Tesla have moved about 11% higher over the past month, but the stock is sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Based on our consensus estimates, we expect Tesla to report a loss of $3.19 per share, down more than 360% more the loss of $0.69 per share it witnessed last year. Revenues are expected to come in at $3.30 billion, up about 44% year-over-year. Tesla said it delivered 29,870 vehicles, which fell short of expectations. The company also recently pushed back production targets for the Model 3. 2.       Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report)Graphics chip behemoth Nvidia is slated to release its latest earnings report on Feb. 8. Nvidia has been on fire for well over a year, including another 12% surge over the past month. The stock has emerged as a favorite pick for exposure to AI, self-driving tech, and gaming. NVDA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as we head into its report date.According to our current consensus estimates, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $1.16 per share and revenues of $2.66 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 17% and 22%, respectively. Gaming-focused GPUs continue to be the company’s bread and butter, but investors should look to see if Nvidia can extend its streak of remarkable growth in its datacenters unit. 3.       Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report)Video game publishing company Activision Blizzard is scheduled to release its most recent quarterly results on Feb. 8. Shares of ATVI have gained more than 13% over the past four weeks, and the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

63,ATVI,"With media giant, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 6, investors are hoping for change in fortune after a disappointing 2017. In fiscal 2017, the company not only witnessed decline in both the top and bottom lines but also witnessed sharp fall in the operating income. Let’s find out how the company is going to fare in the quarter to be reported.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Disney will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 is currently pegged at $1.60. We observed that the consensus estimate has increased by a penny in the past 30 days, which reflects a year-over-year increase of nearly 3.2%. This ushers some confidence in the stock that had witnessed an earnings decline of 3% in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues of $15,196 million, up 2.8% from the year-ago period.Unleashing the Key SegmentsMedia Networks Likely to GainAfter witnessing a decline of 3% in the preceding quarter, the segment is likely to register a year-over-year improvement of 1.8% to $6,346 million, per analysts surveyed by Zacks, driven by gain in revenues at Cable Networks. Meanwhile, per analysts polled by Zacks, Cable Networks and Broadcasting are anticipated to report revenues of $4,531 million and $1,813 million up 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively.Falling subscriber base and higher programming costs at ESPN remain major concerns. Fresh NBA agreement and increase in contractual rate for NFL programming has been driving the overall programming cost higher for ESPN.Disney is striving to bring back ESPN’s golden days. However, it will take some time before the segment makes a strong come back. In an effort to attract online viewers, the company has inked a deal with video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech. Moreover, the company will start online streaming services for ESPN sports in early 2018 and its branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 will carry Disney movies as well as TV shows. The ESPN-branded multi-sport streaming service will give an option to enjoy 10,000 live international, national and regional games every year. Tournaments like Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis, and college sports will be live streamed.Parks & Resorts Continues to Attract VisitorsDisney’s Parks & Resorts division, which have done exceptionally well in fiscal 2017, is likely to sustain the momentum in first-quarter fiscal 2018. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the segment reported revenue increase of 6% following gains of 12%, 9% and 6% in the third, second and first quarter, respectively. The consensus mark for revenues from the segment for the first-quarter is pegged at $4,866 million, up 6.8% year over year. Disney is focused on deploying its capital toward expansion of the Parks and Resorts business, consequently increasing market share and creating long-term growth opportunities.Star Wars: The Last Jedi to Lift Studio SegmentDisney’s Studio segment, which impressed investors with blockbuster hits in 2016, has somewhat disappointed in 2017 as the year has been dull for the movie industry. However, the company’s latest flick, Star Wars: The Last Jedi has performed well at the box office. Moreover, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco were also released during the quarter and did solid business at the box office. So far, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco have garnered above $1.3 billion, $850 million and $680 million, respectively. Analyst polled by Zacks expects Studio segment revenues of $2,767 million, down 9.8% year over year.Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Disney is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

64,ATVI,"Time Warner Inc. , which accepted the buyout offer of AT&T, Inc., is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 1. In the trailing four quarters, this media and entertainment company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.8%. In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.2%.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Time Warner surpasses earnings estimate even this time. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors likely to impact the results.How are Estimates Shaping Up?After registering a marginal gain of 0.5% in the bottom line, Time Warner is likely to witness a sharp increase in year-over-year earnings in the fourth quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.45 up from $1.25 reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable over the past 30 days.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,460 million, up 7.2% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the rate of growth is likely to accelerate from 2.7% recorded in the preceding quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterWe believe that Time Warner’s foray into new markets, focus on original programming, cost reduction and increasing investments in key areas bode well. Additionally, the company has been expanding digital presence to enable consumers to access content from several platforms and devices. Its investments in video content and technology continue to drive results. All these initiatives are likely to be reflected in the quarter to be reported.However, management expects Home Box Office (“HBO”) programming cost to increase at a higher rate in the final quarter due to the timing of original programming and availability of acquired content. Further, management hinted that operating income at Warner Bros. is likely to decline in the final quarter of 2017 due to the number and mix of theatrical home entertainment releases, including the comparison with the release of Suicide Squad in the year-ago period. It will also be affected by rise in costs related to the mix of theatrical releases and television series production. Decline in overall advertising spending and currency headwinds may also impact the performance.Time Warner's expects HBO subscription revenue growth rate to rise in final-quarter 2017 relative to the quarter under review. Although programming cost is projected to increase at a higher rate, growth in revenue will suffice to offset the same. Consequently, the company anticipates operating income growth during the fourth quarter.Time Warner Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Time Warner Inc.

QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Time Warner is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Time Warner has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and a Zacks Rank #3.

66,ATVI,"Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter 2018 results on Jan 30.The company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 24.78%.Last quarter, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 66 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. Net bookings, which matched the consensus mark, came in at $1.18 billion, up 7.4% year over year.However, Electronic Arts’ outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which includes the important holiday season, is lower than expected. For the quarter, the company expects net bookings to be $2 billion whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.03 billion. Electronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Electronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Electronic Arts Inc. Quote Factors at PlayEA’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which has been the key growth driver for the company. EA SPORTS titles, along with Battlefield, Titanfall and Star Wars are some of its biggest franchises.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, Electronic Arts released the highly-awaited Star Wars Battlefront II game, Need for Speed Payback and The Sims 4 (Console). The quarter will also include the sale of FIFA 18 that was released on Sep 29, 2017. FIFA remains one of the most popular titles among gamers.Apart from popular titles, it is the shift to digital that has proved to be a major growth driver for Electronic Arts. Digital sales now contribute to the majority of revenues. Additionally, the live services component (includes revenues from extra content and subscriptions, advertising, and others) of EA games has also emerged as a big growth driver.However, the launch of Battlefront 2 was a disappointment for the company. The game did not receive very positive reviews. The outrage over the exorbitant pricing of in-games purchases compelled EA to temporarily turn off all micro transactions in the game, apparently.The controversy regarding Battlefront 2 has been a dampener and thus sales are anticipated to be lower than its predecessor, which recorded tremendous success in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  The underperformance of The Sims 4 will also remain an overhang on results.In the quarter, the company also completed the acquisition of Titanfall maker, Respawn Entertainment in a cash and stock deal worth $315 million.Rise in operating expenses, mainly due to higher investments in games and live services will weigh on the bottom line.  Stiff competition from other game makers like Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.

68,ATVI,"Shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) surged to a new all-time high on Thursday after the video gaming powerhouse debuted its new “Overwatch” esports league to much fanfare on Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) live-streaming site Twitch on Wednesday night.The inaugural matches of the regular season of the 12-team Overwatch league kicked off yesterday. Fans were able to take in the three-match slate on Twitch, Major League Gaming platforms, as well as OverwatchLeague.com and its new app.Overwatch team owners reportedly paid $20 million to purchase franchises. Ownership groups include Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, along with other owners of mainstream U.S. professional sports franchises (also read: Esports is The Next Billion Dollar Industry: 3 Stocks to Watch).Esports have been on the rise for the last few years, but Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch league is one of the first major tests of a model similar to that of other professional sports. In the first season, the league features 12 city-based teams split into two divisions.Teams from Los Angeles, Dallas, London, Shanghai, Seoul, and other major metropolitan areas are set to compete in the six-month regular season that runs from Jan. 10 until June 16. A postseason and an all-star weekend are also scheduled.Game days currently feature three different head-to-head matchups a night. Teams are set to play twice a week during a slate of games that run Wednesday through Saturday nights.The Overwatch league’s long and packed schedule, with an array of different viewing options for fans, should give Activision Blizzard the chance to cash in from advertisers. Wednesday night’s slate has already been viewed a total of 4.4 million times on Twitch.If you missed any of the #OWL2018 matches today, we're rebroadcasting right now at https://t.co/U6dIipgQGs pic.twitter.com/VfwBTUbCqD— Overwatch League (@overwatchleague) January 11, 2018Activision Blizzard, along with the likes of Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report)—which is set to tip off its NBA franchise-backed NBA 2K esports league later this year—hope that these more polished products, which feature official teams in uniforms with fans in attendance and multiple broadcasts in different languages, will attract the average sports fan.Yet, even if just esports fans and video game players tune in, the Overwatch league could easily be a hit. According to market research firm Newzoo, the average esports fan is between 21 and 35, which is a highly sought after advertising democratic—and much younger than the NFL and MLB’s audience on average. On top of that, the firm projected that around 191 million people around the world would watch at least one esports competition a month in 2017.Activision Blizzard stock surged over 3% to reach a new all-time high of nearly $69 per share on Thursday, as investors seem pleased with the prospect of a potentially massively popular world-wide esports league.

69,ATVI,"The global video game market is bigger than ever, as esports take off and mobile gaming continues to grow. Yet, even as Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI  -  Free Report) new “Overwatch” league launches on Wednesday, historic gaming giant Nintendo (NTDOY  -  Free Report) looks poised to thrive in the new age of video games.Near the end of November, market research firm Newzoo revised its initial global video game revenue projections to $116 billion, which marked a $7.1 billion jump and a 10.7% year-over-year increase. And in just the last 10 months alone, Nintendo has grabbed a decent chunk of that video gaming pie.The Japanese gaming power announced that as of December 10, worldwide sales of its Switch console surpassed 10 million units. Nintendo’s newest gaming console, which launched in March and retails for $299.99, recently became the fastest-selling console ever in the U.S.Looking forward, Nintendo reportedly expects to sell 20 million Switch devices in its next fiscal year. On top of the Super Mario maker’s widely popular new console, the company is also cashing in with a range of classic titles, including a new Pokémon game scheduled for 2018.The Fundamentals Shares of Nintendo climbed nearly 3% on Wednesday as part of what has been a strong run for the company over the last year. Before Wednesday’s gains, the legendary Japanese video game maker had seen its stock price skyrocket 77.74% over the last 52-weeks.Yet, investors will likely be happy to note that Nintendo’s stock price sits 8.5% below its 52-week high water mark. This should give the stock room to grow without the added burden of having to break through a new threshold.However, looking ahead, Nintendo’s stock could theoretically soar past its current year long high if it closes in on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company is projected to see its current quarter sales soar 138% to reach $3.81 billion.Looking further down the road to Nintendo’s current full fiscal year—which ends in March—the company’s earnings are projected to reach $1.23 per share. This would mark a 232.43% year-over-year jump. What’s more, Nintendo’s full-year revenues are projected to surge 112% to hit $9.51 billion, based on Zacks Consensus Estimates.Nintendo’s current cash flow growth rate of 92.06% also blows away the “Toys – Games – Hobbies” industry’s 10% average, and crushes competitors such as Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report). This should help the company invest in the future.What’s more, the company has received one positive earnings estimate revision for its current fiscal year within the last 60 days. In that same time frame, Nintendo also received one positive revision for the following year. Nintendo is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

71,ATVI,"Shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) were up more than 4.5% in morning trading Tuesday as analysts praised the video streaming company’s original content strategy and reignited rumors that the brand could be a candidate for a takeover by Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report).“Netflix is miles ahead in terms of programming hours, original content quality and time spent, and we don't expect this to change. Netflix has won,” wrote Macquarie Research Tim Nollen on Tuesday.Macquarie raised its rating for the stock to outperform from neutral and increased its price target to $220 from $200. The firm’s updated call would represent a 15% climb from Friday’s closing price. Nollen also mentioned that he expects Netflix to reach 60% original content by 2020, saving the company $2 billion in licensing fees.“Netflix has changed the way people watch TV, and is now pushing further into film. Consumers' increasing lack of tolerance for advertising drives them to subscription OTT services,” the analyst said.Meanwhile, analysts from Citigroup stoked rumors that Netflix could find itself in the crosshairs of Apple soon. In a note to clients, Citi’s Jim Suva and Asiya Merchant wrote that the Cupertino-based tech behemoth is gearing up to make a major acquisition of a car company, video game company, or entertainment company—and Netflix is apparently the most likely target right now.Citing the passage of the GOP’s tax reform bill, which includes a one-time allowance for companies to repatriate overseas cash, the analysts said that Apple will finally put its $252 billion cash pile to use. According to their note, there is a 40% likelihood of Apple acquiring Netflix. Other potential targets include Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report).“The firm has too much cash – nearly $250 billion – growing at $50 billion a year. This is a good problem to have,” wrote Suva and Merchant. “With over 90% of its cash sitting overseas, a one-time 10% repatriation tax would give Apple $220 billion for M&A or buybacks.”Want more stock market analysis from this author?

72,ATVI,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in MAT.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen four estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from earnings of 5 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 16 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Mattel has seen four downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 22 cents a share from 41 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 15% in the past month.Mattel, Inc.

In fact, in these reports, ATVI has beaten estimates by at least 20% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago, ATVI expected to post earnings of 30 cents per share, while it actually produced earnings of 55 cents per share, a beat of 83.3%.

77,ATVI,"Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google has come up with another India-oriented feature on Google Maps.Unveiled yesterday at Google for India in New Delhi and known as the “two-wheeler mode”, the feature shows two-wheeler optimized navigation routes.India is the first country to get this update and Google plans to roll it out in other countries with big two-wheeler riding population going forward. The feature is available with the latest version 9.67.1 of Google Maps for Android. iOS is yet to get the update.We observe that Alphabet shares have rallied 28.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 20.9% gain.Shortcuts and Narrow RoadsThe new feature shows shortcuts and narrow roads that are otherwise inaccessible by heavy vehicles. It also provides traffic update, parking situation and estimated time of arrival (ETA) that is expected to be lesser than that of a car.The new feature will surely help two-wheeler owners who always seek to take more advantage of the small size of the vehicles they ride through shortcuts and narrow roads. They will be able to avoid congestion and save time and fuel.The feature will be available with other options like Walk, Drive, Train and Cab.Strategy to Boost Ad RevenuesGiven the fact that India is the largest two-wheeler market in the world, a move like this makes a lot of sense. Google is expected to gain more in terms of ad revenues from this new update.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Alphabet Inc. QuoteNotably, businesses pay for their ads on Google’s search engine, map, video and email platforms through Google AdWords. The company also earns revenues from sales of enhanced and customizable mapping program, Google Maps API that features improved search and request capacity, higher-resolution imaging and advertising control, and includes 24-hour technical support.Fetching Data for Driverless CarWe believe that by adding more features to Google Maps, Alphabet is trying to use it more as a data trove. The company is well poised to use this huge amount of data to improve its driverless technology.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAlphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

78,ATVI,"Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube announced on Monday that it is planning tougher initiatives to free its platform from harsh, violent and disturbing videos and comments.Google has been revamping its policies since the YouTube ad controversy surfaced in March. The issue that primarily centered on the U.K., went global in no time, with over 250 brands suspending their advertising on YouTube. The list included big names from private as well as public sectors including Transport for London, The FCA, HSBC, Toyota, McDonald’s, Heinz, The Guardian, Channel 4, L'Oreal, Marks & Spencer, Hargreaves Lansdown and Sainsbury’s.We observe that Alphabet shares have rallied 27.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 21.8% gain.Increasing ManpowerYouTube will deploy more human resource toward identifying unsuitable content and expects the number of employees working on this to cross 10,000 in 2018. YouTube is also collaborating with industry groups, academics and subject matter specialists to gain better insight into emerging issues.The company stated that since June, the trust and safety teams have manually reviewed nearly 2 million videos for inappropriate content, aiding its machine-learning technology to find similar videos. Teams are collaborating with various child safety organizations across the world to report unacceptable activities and accounts to law enforcement bodies.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Alphabet Inc. QuoteUsing Machine LearningGoogle has been deploying machine learning to flag inappropriate contents for quite some time now and is expanding this capacity to other challenging areas of content.YouTube has an automated software that detects problematic videos and is expanding its reach to those videos that contain hate speech or are against child safety.Stricter Criteria, Regular ReportsThe company plans to implement stringent standards, increase manual curation and significantly expand ad review teams to safeguard advertisers and creators from unsuitable content.The company is planning to produce regular reports containing information about the flags it receives and the steps taken to remove policy violating videos and comments.Our TakeSteps like these make sense as advertisements are extremely important to Alphabet from a business standpoint. We believe that regular policy updates will help Google not only address the growing controversy about misinformation on the web but also put up a clean image to advertisers.There are only two really big digital ad-serving platforms, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and YouTube. The platforms draw large number of users and it’s advantageous for brands to have a presence on both.So, while YouTube can’t take too hard a stand when negotiating with brands, it may also avoid getting pushed into a corner; more so because it can also point to Google Preferred to access the top 5% content on YouTube (at a premium of course). The bottom line impact will also likely be insignificant because Google is already investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance its algorithms and search results.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAlphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

79,ATVI,"Investors who have grown used to the technology sector’s strong rally this year have been rocked over the past few trading periods, as stocks throughout the tech world have struggled—despite progress being made on the GOP’s long-awaited tax bill.Before the current tech selloff began last week, our “Computers and Technology” sector was up over 30% on the year, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was resting near its all-time high. Several innovative tech firms are among Wall Street’s hottest stocks of 2017, while established industry behemoths—including Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report)—have outpaced the market.But it appears that this rally has finally started to see some volatility. Over the last week, tech stocks across the board have slumped, leading many investors to wonder whether the sector is in store for another bubble burst—similar to that of the dot-com era in the early 2000s.Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons to remains optimistic about tech stocks right now. Unlike during the dot-com rally, today’s sector is supported by real earnings and revenue growth. In fact, stocks in our Computers and Technology group are currently sporting an average P/E ratio of 24.13, while it was not uncommon for the Nasdaq’s average P/E to sit in the hundreds at the turn of the century.And after another strong earnings report season—which not only continued the high-growth trend, but also included positive guidance for 2018—we have no real reason to believe that the fundamental picture surrounding the tech sector has changed.For investors with this continued bullish mindset, the recent tech selloff would be considered an opportunity to buy stocks at a discount. With that said, if you hold that belief, check out these three tech stocks to buy now:1.       Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report)Alongside the expansion of the semiconductor industry, we have seen the suppliers of equipment to the chipmakers—such as Lam Research—really explode this year. But LRCX has also been hammered by the current selloff, and shares of the company have lost nearly 15% in five days.Still, Lam Research remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The stock also sports an “A” grade in the overall VGM category of our Style Scores system. The company is expected to witness EPS growth of 64% and sales growth of 36% this quarter, and its Forward P/E sits at just 12.74. 2.       Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report)Video game makers have been among the hardest hit by the tech selloff, and shares of industry giant Activision Blizzard have lost nearly 11.5% over the past five trading days. But ATVI has emerged as an impressive growth stock this year and should stay that way in 2018, meaning that this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock could be on sale right now.Based on our latest consensus estimates, Activision is expected to post earnings growth of 15% and revenue growth of 6% next year. What’s more, the company has met or surpassed estimates in seven straight quarters. ATVI is also growing its cash flow at a rate of 90% right now, so it is clear that management is using its success to sure up its financial position. 3.       Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report)It has been a massive year for GPU behemoth Nvidia, but the company’s remarkable rally has meant that its stock has been hit hard by the tech selloff. In fact, NVDA has slumped more than 13% over the past five days.However, Nvidia remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Next year, the company’s growth is expected to continue, with current projections calling for earnings to expand by an additional 11% and sales growing a further 16%. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

80,ATVI,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) stated last Friday that it has found proof of data breach at its newly acquired company, TIO Networks. The breach might have led to theft of personally identifiable information of about 1.6 million TIO customers and customers of TIO billers.PayPal has been investigating the issue and suspended TIO operations on Nov 10 as part of this investigation. The company confirmed that the breach didn’t disturb its own platform since TIO systems operate separately.The investigation has revealed unauthorized access, which led PayPal to safeguard impacted customers. As part of this effort, TIO is working with its patron companies to alert potentially affected individuals.Also, PayPal is making arrangements for provision of free credit monitoring memberships in collaboration with a consumer credit reporting agency.  The company will directly contact affected individuals and give them instructions to sign up for monitoring.We observe that the company’s shares have appreciated a huge 90.8% on a year-to-date basis compared with the industry’s gain of 30.2%.A Prudent MoveA data breach announcement and subsequent steps to take care of the affected customers makes sense as PayPal would not want to suffer because of a recently acquired entity.Moreover, PayPal’s efforts to make a bigger push in the North American bill pay market and tap un-banked and under-banked customers through the acquisition may get thwarted if it fails to handle the situation.PayPal Holdings, Inc. EPS Diluted (TTM) PayPal Holdings, Inc. EPS Diluted (TTM) | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuotePayPal has been working on the broader goal of partaking into daily financial activities of customers, through strengthening its product portfolio boosting global expansion efforts. We believe that the announced measures are part of PayPal’s efforts to make sure it attains its objective.Had the breach been exposed before the acquisition, we would have seen another Yahoo-Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) case. Verizon made Yahoo sign a revised deal, cutting its price by $350 million following the disclosure of two data breaches by the latter. In this case, since the TIO data breach was exposed post PayPal’s acquisition, it has no such oppourtunity. Rather, it will have to shoulder the responsibility of protecting affected customers.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPayPal has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

81,ATVI,"Semtech Corporation (SMTC  -  Free Report) reported mixed fiscal third-quarter 2018 results with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same.Non-GAAP earnings of 54 cents per share beat the consensus mark by 5 cents and increased 12.5% sequentially and a massive 45.9% year over year. Earnings came ahead of the guided range of 48–52 cents per share.Revenues of $150 million missed the consensus mark by $3 million and decreased 1.8% sequentially. However, revenues increased 9.6% year over year. Revenues were toward the higher end of the guided range of $145.0 million to $153.0 million.Nevertheless, shares have lost 6.8% since the date of release of quarterly results due to an unimpressive guidance for the current quarter. Year to date, shares have gained 7.9%, significantly underperforming the industry’s 23.2% rally.In the reported quarter, the company saw strong demand for high-end consumer and industrial end-markets, partially offset by weakness in enterprise computing and communications markets.The company’s improved profitability was driven by differentiated growth drivers and diversification strategy. Key growth drivers for Semtech are product differentiation, operational flexibility and a specific focus on fast-growing segments and regions.The numbers in detail:Revenues by End MarketSales to high-end consumer market represented 30% of total net revenues and were up sequentially.

Enterprise computing and communications end markets witnessed weak demand and both decreased sequentially, representing 31% and 11% of total revenues, respectively.Revenues by Product Group Signal Integrity Product Group revenues contributed 41% to total revenues and were down sequentially but up 6% year over year. While the sequential decline was due to weak passive optical network (PON) and base station business resulting from demand softness in China, the year-over-year growth was driven by strength in data center business.Protection Product Group represented 32% of total revenues and was up 10% sequentially and 23% year over year. The increase was driven by smartphone strength in North America and Korea offset by softness in China’s smartphone market.Wireless and Sensing Product Group was down sequentially but up 29% year over year, contributing 20% to total revenues. The year-over-year increase was driven by strength in LoRa related business, partially offset by weakness in proximity sensing business.Power and High-Reliability Product Group contributed 8% to total revenues and increased 7% sequentially.

82,ATVI,"Per Reuters, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) has now “temporarily disabled” the option that lets advertisers exclude certain racial groups from their target audience. The move comes after ProPublica’s expose that it could buy “discriminatory” housing ads and could easily dodge the social media giant’s ad review process.Under The Fair Housing Act (1968) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (1974), it is illegal to keep out any section of the society on grounds of race, ethnicity, or sex for housing/credit. In fact, any ad that discriminates between people based on race, religion and sex is considered a felony in the United States.This is not the first time that ProPublica has been able to dodge Facebook’s review process. In September 2017, ProPublica, a non-profit organization that takes up investigative journalism in public interest, claimed that Facebook’s self-serving ad platform “enabled advertisers to direct their pitches to the news feeds of almost 2,300 people who expressed interest in the topics of “Jew hater,” “How to burn jews,” or, “History of ‘why jews ruin the world.”The outlet also claimed that it paid $30 to test if this was actually true. It paid the amount to target those groups with three promoted posts and much to its dismay, Facebook just took less than 15 minutes to approve these ads.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Facebook, Inc. QuotePost the expose, COO Sheryl Sandberg was quoted by Reuters saying, “Until we can better ensure that our tools will not be used inappropriately, we are disabling the option that permits advertisers to exclude multicultural affinity segments from the audience for their ads.”The company has reportedly also added that it is conducting a study on how advertisers are able to exclude certain racial groups (including LGBT community) and such ads will now be subjected to stringent review. The measures will be elaborated in the time to come.Facebook has been in dire straits this year regarding its ads review process. The Russian ad fiasco (related to Brexit and U.S presidential elections) caused extensive PR damage. The company testified to the U.S. Congress regarding the alleged misuse of its platform and is meeting with European regulators next week.To salvage the situation, the company has put in place monetization eligibility standards to make it clear that creators and publishers, which meet its strict guidelines, will be eligible to earn money on its platform. Repeated failure to comply with these terms will result in removal of access to the monetization features.Not just Facebook, brand safety issues plagued Google’s YouTube earlier this year. This year in March, YouTube ran into trouble with advertisers as it was revealed that some ads ran before extremist videos, prompting advertisers to withdraw their ad spots, per media reports. Consequently, Google had to tighten its ad policy to lure advertisers back.Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

83,ATVI,"Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) radically overhauled iPhone X was anticipated to be a super cycle and it seems like it is turning into one.Going a step ahead, Piper Jaffray analyst, Michael Olson in his research titled “Why AAPL Can Keep Working: 'Super Cycle' Is Now 'Super Long Cycle'' has stated that, “this could well turn into a “super long cycle” driven by the next iterations of iPhone X.He was quoted by CNBC saying, “Apple may be increasingly well positioned to experience a strong multi-year iPhone trajectory, not the short-lived 'super cycle' that was anticipated. We believe an elongated iPhone cycle in FY18, followed by a wider array of iPhone X 'offspring' in Fall-18, along with growing awareness and interest in augmented reality (fueled by developers populating app store with new use cases and, longer-term, addition of rear facing 3D sensor), will all push out the need for Apple to answer the question of 'what's next?.'""Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteCiting a threefold jump in Apple’s demand for 3D sensing components from its suppliers, Olson expects Apple to release three new editions next year with better OLED displays.Robust Black Friday SalesThe tenth anniversary edition of the iPhone is witnessing robust sales with 6 million units sold over the Black Friday weekend, per a report from Rosenblatt China Technology.  Nearly 15 million units have been sold since its launch. The firm expects as many as 3 million units to be shipped in the current quarter. Apple is also ramping up iPhone X production with 3 million units produced per week and is expected to increase it by another one million by December, per the report.Apple releases its new models in September and the December quarter usually sees high sale activity. In the year-ago period, Apple sold 45.5 million units of iPhone. This time around, reportedly, it looks like Apple is set to break all records and sell 80 million iPhone units.Sales of iPhone X will get a boost as the phone features a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED display with wireless charging (USB-C), higher storage options and a far superior camera.For the current quarter, Apple expects sales to be in the range of $84 to $87 billion compared with $78.4 billion reported in fiscal first-quarter 2017. Higher average selling price should significantly contribute to the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $85.8 billion.iPhone, Revenues and Stock PriceiPhone continues to be the mainstay of Apple’s revenues. The revolutionary phone, released in June 2007, changed the world forever and catapulted Apple to new highs. The success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled.Reportedly, Apple has sold over 1.2 billion iPhones across the globe, earning over $760 billion in revenues.Since the first iPhone release, Apple shares have skyrocketed compared with the industry to which it belongs. Over the last decade, Apple stock has returned 885.7% while the industry witnessed a rally of 418.5%.There are also speculations that robust iPhone X sales will make Apple the first company to touch the $1 trillion valuation mark. Currently, Apple’s market cap is nearly $882 billion. Its shares have increased about 48.4% year over year and hit a 52-week high of $176.24.

84,ATVI,"We have always maintained that the power of Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) loyal customer base should not be underestimated.StreetInsider has cited a recent report by Rosenblatt China Technology wherein analyst Jun Zhnag said that Apple sold 6 million units of the pricey iPhone X model over the Black Friday weekend alone. Since its launch, iPhone X has sold over 15 million units, added the report.Moreover, the demand for 256 GB iPhone X, priced at $1,150, was double that of the 64 GB model that costs $1K.

Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteApple’s radically overhauled iPhone X was anticipated to be a super cycle and it seems like it is turning into one. Apple is expected to sell a whopping 30 million iPhone X units this quarter, per Rosenblatt. However, for the March quarter, the analyst has reduced unit sale estimates by 5 million to 40 million.Apple releases its new models in September and the December quarter usually sees high sale activity. In the year-ago period, Apple sold 45.5 million units of iPhone. However, reportedly, it looks like Apple is set to witness a record breaking quarter wherein it is expected to sell 80 million iPhone units.For the current quarter, Apple expects sales to be in the range of $84 to $87 billion compared with $78.4 billion reported in fiscal first-quarter 2017. Higher average selling price should significantly contribute to this. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $85.8 billion.There are also speculations that robust iPhone X sales will make Apple the first company to touch the $1 trillion valuation mark. Currently, Apple’s market cap is nearly $870 billion. Its shares have increased about 46.3% year over year and hit a 52-week high of $176.24. Shares are currently trading at $169.48.Per a recent report by GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives, as quoted by Investor’s Business Daily, the iPhone X cycle could help Apple reach the milestone figure as early as next year.Apart from iPhone X, the analyst adds that the fast booming Services business and the rebound in China could propel Apple to new highs.

86,ATVI,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s (BABA  -  Free Report) financial arm Ant Financial has imposed a ban on consumer loans with annual interest rates above 24% from its Alipay platform, with China tightening regulations related to the Internet lending industry.We observe that Alibaba stock has gained 114.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 65% rally of the industry it belongs to.China’s government is trying to cut down problems associated with online loans such as abusive collection methods, default risks and diversion of loan funds to real estate market.Ant Financial’s move comes on the heels of People’s Bank of China and China Banking regulatory commission’s decision to impose stricter regulations on Internet micro loans that have been proliferating over the past year taking advantage of weak regulations. The government has asked provincial authorities to suspend issuance of new licenses for online consumer loan companies and stop the non-compliant ones.What’s Behind the MoveAnt Financial said in a statement,” Our inspections discovered that products recommended by a few merchants on Lifestyle have problems such as interest rates that exceed the legal limit and inappropriate collection methods.”So basically, the move appears to be part of Ant Financial’s efforts to impose better monitoring and remove inferior loan offerings from its platform. It has asked all to perform self-checks by Nov 30.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue (TTM) Alibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue (TTM) | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteNotably, China’s Supreme People’s Court ruled in 2015 that collection of loans with annual interest rate up to 24% would be enforced by the courts. Interest rates of up to 36% are legally allowed but collection would not be enforced by courts. Lenders have to find their own collection methods in case of default.That being said, the move underscores a conservative approach on Ant Financials’ part to preserve its ongoing partnerships under a situation where it is still not clear how regulators will act.We believe that increased government regulations will affect Alibaba and Ant Financial backed Chinese online lender, Qudian. This U.S. listed company offers small cash and merchandise credit products to college students and young workers.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAlibaba shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

87,ATVI,"Per Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone unit sales in 2018 could be lower than expected, given the “flat” buying intent in many countries, reports Investor’s Business Daily. However, revenues are likely to be cushioned by higher average selling price of premium iPhone models (iPhone X).Subsequently, he slashed his iPhone unit sales growth estimate to 10% from 12% projected earlier. However, he has retained the “Buy” rating on the stock.Investor’s Business Daily quoted the analyst saying, “Phone buying intent vs. a year ago for the next 12 months is flat in the U.S. and Japan and down in the U.K., China and Germany.

89,ATVI,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) faces a fresh set of allegations from German automaker Daimler AG over sale of counterfeit products in its marketplace.In a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Daimler alleged Amazon of trademark infringement and claimed that the company sells fake Mercedes-Benz wheel center caps. The lawsuit also claimed that Amazon has not taken steps to handle the infringement issue.“Amazon’s sale of the infringing products causes significant damage to Daimler,” the complaint states. “For example, sales of the infringing products decrease sales of authentic Mercedes-Benz wheel center caps, and tarnish Daimler’s reputation for quality and excellence. The infringing products are of substantially inferior quality than authentic Daimler wheel center caps.”The companies have been at loggerheads since April last year when Daimler sued Amazon in a district court and then the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) for selling fake Mercedes-Benz wheels from 10 distributors. Both the companies decided to stay the district court case until the USITC case reaches conclusion.In August this year, Daimler asked for a resumption of the lawsuit in a Washington federal court stating that the USITC case was resolved with key issues still undecided.Though there are no comments from Amazon on the current lawsuit, the company usually argues that it cannot be held responsible for infringing activities of its third-party sellers. The company claims that it has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items.We observe that Amazon shares have gained 52% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 62.9% rally.Our Take The growth of the e-commerce industry, with consumers increasingly buying things online, is a dynamic going in favor of Amazon. While big brands may build their own online stores over time, a platform like Amazon allows discovery of new buyers.Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteSmaller players are far more dependent on Amazon as they don’t have the resources to invest in technology and fulfillment to generate the kind of reach that Amazon can deliver. Amazon’s platform is currently being used by more than 2 million independent sellers.Moreover, the market is in the early growth phase (considering opportunities in international markets. So, the company’s high growth rates are likely to be sustained over the next few years.But that should not make Amazon overly confident about its online business. When brands hit by counterfeit charges lose sales and potential customers, the ripple effect will also be felt by Amazon and earn it a bad name.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

92,ATVI,"Electronic Arts Inc (EA  -  Free Report) has been in the news since the messed-up launch of its highly anticipated game, Star Wars Battlefront 2 last week.Released on Nov 17, Battlefront has received mostly okayish kind of reviews but apparently it was the outrage over the exorbitant pricing of in-games purchases that compelled EA to temporarily turn off all micro transactions in the game. EA’s shares have lost 1.1% of their value since Nov 17.EA’s move to stall in-game micro transactions has found support from The Walt Disney Company's (DIS  -  Free Report) Lucasfilm, the production company behind Star Wars. The Washington Post quoted Lucasfilm saying, “Star Wars has always been about the fans--and whether it's Battlefront or any other Star Wars experience, they come first. That's why we support EA's decision to temporarily remove in-game payments to address fan concerns.""Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Electronic Arts Inc. QuoteIn a SEC filing, EA said that the removal of in-game purchases will not impact fiscal 2018 guidance. EA also added that the in-game purchases will be available at a later date.However, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets said that the anger was exaggerated. He was quoted by CNBC saying “Gamers aren't overcharged, they're undercharged (and we're gamers). … This saga has been a perfect storm for overreaction as it involves EA, Star Wars, reddit, and certain purist gaming journalists/outlets who dislike MTX.""He further added, “If you take a step back and look at the data, an hour of video game content is still one of the cheapest forms of entertainment. Quantitative analysis shows that video game publishers are actually charging gamers at a relatively inexpensive rate, and should probably raise prices.”Electronic Arts found tremendous success with Star Wars Battlefront. Battlefront sold 14 million copies in fiscal 2016. Given this, it was widely expected that Battlefront 2 sales will also be somewhat around that mark.

94,ATVI,"Baidu, Inc. (BIDU  -  Free Report) raised the curtains on Raven series AI-powered hardware at the 2017 Baidu World yesterday. Raven H is the company’s AI-based smart home assistant that is due for a wider rollout in China in December.The device has been developed in collaboration with Swedish consumer electronics manufacturer, Teenage Engineering and is powered by Baidu’s own DuerOS platform. Danish audio systems maker, Tymphany is in charge of providing the high-end audio components.The Chinese tech giant also unveiled raven R, an automated six-axis robot and claimed that it possesses emotional intelligence. Its Raven Q is a concept AI Home Robot still under development. The company plans to implement technologies like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), voice recognition and natural language processing, and computer vision to raven Q going forward.The three launches are part of Baidu’s “All in on AI” strategy aimed at ramping up its artificial intelligence efforts. We observe that Baidu shares have rallied an impressive 45.6% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 24.6% surge.What’s New in Raven H?There’s not much information except the fact that the design is unique. It is not like other smart speakers that have that have an orthodox cylindrical structure. Baidu, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Baidu, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Baidu, Inc. QuoteRather, the palm-sized gadget looks a lot like eight colorful (red, blue, green and orange) plastic squares stacked above one another. The top-most square becomes a forward-facing LCD screen when tilted upward. It can be also detached completely and used as a touch-sensitive remote or a portable microphone.The gadget costs $256 (1699 yuan), considerably higher than competing products like Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Home, Alibaba’s (BABA  -  Free Report) Tmall Genie, JD’s Dingdong or any of the Echo variants from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).It seems that Baidu is not at all interested in price competition despite its late entry in a market that’s already has several branded smart speakers. In fact, at the moment, it’s difficult to say what’s actually the selling point or functionality that gives it an edge over rival products.That’s because, at the launch, Cheng Lyu, General Manager of Baidu’s Intelligent Hardware Unit, spent very few words on the product’s functions and spoke more on design and hardware. There is no information on international launch plans.Third-Party Contracts Coming in QuicklyThis is important when it comes to smart speakers as third-party contracts not only help penetrate potential business areas but also attract more customers.Baidu collaborated with InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG  -  Free Report) to install Raven H in 100 rooms at its Beijing Sanlitun hotel.The company also partnered with interior design platform Jia.com to offer patrons home décor solutions.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksBaidu carries a Zacks Rank 2 (Buy).

98,ATVI,"Continuing its earnings streak for the 10th straight quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) reported splendid third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein it not only marked a strong year-over-year improvement, but also way came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also beat its estimates in every aspect.This California-based graphic chip behemoth posted earnings of $1.33 per share on non-GAAP basis, up nearly 60.2% year over year. Non-GAAP earnings also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimates of 94 cents per share. The year-over year robust bottom-line performance mainly stemmed from significant revenue growth along with gross margin and operating margin expansionAided by these factors, shares of NVIDIA advanced nearly 3.2% in yesterday’s after-hours trade. Moreover, the stock has been clocking solid returns for the last one year and has soared 134.5%, outperforming the industry's gain of 63.3%.RevenuesRevenues not only surged 31.5% year over year to $2.636 billion, but also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.364 billion, as well as management’s projection of $2.35 billion (+/-2%). The year-over-year jump is primarily attributable to growth across all the platforms, that is, the GPUs gaming platform, Professional Visualization, datacenter and Tegra automotive platforms. Further, NVIDIA continued to gain strength in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, which positively impacted the quarter’s revenues.Revenues from the GPU business jumped 31% year over year to $2.22 billion, driven by strength in GeForce GPUs Gaming revenues and datacenter. Increasing demand for cryptocurrencies owing from increased adoption of Bitcoin and newer technologies like Ethereum also helped in lifting demand for GPU, consequently contributing to the company’s GPU sales growth. Moreover, Nintendo Switch which was launched in March this year, contributed to overall growth.Revenues from Gaming GPU were up 25% on a year-over-year basis to $1.56 billion. Strong growth was primarily due to demand across all regions and form factors.The company’s sustained focus on introducing fast and innovative products, as well as entering into agreements with leading PC game makers, has been driving its Gaming GPU business. During the quarter, NVIDIA announced the new high end graphic card, GeForce GTX 1070 1070 Ti. Available from Nov 2, the card was released to take down the performance of AMD’s $400 Radeon Vega 56. We believe this will take the gaming experience to a new level. Hence, the launch of this product will enable NVIDIA to increase its customer base and help in garnering additional revenues.NVIDIA’s latest collaboration with Square Enix to unveil Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition for PC in Gamescom 2017 is aimed at bringing an enhanced gaming experience to PCs. This deal is a positive for NVIDIA, as it will help the company gain market share among gaming content developers.  Moreover, during the quarter, it joined forces with Activision (ATVI  -  Free Report) to bring Destiny 2 online-game to the PC for the first time.Additionally, revenues from datacenter came in at $501 million, registering a year-over-year increase of over 2 times, mainly fueled by strong adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, high-performance computing (HPC), and strong traction of the new Volta architecture.The company’s Volta-based V100 accelerator was the most notable launch. The Volta V100 GPU provides 10 times more deep learning power to the company’s year-old predecessor, Pascal generation GPUs. During the quarter, Alibaba, Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent announced that they are adopting NVIDIA Volta GPUs in there datacenters and cloud server, joining Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report).Demand for NVIDIA’s HGX AI supercomputer also remained high as more organizations are keen on building AI-enabled applications. The company stated that Huawei, Inspur and Lenovo will be using its Volta HGX architecture to build AI systems for datacenters. During the quarter, NVIDIA launched TensorRT programmable inference acceleration platform, thereby improving the performance and reducing the cost of AI inferencing in order. Notably more than 1,200 companies are already using this inference platform, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, Hi Vision and Tencent.Tegra processor revenues came in at $419 million, which increased 74% on a year-over-year basis. The increase was primarily due to better-than-expected growth in Tegra development services.Automotive revenues for the quarter came in at $144 million, reflecting an increase of 13% year over year. The company continued with entering into new partnerships based on its DRIVE PX AI platform.The company also unveiled a new AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Pegasus at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Europe, during the quarter. This new technology, Pegasus helps to drive fully autonomous robotaxis which can handle the concept of Level 5 self-driving vehicles and uses NVIDIA’s DRIVE PX 2 platform, trained on deep neural networks. Per the company, the new system is capable of delivering 320 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of performance, which is more than 10 times as compared with its predecessor.Moving to Professional Visualization, revenues from Quadro increased 15% year over year and came in at $239 million. The increase was mainly due to elevated demand in real-time rendering tools and mobile workstations.MarginsNVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 59.7%, which is exceeded the management’s guidance range of 58.8% (+/-50 bps).In dollar terms, non-GAAP gross profit came in at $1.575 billion, reflecting an increase of 32.8% from the year-ago quarter, primarily on the back of strength in GeForce GPU gaming platform and a higher revenue baseNon-GAAP operating expenses flared up nearly 19.2% from the year-ago quarter to $570 million due to higher investment in growth areas, including Gaming, AI and self-driving cars. Non-GAAP operating expenses were in line with the company’s projection of approximately $570 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses, however, decreased to 21.6% from 23.9% witnessed in the year-ago quarter.NVIDIA’s non-GAAP operating margin was up from 35.3% to 38.1% during the reported quarter, reflecting growth in its GeForce GTX GPU business and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. In dollar terms, non-GAAP operating income jumped from $708 million to $1.005 billion.Non-GAAP net income during the quarter came in at $833 million as compared with $570 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowNVIDIA exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $6.320 billion compared with $5.877 billion in the previous quarter. NVIDIA’s total debt was $2.008 billion. Free cash flow during the quarter came in at $1.088 billion, while cash flow from operations was $1.157 billion.During the first nine months of the fiscal, the company paid a cash dividend of $250 million and repurchased shares worth $909 million. NVIDIA also announced an increase of 7% to 15 cents per share in quarterly dividend, payable on Dec 15, 2017.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, NVIDIA expects revenues of approximately $2.65 billion (+/-2%), which is much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 billion.Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be 60% (+/-50 bps). Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $600 million. Non-GAAP tax rate is likely to be 17.5% (+/-1%).For fiscal 2018, the company continues to expect returning $1.25 billion to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases.Our TakeNVIDIA posted impressive fiscal third-quarter results and provided encouraging fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance. Also, the company registered year-over-year growth on both counts, primarily due to growth across all its four platforms. Also, better-than-expected demand for its gaming chips used in PCs helped the company post encouraging results.Moreover, we believe that NVIDIA’s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned. We also believe that the higher adoption of NVIDIA’s Tegra processors could act as a catalyst, moving ahead.Meanwhile, the secular decline in the PC market has affected many chip makers. NVIDIA’s dependence on the PC market continues, and therefore is being marred by adverse conditions. The preliminary data released by Gartner depicts that PC shipments in the third quarter were down 3.6% year over year to 67 million units. This also marks the 12th straight quarter of year-over-year fall — the longest duration of decline in the history of PC industry.Gartner stated that shortage of key components, including DRAM, SSD and LCD panels, has been flaring up PC prices, in turn thwarting the overall demand. Per Gartner, DRAM shortages worsened during the third quarter when compared with the first half of 2017.Additionally, competition from the likes of Intel and QUALCOMM Inc. remains a near-term headwind.NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $4.25-$4.30, an increase of 9%-11%.However, year-over-year comparisons are expected to be unfavorable, given volatility in emerging market growth, foreign exchange risk and business concentration in China.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to deliver a positive earnings surprise:Activision Blizzard, Inc.

This will definitely drive top-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Activision Blizzard, Inc Quote Expanding Game Portfolio: Key CatalystWe believe that rapidly-growing digital revenues and continued strength in titles like Call of Duty will boost top line. Moreover, expanding franchise portfolio that includes offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm are key drivers.The acquisition of King Digital Entertainment has also worked in favor of the company.

109,ATVI,"CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, after the closing bell. In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings beat of 7.2%. Notably, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 6.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether CBS will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.10, reflecting a year-over-year increase of nearly 5% and approximately 6% sequentially. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased by a penny in the past seven days.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,295 million down from $3,396 million reported in the prior-year quarter. However, the consensus estimate portrays a sequential growth of 1.2%.Factors Influencing this QuarterFrom the above discussion, it is apparent that CBS top-line is expected to decline 3% year over year in the third quarter. We believe that this might be due to fall in revenues from advertising sales and content group.Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues from adverting to be $1,123 million, down 23.6% year-over-year. CBS remains highly vulnerable to the advertising market, as it derives a major portion of revenues from the sale of advertising on its broadcast and cable networks and television, syndicated programming, and online properties. Notably, broadcast TV is losing ground to the internet and digital media. Consequently, analysts remain concerned about the company’s broadcast TV performance, which is a major revenue and profit contributor.Nevertheless, CBS’s sustained focus on increasing subscription-based revenues is likely to drive long-term growth. In the third quarter, analyst surveyed by Zacks expects revenues from affiliate and subscription fees to increase by more than 27% year over year. Further, the company has an extensive library of premium content that it monetizes over multiple platforms. CBS crossed $1 billion mark in revenues from retransmission consent and reverse compensation in 2016, a year earlier than anticipated. In 2017, management expects retransmission and reverse compensation to increase 25% from the prior year.CBS Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  CBS Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CBS Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Says?Our proven model does not conclusively show that CBS is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CBS carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -2.12%, consequently making the surprise prediction difficult.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Activision Blizzard, Inc.

110,ATVI,"There are several factors that are expected to bolster third-quarter earnings growth for the online gaming companies. First, online gaming platforms managed to maintain a strong customer base with mobile and gaming picking pace with no indication of ceasing. Also, both augmented reality (“AR”) and virtual reality (“VR”) games are gaining foothold and presumed to be the key factors for growth.The success of the sector is evident from its strong year-to-date performance. The ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (GAMR) has gained 50.7% so far this year and 7.1% in the last three months.Both online gamers Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report third-quarter earnings results on Oct 31 and Nov 2, respectively. It will be prudent to consider which of this is a better stock, ahead of their numbers. While, Activision sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Electronic Arts holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled this week include Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Price PerformanceThe online gaming sector has managed to maintain their steady price performance, which is apparent from thebroader industry’s gain of 35.7% in a year. Both Activision and Electronic Arts beat the industry’s performance. Electronic Arts has increased 48.9%, while Activision has advanced 48.6%.ValuationThere are a variety of valuation ratios, of which we have used EV/EBITDA for the online gaming industry. This metric is considered the most-popular valuation tool as it helps investors find out online gaming companies with a healthy EV/EBITDA within a particular sector. This metric is better than the most common valuation ratio, P/E, mainly because it is not affected by different capital structures of two gaming companies.As the online gaming industry is not capital intensive, we have not taken a ratio like P/B. Instead we have used EV/EBITDA, which shows whether the profit produced by all the games released by the company during a particular period is enough to justify its enterprise value.On the valuation front, both Activision and rival Electronic Arts are overvalued than the broader industry. The EV/EBITDA values for Activision and Electronic Arts are 15.22 and 20.25, respectively, while that for industry is 15.14. However, Activision is undervalued than Electronic Arts.Net MarginThe online gaming industry generally possesses high profit margins, mainly because of its ability to penetrate the market more easily than several other industries. Also, strong demand for online games this holiday season is expected to boost the profitability of the sector.With a net profit margin TTM (BNRI) value of 23.27%, Electronic Arts clearly outperforms Activision, which came up with a reading of 23.11%. The net margin of both companies was higher than that of industry’s net margin TTM value of 18.83%, which in turn was higher than that of the S&P 500’s reading of 13.37%.Dividend YieldThe dividend yield offered by both Activision and Electronic Arts was lower than the broader industry, in a year’s time. The industry has returned 0.63% over the period. Electronic Arts’ dividend yield during the aforementioned period is 0%, while that of Activision is 0.47%. Activision has a better dividend yield than Electronic Arts.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Activision delivered positive surprises in each of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 39.81%. In comparison, Electronic Arts delivered an earnings beat in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 27.34%.When considering Earnings ESP, Activision turns out to be a clear winner. With an ESP of +3.83%, Electronic Arts is at a disadvantage against Activision, which holds a value of +5.80%. Meanwhile, Electronic Arts’ Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased by 0.2% over the last 60 days, while Activision’s has advanced 2.5% during the same period.OutlookThe online gaming industry is gaining traction ahead of the holiday season. Major online game publishers are gearing up for their new releases. Two key players, Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, are set to launch Call of Duty: World War II and Star Wars Battlefront, respectively, early next month. New game launches and seasonal demand during the holiday period are expected to facilitate growth for online game stocks. Additionally, online gaming companies are now adopting new pricing models, where a gamer can opt to subscribe to a game instead of purchasing it.ConclusionIn our analysis, when we compared the price performance of both the companies, Electronic Arts holds an edge over Activision by only 0.3%. Moreover, considering net margin, Electronic Arts is better than Activision. However, when considering EV/EBITDA and dividend yield, Activision is better placed than Electronic Arts.Additionally, when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ previous earnings performance and estimate revisions, Activision is clearly the better stock. What seals the deal for Activision is its strong EPS over Electronic Arts and a better Zacks Rank. In this respect, it is evident that Activision holds a stronghold over Electronic Arts ahead of their Q3 earnings release this week.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

111,ATVI,"Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU  -  Free Report) reported results for third-quarter 2017. While the top line recorded a significant year-over-year improvement, bottom-line comparisons were not favorable.The company reported non-GAAP loss of $2.38 per share, which was wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss of $1.68. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at a loss of $1.24 per share.Sohu’s revenues of $516.1 million were up 25.7% year over year and 12% on a sequential basis.The robust growth was mainly driven by solid performance of the Legacy TLBB mobile game, which it launched in mid-May, along with continued growth momentum in mobile search. Sohu Media Portal and Sohu Video also showed positive trends.Notably, the stock has gained 72.1% in the year-to-date period, significantly outperforming the 29.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. Quarter DetailsTotal online advertising revenues (inclusive of revenues from brand advertising, search and search related businesses) increased 15% year over year to $300 million.Brand advertising revenues in the reported quarter fell 33% to $75 million on a year-over-year basis mainly due to decreasing demand from large advertisers and real estate advertising.Search and search-related revenues increased 50% year over year to $225 million on 24% growth in search traffic. Notably, mobile search traffic grew 38% during the quarter.Online game revenues of $132 million were up 34% from the year-ago quarter mainly on strong performance of the Legacy TLBB mobile game.Sogou’s revenues grew 55% year over year and 22% from the previous quarter to $257 million, driven by increase in mobile and search traffic.Sohu Video revenues increased 25% from the year ago quarter to $44 million. The growing popularity of the company’s series Monster Killer helped in adding more subscribers to the platform in the third quarter.MarginsNon-GAAP gross margin in the quarter increased to 49% from 46% in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP gross margin of the company’s online advertising business was 36%, up from 32% in the prior-year quarter.Brand advertising business margin was negative 1%, reflecting a sharp drop from 8% reported in the year-ago quarter primarily due to weak video ad sales.Non-GAAP gross margin of the search and search-related business in the quarter was 49%, in-line with the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP gross margin of the company’s online game business was 87% compared with 76% reported in the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in Legacy TLBB game.Sohu’s non-GAAP operating loss was $75 million compared with a loss of $38 million in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetSohu exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents (and short-term investments) of $1.28 billion compared with $1.24 billion as of Jun 30, 2017.OutlookSince Sohu.com’s subsidiary Sogou recently commenced its Initial Public Offering (IPO) process by filing regulatory F-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company did not provide any guidance for Sogou or the entire Sohu group.For the fourth quarter of 2017, Sohu expects revenues for subsidiary Changyou.com Limited (CYOU  -  Free Report) in the range of $145–$155 million. Online game revenues are expected in the band of $110-$120 million.The company expects Chagyou’s non-GAAP income per ADS in the range of 66 to 76 cents.Sohu.com Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Sohu.com Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sohu.com Inc. QuoteOur TakeThe Legacy TLBB game has brought some respite for the company’s online gaming business by gaining positive response since its launch. The game is likely to drive the company’s top line over the next few quarters.Moreover, Sogou continues to gain popularity and market share through increased product quality and effective marketing campaigns. The company’s investment in research related to artificial intelligence technology will further enhance its product portfolio.Furthermore, its partnership with Tencent will likely improve Sogou’s competitive position against market leader Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report). Notably, in the third quarter, Tencent began the process of testing Sogou Search’s integration into Weixin.Sohu’s effort to expand its reach in the online video market is a positive. The company has a new drama series Your Highness in its pipeline. It is expected to release in the fourth quarter.We believe the company’s focus on improving the features of Sohu News APP will help it gain more users. The launch of a new and updated version of News APP in November is a step in that direction.However, lower spending levels in China, which is affecting the company’s brand advertising revenues and intensifying competition, pose concerns.Zacks Rank & A Key Pick Sohu.com carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

112,ATVI,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (LYV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, after the market closes.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at 55 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 13.2% year over year.Historically, the company has operated through four segments – Concerts, Ticketing, Artist Nation, and Sponsorship & Advertising. But from 2017, it has started reporting only under three business segments by combining its Concerts and Artist Nation segments into one.Markedly, all these segments, especially the Concerts segment, have been witnessing revenue growth backed by higher tickets sales over the last few quarters. We expect this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well. In fact, during the second-quarter conference call, management noted that the initial days of third-quarter 2017 continued to witness strong growth in its concerts business.Additionally, various digital initiatives undertaken by Live Nation are likely to improve the ticket booking experience and further drive the top line. Meanwhile, its food and beverage initiative at amphitheaters continues to improve on-site experience, consequently driving increased spend per customer. This coupled with the addition of more points of sale as well as continuous refinement of its product assortment and pricing are anticipated to boost concert business profitability.Moreover, Live Nation's ticketing business that operates under the well-known brand, Ticketmaster, has been posting solid revenues for the last few quarters. Also, the company boasts a significant presence in this high-margin agency business where it charges a fee for selling tickets on behalf of its clients. Thus, we expect the momentum of revenue growth to continue in the Ticketing segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s sales is pegged at $3.37 billion, reflecting an increase of 6.2% year over year.However, the overall macro environment might dent Live Nation’s revenues to some next. Per management’s last conference call, forex had an adverse impact of 1% on the company’s business in the second quarter but was becoming less of an issue in the quarter under review. Hence, it remains to be seen how currency movements impact the results in third-quarter 2017.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, our proven model shows that Live Nation has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the third quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at +4.59%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Live Nation’s Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.

114,ATVI,"Scripps Networks Interactive  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 1, after market close.In the last quarter, the company’s earnings (excluding special items) of $1.79 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. Also, the bottom line improved 26.1% on a year-over-year basis on the back of a 3.6% growth in revenues.Notably, Scripps Networks has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 17.7%.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on Scripps Networks’ third-quarter results.Below-par advertising revenues are expected to hurt the performance of the company’s flagship division - U.S. Networks. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter segmental advertising revenues is pegged at $491 million, much lower than the $553 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.  Total revenues from the U.S. Networks division is pegged at $711 million, much lower than the $779 million in the preceding quarter.The International Networks segment is also expected to disappoint in the third quarter of 2017. In fact, the pessimism regarding the sector can be made out from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter adjusted profits from the unit that is pegged at $5.27 million, much lower than the $38.78 million in the second quarter of 2017.Increased programming, selling, general and administrative expenses are also likely to hurt the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Evidently, shares of Scripps Networks have declined 3.1% over the last month, as against the Zacks Broadcast Radio And Television industry’s growth of 0.7%.Despite all the pessimism surrounding the stock, an earnings beat might not be too difficult for Scripps Networks in this quarter owing to reduced expectations. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter seems to be pretty conservative, 40.6% below $1.65 per share reported in second-quarter 2017.However, we believe that more than the earnings numbers, investors await updates on the impending acquisition of Scripps Networks by Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report).What Does our Model Say?Our proven model shows that Scripps Networks is likely to beat earnings in the soon-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Scripps Networks has an Earnings ESP of +5.10% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 5 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents per share.

115,ATVI,"SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 numbers on Nov 1, before the market opens.This Israel-based manufacturer of household soda witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 25.5% last quarter, marking an average beat of 103.03% for the last four quarters.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the third-quarter earnings release —SodaStream banks heavily on the growing demand for its sparkling water. The company’s cost-effective beverage carbonation systems help consumers transform ordinary tap water into soft drinks and sparkling water, providing a healthier alternative to carbonated sugary drinks. Owing to a shift in consumer preference toward the healthier sparkling water, SodaStream repositioned itself in the United States to capitalize on this. In fact, in the last reported quarter, the company recorded revenue growth in all of its geographical operating locations backed by an increase in sparkling water maker units.Revenues in the second quarter increased 10% on a 35% rise in sparkling water maker units to 859,000. Moreover, management expects revenues to grow approximately 7% to about $133 million in the to-be-reported quarter. This will account for 48% of management’s projected second-half 2017 revenues. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017 revenues is pegged at $135.1 million, reflecting 8.7% year-over-year growth.Notably, SodaStream has efficient cost-effective strategies which help the company enhance its operating platform. Additionally, advanced manufacturing capabilities enable the company to leverage its cost structure on higher production volumes. In fact, SodaStream’s operating expenses in the second quarter declined 280 basis points (bps) from the year-ago level. The company expects lower costs and higher revenues for the remaining of 2017, which in turn will boost the company’s bottom line.The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 74 cents, reflecting year-over-year improvement.However, owing to SodaStream’s extensive international presence, negative currency translation poses a threat. Nonetheless, a strong product pipeline and cost-effective strategies are expected to drive growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that SodaStream is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: SodaStream has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 74 cents.

116,ATVI,"The New York Times Company (NYT  -  Free Report), a diversified media conglomerate, is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1. In the trailing four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 43.1%. In the preceding quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 38.5%. Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the company surpasses earnings estimate even this time. Let’s delve deep and find out the factors impacting the results.Strategies on Track, Ad Revenue a ConcernThe New York Times Company is diversifying business, adding new revenue streams, strengthening balance sheet and restructuring portfolio. It has offloaded assets in order to re-focus on core newspapers and pay more attention to its online activities. The company has been adding diverse revenue streams, such as a pay-and-read model, to stay less vulnerable to economic conditions. It is not only gearing up to become an optimum destination for news and information but is also now focusing on service journalism, with verticals like Cooking, Watching and Well.The New York Times Company has been struggling with dwindling advertising revenues for quite some time now. Analysts pointed that increasing online readership has made the print-advertising model redundant. Print advertising revenue fell 10.5% in the second quarter of 2017, following a decline of 17.9% in the preceding quarter. Although, total advertising revenue increased marginally by 0.8% during the second quarter, the company hinted that it is likely to decline in the mid to high-single digits in the third quarter.How are Estimates Shaping Up?The New York Times Company’s diversification strategy to counter dwindling advertising revenues is likely to have a favorable impact on the top and bottom lines. Analysts polled by Zacks expect third-quarter revenue to be $388 million, up 6.7% from the year-ago quarter. However, we note that the rate of growth is likely to decelerate from 9.2% registered in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, earnings are projected to surge 50% year over year in the quarter, following an increase of 63.6% in the preceding quarter. Being stable in the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 9 cents, up from 6 cents reported in the year-ago period.New York Times Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  New York Times Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | New York Times Company (The) QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively show that The New York Times Company is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The New York Times Company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 9 cents. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.80% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Discovery Communications, Inc.

117,ATVI,"Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 4.2%. Its earnings (on an adjusted basis) of 68 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents. Also, the bottom line contracted 4.23% on a year-over-year basis.Discovery’s second-quarter revenues of $1,745 million improved 2.2% on a year-over-year basis. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,764.4 million.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Discovery is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: Discovery has an Earnings ESP of +0.46%, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A positive Zacks ESP is indicative of a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Discovery carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Discovery’s joint venture with The Enthusiast Network (“TEN”) in August for automotive media is likely to aid results in the third quarter. This move marks the company’s entry into direct-to-consumer offerings. Discovery will take a majority controlling interest in the new venture with options to acquire 100% of its business.Notably, Discovery has inked multiple deals to expand its reach. In September, the company renewed its distribution partnership with AT&T. The long-term carriage deal is aimed at expanding its portfolio of networks across more platforms. Following its renewal, the company's networks are available on all platforms of DirecTV.  This strategy is further expected to buoy results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The company’s initiatives to reward shareholders through buybacks are also impressive.However, declining advertising revenues have been hurting Discovery for quite some time now, besides foreign currency movements and higher costs. This might hit the top line in the third-quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter advertising revenues stands at $693 million, much below the previous quarter’s reported figure of $805 million.Additionally, high costs are expected to affect the bottom line in the third quarter. Total costs are expected to grow in the range of high single to low double digits in the third quarter.Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Discovery Communications, Inc.

118,ATVI,"Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter 2018 results on Oct. 31after the closing bell.One of the leading names in the video game industry, Electronic Arts continues to benefit from its popular franchises as well as the shift to digital. Additionally, revenues from the live services component are fast emerging as a key growth driver.Ongoing cost-optimization initiatives are also expected to cushion the company’s top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, the company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 27.34%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 48 cents per share that easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents. Revenues (excluding deferred revenues) came in at $774 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $765.9 million.Notably, in the last one year, EA has generated a return of 45.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 32.6%.Factors at PlayEA’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which will continue to fuel top-line growth. EA SPORTS titles, along with Battlefield, Titanfall and Star Wars are some of its biggest franchises.In the second quarter, Electronic Arts released FIFA 18, NBA LIVE and NHL 18 (September) and Madden NFL18 (August). FIFA 18 was released on Sep 29, 2017 and therefore the quarter will include sales for the first two days only. FIFA remains one of the most popular titles among gamers. Moreover, both Madden NFL 18 and NHL 18 have seen success if we go by NPD data. Per the research firm, Madden finished third whereas NHL 18 finished eight on the list of top selling titles in September.Apart from popular titles, it is the shift to digital that has proved to be a major growth driver for Electronic Arts. Compared with the physical platform, digital games are more profitable due to minimum packaging cost. This cost effectiveness will help publishers like EA to use the digital format to keep a popular franchise running profitably over a long period of time. Digital sales now contribute to the majority of revenues. In the first quarter, digital sales were nearly 60% and grew 28% year over year.The live services component (includes revenues from extra content and subscriptions, advertising, and others) of EA games has emerged as a big growth driver. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, sales from ""live"" services increased 29% to $501 million. We believe Ultimate Team and Battlefield 1along with EA sports titles will continue to boost revenues from live services in the about-to-be reported quarter.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.EA has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.59% and that indicates a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks that, as per our model, also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +7.66% and a Zacks Rank #1.

119,ATVI,"Flex Ltd. (FLEX  -  Free Report) reported fiscal second-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 27 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents but declined 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 4.4% from the year-ago quarter to $6.27 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.1 billion. The impressive results can be attributed to the company’s focus on Industrial & Emerging Industries (IEI) and High Reliability Solutions (HRS) segments which improved diversification.Shares of Flex have gained 20.7% year to date, significantly outperforming the 15.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Quarter DetailsCommunications & Enterprise Compute (CEC) revenues declined 10% from the year-ago quarter to $1.9 billion. This segment generated $43 million in adjusted operating profit and recorded 2.2% adjusted operating margin. Lower profitability was due to 10% lower revenue levels. Growth in cloud data center business was overshadowed by a decline in legacy businesses.However, management noted the CEC segment to be a strong contributor to free cash flow. The segment also provides support to the company to venture into new markets such as digital health and autonomous vehicles.Consumer Technologies Group (CTG) revenues improved 5% from the year-ago quarter to $1.8 billion. This division produced $31 million in adjusted operating profit, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 1.8%, missing the guided range of 2% to 4%. In spite of incurring operating losses due to its strategic partnership with Nike, the segment saw a sequential 60 basis points (bps) improvement in margins driven by higher revenues and benefits from end-of-life programs.Management noted that apart from increased operating expenses due to the Nike partnership, the company’s launch of several big programs this quarter resulted in higher startup costs, which hurt its bottom line. Moreover, continuing investments in designing and innovation related to the “Sketch-to-Scale” portfolio transition kept margins under pressure.However, management is hopeful that once the integration is completed and challenges of the partnership addressed, profits will increase.Revenues from the IEI segment were $1.5 billion, up a robust 17% year over year. This division reported $51 million in adjusted operating profit and 3.5% adjusted operating margin. Although various new customer programs in the home and lifestyle and energy businesses drove results, initial startup costs weighed on margins.HRS revenues rose 16% from the year-ago quarter to $1.2 billion. The segment reported $92 million in adjusted operating profit, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 8%.Flex reported non-GAAP operating income of $188.3 million compared with $196.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The company’s non-GAAP operating margin was 3% in the quarter compared with 3.3% in the prior-year quarter.The company’s investment deconsolidation in Elementum resulted in a gain of $144 million in the quarter.Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 12.4% from the prior-year quarter to $274 million, reflecting higher design and engineering costs. Management stated expansion in innovation and design centers and cost incurred for investments and acquisitions as the major reasons for an increase in expenses.Other Financial DetailsIn the quarter ended Sep 30, 2017, cash & cash equivalents were $1.37 billion, while total debt was $3.00 billion.Flex generated net cash from operations of $280.8 million and free cash flow of $34 million.The company bought back 4.4 million shares worth $71 million in the second quarter.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2018, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $6.3–$6.7 billion.Adjusted operating income is anticipated in the range of $205–$235 million. Management expects adjusted earnings in the range of 28–32 cents per share.Management expects IEI and HRS segments to continue with the robust double-digit growth in the December quarter. Moreover, CTG division is also anticipated to benefit from new product and client wins.However, decline in the “traditional businesses” is expected to remain an overhang on the CEC segment.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Flex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

122,ATVI,"In the heart of the third-quarter earnings season, investors’ feverish search for earnings beat is understandable. Investors love an earnings beat because it usually always translates into stock price appreciation. In fact, a beat works better than earnings growth in this regard. We’ll tell you why.What Makes Earnings Beat So Intriguing?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) fall if they miss or just come in line with market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it looks good apparently) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend. If that is the case, the company’s fundamentals raise serious doubts.Also, seasonal fluctuations are crucial in determining a company’s earnings growth. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and its Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline in Q1. In such cases, growth rates are misleading when it comes to analyzing the true picture of a company.On the other hand, Wall Street analysts rack their brains to study companies’ financials and initiatives to forecast earnings. They in fact club their insights and the company’s guidance to derive an earnings estimate.Thus, beating this key number is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release.Now, since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season, investors can check its earnings surprise history. An impressive track record generally acts as a catalyst, sending the stock higher. It proves the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or, in other words, is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release as well.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3-5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to around five.Here are the five stocks that passed the screen:Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report): The company is a pure-play online and console game publisher. It has a VGM Score of C. The stock belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 19% and has a Zacks Rank #1.

123,ATVI,"Time Warner Inc. , which accepted the buyout offer of AT&T, Inc., is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Oct 26. In the trailing four quarters, this media and entertainment company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 16.7%. In the preceding quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 11.8%.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Time Warner surpasses earnings estimate even this time. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.How are Estimates Shaping Up?After registering an increase of 3% in the bottom line, Time Warner is likely to witness a year-over-year decline in the third quarter of 2017. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.53 down from $1.83 reported in the year-ago period. We also note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased by a couple of cents in the past seven days, which indicates that analysts are not very optimistic about the company’s performance.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7,412 million, up 3.4% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the rate of growth is likely to decelerate from 5% registered in the preceding quarter.Time Warner Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Time Warner Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Time Warner Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing This QuarterWe believe that Time Warner’s foray into new markets, focus on original programming, cost reduction and increasing investments in key areas bode well. Additionally, the company has been expanding digital presence to enable consumers to access content from several platforms and devices. Its investments in video content and technology continue to drive results. All these initiatives are likely to be reflected in the quarter to be reported.However, decline in overall advertising spending and currency headwinds may adversely impact performance. Further, management had earlier projected that Turner division's total advertising revenue is likely to decline in the low-single digits in the third quarter. We also note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of revenues for the segment, which is currently pegged at $2,777 million, is down from $3,102 million reported in the second quarter but reflects year-over-year growth of 6.4%.Time Warner's Home Box Office (“HBO”) segment is expected to generate revenues of $1,555 million, up 9% from the year ago period. Management had earlier guided that Home Box Office’s subscription revenue growth rate would rise in the second half of 2017 and total revenues is projected to increase at a higher rate in the second half compared to the first half.Analysts polled by Zacks envision revenue to decline at Warner Bros., which may weigh on the company’s top-line. Total revenues for the segment is projected to be $3,326 million, down 2.2% year over year.What Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Time Warner is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Time Warner carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) but has an Earnings ESP of +5.23%, consequently making the surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.77% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #3.Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.29% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

124,ATVI,"Welcome to the second episode of Full-Court Finance, a new podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. This week, we explore the rapid rise of esports.Esports is essentially professional video gaming. The all-encompassing term covers different video games, leagues, tournaments, companies, countries, and much more. Industry revenues are projected to skyrocket 41% this year to hit $696 million while reaching 385.5 million fans,according to a report by gaming-focused market research firm Newzoo.By 2020, advertising, sponsorship, media rights, consumer spending, and video game maker investment will help make esports a $1.5 billion industry.The U.S. government has granted work visas for professional video gamers, the Olympic Council of Asia recently voted to include esports in the 2018 Asian Games after a push from Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) subsidiary Alisports, and the Paris Olympic committee has even considered testing video game competitions at the summer games in 2024.Television and news giants including ESPN, NBC, and TBS have already committed to broadcasting and covering esports, which includes a focus on multiplayer online battle arena games Defense of the Ancients and League of Legends, as well as the first person shooter games Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch.Esports are a massive draw for marketers and advertisers because their average audience is made up of mostly employed men between 18 to 35 years old—a demographic that has become harder to reach than ever.On top of this, gaming giants—Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report)—are all invested in esports’ long-term viability and success.And major sponsors of more traditional sports are already trying to cash in on professional video gaming. Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) sponsored last year's League of Legends World Finals. American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Geico, Bud Light, Audi, Buffalo Wild Wings , and others are all esports sponsors.Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) got ahead of the esports curve when it purchased esports streaming giant Twitch for about $1billion dollars in 2014. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube has its own “gaming” section that streams esports. And esports events have sold out the Staples Center in Los Angeles and Madison Square Garden in New York City.Activision Blizzard’s new Overwatch league, which will kick off its inaugural season in January, is set up much like many more common sports with city-based teams, regularly scheduled games, playoffs, and minimum salaries for team members. Investors, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke, and others paid $20 million to purchase one of 12 teams in the league’s first season.Other major players in the sports world, such as Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, and the Golden State Warriors ownership group are all also heavily invested in esports. And the NBA is set to launch its first ever video game league where NBA team-associated clubs will do battle on virtual NBA 2K courts starting in 2018.But you will have to listen to the whole episode to find out more about this sport of the future!If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

125,ATVI,"Share price of Gluu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) increased 3.8% to a new 52-week high of $4.33 and closed at the same price on Oct 13.Notably, shares of Gluu have gained 114.4% over the last one year, substantially outperforming the industry’s 32.6% rally. The outperformance can be attributed to strong adoption of the company’s gaming portfolio.Moreover, we believe the announcement of the company’s new “digital-entertainment project” in partnership with Grammy Award winning pop star Taylor Swift is also positive.Currently, Gluu carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has a market capital of $514.6 million and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15%.Diversified Game PortfolioGlu Mobile’s roster of games, especially its evergreen titles like Cooking Dash, Racing Rivals and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood have been primarily driving growth. Notably, the company’s revenues have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past two quarters.The company’s celebrity titles Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Restaurant Dash: Gordon Ramsay also garnered considerable success. The former recorded $40 million in sales in the first three months, while the latter has generated $30 million so far.However, the other titles such as Katy Perry Pop, Britney Spears: American Dream and Nicki Minaj have fallen short of expectations. To add to it, the company has been incurring losses.Therefore, the company’s latest shift toward creating a social networking app called The Swift Line for the popular pop star is prudent in our view. The app, which is set for launch later this year, will enable the company to gain the support of the wide fan base of the singer.Nick Earl, President & CEO of Gluu, believes that the company will be able to create a “deeply social environment” by connecting Taylor’s fans with her for an interactive communication session.Reportedly, the app will be updated with the singer’s latest songs every week. The usage of Taylor special emojis, Taymojis, in conversations will also help them express their views freely.  We believe this will enable the company to witness a rise in user engagement and thereby drive growth.However, rising competition from established players like Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take-Two (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) remains a concern.Glu Mobile Inc.

126,ATVI,"Shares of video game giants—including Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report), and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report)—sank on Monday after a bearish analyst report on the state of the industry.Today’s cautionary take comes from Cowen. The investment banking firm downgraded several industry giants, including Take-Two and Activision, as well as Ubisoft Entertainment (UBSFY  -  Free Report).Shares of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard dropped by over 3%, while industry peer Electronic Arts stock fell by more than 1.50%. Shares of Take-Two Interactive, which makes NBA 2K and other big-name video game titles, tanked by over 4%.Interestingly enough, Cowen’s note comes in contrast to other recent analyst coverage. Just last week, Barclays’ analyst Ryan Gee started coverage on four of the biggest video game companies. Gee gave Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) an “Overweight” rating and a price target of $129 a share, which marked a roughly 7.42% upside to last week’s closing price.Part of the reason for Gee’s initial bullish coverage is because he thinks EA’s Live Services’ revenues will grow over the next two years.The analyst also initiated coverage of Take-Two Interactive with an “Overweight” rating and a $115 price target. Take-Two’s $115 per share price target marked a nearly 7.25% upside compared to Friday’s closing price of $107.23 a share. Gee noted that Take-Two is monetizing popular video games more effectively compared to its peers.Gee also initiated coverage of video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard with an “Equal-Weight” rating along with a $65 a share price target, which marked a 2.77% upside to Friday’s closing price.Still, despite these recent relatively bullish Barclays’ rating, shares of all four of these companies sunk on Monday.Sales ProjectionsThis downgrade and brief investor retreat comes just a few days before market research firm NPD Group is set to release its September video game sales report.Stifel Nicolaus analyst Drew Crum expects that the Oct. 12 report will be very important for investors, as it includes some the industry’s biggest games—including NBA 2K18 and FIFA 18. The analyst projects overall video game sales will gain about 20%, while hardware and console sales will fall year-over-year.Crum expects Activision Blizzard’s September sales will be $90 million—up from $20 million a year ago, due in large part to the recent release of Destiny 2. He projects Take Two Interactive’s sales will fall in the high-single digits to $100 million, while Electronic Arts sales are projected to gain slightly to hit approximately $80 million.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

128,ATVI,"Research firm eMarketer has once again slashed the 2017 U.S ad revenue estimates for Snapchat’s parent company Snap Inc (SNAP  -  Free Report). This is the second time this year that the projection has been cut.Snap is now estimated to earn $642.5 million in ad revenues from the United States compared with the earlier estimate of $770 million. In March this year, the research firm had slashed the domestic ad revenue forecast from $805 million to $770 million. On a worldwide basis, Snap’s revenues are now projected to be $774.1 million, down from the earlier projection of $900 million.In its latest report, eMarketer stated that “Despite all of its improvements in ad products and measurement, Snapchat remains in the experimental bucket for many marketers. They give it high marks for its creative possibilities and its ability to attract a youth audience, but many have yet to make it a must-buy.”Snap trails its rival, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) owned Instagram, adds eMarketer, but is well ahead of Twitter. Instagram will continue its lead over Snapchat in the next few years with revenues from the United States touching $3 billion in 2017. By 2019, Instagram will earn $6.84 billion in domestic ad revenues. In contrast, Snapchat will earn $2 billion in domestic ad revenues (down from $2.2 billion forecasted in March this year) by 2019, adds eMarketer.Instagram has seen terrific success and now has over 800 million users. Moreover, Instagram Stories, an unabashed copy of Snapchat’s feature of the same name, has more than 250 million daily actives. In contrast, Snapchat’s total daily active users are a little more than 173 million. Snap Inc. Price Snap Inc. Price | Snap Inc. QuoteSnap has been working on attracting advertisers. It added three ad products in May, namely Sponsor World Lenses, Audience Lenses and Smart Geo filters. For buying video ads, Snap introduced the self serve Ad Manager in June. The company launched two more advertising tools called Snapchat Mobile Dashboard and Business Manager. Further, in order to woo advertisers, the company acquired Placed (in June), a start-up specializing in measuring the success of digital ad campaigns.Earlier in July, Snap rolled out a tool namely Snap Publisher to help advertisers create their own ads.Recently, the company announced the addition of 14 new Creative Partners “to provide advertisers hands-on support to plan, executive and optimize Snap Ads campaigns.” The company’s Snapchat Creative Partner program was launched in June.All these are yet to prove beneficial. Analysts also add that the company’s lack of popularity in the international quarters and its focus only on under-30 users remain concerns.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementSnap carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

129,ATVI,"Per Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), about 10 million users have watched the Russian backed ads, allegedly aimed at influencing the 2016 Presidential elections outcome. The revelation was made a few hours after the social media giant furnished extensive details about 3K plus Russian backed ads (not made public yet) on its platform to the Congress.In the blog post, Facebook’s vice president of Policy and Communications, Elliot Schrage stated that these ads were mostly targeted at divisions on grounds of politics and social norms and often touched upon on sensitive topics like immigration and racial issues, gun rights as well as LGBT matters.Schrage also said that nearly 44% of the total ad impressions were before the U.S. election whereas the same spiked to 56% post elections.Also, notably, the company said that there are chances that nearly 25% of the ads were never seen by anyone because the advertising auctions are designed to ""reach people based on relevance.""Facebook, Inc. Price Facebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. QuoteThe company also added that there could be more such undetected ads. “We’re still looking for abuse and bad actors on our platform — our internal investigation continues. We hope that by cooperating with Congress, the Special Counsel and our industry partners, we will help keep bad actors off our platform” stated Facebook.Nonetheless, Schrage in his blog post has underscored that “We understand more about how our service was abused and we will continue to investigate to learn all we can. We know that our experience is only a small piece of a much larger puzzle. Congress and the Special Counsel are best placed to put these pieces together because they have much broader investigative power to obtain information from other sources.”Facebook is in the eye of the storm ever since it revealed to the Congress that it has identified Russian accounts spending nearly $100,000 in ads (over 3K), which coincided with the U.S. election (from June 2015 to May 2017). This has caused a massive uproar.The recent disclosures are now particularly concerning as it reflects that the Russian meddling continued after the elections as well. With an investment of just $100,000, the alleged Russian factors could reach an audience this huge, adds CNN.However, Schrage added that Facebook is now upping it ante to ward off such incidents in the future. Facebook will employ about 1000 people to review ads. Plus, it will authenticate the background of advertisers and make ad details more transparent.Since the elections, social media companies, especially Facebook and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), have been under fire for dissemination of fake news that allegedly influenced elections. Twitter recently revealed that it had found over 200 accounts related to Russian factors/bot network.These companies are battling extensive PR damage. Moreover, pressure from governments of various countries including France, Germany (which goes into election a few days from now) and Britain to curb the spread of fake ads/news and extremist activities on their platform is mounting.In the past few months, Facebook has been tightening control over what is displayed on its platform by enabling third party verification. Facebook said it will also scrutinize ads that promote bogus stories for monetary gains. The company said that it will work with the entire news industry to improve its fact checking systems. Facebook made the “Trending” feature more automated to minimize human intervention. The company has done away with the need to write description for trending topics that required news curators to do the job. It has also deployed artificial intelligence to tackle terrorism.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

131,ATVI,"Multi-brand toy and consumer products company, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report), is likely to continue growing on the back of its long-term strategic goals. The objectives include expansion of its solid base of evergreen brands, entering into new categories, creating a strong portfolio of new and existing licenses, and developing owned IP and content.However, the company faces challenges in the form of a difficult retail environment, rising costs, competition from alternative modes of entertainment and adverse forex translations.Meanwhile, JAKKS Pacific continues to expect higher net income, earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA on lower net sales for 2017 compared with the previous year. Also, the company anticipates enhanced profitability in the second half of the current year owing to its efficient marketing undertakings and cost-cutting policies.Key Growth DriversGoing forward, we are particularly optimistic on the company’s innovative partnerships and joint ventures that should help JAKKS Pacific gain market share in a competitive industry. Additionally, the company’ strategic acquisitions is likely to aid in entering new categories.Markedly, JAKKS Pacific’s collaborations with Disney, Skechers, Nickelodeon, Cabbage Patch Kids to manufacture toys and merchandise related to these brands is also likely to drive growth. Furthermore, the company’s licensing agreements with popular movie and television franchises are expected to boost sales as merchandise based on movies enjoys immense popularity.In fact, since the beginning of the year, it has entered into multiple licensing agreements spanning across varied product lines that are all set to hit stores in the near term and add to the top line. Also, despite lower sales in the first-half 2017, the company expects sales decline in the second half to be more modest as it heads into peak selling season.JAKKS Pacific also remains committed to diversifying its footprint outside the United States in various key markets and currently operates in 65 countries, worldwide. Notably, the expansion initiatives are likely to strengthen its international presence as well as customer base and thereby aid in growing sales, profit margins and the company’s access to attract licenses.Furthermore, in order to cash in on the demand for smartphone gaming, the company has introduced a number of mobile gaming apps and digital games along with the physical toys, which would help the company. JAKKS Pacific’s investment in digital innovation is also expected to help in brand building, besides helping the company to capitalize on the increasingly lucrative technology-based gaming market.Interestingly, JAKKS Pacific has realized the importance of online retailing and has shifted a great amount of focus to aggressively growing online sales. In fact, it continues to modify the company’s sales and logistics capabilities in order to capitalize on this shift. Markedly, sales to online customers and the e-commerce division of traditional retailers rose over 50% year over year in the second quarter.ConcernsIt is to be noted that a challenging retail environment for toys due to lower consumer confidence remains a major concern for JAKKS Pacific as well as other leading toy makers like Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report). Currently, customers are reducing non-essential purchases, which in turn is hurting toy makers’ revenue.Continuous competition from technology-based gaming companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) has also been posing a significant threat to the market position of toy makers like JAKKS Pacific.Meanwhile, as the U.S. dollar continues to show strength against various other currencies, the negative currency impact is likely to hurt revenues, given the company’s considerable international presence. Moreover, the British Pound’s plunge in value since the Brexit vote is impacting JAKKS Pacific’s revenues. In fact, foreign exchange movements can be cited as one of the primary reasons behind the company’s expectations of lower revenues in 2017 than the last year.Additionally, the company is experiencing increased costs related to international expansion, development of new IP and acquisitions. These initiatives are adding greatly to expenses without the offsetting benefit of having any material impact on revenue growth. Unless the trend reverses, the company’s margins will remain under pressure, despite several cost-containment efforts.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Strategic acquisitions have been a key growth factor for Scientific Games over the years.We have seen that acquisitions of Bally Technologies (2014),WMS Industries (2013), Parspro and Provoloto (2012), Barcrest Group Limited (2011), Sceptre Leisure Solutions (2010) and GameLogic (2010) have expanded the company’s ability to offer computerized systems and services to the global gaming industry.Scientific Games also completed the buyout of DEQ Systems in January and Red7Mobile in July, which will help the company to solidify its position, going ahead.Coming to the NYX deal, the company says the buyout will help Scientific Games to broaden its product pipeline in digital gaming and online lottery markets. Besides, NYX’s sport betting platform OpenBet Sportsbook will further position it well for the online gambling market.This is important because the online gambling market is expected to emerge as a lucrative business opportunity. Per market research firm, Technavio the global sports betting market will witness CAGR of more than 4% over the 2016-2020 time frame. The firm projects global online gambling market to increase at a CAGR of more than 9% over the same period.Notably, in the past one year, Scientific Games shares have gained 280.7%, substantially outperforming the  industry’s rally of 15.8%.The company will also be able to cash in on the growing global customer base of NYX. Moreover, management expects the deal to be accretive to earnings in the first year after closing.Reportedly, Matt Davey, the current Chief Executive Officer of NYX, will supervise Scientific Games’ new Digital Gaming and Sports division, after the completion of the deal.We believe the company will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, which will boost its top-line amid stiff competition.However, the company’s leveraged balance sheet results in significant interest expense. Adding more debt for funding acquisitions will further enhance its indebtedness and weigh on its profitability.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksCurrently, Scientific Games has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.Long-term earnings growth rate for Applied Materials, Activision and Micron is currently projected to be 17.1%, 13.6% and 10%, respectively.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

133,ATVI,"Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) has decided to drop the proposed creation of Class C shares, which could have helped CEO Mark Zuckerberg to hold his sway over the company. Facebook’s sudden plan to discard the creation of Class C shares reportedly comes under tremendous investor pressure.Last year, during its first-quarter 2016 results, Facebook had proposed the creation of publicly listed but non-voting new Class C shares. Facebook, at present, has a double class structure. The Class C shares will have the same economic rights as Class A and Class B shares. Notably, Class B shares have 10 times the voting rights of Class A shares. Class B shares aren’t traded and are held mostly by Facebook executives.The idea behind the creation of this new class of shares was to allow Zuckerberg to have control over the company while continuing his charitable work. In December 2015, following the birth of their first daughter, Zuckerberg had said that he and his wife plan to give 99% of their Facebook shares, valued at $45 billion then, over their entire lifetime, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative LLC, a limited liability company for betterment of the society.However, a certain section of investors filed a class action lawsuit against Zuckerberg’s proposal. These investors reportedly argued that the new class structure could potentially cause huge losses for them (running into billions of dollars) if the new Class C shares started trading. The trial was scheduled to begin in a few days at Delaware’s Chancery Court. The case will now probably to be dismissed.In a blog post, Zuckerberg said that, “I shared a proposal announced by Facebook's board of directors to create a new class of Facebook stock. The idea was that it would allow me to keep voting control of Facebook so we can continue to build for the long term, but also allow Priscilla and me to fund the work we're doing through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. At the time, I felt that this reclassification was the best way to do both of these things.”He went on to add that in the last 18 months, Facebook’s robust performance has helped the stock to grow “to a point” that he can easily continue his charitable work as well as keep hold of his voting control for the next two decades and therefore a reclassification is not necessary anymore. He added that he was selling nearly 35 to 75 million shares over the next one and a half years for philanthropic purposes.Facebook is under fire ever since the disclosure that Russians used the platform to meddle with the 2016 Presidential elections. Facebook is now furnishing details of nearly 3K ads to congressional investigators. Zuckerberg in a Live video broadcast also said that to create transparency for political ads on its platform, it will now make it mandatory for advertisers to disclose their identities.Not just this, arecent revelation by ProPublica also put Facebook in a tough spot. Per ProPublica, Facebook helped advertises target anti-Jew groups. An algorithm error rather than a human error was the cause added ProPublica. Post this revelation, Facebook said that it has removed the fields in question.After facing fire, Facebook has taken proactive measures to fight bogus ads on its platform. In his live broadcast on Sep 21, 2017, Zuckerberg added that the company will also hire additional 250 election integrity employees and partners with election commissions across the globe. Facebook will now increase the information shared with other tech companies as well cyber security specialists to ensure safety and security on the platform.Facebook’s proactive measures look good. Such measures are the need of the hour as Facebook’s top line mostly comprises ad revenues. Last year, Facebook generated over $27.6 billion in revenues with ad revenues of $26.9 billion.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year.

Apple had touted the built-in cellular as the USP of the Watch.Lauren Goode of The Verge said that she persistently faced troubles connecting to cellular network. After having her first review unit replaced by a second unit by Apple, the problems remained. The “untethered” experience was intermittent. Plus, Watch seemed to connect to random wi-fi signals.

We are investigating a fix for a future software release.”The Wall Street Journal also pointed out similar problems with connection and a quick draining battery.Though New York Times’ Brian Chen was relatively more positive about the Watch, he was perturbed by the fact that people will have to shell $10 for cellular connection even after paying $399 for the Watch. TechCrunch analyst echoed similar sentiments and said that though the Watch was good but given the issues with LTE connectivity now, it is but obvious there will be “serious deliberation” as far as buying is concerned as there will another $10 required to pay for cellular connection. .Apple Watch OS 3 was said to be the “ultimate expression of Apple Watch” by the company’s chief financial officer, Jeff Williams. Powered by a new dual core processor, which is 70% faster than its predecessor, users can call, text as well as access GPS and third party applications like WeChat. Also, with integrated cellular and Apple Music, 40 million songs are available for streaming on your wrist, added Williams.Apple Watch was launched in April 2015.

137,ATVI,"The video game world, like many other industries, heats up as the holiday shopping season kicks off. But the gaming industry is so much more than a three-month period of “buy the hottest new game for your kids.” The video game industry is a global powerhouse that takes in billions of dollars a year, and it is set to continue to skyrocket.This year, based on market research firm Newzoo’s “Global Games Market Report,” 2.2 billion video gamers around the world will help generate $109 billion in revenue for the global video game industry. And this 7.8% year-over-year jump in sales is only part of the story.Esports’ popularity and its newfound economic viability has created a whole new growth sector within the industry. The professional video gaming industry is projected to grow 41% from last year to hit $696 million. And the Olympic Council of Asia recently announced that it will include esports in the 2018 Asian Games—spurred by support from Alibaba’s (BABA  -  Free Report) Alisports.With so many companies set to profit from the gaming market’s continued growth, let’s take a look at two big-time video game players with great Zacks Ranks to see which stock is the best investment right now.Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report)Activision Blizzard’s stock has soared in 2017, experiencing a 77.79% year-to-date price change, which makes the S&P 500’s 10.89% gain look modest. Now, the company’s stock price sits just below its all-time high of $66.58 per share. This might turn off some investors who tend to stay away from stocks at current highs, but let’s look at some of the company’s fundamentals and projections to see what’s really going on.The maker of widely popular video games such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft is coming off a better-than-expected second quarter that saw its revenues pop 4% to hit $1.63 billion. Maybe more impressively, Activision Blizzard’s sales from its digital channels jumped 15% to reach $1.31 billion. The company boasted 407 million monthly active users last quarter.Activision Blizzardstock is currently trading at 30x earnings, which is not great compared to the overall market, but its 2.22 PEG ratio does match the industry average. The company’s P/B ratio of 4.98 also hovers right around the industry average, so value investors don’t need to be too worried here.Thecompany’s Current Ratio of 2.47 tops the industry average. Activision Blizzard’s90.25% cash flow growth also helps to show that the company is on a strong growth trajectory. Based on our current consensus estimates, the company’s sales are expected to climb 10.87% this quarter and gain 4.10% for the year to hit between $6.61 billion and $7.14 billion.Within the past 60 days, ATVI has received six upward earnings estimate revisions for its full year, and the video game giant has also only missed earnings estimates once in the last 14 quarters.Activision Blizzardis currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Nintendo Co., Ltd. (NTDOY  -  Free Report)The legendary Japanese video game company has experienced a rebound in the last couple of years, as it got back to the basics that made the company a household name around the world. Nintendo is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and its new Switch consoles are poised to help keep the company’s resurgence going strong.Nintendo’s most recent quarterly revenues hit $1.37 billion, which marked an almost 150% year-over-year jump. The company’s sales jumped based on strong demand for its multi-purpose Switch consoles. Nintendo expects to sell 10 million of its $299.99 Switch consoles in its current fiscal year.Shares of Nintendo have skyrocketed this year and hit a new 52-week high of $48.65 a share on Wednesday. But investors who are worried that it will be hard for the Super Mario maker to jump into a new range might consider some key Zacks Consensus Estimates. Our current consensus estimates call for sales to skyrocket 106.67% this quarter and 70.68% for the full-year to hit a high-end estimate of $7.91 billion.Our consensus estimates also project EPS growth of 203.59% this fiscal year. That expansion is projected to continue, with current consensus estimates calling for 61.73% EPS growth in the next fiscal year.The company has received one positive earnings estimate revision for its current quarter within the last 60 days. In that same time frame, Nintendo also received three positive revisions to its full-year estimates and two positive revisions for its next year estimates.Bottom LineThe battle between two video game industry heavyweights was certainly not lopsided and it could very well prove to be a split-decision. Activision Blizzard’s games and Nintendo’s consoles have loyal and ever-growing user bases.But with Activision Blizzard’s foray into the world of epsorts, with its new ""Overwatch"" league that has seen NBA owners buy city-based franchise for $20 million, the long-term edge could lean in its direction.Also, the proliferation of smartphones around the world, even in some of the poorest nations, means more people have access to mobile videos games, and Activision Blizzard is growing its digital gaming sector at a huge rate.Still, both companies are strong, boast high Zacks Ranks, and look poised to continue to grow.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

139,ATVI,"The holiday season is the most important time of the year for video game developers and distributors. The majority of the companies tend to release their most important titles couple of months ahead, particularly from September, to attract the maximum number of players.Hence, a strong and innovative game pipeline is of utmost importance for the companies as well as investors.Moreover, availability on the latest consoles decides the games growth trajectory during the holiday season. Notable manufacturers like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) and Nintendo Co. Ltd (NTDOY  -  Free Report) also launch their flagship devices prior to the holiday season.Market research firm, Newzoo expects consoles to be the second largest revenue generator after mobile gaming with $33.5 billion in 2017.Microsoft Banks on Xbox OneMicrosoft’s much-awaited Xbox One X is set to release on Nov 7. Preorder volumes have already surpassed all previous records. Per media reports, preorder of the device is expected to go live again on Sep 21.Microsoft expects the new console to help in bridging the gap with Sony’s PS4. Per Venturebeat, Sony’s market share in the console hardware market was almost double that of Microsoft’s 26% at the end of 2016.However, lesser number of exclusive games can be a headwind for Microsoft. Sony has a much enriched line-up of exclusive titles for PS4 Pro, namely Gravity Rush 2, Tales Of Berseria, Yakuza 0, Nioh, Horizon Zero Dawn and Persona 5 among many others.Moreover, Microsoft will face competition from Nintendo. The Japan-based video game giant is set to launch Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) Classic Edition across the United States on Sep 29. The company is well poised on strong sales of its Switch console. Per Nintendo, as of Jun 30, 4.7 million units of Nintendo Switch (launched in March) have been sold globally.Mobile Games: The Cash CowsDespite strong anticipated demand for consoles like Xbox One, we believe that mobile games are the cash cows for gaming companies. Newzoo projects mobile game revenues to grow in the range of 32% - 40% over 2017-2020 time frame.The strong growth can be attributed to growing adoption of high-end smartphones and tablets.  Consumers are increasingly spending more on buying in-game items that are driving up the top line of companies. Per Newzoo, mobile gaming will be extremely lucrative and account for 42% of the total gaming market in 2017.E-Sports -  The Game ChangerE-sports are fast emerging as a lucrative business opportunity. Like traditional sports, even these are held at stadiums and televised or broadcast online. Importantly, these tournaments have alluring prize money.With continued increases in viewership, corporate sponsorships and growing media coverage, e-sports is here to stay. Per the latest report from Newzoo, in 2017, revenues from e-sports are expected to be up 41.3% to $696 million.3 Gaming Stocks in FocusLet’s focus on three stocks that have the most attractive game pipeline for the upcoming holiday season.Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report)The company recently released its much awaited online multiplayer game Destiny 2 on PS4 and Xbox One console. Activision is set to release the Call of Duty: WWII on Nov 3.Call of Duty has been the most important revenue generating franchise for Activision over the years. The company should keep its fingers crossed with the new installment, as the last one – Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare – was a dampener.Activision is also strengthening presence in the e-sports market. The company recently set up Blizzard Arena Los Angeles, a state-of-the-art facility for e-sports events at Burbank Studios. With Overwatch recording stupendous success with 30 million players and counting, Activision has announced a league for this franchise as well.Activision sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

140,ATVI,"Per a Bloomberg report, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) is likely to be summoned by The Senate Intelligence Committee to testify regarding the Russian interference in U.S. Presidential election.Bloomberg quoted Senate Committee Chairman Richard Burr saying that, ""We’re in agreement on a Facebook public hearing. It’s just a question of when and potentially the scope.”Reportedly, Mark Warner, another senator from the panel, put focus on a Daily Beast report that claimed that Russians used Facebook’s platform to organize protests rallies including anti-immigrant protests in August 2016. Reports add that Warner is dismayed as Facebook chose not to reveal this information to the Senate. Per him, this is the “tip of the iceberg” and extensive probe will help to uncover a lot details.Facebook, Inc. Price Facebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. QuoteFacebook is in the eye of the storm ever since it revealed to Congress that it identified Russian accounts (about 470) spending nearly $100,000 in ads (over 3K) coinciding with the U.S. election (from June of 2015 to May of 2017). This has caused a massive uproar.A few days back, Facebook furnished extensive “detailed” records on Russian ad spending during U.S. Presidential elections to special counsel, Robert Mueller. This was in response to Mueller obtaining a search warrant against the tech giant. Per The Wall Street Journal, the furnished records include details of the accounts and the copies of ads and the targeted audience.There has been widespread speculation that Russia meddled with 2016 U.S. presidential elections that resulted in Donald Trump’s victory. To investigate this, the Department of Justice (DoJ) appointed Mueller, an ex FBI chief.Notably, Twitter is also likely to be summoned by the Senate over Russian involvement in the elections.Since the elections, social media companies, especially Facebook and Twitter, have been under fire for dissemination of fake news that allegedly influenced elections. These companies are battling extensive PR damage. Moreover, pressure from governments of various countries including France, Germany (which goes into election few days from now) and Britain to curb spread of fake news and extremist activities on their platform is mounting.Facebook has been tightening control over what is displayed on its platform by enabling third party verification. Facebook said it will also scrutinize ads that promote bogus stories for monetary gains. The company said that it will work with the entire news industry to improve its fact checking systems. Facebook made the “Trending” feature more automated to minimize human intervention. The company has done away with the need to write description for trending topics that required news curators to do the job. It also has deployed artificial intelligence to tackle terrorism.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shares also touched a 52-week high of $42.10 during yesterday’s trading session.The share price momentum can be attributed to the company’s strategic initiatives andexpanding product portfolio.Moreover, the recent announcement of the company’s proposed reincorporation from Delaware to Nevada where it is currently doing business is a positive in our view. Local incorporation has many advantages like lower cost, familiarity with local law and geographical proximity.Notably, Scientific Games’ shares have gained 200.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s13.7% rally.Key FactorsScientific Games with its innovative product pipeline enjoys a premium position in the gaming equipment space, as well as in the instant ticket and online lottery markets.The company’s growth is driven by increases in gaming and interactive segment revenues.Notably, in the last reported quarter, almost 60% of Scientific Games’ total revenue was contributed by its gaming segment, which was driven by growth in Gaming Machine sales, Gaming Systemsand Table Products. The year-over-year growth in Gaming Systems revenues was driven by an increase in software and hardware sales, including shipment of new iVIEW4 player-interface display units.The company’s iVIEW4 technology, backed by sophisticated and advanced features, is witnessing strong adoption. Earlier this month, the company was awarded a contract by Temecula, CA-based Pechanga Resort & Casino to provide 4,200 new iVIEW4 on-device player-interface controllers.The company also announced that itis has been chosen by Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino for providing a suite of products for casino management as well as for its online and mobile platforms.Further, the company’s Gamescape, Pro Wave, and TwinStar cabinets along with J43 and three-reel mechanical cabinets have also been instrumental in boosting its gaming segment.Additionally, Scientific Games announced the launch of its new slot game named Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy last month.

142,ATVI,"Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) little snafu on stage while demonstrating the new facial recognition feature for its mega edition, iPhone X not only resulted in a wave of trolls and memes on social media but also gave competitors an opportunity to take potshots at the tech giant.Per reports, in a Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) ad post, Huawei took jabs (using a clown) at iPhone X’s facial recognition by stating it fails often and people should wait for the real artificial intelligence (AI) phone coming on Oct 16, 2017. This refers to its upcoming device, Mate 10.During Apple’s mega event on Sep 12, 2017, the company suffered a major embarrassment when the phone Craig Federighi was using to demonstrate the Face ID feature did not unlock and the software chief was forced to use the backup, which worked as it was required.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteApple later on clarified that the snafu was caused by members who initiated a ""lockout mechanism"". Per a Yahoo report, a staff member restarted the phone just before the event and so when Federighi was attempting to unlock, it showed the “password is required” prompt. Now, if the phone is switched off or has been restarted, the password needs to be manually set as a security measure.Nonetheless, the social media has been merciless. Huawei now joins the list.We can’t overlook the fact that of late Apple is losing ground (especially in China and South East Asia) to cheaper handsets. Chinese handset makers like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and Huawei have been gaining market share.Per a CounterPoint Research, the smartphone market in China grew 3% between April and June 2017. Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi have been dominating majority of the market. Huawei indeed was the biggest gainer with its new models like Nova and P10 models. Notably, Huawei tried entering the U.S. market but hasn’t had much success.The latest CounterPoint Research report (Sep 2017) pointed that Huawei outshined Apple to become the second largest brand overall. Despite market loss, Samsung is still the leading brand while Apple was third, behind Huawei.As for Huawei, China is the biggest market followed by Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Its limited presence in other South East Asian markets along with U.S ""limits Huawei's potential to the near-to-mid-term to take a sustainable second place position behind Samsung” added the report.As far as Apple is concerned, it needs to have a hit with iPhone X, the much anticipated tenth anniversary mega edition. The phone definitely marks a giant leap with features like OLED display and glass body and Face ID. However these features aren’t exclusive and Samsung phones already boast these. Plus, the hefty price tag ($1,000) has caused a raging debate.Though users in the United States are expected to be unaffected by the price point, sales in China are expected to take a hit as the price tag is double the averageChinese monthly salary. China is Apple’s biggest market after U.S and Europe.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementApple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year. Shares of Apple have surged 39.7% compared with the industry’s 38.8% increase.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and FormFactorInc (FORM  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

143,ATVI,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is currently one of the top-performing stocks in the technology sector and a rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal its bullish run. Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.The company has performed extremely well so far this year and has the potential to carry on the momentum in the near term.Why an Attractive Pick?Share Price Appreciation: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse year to date. Micron returned a whopping 61.6%, which compared favorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 11.7%.Solid Rank & VGM Score: Micron currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Northward Estimate Revisions: Four estimates for the current year moved north over the past 60 days versus no southward revisions, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the company. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year increased 1.3%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus Micron Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus | Micron Technology, Inc. QuotePositive Earnings Surprise History: Micron has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 23.1%.Strong Growth Prospects: The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings of $4.62 reflects year-over-year growth of 7,602.2%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 32.2% growth in 2018. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10%.Growth Drivers: Micron offers both DRAM and NAND products. While DRAM chips are key components in PCs, NAND flash chips are crucial for portable electronic devices.Improving prices for DRAM and NAND chips make us confident about Micron’s growth. Per various sources, the prices for these specific chips have improved primarily due to a better product mix optimization and higher-than-expected demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.Mergers and acquisitions are actively expanding Micron's core business. Notably, the company acquired the remaining stake in Inotera in December and made the brand a wholly owned subsidiary in Taiwan.It is worth mentioning that Inotera will have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment levels and cadence, followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.Going forward, the acquisitions of Elpida and Rexchip (now known as Micron Memory Japan, Inc. and Micron Memory Taiwan Co., Ltd., respectively) will increase Micron’s traction in the memory market.Micron is positive about the product launches and growing demand, particularly that of SSD products. We also believe that any increase in prices will have a favorable impact on the company’s overall results. We anticipate these benefits to be a tailwind for the company, going forward.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard, Inc.

144,ATVI,"After weeks of shaky trading, the Wall Street continued its second-largest bull run, dodging the list of woes including geopolitical tension, Washington turmoil, elevated valuations, the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey & Irma as well as rounds of downbeat economic data.In particular, the S&P 500 is in the spotlight, with the index breaching the 2,500 milestone for the first time, bringing its year-to-date gains to nearly 12%. According to Bloomberg, this rally overtook the 266% increase in the index during the 1949-56 bull run and added almost $20 trillion to the value of American equities. The journey of 100 points came in less than four months, suggesting strong complacency in the stock market.Renewed hopes for Trump’s tax reform by the end of the year is the main catalyst in driving the stock market to new highs. Additionally, steady economic fundamentals and strong corporate earnings added to the strength.

The ETF is the low cost choice in the space, charging 4 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in solid volume of 3.4 million shares a day on average.The fund has gained 13.1% in the year-to-date time frame and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.

145,ATVI,"Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google continues to grapple with legal hassles as it faces fresh allegations for practicing pay discrimination against its female workforce. The suit was filed on Thursday in San Francisco Superior Court on behalf of former women employees Kelly Ellis, Holly Pease, and Kelli Wisuri who accused Google of placing women employees in lower career paths. They also say that the company is paying them lower salaries and bonuses than their male peers.The suit claims that Google violated the California Equal Pay Act and urged the court to compel it to pay for damages and correct its hiring practices.We observe that Alphabet has gained 17.7% year to date, outperforming the 14.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.James Finberg, a San Francisco attorney and the lawyer for the plaintiffs stated that ""this lawsuit is an effort to pull down the barriers and shatter the stereotypes."" He added, ""We can bring about positive change not only at Google but at other companies in the Silicon Valley"".Finberg expects the lawsuit to attain class action status and represent all women who worked for Google in California over the last four years.Google’s ReactionSenior manager of corporate communications at Google, Gina Scigliano wrote in an email that the company does not agree with the lawsuit’s central allegations.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Alphabet Inc. Quote“Job levels and promotions are determined through rigorous hiring and promotion committees, and must pass multiple levels of review, including checks to make sure there is no gender bias in these decisions,” she wrote. She added “And we have extensive systems in place to ensure that we pay fairly”.Does the Gap Really Exist?Earlier this month, The New York Times published salary data shared by around 1,200 Googlers (roughly 2% of the company’s global workforce) in the United States.The data containing salary and bonus information for 2017 disclosed that women make less than men in 5 out of 6 job levels. At level 3, the entry level for technical positions, women get 4% less in salary and bonus than men. The gap widens to 6% at level 5. Google said that the spreadsheet information ignored a number of important factors such as employee location, position and performance.The lawsuit itself cites data from a 2015 review of Google’s employment practices by the contract compliance unit of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). A statistical regression analysis performed by the agency on pay of about 21,000 employees of the tech giant’s Mountain View office revealed “systemic compensation disparities against women.”Notably, earlier this year, the company was sued by DOL for not revealing employee pay information that the department seeks regularly for compliance evaluation.According to David Gottlieb, a civil rights attorney at Wigdor LLP in New York, despite U.S. companies and the society at large taking steps in favor of equality, gender-based pay disparity against women continues.Is Google in Trouble?The charges are disgraceful for a brand that apparently has always been vocal about its stand against any gender-based disparity. According to Fortune, on Equal Pay Day (Apr 4, 2017), Google used the Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) platform to announce that it has “closed the gender pay gap globally.”However, amid repeated gender disparity charges, this claim can now be taken with a pinch of salt. If Google’s found guilty, it will not only lead to a hefty penalty but also affect its brand image.Alphabet is already mired in legal troubles practically across all continents, which have earned it a bad name on privacy concerns, anti-competitive concerns, patent infringements, tax theft and what have you.Recently, the European Commission (“EC”) slapped a record $2.9 billion fine on the company for favoring Google Shopping/Google Product Search/Froogle over comparison shopping services of competitors. Google has appealed against this fine.The company has two other cases pending. One of these is related to Google using the Android platform to force hardware makers bundle Google services and prevent the preloading of rival services on the devices. The other involves restricting access to ads provided by its competitors, which might hit its core AdSense business. Therefore, investors remain wary.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAlphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard, Inc.

146,ATVI,"Share price of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $180.11, eventually closing at the same price on Sep 15. The stock has rallied 68.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 22.1% gain of the industry it belongs to.Also, we note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 34.54%.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter 2018 has increased 20.5% to 94 cents over the last 60 days. For fiscal 2018, estimates increased 17.3% to $3.6 per share over the same time frame.What’s Backing the Rally?NVIDIA’s performance is primarily attributable to growth across all the four platforms, namely the GPUs gaming platform, Professional Visualization, datacenter and Tegra automotive platforms. The company’s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned. We also believe that the higher adoption of NVIDIA’s Tegra processors will act as a catalyst, going ahead.Also, NVIDIA growing strength in the artificial intelligence (AI) space has positively impacted its results. The company’s efforts toward autonomous vehicle and the AI segment reflect its intention to be the largest player in the self-driving and machine learning arena too.Notably, in the last reported quarter, the company entered into a number of AI partnerships with the likes of Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta, and Wistron. Demand for NVIDIA’s DGX AI supercomputer is also high as more organizations are keen on building AI-enabled applications.Further, its focus on GRID platforms can increase GPU adoption in data centers, giving it an advantage against its competitors.NVIDIA’s latest collaboration with Square Enix to unveil Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition for PC in Gamescom 2017 is aimed at bringing an enhanced gaming experience to PCs. This deal is a positive for NVIDIA, as it will help the company gain market share among gaming content developers. We believe that NVIDIA’s GameWorks suite of tools, which improve the visual effects of games, will help to generate additional demand for its graphics technology.NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteNotably, the company has a market cap of $108.1 billion.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other key picks in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

148,ATVI,"VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) recently announced that about 1.3 million domain names were registered in second-quarter 2017.According to the latest “The Domain Name Industry Brief”, domain name registrations increased 0.4% sequentially to approximately 331.9 million across top-level domains (TLDs) at the end of the quarter. Domain name registrations increased 6.7 million or 2.1%, year over year.Country Code Top-Level Domains (“ccTLDs”) increased 2.6% year over year and 0.8% sequentially to 144.2 million in the June 2017 quarter. The increase was noted across all Top-Level Domains (TLDs) as both .com and .net grew during the quarter. On a combined basis, .com and .net domain names improved 0.8% year over year to approximately 144.3 million in the second quarter.The company is benefiting from strong gTLD prospects. New gTLDs (“ngTLD”) represent 7.3% of total domain name registrations.Reportedly, new .com and .net registrations were 9.2 million compared with 8.6 million in the year-ago quarter. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).Shares of VeriSign have gained 37.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the 27% rally of the industry it belongs to.Domain Registration ProspectsVeriSign is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).The company announced a new agreement with ICANN per which the annual fee for a .net domain name registration will be increased from $8.20 to $9.02 effective Feb. 1, 2018. However, the other terms of the agreement remain unchanged.VeriSign also raised its domain name base growth rate guidance for 2017. The company now anticipates the same to grow between 2% and 2.75%, up from its earlier forecast of 1% to 2.5%.VeriSign, Inc. Price VeriSign, Inc. Price | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteGoing ahead, for the third quarter, VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase in the range of 0.8 million to 1.3 million.Also, gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results in our view. The company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as in international markets. We believe that increasing domain name registration coupled with price hikes for domain names will drive the top line.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

149,ATVI,"Per media reports, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) has furnished “detailed” records on Russian ad spending during U.S. Presidential elections to special counsel, Robert Mueller. This was in response to Mueller obtaining a search warrant against the tech giant.There has been a widespread speculation that Russia meddled with 2016 U.S. presidential elections that resulted in Donald Trump’s victory. To investigate this, the Department of Justice (DoJ) appointed Mueller, an ex FBI chief.Per Wall Street Journal, the furnished records include details of the accounts and the copies of ads and the targeted audience. Almost a fortnight back, Facebook revealed to Congress that it identified Russian accounts (about 470) spending nearly $100,000 in ads (over 3K) coinciding with the U.S. election (from June of 2015 to May of 2017), causing a massive uproar.Facebook, Inc. Price Facebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. QuoteThe report also added that Facebook might not have disclosed all information to Congress for fear of Privacy Law violation or disturbing the probe by DoJ. Also, Facebook feared that revealing everything to Congress escalated chances of a leak compared to furnishing details to DoJ.Business Insider quoted ex federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti who said that the warrant implies that “Mueller has concluded that specific foreign individuals committed a crime by making a 'contribution' in connection with an election.""Mariotti further added, ""That has implications for Trump and his associates, too. It is a crime to know that a crime is taking place and to help it succeed. That's aiding and abetting. If any Trump associate knew about the foreign contributions that Mueller's search warrant focused on and helped that effort in a tangible way, they could be charged.""However, there has been no word from Mueller’s office while Facebook has maintained that it will cooperate with the concerned authorities.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year.

150,ATVI,"Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI yesterday took the wraps off its first educational robot designed for middle and high school students.Known as TI-Innovator Rover, the company claims it to be the first-of-its-kind calculator-controlled robotic car. The machine will have a wider rollout in the United States and Canada this fall and in Europe early next year.We observe that Texas Instruments stock has gained 14.1% year to date, underperforming the 18.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.How Does It Work?Students can write programs on Rover’s graphing calculator based on which it moves and draws things. The basic idea is to help students learn science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects in an easy, interesting, enjoyable and interactive way.The machine helps students individually or collaboratively explore various STEM topics and concepts and efficiently work on basic as well as advanced STEM, coding and robotics projects. Even students less accustomed to coding and robotics, can use Rover through basic programs. It has been built particularly for classroom use.President of TI Education Technology, Peter Balyta stated, ""Given the sheer joy we have seen on students' faces as they learned to code during our testing phase, we are excited to see how Rover will inspire more young minds through an introduction to robotics.""Texas Instruments Incorporated Net Income (TTM) Texas Instruments Incorporated Net Income (TTM) | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteOur TakeTI’s robotic subsystem aims at building new capacities and features for robots used in industrial, medical, logistics and service applications. The latest move appears to be a part of this effort. The company leverages on its expertise in analog and embedded products and systems in the process. The move is evidence of Texas Instruments’ R&D investments in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderTexas Instruments carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

151,ATVI,"Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) has set up monetization eligibility standards to make it clear that creators and publishers, which meet its strict guidelines, will be eligible to earn money on its platform. The social media giant called it part of its efforts to improve products/experience for all its users and creators/advertisers by bringing more “clarity” and “transparency''.Per Facebook, creator/publishers have to abide by its Community Standards, Payment Terms and Page Terms. Repeated failure to comply with these terms will result into removal of access to the company’s monetization features. In the blog post, Facebook stated, “Creators and publishers must have an authentic, established presence on Facebook — they are who they represent themselves to be, and have had a profile or Page on Facebook for at least one month. Additionally, some of our features like Ad Breaks require a sufficient follower base, something that could extend to other features over time.""     Facebook, Inc. Price Facebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. QuoteThe company further added, “Those who share content that repeatedly violates our Content Guidelines for Monetization, share clickbait or sensationalism, or post misinformation and false news may be ineligible or may lose their eligibility to monetize.”This move is widely seen as Facebook’s efforts to avoid brand safety issues, which plagued Google’s YouTube earlier this year.This year in March, YouTube ran into trouble with advertisers as it was reported that some ads ran before some extremist videos, prompting advertisers to withdraw their ad spots, per media reports. Consequently, Google had to tighten its ad policy to lure advertisers back.Per a Bloomberg report, the recent uproar caused by Facebook’s revelation of Russian accounts spending nearly $100,000 in ads ahead of the U.S. election has mounted advertisers' concerns. Already, advertisers have been wary as the service has been under fire for quite some time now given the extensive dissemination of fake news on its platform. The victory of Donald Trump is widely credited to fake news circulation on social media. Plus, there has been widespread speculation that Russia indeed meddled with 2016 U.S Presidential elections resulting in Trump’s victory.Putting in place stringent measures like this is the need of the hour for Facebook as it launches its dedicated video viewing tab, Watch. The company is currently testing in-stream video ad breaks with publishers creating content for Watch.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year.

152,ATVI,"Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) eagerly awaited event went ahead as expected with the launch of Apple Watch Series 3, a new Apple 4 K TV and three new iPhone editions namely iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and the mega edition, iPhone X (called iPhone “ten”).The event was held at Steve Jobs Theater at Apple’s new spaceship campus in Cupertino. The event began with a Steve Jobs voice over followed by CEO Tim Cook’s homage to the legend. Cook said it was only fitting that “Steve should open his theater.”iPhone X UnveiledThe mega edition was biggest highlight of the event and was unveiled towards the end of the event. Just like the rumors, the phone has end-to-end curved OLED display with a facial recognition technology that unlocks the phone as well as helps to make secure payments via Apple Pay.It supports wireless charging and is resistant to microscopic dust and water. It also has the A11 bionic chip. Apple added that with the new A11 bionic chip, augmented reality games and apps “reach a new level of fluidity and realism.”Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteApple claims that it will not be easy to fool the Face ID technology though an “evil twin” could compromise the ID. The technology is powered by the TrueDepth camera that boasts a flood illuminator, infrared camera, dot projector, front camera and ambient light sensors. Machine learning enables Face ID to adjust with physical changes in facial appearance over time.The Home button has been done away with. Users will just have to swipe up to access the home screen.The iPhone X has 5.8” Super Retina Display with 2046×1125 resolution and 458 PPI. The camera is way better than the earlier iPhones. The iPhone X has 12 MP dual cameras with faster sensors and f/1.8 and f/2.4 apertures.Then there is also animoji, an app that deploys 3D technology to create emojis that imitate the users’ expression.The starting price of the phone is at $999. Preorders begin Oct 27 and phones will be available from Nov 3.Launch Delay A Concern?Here is our concern. The delay in launch of iPhone X somewhat confirms supply chain issues as has been widely reported. With the November launch, the sales won’t be included in this fiscal.Also, we believe the new iPhone is definitely an upgrade over its predecessors but doesn’t have exclusive features. Samsung phones already have this. Its price point is also a cause of concern for masses but won’t deter buyers who are looking to get their hands on the new phone to boost their status symbol. Also, support for AR apps is expected to prove a major draw.Per reports, sales in America are unlikely to be impacted but China sales could be affected as the $1000 price tag is double the average Chinese monthly salary.Moreover, the other two models release just a month and a half prior to iPhone X. Consumers can definitely hold their purchases for some more time and this could cannibalize iPhone 8 and 8 Plus sales, thereby impacting the current quarter’s sales.Let’s Have a Look at Other AnnouncementsiPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: Apple’s iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are the new generation of iPhones with an all new glass design. The glass design is further reinforced by internal laser welded steel. Apple has called it “the most durable glass ever in a smartphone”. It also supports wireless charging and is resistant to microscopic dust and water. The stereo speakers are 25% louder then iPhone 7.It comes with retina HD display (4.7” for 8 and 5.5” for 8 Plus) with iPad’s True Tone color display and 3D touch. The True Tone technology helps to adjust white balance to match the light in the surrounding environment. The new editions phones also carry A11 Bionic chips that have four efficiency cores that are 70% faster than A10 Fusion chips. It has two performance cores whose capacity has now enhanced 25%. It also carries Apple’s own designed three core GPU, which is up to 30% faster than A10 Fusion.Coming to the camera, as widely expected, there have been a number of developments. The new phones feature a 12 MP camera that has upgraded color filter and deeper pixels. The portrait mode is better with “dual cameras and new facial land marking” helping to create studio like dramatic lighting effect.The starting price of these phones is $699 and $799, respectively, for 64 GB version and they come in three different colors including a new gold finish. Preorders begin Sep 15 and the phones will be available from Sep 22.Apple Watch Series 3: Apple has taken a major leap forward with the new Watch series by integrating cellular connectivity. The new Watch (with watch OS4 operating system) will have a built-in LTE cellular connection, thereby eliminating the need to be connected to an iPhone. Users do not need a new number for getting cellular connection on their watches.Chief financial officer, Jeff Williams called it the “ultimate expression of Apple Watch.” Users can call, text as well as access GPS and third party applications like WeChat. Also, with integrated cellular and Apple Music, 40 million songs are available for streaming on your wrist, added Williams. And, yes, for the first time Siri can talk to Watch users now.All this has been made possible by the new dual core processor, which is 70% faster than its predecessor. To work around the problem of an antenna for the cellular, Apple has turned the display into a cellular antenna. It also has an electronic SIM and a barometric altimeter. Its battery life is over 18 hours.Apple will take orders (watch with cellular) from Sep 15 and the device will be available from Sep 22 in nine countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland in partnership with 14 carriers initially.The non-cellular version will be available in 26 countries (China, Canada and Australia among others) post launch.The watch (with cellular connection), which costs $399 will be available in a variety of colors namely gold, aluminum, silver and space grey. Users will have a range of bands to choose from including the sport loop. Watch Series 3 without cellular is priced at $329. Series 1 price has been slashed to $249.As far as OS4 is concerned, it has a plethora of health benefit features including GymKit, smart activity coaching and new features for swimmers like auto set as well as a workout feature for high intensity interval training. Williams added that Apple’s heart rate monitor will now be on Watch face and there is a feature that will alert the user about an increase in heart rate when the person is in a state of rest. Apple wants its users to be aware of cardiac arrhythmia, a major cause of a stroke.Apple 4K TV: The new Apple TV has two new features called 4K resolution and High Dynamic Range (HDR) streaming capacity. User Interface has been revamped in the 4K TV. Users can now see all 4K content across leading studios on iTunes at the price of HD. 4K content from Netflix and Amazon will also be available on 4KTV. Live sports will be available on 4K TV.The new 4K TV boasts a new tvOS and has an A10x processor with CPU performance twice as faster and graphics performance four times faster than the current Apple TV.Apple TV App will be made available in seven more countries by this year, starting with Canada and Australia.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year.

153,ATVI,"On Sep 12, we issued an updated research report on technology firm, AMETEK Inc. (AME  -  Free Report).AMETEK is a leading worldwide manufacturer of electronic appliances and electromechanical devices. The company sells its products globally through two major operating groups, the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). Growth DriversManagement has been making strategies to improve its productivity, increase organic sales through global market expansion and new product development. This, in turn, has helped AMETEK to build an excellent backlog that has resulted in solid performance.Solid execution and global market expansion are other positives.Moreover, the company’s strong business portfolio serves as another growth driver. In fact, AMETEK has been consistently introducing new and improved products that added to its vastly differentiated product pipeline. Some of the recent launches include Custom Cooling Systems, the new DC power supply and high-speed camera.The consistent product introductions by the company generate customer loyalty and facilitate market share gains, thereby boosting revenues. Evidently, products introduced over the last three years made up 24% of revenues. This indicates that the company is not only good at developing products but also at marketing them.Also, AMETEK supplements organic growth with strategic acquisitions. For this purpose, it generally looks for niche players that complement one of its many product lines or round out its portfolio.Recently, the company completed the acquisition of instrumentation provider, MOCON, Inc. for $30 per share in cash or a total value of about $182 million. The deal will compliment its existing gas analysis instrumentation business. MOCON’s products will provide opportunities to AMETEK to further expand into the growing food and pharmaceutical package testing market.Estimate revision trends for 2017 also remain favorable with 10 estimates moving north and none moving in the opposite direction in the last 60 days. Additionally, earnings estimates climbed 1.6% to $2.52 per share over the same time frame.HeadwindsNotably, AMETEK has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have gained 33.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 37.4% in the same time period.A major portion of AMETEK’s revenues is generated from operations outside the United States. Also, significant dollar strength and adverse foreign currency fluctuations erode the profitability of the company. Therefore, sales in 2016 suffered 1% from foreign currency headwinds.Furthermore, though acquisitions are a part of AMETEK’s growth strategy, unsuccessful execution and integration of new buyouts and an increase in acquisition costs due to stiff competition is likely to negatively impact its sales/margin performance. AMTEK, Inc.

155,ATVI,"Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) flagship offering, iPhone could surpass $1 trillion in sales by the end of 2018 bolstered by iPhone X, per a report by TheStreet, which quoted research firm Strategy Analytics.The revolutionary iPhone, released first in June 2007, had changed the world forever and catapulted Apple to new highs. Apple co-founder and the then CEO Steve Jobs had said that iPhone was a blend of three devices, namely, a ""widescreen iPod with touch controls"", a ""revolutionary mobile phone"" and a ""breakthrough Internet communicator"". The original iPhone was powered by an ARM-based 1176JZ (F)-S processor and had a PowerVR MBX Lite 3D graphics chip. It had a 1400mAH battery.Upon release, the phone received terrific response. The success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled. Reportedly, Apple has sold over 1.2 billion iPhones across the globe earning over $760 billion in revenues. Valuation Could Also Hit $1 TrillionSince the first iPhone release, Apple shares have skyrocketed compared with the industry to which it belongs. Over the last decade, Apple stock has returned 826% while the industry witnessed a rally of 387%.The new iPhone is widely considered to be a super cycle. The edition is expected to be far better than its predecessors with features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C), higher storage options and a far superior camera.There are also speculations that robust iPhone X sales will make Apple the first company to touch the $1 trillion valuation mark. Currently, Apple’s market cap is $834 billion. Its shares have increased about 36% year over year and hit a 52-week high of $165. Shares are currently trading at $161.50.Per a Fortune report, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity Michael Walkley said that if Apple can sell 46.5 million and 84 million units in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, it will represent a 5% gain from the same period last year. Consequently, he expects share price to hit $180. Apple shares need to add another $15 to reach the magical market cap figure, observe analysts.Apple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. QuoteIs the Price Point an Impediment?However, it is the price point that has been considered by many as an impediment to sales. The new phone is likely to carry a price tag of more than $1000. Many analysts observe that consumers may not be willing to spend that much on a phone whose features aren’t exactly exclusive. For instance, Samsung phones have OLED display and wireless charging options.The debate over the exorbitant price has been raging on for some time now. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions with 256GB storage carry price tags of $849 and $969, respectively. So a price tag north of $1000 should not be considered unreasonable for a fully redesigned OLED iPhone 8.iPhone (4GB model) was priced at $499 way back in 2007, which was unheard of back then. Yet, Apple scored a home run with the device. The power of Apple’s fan base though cannot be undermined but with this edition, their loyalty will be tested strongly. Per a Reuters report, iPhone sales in the United States aren’t likely to be badly disrupted because of the price point. An analyst with Loup Ventures was quoted saying that four out of five consumers who have earlier bought a new iPhone are likely to buy iPhone X. Plus, discounts offered by carriers will also make the price tag affordable.However, the Reuters report adds that price point could dim iPhone X’s China prospects. The $1000 price tag is double the average Chinese monthly salary. Following the roaring response to iPhone 6, the next edition saw a much subdued response in Greater China, which is Apple’s third biggest market as it was widely perceived that the new edition does not have much new to offer compared with its predecessors, adds the report further.In the last reported quarter, sales declined 10% year over year to $8 billion. Over the past few quarters, Apple’s iPhone sales have been marred, especially in China, by increasing competition from cheaper handsets like Oppo and Vivo. With iPhone X, Apple is looking to reverse that trend.Reuters quoted Mo Jia, a Shanghai-based analyst at Canalys, “Apple really needs to launch a very innovative product this time around.

158,ATVI,"It seems that the massive Seattle headquarters are not enough to support the continuously growing Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). It is gearing up for a second headquarter in North America that can accommodate as many as 50,000 employees and spending $5 billion for it.Yesterday, the company announced plans for what it calls Amazon HQ2 and sought submission of response to its request for proposal (RFP). Amazon said that jobs at HQ2 will mostly be in software development with average annual compensation of $100,000 over 15 years.Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos stated, “We expect HQ2 to be a full equal to our Seattle headquarters.”We observe that Amazon shares have gained 28.8% year to date, underperforming the 46.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Set Criteria Indicate Meaningful ExpansionAmazon prefers urban or suburban but metropolitan locations, home to more than 1 million people, offering a stable and business-friendly environment, real estate options and with resources to attract strong technical talent.The location need not have to offer an urban or downtown campus, a layout resembling Amazon’s Seattle campus or a development-prepped site. Notably, Amazon has stressed on “communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options.”The stated preferences indicate that a massive and more meaningful expansion is on its way. The expansion of headquarters straightway indicates expansion of global operations, which is actually happening and the company needs to support that from its core. The company is surely thinking several years down the road.Amazon is one of the world’s fastest growing companies with fingers in almost every pie. The company has been ramping up its efforts in both online and brick-and-mortar retail leveraging on its solid loyalty system in Prime and its Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) strategy.Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteAmazon Web Services (AWS) remains the cloud infrastructure leader and continues to grow on partners and consumers. The company is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa. Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services.It has recently made two big acquisitions that of Whole Foods and Souq.com, accelerating its choice of buy option over build.Smoothened Relations with the White HouseAmazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos and President-elect Donald Trump did not seem to have good relations during the presidential campaign. But things appear to be easing after the results as Bezos was among the leading technology industry executives to meet Trump.The President-elect has urged technology leaders to create and retain jobs within the United States. Since then. Amazon has frequently made announcements related to job creation in the United States.Cities Racing to Win AmazonToronto, Dallas, Houston, St. Louis, Kentucky and Miami are among the many that have expressed interest. We expect many more to come forward and the bidding to be fierce.Amazon has launched a special website where representatives of cities and regional economic development organizations can put up their responses to the proposal. The company wants to wind up the response acceptance process by October and final selection by 2018.Economic Development in FocusAmazon in its press release notes that from 2010 to 2016, the company’s investments in Seattle have generated an economic impact of $38 billion in the city. That’s an additional 1.4 dollars against each dollar invested in Seattle by Amazon.City and state heads are surely eyeing a repetition of Amazon’s economic impact on Seattle’s in their own areas and thus have started gearing up to grab the opportunity.Currently, cities and states are increasingly attracting technology companies as they bring in huge employment opportunities and attract other businesses, thus boosting the overall economy. They are ready to give away massive benefits mainly in the form of tax breaks in return as they know that economic development often outweighs loss in tax.Growth at the Cost of Margins?Amazon’s global margins are likely to be under pressure at least for a few years. Amazon continues to invest heavily on fulfillment centers, TV shows and movies, AWS, acquisitions, India expansion and what not. The proposed 5 billion investments on its second headquarters is just another example.Amazon has never hesitated to sacrifice margins to pursue its long-term objectives - bringing more customers under its umbrella and giving them reasons to stay. Since it generates significant cash from operations and holds a huge cash balance, management has the flexibility to pursue even more growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

164,ATVI,"The investing world is at present tousled with geopolitics, domestic politics, natural disasters like hurricanes and mixed economic data points. But this doesn’t mean that Wall Street activities will stop.Even in a shaky market like this, people are busy investing, but with greater caution. Naturally, what every investor would want now is a quality pick. Stocks that are likely to beat earnings estimates fall in that category. After all, it is a positive earnings surprise or a beat that matters the most, irrespective of earnings growth.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if it has been decelerating.Seasonal fluctuations also come into play. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.It’s only after significant research and analysis on a company’s financials and initiatives that Wall Street analysts project its earnings. They also take a company’s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. If the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Locate Potential Outperformers? Investors tend to look for stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line but might not always succeed. One way of identifying the winners beforehand is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company.An impressive track record in this regard generally acts as a driver. It indicates the company’s ability to exceed estimates. Investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3-5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 13.Here are five out of 13 stocks that passed the screen:Guess?, Inc.

165,ATVI,"The rise of new technologies has greatly influenced the video game and toy industry in recent years. New platforms are popping up all the time, and the proliferation of smartphones has expanded the reach and ease of which people can play video games.Of course, this can also negatively impact the amount of money spent on physical toys, and with free-to-play video games everywhere, it has forced the legacy industry to evolve. But with more platforms and games overall, along with the rise of E-sports—a new multi-billion dollar industry centered around competitive gaming—there is simply more money to go around.Let’s take a look at a few companies with great Zacks Ranks that also have the ability to profit in the changing toy and video game sector.Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report)Activision Blizzard, the maker of widely popular video games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, is coming off a better-than-expected second quarter. The company posted revenues of $1.63 billion, which marked a 4% increase year-over-year. More impressively, Activision Blizzard’s net revenues from its digital channels jumped 15% to $1.31 billion.Activision Blizzard boasted 407 million monthly active users last quarter. The Blizzard leg of the company saw its monthly online player community pop by 38% from the year-ago period to a new record of 46 million.Activision Blizzardstock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s 81.56% year-to-date price change blows away the industry average of 14.36%, and we’ve seen six positive revisions to Activision Blizzard’s full-year earnings estimates within the past 60 days. The video game giant has also only missed earnings estimates once in the last 14 quarters.Shares of Activision Blizzardrest just below its all-time intraday trading high of $66.58 a share, which it reached in late August, but this stock could break into a new range soon if the company continues to impress.Nintendo Co., Ltd. (NTDOY  -  Free Report)Legendary video game maker Nintendo has experienced a resurgence in 2017. The company’s most recent quarterly revenues soared almost 150% year-over-year to $1.37 billion.Nintendo’s sales jumped based on strong demand for its new Switch consoles. The company projects it will sell 10 million Switch consoles, which retail at $299.99, during its current fiscal year.Nintendo has received three upward earnings estimates revisions for this year, as well as two for next year, within the last 60 days. The company’s sales growth is projected at 70.68% for the current year, which is well ahead of the Toy – Games – Hobbies industry average of 6.40%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Nintendo’s revenues projects 80.96% growth in the current quarter.Our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 203.59% this fiscal year. That expansion is projected to continue, with current consensus estimates calling for 61.73% EPS growth in the next fiscal year.Shares of Nintendo currently sit a few dollars below its 52-week high of $44.25 a share, which it reached right after it reported its most recent earnings in late July. Nintendo is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), so the stock could be poised to move higher soon.Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report)Toy making giant Hasbro is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and scored a “B” grade for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system. The company is coming off a strong second quarter that saw its revenues pop by 11% to hit $972.5 million.Hasbro’s U.S. and Canadian sales jumped by 16%, which helped operating profit increase 18% to $100 million. Hasbro stock currently sits well below its 52-week high of $116.20 a share, at roughly $94 a share, which means the stock has plenty of room to grow before investors even need to think about testing a new range.Moreover, the company, which makes Nerf, Play-Doh, Transformers, and many more toys, has received five positive earnings estimate revisions for next quarter, full-year 2017, and next year within the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for 15.24% EPS growth in the next quarter and a 13.64% pop for the full year.Our consensus estimate currently calls for $1.63 billion worth of sales next quarter, which would mark an 11.52% year-over-year jump. We also project full-year revenues to climb 8.10%.Bottom LineAlthough many industries are being negatively impacted by the growth of e-commerce, this sector might be poised to expand along with it.Activision Blizzard’s games and Nintendo’s products have loyal and ever-growing user bases, and Hasbro makes some of the most beloved toys and board games on the planet. At the end of the day, these strong Zacks Rank stocks are poised to grow overall, and they are also headed into the always-vital holiday quarter.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

166,ATVI,"Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google has collaborated with China’s Xiaomi to revive its Android One program in India. Android One powers Xiaomi Mi A1, a new $234 (14,999 rupees) handset that was launched in the country yesterday.Google Global Director of Android Partner Programmes, Jon Gold told reporters that, ""I would not consider this a reboot... we have been working in this direction now for a couple of years just a little bit more quietly.""Alphabet shares have rallied 16.5% over the last year, outperforming the 12.7% gain of the industry it belongs to.A Strategic ChangeGoogle introduced the program in India in 2014 to make high-quality budget smartphones available to as many people as possible in developing economies. Under this initiative, Google designed the budget hardware while local companies like Micromax, Spice and Karbonn manufactured it. All devices were priced below $110 (7,000 rupees).But very few devices were launched leading to speculations that Google will do away with the program. The attempt was apparently a failure due to availability of phones with better specifications in that price range.However, Google appears to have solved this problem by shifting focus to a phone that is at a comparatively higher price point and loaded with nice specifications. The Mi A1 is Xiaomi’s first dual-rear camera phone that features 12 MP wide angle camera and a 12 MP telephoto camera.Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM) Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Alphabet Inc.

Frequent updates will be there with Android Oreo expected before the year end and Android P in the future.Again, Xiaomi is one of the world’s top five smartphone companies and ranks second in India. It appears that Google is banking on Xiaomi’s success to expand its market share and Android user base.The Android AdvantageGoogle is pushing Android to multiple markets (low, mid and high range smartphone users). Not only does it help the company to build search market share but also to drive sales of apps and digital products through Google Play.The move is also part of the company’s bid to improve advertising tools by facilitating the linking of search results with apps as well as deep linking between apps. The company connects advertising campaigns across mobile and desktop platforms and that boosts advertisers’ return on investment.Mobile app indexing and Mobile Friendly algorithm change will improve user experience and thus drive the next phase of revenue growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAlphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

169,ATVI,"The buzz surrounding Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone 8 is growing louder as we approach its big event to be held on Sep 12, 2017.Apple is expected to unveil the latest iPhone to mark its tenth anniversary. It will be a huge leap in terms of innovation with features likea glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C) and higher storage options. The camera is likely to be far better than its predecessors.OLED display is being increasingly adopted as it comes with improved brightness, contrast and efficiency compared with LCD or Plasma displays. Television sets have long been equipped with OLED displays. Smartphones are also catching up fast.Per reports, the company has ordered nearly 100 million OLED screens from Samsung Electronics. Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteThere are humongous expectations from the iPhone 8 cycle. However, it is the price point that is seen as a potential threat to iPhone 8’s sales. Reportedly, iPhone 8 could be priced more than $1,000 dollars.  Many analysts observe that consumers may not be willing to spend that much amount on a phone whose features aren’t exactly exclusive. For instance, Samsung phones have OLED display and wireless charging options.However, an analyst with Barclays observed that providing freebies with iPhone 8 could make the $1000 tag more reasonable. Per a survey conducted, Barclays’ analyst points out that if the average selling price (ASP) drops to $800 from $1000, users’ buying intention will double from 18% to 36%.Survey shows that if Apple could include a one-year free subscription to Apple Music and iCloud storage, which otherwise costs about $156, iPhone 8 sales may increase to 64 million in 2018. Currently, without the freebies, the sales figure is lower by 24 million.However, another analyst has observed that though the idea of providing freebies isn’t crazy but with Apple, it might simply not be possible.He argues that demand for a new iPhone has always been “off the charts”. A redesigned iPhone 8 will simply do not have dearth of buyers.More importantly, giving out freebies is just not Apple’s business model. It thrives on selling “premium products at premium prices”. Therefore, Apple bundling services to boost iPhone 8 is just not possible, adds the analyst.The debate over the exorbitant price has been raging on for some time now. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions with 256GB storage carry price tags of $849 and $969, respectively. So a price tag north of $1000 should not be considered unreasonable for a fully redesigned OLED iPhone 8.iPhone (4GB model) was priced at $499 way back in 2007, which was unheard of back then. Yet, Apple scored a home run with the device. The power of Apple’s fan base cannot be undermined.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past one year. Shares of Apple have surged 52.3% compared with the industry’s 50.7% increase.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Operating cash flow for the quarter was $265 million.OutlookFor 2017, Activision expects GAAP revenues of $6.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.05 compared with an earlier projection of revenues of $6.1 billion and earnings per share of $0.88. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues and earnings are expected to be $6.4 billion and $1.94 per share, respectively, against an earlier projection of revenues of $6.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.80. Deferral revenues are expected around $175 million.For third-quarter 2017, Activision anticipates GAAP revenues of $1.385 billion and earnings per share of $0.09. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues and earnings are likely to be $1.385 billion and $0.34 per share, respectively. Deferral revenues are expected to be around $315 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend for fresh estimates. There have been eight revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and Consensus  Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and Consensus | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Activision's stock has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. The stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate investors will probably be better served looking elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock. The magnitude of these revisions also looks promising. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We are expecting an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

172,ATVI,"Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) has sent out invitations to the media for a big event to be held on Sep 12, 2017 at the Steve Jobs Theater at its new headquarters located at Cupertino, CA, per reports.Apple usually holds a big event in September to reveal its latest offerings, which start retailing a week after the event.However, for a long time now, there has been tremendous buzz about this year’s event as Apple is expected to unveil the tenth anniversary iPhone edition along with Phone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, which are updates to its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions unveiled last year.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteNicknamed as iPhone 8, Apple’s mega edition phone has caught the fancy of one and all. Apple is likely to make a big innovation leap with iPhone 8. It is rumored to have features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C) and higher storage options. The camera is likely to be far better than its predecessors.Reportedly, iPhone 8 will be the first of its kind to support OLED display. Per reports, the company has ordered nearly 100 million OLED screens from Samsung Electronics. OLED display is being increasingly adopted as it comes with improved brightness, contrast and efficiency compared with LCD or Plasma displays. Television sets have long been equipped with OLED displays. Smartphones are also catching up fast.Expectations regarding the upcoming iPhone 8 are humongous. The revolutionary iPhone, first released in June 2007 had changed the world forever. The iPhone was the first phone to have a touch screen and was a ""breakthrough internet device"".Upon release, the phone received terrific response. Following that, the success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled. Apple has sold over a billion iPhones across the globe. However, over the past few quarters, Apple’s iPhone sales have been marred by increasing competition from cheaper handsets like Oppo and Vivo.With iPhone 8, Apple’s fortunes in China are expected to get a boost. A survey conducted by Maxim Group in May indicated ""significant pent-up demand"" for iPhone 8 in China. Per Maxim Group, iPhone sales in China will increase 170% year over year to 80.7 million units in fiscal 2018.Also, if we go by the latest report from IDC, Apple will see a 9.1% rise in iPhone shipments next year driven by iPhone 8, iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. Though iPhone 8 is slated for release this year, the majority of shipments are “likely to land early in 2018”, according to IDC. More importantly, average selling price of premium devices (with large screens) will increase 9% by 2021 driven by high-end mobile phones like iPhone 8, Note 8, V30 and more.Apart from the new iPhones, per media reports, Apple could launch a new Apple watch. There could also be a new Apple 4K TV. The company is likely to speak at length about iOS 11 and new MacOS and watchOS.At the WWDC earlier this year, Apple gave a sneak peek into its AR efforts. The company also displayed an augmented reality (AR) tool called ARKit. We expect more on this at the September event along with HomePod.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past one year. Shares of Apple have surged 51.2% compared with the industry’s 50.6% increase.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

173,ATVI,"Not only is September historically the worst month for the equity market, stocks presently look susceptible to a pullback due to Harvey, North Korea tensions and U.S. government shutdown. However, fresh data have indicated that the domestic economy continues to grow at a steady albeit slow pace. Corporate earnings also continue to impress and from a trading perspective, more market participants are expected this month as vacation time comes to an end.Thanks to these encouraging developments, Wall Street is expected to be more disciplined and prepared to withstand the habitually rough trading period. Thus, investing in solid stocks that have given consistent returns this month will be judicious. The Somber September  Investors shouldn’t sell based solely on the calendar, but, this seasonal peculiarity can’t be ignored as we head into a busy month of trading. Since the World War II, the S&P 500 Index has seen losses in September. Also, September has seen the worst monthly drop in equities on average.Stock Trader’s Almanac found out that since 1950, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones averaged a loss of 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite, as incepted in 1971, averaged a loss of 0.5%, as did the Russell 2000 of small-cap stocks since it was started in 1979. Such a dismal performance compelled Jeff deGraaf, head of Renaissance Macro Research, to tell his clients that we are “entering the only month of the year that has statistically significant negative returns.”This year could also spring surprises. With North Korea attacking Japan, hurricane Harvey wreaking havoc and the political climate in the United States losing stability, possibilities of a market correction haunt investors.Market-Jolting Events that Spooked Investors North Korea’s ballistic missile launch over Japanese airspace reignited tensions. This has resumed the logjam between Pyongyang and President Trump that had unnerved markets in August. The South Korea military that was conducting a war game with the United States has been put on alert, while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the missile test an “unprecedented, grave and serious threat that seriously damages peace and security in the region.”On the domestic front, Harvey, the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in almost 12 years, has put vast areas under water. The rainstorm originated from a tropical depression which rapidly ballooned from a Category 1 hurricane to Category 4. It worsened due to a lethal confluence of meteorological events. While it is too early to gauge the financial impact of the hurricane, some experts are calling for losses in the double-digit billions. The hurricane disrupted oil refineries and led to a decline in shares of insurance companies (read more: 4 Home-Improvement Stocks to Buy Post Harvey Mayhem). As if all of that wasn’t enough, anxiety gripping the Wall Street over the debate to raise the federal government’s debt ceiling has frayed relations between President Trump and the Republican leadership. Such disputes, may, further delay the implementation of the promised pro-business policies. In fact, with the disconnect growing, the chances that the government will shut down is 50/50, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS  -  Free Report).Positive Economic Environment & Earnings Buoy MarketsBut, let’s be optimistic. Not everything is as dampening about the markets. The U.S. GDP expanded 3% in the second quarter, the fastest rate of growth in more than two years. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment helped the economy gain traction. Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter. Consumer spending – the biggest driver of the economy – picked up on higher income for consumers and low inflation.The second-quarter earnings season, in the meanwhile, has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 491 S&P 500 members or 98.2% of the index’s total membership already out. Total earnings for these companies are up 11.2% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 74.3% beating EPS estimates and 68.4% beating revenue estimates (read more: Plenty of Small-Cap Earnings Still to Come).Investors Will be Back, Market to See Some UpsideWith the Labor Day fast approaching, the summer months and vacations are soon to be over. During such holiday periods, major market participants don’t make big moves. Big decisions are often postponed. But, once the summer months come to an end and the markets get back to normal, the major decisions are taken.This suggests that trade will increase and market leaders will return and take control of the equity market in a commanding manner. Furthermore, typically after Labor Day, the market is slow for a day or two before things pick up pace.5 Top-Performing Stocks for SeptemberSeptember may be a rocky month for the stock market.

175,ATVI,"Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is facing an antitrust complaint in China. Per Reuters, local developers have accused the iPhone maker of charging exorbitant fees and removing apps from its local store without proper clarification. The complaint is now being reviewed by China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC).Like many other U.S.-based companies, China has been a tough nut to crack for Apple as well. The country is the second largest iPhone market. However, strict regulations have often played havoc with its operations.Per New York Times, last year, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television “asserted its authority” and shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks services after being in operations for not even seven months.Moreover, competition from local players such as Huawei and Oppo is also hindering growth prospects. Additionally, in a bid to promote domestic manufacturers, the Chinese government has created an increasingly challenging regulatory environment for foreign companies to operate.Notably, in the last reported quarter, Apple revenues declined around 10% year over year in the Greater China region to $8 billion. The regulatory issues faced by the company in the region can aggravate the problem further.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteHowever, the company remains optimistic about the long-term growth prospects of the region, especially given the hype surrounding iPhone 8, which is rumored to be launched in Sep 2017. A survey conducted by Maxim Group in May indicates a ""significant pent-up demand"" for iPhone 8 in China. Per Maxim Group, iPhone sales in China will increase 170% year over year to 80.7 million units in fiscal 2018.Notably, shares of Apple have gained 40.7% year to date, slightly outperforming the industry’s 39.9% rally.Notable Moves In ChinaApple has stepped up investment in the country to woo the government in a bid to protect its business interests. The company's optimism regarding the region is further evident from its recent appointment of Isabel Ge Mahe to the newly created post of vice president and managing director of Greater China to “provide leadership and coordination across Apple’s China-based team.”Recently, the company collaborated with local internet services companies to establish its first data center in China that will ensure compliance with the country's newly implemented cyber-security regulations.New York Times reported last month that Apple had taken off virtual private networks (VPN) applications from its China App Store that were used to breach the Great Firewall. Last year, the company had even removed a news app by New York Times following a request by the Chinese government. Such moves from Apple definitely show its cooperation with the Chinese government with respect to Internet censorship.Earlier last year, the company had invested $1 billion in the ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing (DIDI). Moreover, in March, it announced plans to build two R&D centers in Shanghai and Suzhou, Jiangsu province. It established two R&D centers in Beijing and Shenzhen last year.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderApple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

179,ATVI,"Video game publishing giant, Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) released the Call of Duty: WWII Private Multiplayer Beta for pre-order customers on Sony’s PlayStation4 (PS4) systems over the last weekend. Reportedly, the second Private Multiplayer Beta weekend will begin on Sep 1 and run through Sep 4 on PS4 as well as Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One.Per the company, players of the Private Multiplayer Beta will receive the Private Multiplayer Beta Combat Pack, which will include a “specially-themed Private Multiplayer Beta helmet, calling card and emblem.” Apart from that, at select retailers, pre-order customers will also get Divisions Pack comprising “five Premium Gear Sets inspired by the five Divisions in Call of Duty: WWII multiplayer.”Developer Sledgehammer Games revealed that the beta version will deliver only a part of the full multiplayer experience as it plans to implement the feedback in the final game, which is set to release on Nov 3. The company seems to keep the interest of fans brewing by keeping out the brand new Headquarters social space from the beta version.Call of Duty – A Key Growth DriverActivision’s Call of Duty: WWII is the fourteenth installment of Call of Duty and the second game in the series set against the backdrop of World War II after Call of Duty: World at War released in 2008. World at War was one of the bestselling games that year with more than 2.75 million units sold. We believe the release of Call of Duty: WWII in November will have a similar impact and enable the company to make the most of the holiday season.Call of Duty is one of the most important revenue generators for the company. It has always lifted investors’ sentiment and raised expectations for future titles. The company has witnessed strong growth across all the Call of Duty franchises, except the Infinite Warfare title, which recorded relatively lower sales.Notably, last year, the company’s shares were up following the Call of Duty XP event. Earlier, in 2015, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 earned over $550 million, globally, in its opening weekend.We believe the new title will help to sustain the momentum in Activision’s shares, which have gained 73.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 46.7% rally. Other FranchisesActivision’s expanding franchise portfolio that includes offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm will drive growth in the long haul. Notably, the company is also set to launch Destiny 2 on Sep 6, ahead of the holiday season. We believe along with Call of Duty: WWII, Destiny 2 will also be a big revenue driver going ahead.Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteCompetition Activision faces severe competition from its peers like Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) who are stepping up their efforts to gear up for the holiday season. The holiday season is the most important time of the year for video game stocks. Most of the companies generate maximum sales during this time of the year. They go by the idea of ‘saving the best for the last’ and release their most important titles during the holiday season.Take Two, one of the leading names in the video game publishing arena, is driven by its well-known franchises like GTA and NBA2K as well as other franchises like WWE 2K, Mafia, Sid Meir’s Civilisation, BioShock, Battleborn, Max Payne and Red Dead. Reportedly, it is launching the new NBA 2K18 in Sep 2017 and WWE 2K18 on Oct 17.EA’s popularity is driven by franchises like EA SPORTS titles, along with Battlefield, Titanfall and Star Wars. It also has a strong pipeline of new launches, which includes the sequel of the immensely popular action packed game Star Wars Battlefront to be released worldwide on Nov 17.Currently, Activision sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

180,ATVI,"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) recently announced that the pre-ordering volumes of Xbox One X have already surpassed all previous records. Per Gamespot, the Scorpio edition appears to be sold out at retailers.The much awaited device is set to release on Nov 7, for a price of $499.99. The console will be backward compatible with Xbox One and Xbox One S titles which makes it even more lucrative.We believe the launch of this device will improve Microsoft’s market share in the console space, which is currently dominated by Sony (SNE  -  Free Report). Per the IHS Markit data, at the end of 2016, Sony had 57% market share compared with Microsoft’s 26%.Nevertheless, we believe that the latest improvement will not be a massive one, which will narrow the gap between the two consoles, at least in the near term. Despite impressive features, the lower number of exclusive gaming titles seems to be an offset for the positives.Microsoft’s shares have gained 19.2% year to date, underperforming the 24.0% rally of the industry it belongs to.Feature Laden Xbox One X Edges Out PS4 ProIn comparison with Sony's Play Station 4 (PS4) Pro’s four teraflops of processing power running at 2.1 Ghz, the Xbox One X features six teraflops running at 2.3 Ghz. While PS4 Pro has 8 GB of DDR5 memory, the Xbox One X is embedded with 12GB of GDDR5 memory, with 9GB unlocked for developers.The Xbox One X has the capability of playing native 4K at 60 frames per second (fps). Though PS4 offers 4K content, it does not have the feature of handling games at 60 fps. The Xbox One X can play Ultra-HD Blu-ray disks, whereas the PS4 Pro is not capable of playing 4K Blu-rays. However, both consoles have storage space of 1TB.Notably, the difference of price between the two consoles is quite high. PS4 Pro, which is already available in the market for around $399, has a much lower price compared with the upgraded version of Microsoft’s gaming console. The elevated price might be a headwind for the sales volume of Xbox One X.In a recent interview with Eurogamer, Xbox Head Phil Spencer said that Xbox One X is more of a 4K gaming console. Hence, PS4 Pro is more of a competitor to its previous version, Xbox One S, and not the upgraded one.Microsoft Corporation Revenue (TTM) Microsoft Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Microsoft Corporation QuoteLack of Exclusive Games: Headwind for Xbox One XWe believe the lesser number of exclusive games on the upcoming console is a major headwind for Microsoft. A few exclusive games which will be available are Forza 7, Battlegrounds and Cuphead. On the other hand, Sony has a much enriched line-up of exclusive titles for PS4 Pro, namely Gravity Rush 2, Tales Of Berseria, Yakuza 0, Nioh, Horizon Zero Dawn and Persona 5, among many others.Moreover, we anticipate that the delay in the release of Microsoft’s new game Crackdown 3 will be a negative for the sales volume of Xbox One X.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMicrosoft currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space are Activision Blizzard, Inc (ATVI  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Glu Mobile Inc.

183,ATVI,"On Aug 23, we issued an updated research report on toymaker, Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report).Shares of the company have underperformed its industry year to date. While the stock has been up over 16.2%, the industry gained 36.5%.Meanwhile, Hasbro’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has moved down 4.9% in the last two months, the current-year estimate has climbed 3.1%. These mixed expectations indicate that while analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the near term, the stock’s growth story might be good in the future.Moreover, the company has a positive earnings surprise history for all the trailing ten quarters. The average earnings beat for the last four quarters is 19.06%.The company’s consistent top- and bottom-line performance on the back of strategic partnerships and rapid growth in the emerging markets, has given the stock this momentum.ProspectsHasbro seeks to boost revenues by increasing the visibility of its brands through various modes of entertainment including motion pictures. Given its strong product line-up that includes its core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations, the company remains well positioned for future growth. Greater focus on entertainment-backed products continues to bode well.Meanwhile, the toymaker continues to enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses that complement its brands. Also, it has primary licensing agreements with various entertainment and film, and television production companies. These, in turn, would help in maintaining the flow of revenues.Moreover, Hasbro has a supreme gaming portfolio and the company is refining gaming experiences across a multitude of platforms like face to face gaming, off the board gaming, and digital gaming experiences in mobile. In particular, the digital gaming market has strong growth prospects and consequently Hasbro is ramping up its digital gaming efforts.The company also seeks to grow its international business by expanding into the emerging markets of Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin and South America. These markets offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets. Additionally, they have been contributing to a significant share of Hasbro’s top line, given its investments in advertising and other brand building efforts.In fact, despite difficult operating conditions in some key markets, Hasbro’s emerging market revenues (excluding currency impact) have increased consistently since 2012. This is a trend that is anticipated to continue in 2017 as well.HeadwindsToy manufacturers have to battle a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment including video games and other electronic devices. Evidently, Hasbro’s revenues have been under some pressure over the past few quarters due to lower demand for games as children are opting for electronic versions of games on smartphones and tablets.Meanwhile, consumer spending uncertainty continues in the United States as customers are restraining their non-essential purchases. In addition, weak performance in Latin American markets like Brazil due to a challenging macroeconomic environment remains a concern.Hasbro also continues to grapple with higher costs related to initiatives such as launch of new products and investments in technology that are expected to weigh on near-term margins.Furthermore, the company’s considerable international presence exposes it to the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which ultimately might pressurize the top line.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHasbro currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same space include Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Nintendo Co. (NTDOY  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report). While Activision Blizzard sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Nintendo and Glu Mobile carry a Zack Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Activision Blizzard and Nintendo delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 39.81% and 190.04%, respectively, in the last four quarters. Meanwhile, Glu Mobile’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year’s loss is 83% narrower than previous year.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Interestingly, the major indices opened the day in the red, so these stocks have been able to break higher despite a relatively weak day of trading.What’s more interesting than that is the fact that a handful of today’s new highs are also on our Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list. Some investors may be hesitant to buy a stock at its all-time peak, but if the Zacks Rank is indicating that shares could move even higher, it could be a unique opportunity to ride a strong company’s momentum.So what are these elusive companies? Check out four Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks that just touched new all-time highs today.1.       Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report)Shares of Activision Blizzard were actually down through morning trading, but the video game publisher briefly touched a new all-time high $64.48 per share on Wednesday. The gaming market has been relatively strong recently, and Activision is looking like one of the industry’s strongest stocks.The publisher recently crushed earnings estimates by over 80%, and positive estimate revisions for its upcoming fiscal period have been pouring in. With a deep library of blockbuster games and profits expected to grow at nearly 14% click over the next three to five years, ATVI should continue to be a strong pick for some time. 2.       Progress Software (PRGS  -  Free Report)Progress is a global software company with a variety of solutions for integration, data interoperability and application development. Its stock has recovered from a big sell-off to start the year, and now shares are breaking into new highs. The company touched a new all-time high of $33.49 per share early Wednesday morning.The stock has moved more than 11% higher since its last earnings report, which witnessed the company surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate by five cents. With a beta rating of 0.70, the stock is hypothetically less volatile than average, but its “B” grade for Growth implies that it’s still an exciting growth option.   3.       Weibo Corporation (WB  -  Free Report)Thanks to a solid earnings report and strength throughout the Chinese internet market, Weibo—often referred to as China’s Twitter—has been soaring lately. Earlier today, the stock touched a new all-time high of $97.52 per share.Weibo has been one of the hottest stocks on the market this year, and shares are now up more than 118% year-to-date.

Ferrari’s 83% RoE crushes its industry average, and its current cash flow growth of 19.5% and net margin of 14.4% further highlight its financial strength. The stock is now poised to be a leader in its industry, which currently sits in the top 18% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

185,ATVI,"Share price of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $95.11, eventually closing a tad lower at $94.95 on Aug 22. The stock has rallied 92.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 48.1% gain of the industry it belongs to.The stock price momentum can be attributed to consistent results. We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 107.07%.We note that increasing digital revenues and strength in franchises like Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K are primarily responsible for this strong growth. These factors are expected to help the stock sustain the momentum going ahead.Currently, Take-Two carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company has a market capital of $9.69 billion and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 14%.Franchise Strength, Digital Revenues - Key CatalystsTake-Two, one of the leading names in the video game publishing arena, continues to benefit from its popular offerings like Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, along with its other releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company’s margins.  Moreover, the company anticipates continuous growth in digital revenues driven by higher sales of full game downloads and increases in recurrent consumer spending.Additionally, Take-Two’s acquisition of game developer, Social Point is expected to boost its performance. Management expects Social Point to contribute 6% of net revenue in the current fiscal.Also, the company’s foray into the fast emerging e-sports market is a positive. In February this year, Take Two inked a deal with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague, which will be functional in 2018. We believe this will enable the company to grab a share of the growing e-sports industry and boost its top line.However, stiff competition from other game makers such as Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.Outstanding Q1 Results, Solid ViewTake-Two reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of 60 cents per share which came in much better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents. The strong earnings performance was driven by higher net sales (excluding deferred revenues) of $348.3 million, which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $287.1 million.For the second quarter, the company expects GAAP net revenue to be in the range of $400–$450 million. The company projects earnings in the range of 15–25 cents per share.For fiscal 2018, the company has increased its outlook for net sales, which is now projected in the band of $1.65–$1.75 billion compared with the previous guidance of $1.42–$1.52 billion.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and Consensus Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and Consensus | Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

186,ATVI,"Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) and the National Football League (NFL) recently announced a partnership to organize the Madden NFL Club Championship that will involve the 32 NFL clubs. Reportedly, players above 16 years who excel in EA’s Madden NFL in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany can play the tournament.Per media reports, the winner of this “largest competitive gaming commitment ever by a U.S. professional sports league” will get a lions’ share of the cash prize of $403,000 and two tickets to the Super Bowl 52 to be played in Minnesota.Growing E-Sports Market – Key CatalystE-sports, which are live video game tournaments, are fast emerging as a lucrative business opportunity. Like traditional sports, even these are held at stadiums and televised or broadcast online. Importantly, these tournaments have alluring prize money. Per NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, e-sports and competitive gaming are very attractive to the “younger and digitally savvy NFL audience”.EA’s involvement with NFL to attract e-sports gamers is a significant move for the company. With continued increases in viewership, corporate sponsorships and growing media coverage, e-sports is here to stay. Thus, the company’s initiatives to strengthen its presence in the e-sports market will help drive the top line.Per the latest report from Newzoo, in 2017, revenues from e-sports are expected to be up 41.3% to $696 million. From 2015 to 2020, revenues are likely to record CAGR of 35.6% to $1.49 billion.We believe this will help to sustain the momentum in EA shares, which have gained 51.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 44.4% rally.Stiffening Competition a HeadwindGiven the sound business opportunity, competition in this space has intensified.  Other video game companies like Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO  -  Free Report) are also making big moves to grab a share of this pie.With Overwatch recording stupendous success with 30 million players and counting, Activision has announced a league for this franchise as well. Activision has recorded first seven team (city-based) sales for the Overwatch league. A few days back, the company added that it has sold the London and Los Angeles teams for the league.Activision has long been making efforts to build its presence in this arena. In fact, the company has set up an exclusive e-sports unit spearheaded by former ESPN CEO Steve Bornstein. Also, it acquired MLG, a leading e-sports player for an estimated $46 million. Activision has already established Call of Duty World League.  After treading cautiously initially in the lucrative e-sports market, Take Two has accelerated its efforts. In February this year, the company inked a deal with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague. This made NBA the only professional sports league to have its own e-sports league. The league will be functional in 2018. Take Two has been conducting an NBA e-sports tournament for the last two years.Electronic Arts Inc. Price Electronic Arts Inc. Price | Electronic Arts Inc.

188,ATVI,"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) has delayed the release of its game Crackdown 3 from Nov 7, 2017 to spring 2018, per Polygon. It was initially scheduled for release alongside the launch of the company’s new gaming console Xbox One X But a few enhancements are still in progress and hence the delay.Per Microsoft management’s interview with Polygon, the tweaks are aimed at delivering a superior gaming experience. These will ensure that the three modes of the game, namely campaign, co-op multiplayer or competitive multiplayer mode and Wrecking Zone are in sync.However, we believe that the delay will definitely hurt Microsoft’s top-line in the lucrative holiday season. Notably, the delay was announced a day after a similar game called Agents of Mayhem by Volition was released. Both the games were in focus at this year’s Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3).Microsoft stock has gained 18.5% year to date, underperforming the 24.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.Gaming Revenues Growth TrendMicrosoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 gaming revenues increased 3% (4% at CC) driven by growth in Xbox software and services. However, lack of a major game release in the upcoming holiday season will make it difficult for the company to sustain this growth trend.Moreover, we believe that lack of credible game titles on the new Xbox platform is detrimental for the console’s unit sales, at least in the near term. This will provide further competitive edge to Sony’s (SNE  -  Free Report) PlayStation platform.Per IHS Markit, Sony with its PlayStation 4 (PS4) held 51% of the gaming console market as compared with Microsoft’s 26% last year. The launch of Xbox One X is anticipated to narrow this gap.However, stiff competition from Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) remains a headwind.Microsoft Corporation Revenue (TTM) Microsoft Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Microsoft Corporation QuoteZacks RankMicrosoft currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

189,ATVI,"Shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) have been performing well of late. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained a whopping 51.3% on a year-to-date basis. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.If you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, the time is right for you to add the stock as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Factors Working in Favor of NVIDIAEstimates on the UpswingWe note that earnings estimates for NVIDIA have displayed a healthy uptrend. For 2018, all the three estimates moved up in the last 30 days, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate rising roughly 16.9% to $3.60 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 also climbed 11.5% to $3.87.Stellar Q2 EarningsNVIDIA reported splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein it not only delivered a strong year-over-year improvement, but also came way ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.This California-based graphic chip behemoth posted adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation but excluding other one-time items) on a proportionate tax basis of 92 cents per share, handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents. Further, adjusted earnings increased from 44 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Revenues not only surged 56.2% year over year to $2.230 billion, but also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.948 billion, as well as management’s projection of $1.95 billion (+/-2%). The year-over-year jump is primarily attributable to growth across all the platforms, namely, the GPUs gaming platform, Professional Visualization, datacenter and Tegra automotive platforms. Additionally, NVIDIA continued to gain strength in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, which positively impacted the revenues.Positive 3Q ViewThe company provided encouraging fiscal third-quarter revenue guidance in second-quarter conference call, which was well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate at that time. For third-quarter fiscal 2018, NVIDIA expects revenues of approximately $2.35 billion (+/-2%), which was much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14 billion.Ahead of the IndustryThe stock has been clocking solid returns in the last one year and has gained 159.3%, significantly outperforming the industry's gain of 30.5%.Other Factors Driving GrowthThe company’s sustained focus on introducing fast and innovative products, as well as entering into agreements with leading PC game makers, has been driving Gaming GPU business. Further, it recently introduced Max-Q design standard, which will help in making thinner, quieter and faster gaming laptops. Moreover, NVIDIA joined forces with Activision (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Bungie to bring Destiny 2 online-game to the PC for the first time.Furthermore, the company’s Volta-based V100 accelerator was the most notable launch in the quarter. The Volta V100 GPU provides 10 times more deep learning power to the company’s year-old predecessor, Pascal generation GPUs. Recntly, NVIDIA shipped a number of V100 GPU production units and per the company, it is currently supporting the industry's two most common AI frameworks – Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google TensorFlow and Facebook's Caffe.Increasing demand for cryptocurrencies owing from increased adoption of Bitcoin and newer technologies like Ethereum also aided in the rising of demand for GPU, consequently contributing to the company’s GPU sales growth.Notably, in the last reported quarter, the company entered into a wide range of partnerships based on its AI technology, including Baidu, Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta, and Wistron. Demand for NVIDIA’s DGX AI supercomputer also remained high as more organizations are keen on building AI-enabled applications. The company has shipped the system to over 300 customers, so far, and more than 1,000 are in the pipeline. Notably, per NVIDIA, Facebook is using its 128 DGX system.The company continued to witness solid momentum in its GRID graphics virtualization business. Moreover, the company won several contracts, but the deal with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services was the most remarkable. Per the company, AWS’s G3 instances now run on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs.Bottom LineGiven that the company’s long-term earnings per share growth rate is 10.3% and has a market of $98.26 billion, we believe that the stock has much upside potential.Keeping these positives in mind, we feel NVIDIA is one such technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

190,ATVI,"Zillow Group (ZG  -  Free Report) reported earnings of 4 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, which was much better than a loss of 71 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Including stock-based compensation, the company incurred loss of 12 cents, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents.Total revenue increased 28% year over year to $266.9 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $265 million.Notably, shares of Zillow have gained 10.4% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 19.8% rally.Quarter in DetailsZillow has two reportable segments namely, Marketplace (which includes Premier Agent, other real estate and mortgages) and Display.In the second quarter, Marketplace revenues of $248.6 million increased 30% on a year-over- year basis. Premier Agent increased 29% year on year attributable to increase in platform visits. The rise was primarily driven by an increase in the number of agents and accelerated spending for advertising.Real Estate revenues surged 45% year over year. This segment was propelled by continued demand for the company’s brands such as StreetEasy, Zillow, Trulia, Naked Apartments, Hot Pads and HREO.Zillow Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Zillow Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Zillow Group, Inc. QuoteMortgages reached $20.9 million, reflecting a 14% year-over-year increase. Since the majority of the consumers are home purchase loan shoppers, fluctuation in interest rates did not affect them massively.On the other hand, Display revenues of $18.3 million increased approximately 9% on a year-over-year basis, with better-than-expected brand sales initiatives and resultant increased traffic being the key driving factors.Reported sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues expanded 140 basis points (bps). Technology and development expenses as a percentage of revenues however contracted 100 bps.As of Jun 30, 2017, Zillow had cash and cash equivalents of $276.5 million compared with $243.6 million as of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceManagement expects third-quarter 2017 total revenue to remain in the range of $273 million to $278 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $235.9 million.The company expects Premier Agent revenues of $196 million to $198 million, other real estate revenues of $40 million to $41 million, and mortgage revenues of $20 million to $21 million, which taken together comprise Marketplace revenues.Display revenues are projected in the range of $17 million to $18 million.Operating expenses are expected to remain in the range of $261 million to $266 million.

The EBITDA outlook ranges between $220 million and $230 million, with a 21% margin at the midpoint.Our TakeZillow posted better than expected top- and bottom-line results. The company’s increased advertising effectiveness, continuous product innovation and effective free marketing channels are helping it to gain audience. Continuous growth in new MLS partnerships is enabling the company to deliver high quality listing information to homebuyers and sellers.However, increasing competition, hiked mortgage interest rates and constrained advertising spend remain headwinds.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Zillow has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard, Inc (ATVI  -  Free Report) both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Alibaba Group (BABA  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #2.

191,ATVI,"Continuing its earnings streak for the ninth straight quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) reported splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein it not only marked a strong year-over-year improvement, but also way came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also beat its estimates at every aspect.This California-based graphic chip behemoth posted adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation but excluding other one-time items) on a proportionate tax basis of 92 cents per share, handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents. Also, adjusted earnings increased from 44 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.On GAAP basis, the company’s earnings jumped over two-fold, year over year, to 92 cents per share from 41 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, NVIDIA reported earnings of $1.01 per share on non-GAAP basis, up nearly 91% from the year-ago quarter figure of 53 cents. The year-over year robust bottom-line performance was mainly stemmed by significant revenue growth.Despite this, shares of NVIDIA declined nearly 7% in yesterday’s after-hours trade. In our opinion, investors’ sentiments were shaken owing to the slowdown in the company’s Automotive segment’s revenue growth and loss of some business due to lapse of licensing agreement with Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report).Nonetheless, the stock has been clocking solid returns for the last one year and has gained 161.3%, outperforming the industry's gain of 34.8%.RevenuesRevenues not only surged 56.2% year over year to $2.230 billion, but also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.948 billion, as well as management’s projection of $1.95 billion (+/-2%). The year-over-year jump is primarily attributable to growth across all the platforms, that is, the GPUs gaming platform, Professional Visualization, datacenter and Tegra automotive platforms. Also, NVIDIA continued to gain strength in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, which positively impacted the quarter’s revenues.Revenues from the GPU business jumped 59% year over year to $1.9 billion, driven by strength in GeForce GPUs Gaming revenues and datacenter.Revenues from Gaming GPU were up 52% on a year-over-year basis to $1.19 billion. Per the company, the strong growth “reflects the vibrant gaming ecosystem, underpinned by continued excitement over our recent launch GPUs and other technologies, great games, and growing interest in e-sports.”The company’s sustained focus on introducing fast and innovative products, as well as entering into agreements with leading PC game makers, has been driving its Gaming GPU business. During the last quarter, it introduced Max-Q design standard, which will help in making thinner, quieter and faster gaming laptops. Moreover, during the fiscal second quarter, it joined forces with Activision (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Bungie to bring Destiny 2 online-game to the PC for the first time.Furthermore, the company’s Volta-based V100 accelerator was the most notable launch in the quarter. The Volta V100 GPU provides 10 times more deep learning power to the company’s year-old predecessor, Pascal generation GPUs. During the fiscal second quarter, NVIDIA shipped a number of V100 GPU production units and per the company, it is currently supporting the industry's two most common AI frameworks – Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google TensorFlow and Facebook's (FB  -  Free Report) Caffe.Increasing demand for cryptocurrencies owing from increased adoption of Bitcoin and newer technologies like Ethereum also helped in lifting demand for GPU, thereby contributing to the company’s GPU sales growth.In addition, revenues from datacenter came in at $416 million, registering a year-over-year increase of over 2.5 times, mainly fueled by strong adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, high-performance computing (HPC), and GRID technologies.Notably, in the reported quarter, the company entered into a wide range of partnerships based on its AI technology, including Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta, and Wistron. Demand for NVIDIA’s DGX AI supercomputer also remained high as more organizations are keen on building AI-enabled applications. The company has shipped the system to over 300 customers, so far, and more than 1,000 are in the pipeline. Notably, per NVIDIA, Facebook is using its 128 DGX system.The company continued to witness solid momentum in its GRID graphics virtualization business. During the fiscal second quarter, the company won several contracts, but the deal with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services was the most remarkable. Per the company, AWS’s G3 instances now run on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs.Tegra processor revenues came in at $333 million, which doubled on a year-over-year basis. The increase was primarily due to better-than-expected growth in Tegra development services. Nevertheless, a sluggish automotive business growth somewhat remains a drag on this segment’s growth.Automotive revenues for the quarter came in at $142 million, reflecting an increase of 19% year over year. However, the growth rate was much lower than previous quarter’s growth rate of around 25%. Nonetheless, the company continued with entering into new partnerships based on its DRIVE PX AI platform.Moving to Professional Visualization, revenues from Quadro increased 10% year over year and came in at $235 million. The increase was mainly due to elevated demand in real-time rendering tools and mobile workstations.MarginsNVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin (including stock-based compensation but excluding other one-time items) expanded 50 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 58.6%, which is in line with management’s guidance range of 58.6% (+/-50 bps).In dollar terms, non-GAAP gross profit came in at $1.306 billion, reflecting an increase of 57.3% from the year-ago quarter, primarily on the back of strength in GeForce GPU gaming platform and a higher revenue base However, this was partially offset by loss of business from lapse of Intel’s licensing agreement.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up nearly 19% from the year-ago quarter to $533 million due to increased hiring to support growth initiatives. Non-GAAP operating expenses were somewhat in line with the company’s projection of approximately $530 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses, however, decreased to 23.9% from 36.2% witnessed in the year-ago quarter.NVIDIA’s non-GAAP operating margin was up from 26.8% to 34.7% during the reported quarter, reflecting growth in its GeForce GTX GPU business and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. In dollar terms, non-GAAP operating income jumped from $382 million to $773 million.NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowNVIDIA exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $5.877 billion compared with $6.206 billion in the previous quarter. NVIDIA’s total debt was $1.984 billion. Free cash flow in the first half of fiscal 2018 came in at $879 million, while cash flow from operations was $987 million.During the first two quarters of the fiscal, the company paid a cash dividend of $166 million and repurchased shares worth $758 million. NVIDIA also announced a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per share, payable on Sep 18, 2017.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2018, NVIDIA expects revenues of approximately $2.35 billion (+/-2%), which is much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14 billion.Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be 58.8% (+/-50 bps). Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $570 million. Capital expenditures are estimated to be roughly in the range of $65–$75 million.  Non-GAAP tax rate is likely to be 17% (+/-1%).For fiscal 2018, the company continues to expect returning $1.25 billion to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases.Our TakeNVIDIA posted impressive fiscal second-quarter results and provided encouraging fiscal third-quarter revenue guidance. Also, the company registered year-over-year growth on both counts, primarily due to growth across all its four platforms. Also, better-than-expected demand for its gaming chips used in PCs helped the company post encouraging results.Moreover, we believe that NVIDIA’s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned. We also believe that the higher adoption of NVIDIA’s Tegra processors could act as a catalyst, moving ahead.On the flip side, the secular decline in the PC market has affected many chip makers. NVIDIA’s dependence on the PC market continues, and therefore is being marred by adverse conditions. The preliminary data released by Gartner depicted that PC shipments in the second quarter declined 4.3% year over year to 61.1 million units. This decline marked the 11th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, the longest in the history of the PC industry.Also, Gartner’s forward-looking statements make us a shade cautious about the prospects of the PC industry. The research firm agreed that the recent surge in DRAM prices and short supply of SSD will lead to an escalation in PC prices.Additionally, competition from the likes of Intel and QUALCOMM Inc. remains a near-term headwind.NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(SYNA  -  Free Report) dropped to a new 52-week low of $42.50, eventually closing a tad bit higher at $42.58 on Aug 8.The underperformance can be attributed to growing headwinds related to sluggish demand in China. Notably, management had lowered fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 guidance following the announcement of the acquisitions of Conexant Systems and Multimedia Solutions business of Marvell Technology Group in mid-June.We note that these headwinds have pulled down current year earnings estimates over the last 30 days.

193,ATVI,"Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) has pulled the plug on its teens-only app, Lifestage nearly a year after it was launched. The app was designed to assist teenagers connect with their peers by creating a video profile.Lifestage was created by Facebook employee, Michael Sayman when he himself was a teenager.During the launch of Lifestage, Facebook faced questions as to the necessity of an additional app when its social networking platform, photo sharing app and messaging app are already so popular. In a post, Sayman answered saying, “Lifestage looks back at the days of Facebook from 2004 and explores what can be done if we went back and turned the crank all the way forward to 2016 with video-first.” Lifestage underscored Facebook’s focus on videos.Also, Lifestage was aimed at containing the threat from the rising popularity of Snap Inc’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) Snapchat. Sayman believed that Lifestage could have a strong influence on the Generation Z, the upcoming market for advertisers and marketers.  Unfortunately, the app failed to gain much popularity compared with other social networking apps like Instagram, Snapchator WhatsApp.Per sources, Lifestage suffered from ""confusing"" user interface and limited privacy controls. Surprisingly, in a market where apps undergo constant updates to stay attractive and competitive, Lifestage was last updated in Oct 2016. The inability of the app to be among the top-ranking apps on Play Store reflects lower adoption in its target market, the high schoolers.Apart from Lifestage, Facebook has also shut down its Group Apps in order to focus on other groups onits main app and website. It’s not the first time Facebook has rolled back an app (remember Poke, Slingshot, Moments, Notify, Riff, Rooms and so on).  However, Facebook believes it to be a good learning experience and plans to implement the lessons learnt for future endeavours.Facebook, Inc.

194,ATVI,"On Aug 9, Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The upgrade can be attributed to strong second-quarter 2017 results.

We note that Activision beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 52.54%.Revenues of $1.42 billion were better than the consensus mark of $1.21 billion, driven by continued strength in digital revenues, success of Overwatch and the buyout of King Digital Entertainment.The robust performance drove current quarter and full year estimates in the last seven days.

Its offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm and Call of Duty are widely popular and should continue to contribute to the bottom line.Moreover, Activision is aggressively working on becoming a media entertainment giant, somewhere on the lines of The Walt Disney Company. Apart from launching a movie studio, the company is also strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market. Recently, with Overwatch recording stupendous success with 30 million players so far and counting, Activision announced the launch of Overwatch e-sports league. Notably, the bids for the first seven teams (city-based) of the Overwatch league have already been completed. It also introduced a new consumer product division to be spearheaded by ex-Walt Disney executive, Tim Kiplin.Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM)  Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteOther Key PicksAlibaba Group Holding (BABA  -  Free Report), Luxoft Holding (LXFT  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) are the other top-ranked stocks in the sector.

195,ATVI,"Investors in Activision Blizzard International, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the August 11th, 2017 $47 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Activision Blizzard shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Activision Blizzard is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Top 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 44 cents per share to 47 cents.Given the way analysts feel about Activision Blizzard right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

196,ATVI,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 9. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 14.9%.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 16% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Twenty-First Century Fox will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 34 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of over 24%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased by a couple of cents witnessed in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6,734 million compared with $6,646 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterRobust affiliate fees at the company’s broadcast and cable-television divisions are anticipated to drive the revenues higher. In the third quarter, Cable Network Programming revenues increased 2.1% on the back of robust affiliate revenues growth, after increasing 10% and 7.1% in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Affiliate fees are the dominant source of revenue for the Cable Network segment and a major contributor to total revenue.However, increase in cost at Cable Network Programming has been worrying investors. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Cable Network Programming costs have increased 6.3% to $7,687 million. The rise in expenses was mostly due to elevated sports programming costs. We believe that an increase in expenses, due to higher sports programming costs may hurt the margins and affect the bottom line in the coming quarters.Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

"
202,ATVI,"The blue-chip index continued its winning streak on Thursday after crossing the psychological milestone for the second time on the trot. This performance can be attributed to a 1.6% rise in shares of Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report).

On a non-GAAP basis, revenues and earnings are likely to be $1.385 billion and 34 cents per share, respectively. Deferral revenues are expected to be around $315 million.Our TakeActivision has been benefiting from its focus on broadening its franchise portfolio, innovation and initiatives to expand to new geographies. Its offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm and Call of Duty are widely popular and should continue to contribute to the bottom line.Activision is aggressively working on becoming a media entertainment giant, somewhere on the lines of The Walt Disney Company. Apart from launching a movie studio, the company is also strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market. Recently, the company announced the launch of Overwatch e-sports league. It also introduced a new consumer product division to be spearheaded by an ex-Walt Disney executive, Tim Kiplin. The higher adoption of free-to-play games and significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) , Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) remain near-term headwinds. Also, an uncertain macro-economic outlook adds to its woes as video games form a part of discretionary spending. Also, the company’s dependence on a handful of mega franchises (Call of Duty, World of Warcraft) for the lion’s share of its revenues makes it highly vulnerable.Zacks Rank & Stock Price MovementCurrently, Activision carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Deferral revenues are expected to be around negative $225 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIncreasing digital revenues and continued strength in titles like Call of Duty should cushion earnings in the second quarter. In the last quarter, apart from releasing a new DLC pack for Call of Duty, Activision rolled out other in-game content for World of Warcraft, Hearthstone as well as the Overwatch Uprising event. These, along with the launch of Heroes of the Storm 2.0, are likely to positively affect the upcoming results. More importantly, the acquisition of King Digital is expected to continue boosting growth.Activision is aggressively working on becoming a media entertainment giant, somewhere on the lines of The Walt Disney Company. Apart from launching a movie studio, the company is also strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market.Nevertheless, higher adoption of free-to-play games and significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive and Glu Mobile remain near-term headwinds.Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Activision is likely to beat earnings this quarter.
