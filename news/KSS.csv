Two department-store stocks are near buy zones after strong price advances — Dillard's (DDS) and Nordstrom (JWN).XThe department-store industry is a top-tier group with a No. 23 ranking out of 197 groups. Over the last year, the group has mostly proved its ability to weather the Amazon.com (AMZN) storm. Strong earnings reports in the past few weeks for several department stores have given the group new fuel.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Macy's (M) is the No. 1-ranked stock, with a 94 IBD Composite Rating. The rating blends key fundamental and technical metrics to gauge a stock's overall strength.The stock was a volatile trade after a flat-base breakout on April 26. The stock broke out above a 31.14 buy point, but quickly stumbled and triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal. On May 16, the stock launched almost 11% higher after a better-than-expected earnings report.Shares rose more than 3% in morning trade Tuesday, reaching the highest level since Dec. 15.Kohl's (KSS) advanced more than 4% at midday Tuesday on its way out of the buy range above a 69.58 buy point. Shares broke out on Monday with a 4.7% gain. Volume rose just 15% above average.

Shares jumped more than 5% at midday, and volume was tracking about 80% above average.In the most recent quarter, earnings and sales grew 36% and 3%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period.Bullishly, the stock's relative strength line is hitting a new high to underscore the stock's outperformance vs. the general market. Meanwhile, the stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B and an up/down volume ratio of 1.2.Nordstrom is approaching a double bottom's 52.24 entry. Shares gapped down below their 50- and 200-day lines on May 18 but are quickly recovering. The stock has an eight-day win streak and is aiming for a ninth straight gain.The latest quarter showed earnings growth of 19%, which snapped a three-quarter streak of declining growth.RELATED:Department-Store Duds?

And the best mutual funds have been picking up shares.In addition to retail stocks, the best-performing mutual funds have also been putting money into the semiconductor, medical, transportation and banking sectors over the last three months.Seventeen top funds invested approximately $70.7 million in Macy's.

5,KSS,"Retailer stocks and consumer-spending plays, particularly those focusing on apparel and food, did well on Tuesday during another upbeat session for the Nasdaq.The tech-rich composite gained 0.4% on the back of strength in companies including Netflix (NFLX) (up 1%) and Apple (AAPL) (up 0.7%). Both reached new highs.Apple and Netflix are two FAANG companies that hold a spot in IBD Leaderboard. The premium service features annotations on the daily and weekly charts to help users become more adept at spotting precise buy points and sell signals.Chip and semiconductor equipment plays also showed upside progress.

Shares rose nearly 2% to 43.92 and hit new highs in low volume.A hot growth stock can make new highs in below-average trade and still have the strength to keep its long-term uptrend going. That's especially true when the breakout from a proper base occurred within the past 18 weeks or so.However, Canada Goose is close to triggering an offense-type sell signal. Why? Since its April 19 breakout past a 36.76 buy point, the stock is close to nailing a 20% profit, which would trigger at 44.11.Canada Goose debuted on the NYSE at 12.75 a share in March 2017.When CAN SLIM-style growth investors take multiple profits in good-sized positions at 20% to 25%, they set themselves up for a grand year.Think of it this way. If you start with $10,000 and invest all of that money in a stock that leads the market, sell all shares when the profit reaches 20%. Now you're at $12,000. Do this two more times, and your balance is up to $17,280, up 72.8%.The Toronto-based apparel company is enjoying fantastic growth, with earnings rising 189% to 55 cents a share in fiscal 2017 (ended in March of that year) on a 39% blast up in sales to $303 million.

They trimmed their price target to 25 from 27.Essentially: Shuttering stores might not be enough to stem the bleeding.""Macy's has reduced its footprint 14% since 2014, but our analysis suggests its store-only comps continued to trend negatively (-4.3% 2017 & -4.9% 2015-2017 average) over the same time period,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger. ""This implies that even though Macy's is closing stores proactively, it may not be doing so quickly enough.""Looking at physical stores alone, she said she expects negative comps to continue.Separately, Greenberger sees ROIC deteriorating this year ""and thus expect the stock price to decline once again. Furthermore, Macy's increased reliance on private label credit card income and real estate gains masks the underlying deterioration in core retail EBIT (-63% since 2014).""Once shoppers take their business elsewhere — say, to Amazon (AMZN) — Greenberger points out that Macy's would miss out doubly, on both the actual sale and on the Macy's private-label credit card income.Private label credit card income and gains from asset sales have become a bigger part of Macy's total earnings, she said, and ""real estate gains cannot continue in perpetuity.""

29,KSS,"Black Friday spending shot up nearly 17% to $5.03 billion, according to Adobe Analytics data, and early results for Cyber Monday shopping point to an even bigger day than expected.X Adobe had expected record online Cyber Monday sales of $6.6 billion, which would mark a 16.5% gain from the prior year. But as of 10 a.m. ET today, $840 million had been spent online, representing growth of 16.9%.Overall web traffic is up 12%, with mobile traffic representing a record high 53.3% of visits plus 39.7% of revenue, Adobe added. Growth was also up sharply from Saturday and Sunday, which brought in a total of $5.12 billion online, up 10.1%.So which stores are racking up major sales, and which ones are desperate for shoppers?Toys and gadgets were predictably hot on Black Friday: the Nintendo (NTDOY) Switch, Hatchimals and Colleggtibles, PJ Masks, L.O.L. Surprise Dolls, Ride On Cars, and Google (GOOGL) Chromecast and Roku (ROKU) streaming devices were top sellers, said Adobe.Computers, TVs and toys were the most discounted products on Friday, and shoppers looking to complete their holiday shopping will likely find great deals on toys again today, as toys are expected to get the biggest price cuts on Cyber Monday. Piper Jaffray said Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) was the busiest store its analysts visited in both Minnesota and Texas over the weekend.""Overall, we think (Thanksgiving/Black Friday) was strong even though it continued to be diluted by online sales and earlier sales that began in early November and heightened the weekend before (Black Friday),"" wrote B. Riley FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""However, given the cold spurt in early November we believe outerwear was a big purchase early on which left room for apparel purchases over BF, particularly given the new fashion cycle.""At the mall, American Eagle (AEO) (and its Aerie brand), Build-A-Bear Workshop, L Brands' (LB) Pink and Gap (GPS) chain Old Navy came out on top on Black Friday, she said, ""managing sales/promos that should lead to good top lines and bottom lines.""Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Abercrombie-owned Hollister also merited callouts from Anderson, although traffic at both stores was lower than that of the top performers. The firm's analysts spotted mall visitors toting Victoria's Secret, Build-A-Bear, American Eagle, Macy's (M), Forever 21 and Lululemon (LULU) bags more than any others.""Fashion apparel looked to be the key items over TG/BF, while activewear continued to be challenged and even though athletic footwear appeared strong it was mainly driven by discounts,"" wrote Anderson.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Struggling Under Armour (UAA) offered 50% discounts at its factory outlets, noted analysts, a contrast to Nike's (NKE) 25%-off promotion at outlet stores and Adidas' (ADDYY) more-modest promotions.But even as shoppers hit the registers this past weekend, the American mall continues to suffer. Brick-and-mortar traffic fell over 7.5% on Black Friday, and same-store retail traffic fell over 3%, according to Cowen, citing national traffic devices. And stores like Sears (SHLD) are doing the best they can to reclaim foot traffic as the heyday of department stores looks to be permanently in the rearview mirror.Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom called out Wal-Mart (WMT), Kohl's (KSS), Amazon (AMZN), and Dollar Tree (DLTR).""Looking ahead, roughly 85% stated they intend to make a purchase on Cyber Monday – so taking all of it together ... the weekend looks like it was a winner for most,"" he wrote.Macy's shares climbed 0.7% on the stock market today. Gap shares rose 1.3% to 21.21, retaking a 20.87 buy point. Wal-Mart was unchanged.

For chains that find the right balance between their own labels and outside ones, long-moribund shares could see life again. But while private labels have been hiding in plain sight for decades, the current surge could deliver another jolt to the retail sector, if national brands lose ground and prices fall further.""With the advent of Amazon and the 'everything store,' you can pretty much get a national brand that you want, anywhere,"" said Kantar Retail analyst Tiffany Hogan. ""So I think we're seeing another swell in private-label development, being used less as a fill-in strategy, which is how many of them probably started,"" and more of an offensive play.It's already a massive business for supermarkets, drug chains and mass-merchandise stores, with sales hitting a record high of $118.4 billion in 2015, according to the Private Label Manufacturers Association. And so far in 2017, private-label manufacturing sourcing has grown 26% vs. the prior-year period, according to ThomasNet data, with notable pops in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.Today, what might have once prompted mockery at a school cafeteria is emerging from a makeover. Back in the day, store brands were meant to emulate well-known national names, offering what was perceived as a lower quality but cheaper option, rather than a distinct alternative on par with the bigger brands. Instead of red-and-white soda cans plastered with knockoff-style logos, there are now a lot more products like Whole Foods' 365 brand cola, proudly crafted with pure cane sugar and filtered carbonated water.For a retailer, owning a brand means margins are higher, prices are more competitive, and customers can't get the products anywhere else. At Amazon alone, the private-label market represents a $1 billion gross-profit opportunity, Morgan Stanley has estimated. Plus, there's greater control over product creation and speed to market, said Hogan.And companies are taking advantage of that control, crafting unique images meant to resonate with consumers' hearts and not just their wallets.""I am not a person who has or probably would ever get a tattoo, but if I were going to get one, I would want it to be the design on our coffee bag,"" says Liza Landsman, president of Jet.com, the e-commerce player acquired last year by Wal-Mart. ""I just think it's really beautiful.""She's talking about the creature on the cover of one of Jet.com's newly launched Uniquely J in-house products, an intricately inked Peruvian tiger. And it's not hard to see why: It looks more like a hipster's sleeve tattoo than a coffee container.Uniquely J's slim-but-growing collection of 50 or so items — salsa, avocado oil, sandwich bags, toilet paper — don't all sport edgy tigers. Some have cartoon bears and walruses. All are aimed at consumers of the ""metro-millennial lifestyle,"" and mark a pivot from the private-label game plan of old.""Over the last few years, the attitude toward private label among consumers has really evolved, and I think that's in response to the fact that it's not your father's private label anymore, that so much innovation and product and packaging and design is happening in that space that there (are) ample opportunities to bring really interesting offerings to market,"" said Landsman.Attitudes were much different in the early 1980s. Back then, high-end designer Halston inked a billion-dollar deal to create a lower-priced version of its apparel for J.C. Penney (JCP). But brand dilution was so frowned upon back then that Bergdorf Goodman expelled the Halston brand altogether from its upscale stores.In the 1990s, Target launched brands like Archer Farms and teamed up with architect Michael Graves for an exclusive designer partnership. Those efforts, plus in-house brands like Merona and Mossimo, which are now being retired, were better received and earned Target a devoted following among shoppers looking for reasonably fashionable but affordable items.""That was cool,"" said Jim Holbrook, CEO of private-label retail services firm Daymon. ""It was exclusive, you could only get it at Target; it was well designed, and at an affordable price. And to me that was sort of the advent of the differentiating strategy.""Target now wants to win back customers who knew and loved the ""Tar-zhay"" of yesteryear. It's in the process of debuting no fewer than a dozen brands, all either clothes or furnishing, including A New Day (womenswear), Goodfellow (menswear), Project 62 (home décor), Joylab (athleisure) and Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, a home and lifestyle label created in conjunction with HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines.They hope to replicate the success of Cat & Jack, the company's shining example of what a good private label can accomplish. The cheery, on-trend kids clothing raked in $2 billion just in its first year, a remarkable feat for a debut in a home and apparel category that brings in $26 billion annually for Target — over a third of its total revenue.""Target kind of lost their way for a couple years, but (CEO) Brian Cornell's done a great job refocusing them on kids' apparel, home and launching of all these"" private-label brands, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough of Target's chief, who took the helm in 2014.And Macy's (M) — which has a well-regarded stable of 20 or so exclusives like the Martha Stewart Collection — plans to grow its private and exclusive brands to 40% from 29% of the business by 2020, saying they help stem store traffic losses at its department stores.But Kohl's (KSS) recent private-label venture offers a warning. The department store had pushed its private labels but upset the balance between major brands and in-house offerings, weighing on sales. That showed management that national brands still matter, Yarbrough said. The department store has since focused more in the other direction, partnering with Under Armour (UAA), for instance.""Now, the risk is, for some retailers, you don't want to go too far,"" he said.In other words, shoppers like a healthy smattering of unique store brands, so long as they can still find household names like Nike (NKE) or Coca-Cola (KO) on shelves.For 20- and 30-somethings who came of age during the Great Recession, however, brands may matter even less than ever, amid their existential hunt for authenticity and uniqueness.The online store Brandless, for example, is a curated selection of groceries, household and personal care items that sell for a straightforward $3 apiece but come without what the startup's CEO, Tina Sharkey, has termed the ""Brand Tax,"" i.e. marketing costs and the ""false narrative of cartoon characters and actors"" on packaging.Brandless doesn't sell any Starbucks. Instead, it offers a chocolate-colored bag of organic, fair-trade cold brew, simply labeled ""Cold Brew Coffee Bag."" Other items are similar. No Kleenex, just ""Facial Tissue."" No Chapstick, only ""Lip Balm.""They could be mistaken for cheap generics, but the company proudly touts merchandise that is carefully sourced and ""non-GMO, sometimes organic, fair trade, kosher, gluten-free, no added sugar and more.""""I think people would tell you that millennials are exponentially more open to buying brands they didn't grow up with and trying things that speak to their values, are affordable, are not wedded to things that were necessarily at their table for years,"" said Sharkey. ""So I think there's a huge openness (to new brands) and openness to private label.""Therein lies a challenge to companies' exclusive offerings, however. Modern millennial shoppers aren't brand loyal, so they're game to skip big-name labels in favor of private brands. But companies are banking on the hope that their unique products will cultivate some modicum of loyalty, or at least one or two return trips.Loyalty is what Amazon knows well as it tries to lure more subscribers to its Prime ecosystem with its own house brands, which includes a number of womenswear lines, not to mention its popular Amazon Basics and Amazon Essentials for tchotchkes around the house.Of Amazon's estimated 34 private-label brands, 19 are clothing collections. That there's an industrywide rise in interest in store-brand apparel manufacturing comes as no surprise to ThomasNet CEO Tony Uphoff, who pointed to store closures at Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch and the decline of traditional brands.But success, even for Amazon, is not guaranteed. Paris Sunday, its fashion-forward casual line of dresses and other clothes, is reportedly being phased out, according to a recent WWD story.Still, it's early days, and as department stores are waning in influence, Amazon's access to massive amounts of data means it wields gargantuan power.""Way back in the day, it would take several months to figure out what a trend was and what people wanted and analyze the data,"" said Daymon CEO Holbrook. ""And then the data got more available with point of sales scanner data and loyalty card data, so that would take several weeks. And now, Amazon's true competitive advantage is they know, real time, minute by minute, what people want.""In the first half of 2017, the young women's apparel line, Lark & Ro, made an estimated $1.9 million for Amazon — chump change — but AmazonBasics has become a $210 million business, according to 1010data estimates.And sales of Amazon's in-house children's apparel, Scout & Ro, grew fivefold over that same time frame, said the research firm.""The brick-and-mortar retailers who get good at marketing and good at telling those stories and get good at the human touch, I think, can beat Amazon,"" said Holbrook. ""But at this point, Amazon's trying a lot of different things in the private brand space. And they're going to figure it out.""

41,KSS,"Starting in October, Kohl's (KSS) will start processing Amazon (AMZN) returns for free at 82 stores in Los Angeles and in Chicago, said the department store.X""We are thrilled to launch this unprecedented and innovative concept, allowing customers to bring in their unpackaged Amazon returns to Kohl's and we will pack them, ship them, and return them to Amazon for free,"" said Kohl's Chief Administrative Officer Richard Schepp.""This is a great example of how Kohl's and Amazon are leveraging each other's strengths — the power of Kohl's store portfolio and omnichannel capabilities combined with the power of Amazon's reach and loyal customer base,"" he added.The move may seem unorthodox, but brick-and-mortar stores — and department stores in particular — are struggling to find new ways to draw more shoppers into physical stores. And returning online orders is a point of inconvenience for those who buy products online.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The initial partnership is an 'intelligent' way for Kohl's to leverage unused parts of its store footprint and help improve frequency at stores, wrote Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom.""Indeed, Kohl's has historically seen a roughly 25%-30% uptick in baskets from BOPUS (buy online pickup in store) transactions, so it's plausible that the company will see some benefit,"" he said.Kohl's shares rose 1.1% to 45.39 in the stock market today, closing well off intraday highs of 47.44, the best since Jan. 4. Amazon shares fell 0.4% to 969.86, their 4th straight decline.RELATED:The Amazon Monopoly Problem: Prime Time For Antitrust ActionToys 'R' Us Seeks Bankruptcy, Crushed By Debt And Online RivalsHulu Beats Netflix, Amazon To Milestone In Emmy Award VictoryRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry NewsFANG Stocks News & Quotes

43,KSS,"Retailers are still having a tough go of it. And a recent IPO was the catalyst for Thursday's troubles. But there were a few notable exceptions, including Amazon.com (AMZN) and Wal-Mart (WMT).XThe nearly sectorwide slide came in the wake of J. Jill's (JILL) late Wednesday warning that sales were lower than expected, cutting guidance. J. Jill, which came public in March at 13 a share, plunged 51% to 4.86 on the stock market today.Retail groups were among the biggest losers out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, including the two worst performers.J.C. Penney (JCP) is hitting a fresh all-time low, falling 3.7%. Kohl's (KSS) briefly slipped below its key 50-day moving average for the first time since the start of September, retreating 2.1%.Teen bargain-retailer Five Below (FIVE) is testing its buy point after clearing the 54.23 entry from a period of consolidation in late September, slipping 1.8% to 54.99.Nike (NKE) dipped 0.4% after hitting a 2017 low intraday, as Bloomberg pointed out a 40% flash sale that one NPD analyst calls ""unprecedented.""Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is tumbling following a downgrade from Cleveland Research to neutral from buy, citing an expected slowdown in cosmetics and a rise in promotions. Ulta plunged 8.5% to an 18-month low.Upscale housewares chain Williams-Sonoma (WSM) retreated 3.6% on its own downgrade.Foot Locker (FL), Gap (GPS) and Macy's (M) were also significant losers, closing down 4.6%, 4.3% and 1.1%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Retail stocks have been offering shorting opportunities. Not sure where to start? Here's a primer in short selling. Amazon, meanwhile, hit a two-month high, rising 0.6% as it works on a flat base. And Wal-Mart, increasingly lauded for its e-commerce efforts over the last year or so, advanced 0.4%. Wal-Mart has surged 9% this week, just beyond a buy range after breaking out Tuesday on a bullish online sales forecast and $20 billion buyback.Wal-Mart is increasingly seen as the brick-and-mortar retailer most likely to hang with Amazon as many traditional chains fall further behind and risk going out of business.Target (TGT) was another winner Thursday.

Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Workday (WDAY) are setting up near buy points with both holding Tuesday events with analysts.XFutures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose about 0.2% above fair value. On Monday, the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite lost 0.2% while the Dow industrials gave up 0.1%.Tesla rose 1.2% to 347 early Tuesday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the electric car maker to 379 from 317, though it kept an equal-weight rating. During Monday's stock market trading, Tesla tumbled 3.9% to 342.94 amid fresh concerns about Model 3 delays and growing skepticism about CEO Elon Musk's ambitious targets. Musk rebutted some claims, including that some parts were being assembled or welded by hand, but shares closed near session lows, falling through their 50-day moving average.Tesla broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 370.10 buy point last month, but began selling off a few days later — with the size of the drop and the move below the 50-day line offering clear sell signals.Ichor rose 7.2% to 28.85 in the premarket. Late Monday, it announced that it reached a deal to produce liquid delivery systems for a major customer. Ichor had rallied 1.9% to 26.91 during the regular session.Ichor broke out of a double-bottom base with a 24.40 entry in mid-September. Ichor later provided a 25.41 handle entry.

45,KSS,"At the start of the year, Macy's stock and a few others had begun to show signs of life. But retail stocks clearly were not leading the market. Dollar stores and building products were the only retail groups among IBD's top 20 industries. The retail sector weighed in at No. 20, among the 33 sectors that IBD tracks.But hefty advances — not only in Macy's stock price, but from Kohl's (KSS), Dillard's (DDS), Tiffany (TIF), Fossil (FOSL) and RH (RH), to name just a few — have placed retail among the market's highest fliers. Retail groups posted six of the 10 top gains among industries over the past eight weeks. Over the four most recent weeks, retailers notched four of the top five advances. Shoe and clothing manufacturers were close behind.A broad rise in jewelry retail stocks lifted that group to the best gain of the past four weeks, up 32.5%, with an eight-week advance of 35.8%. The eight-week tally also shows office-supply retailers outperforming, up 45.5%. Home furnishings and department stores are also in the top five gains among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.A broader look — at the year-to-date gains — shows only slightly different results. Jewelry retailers top the list, up 46.8% through Monday. Department stores are next in line with a 42.3% gain.

The industry has stripped down, restructured and shaken out. In addition, unemployment is at its lowest level in 18 years. And while wage growth has lagged, at least more consumers are bringing home paychecks. In addition, tax changes may mean more cash in pockets in the coming back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.So which stocks led the retail charge through the first half of 2018?For jewelers, Fossil soared 294% through Tuesday. Movado (MOV) has pounded out a 56% gain, while heavyweight Tiffany logged a 31% gain. All three stocks are extended.Department store chains Macy's and Dillards each rose 61% for the year through Tuesday. Kohl's has a 47% gain. All three stocks are extended. Macy's is in a profit-taking zone, more than 20% above a flat-base buy point at 30.14.The industry with the third-largest year-to-date gain, internet retailers, has become a huge group.

Etsy is also extended from a late-May rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Stamps.com is working on its ninth straight weekly advance.

47,KSS,"The breadth of industries that feature stocks hitting new highs continues to be wide. On Tuesday, Salesforce.com (CRM), Five Below (FIVE) and Dillard's (DDS) are giving investors opportunities to add new positions to their portfolios.Salesforce, a June 2004 IPO, is up more than 2% for the week as shares continue to drive past a 128.97 buy point in a seven-week cup pattern.The 5% buy zone extends up to 135.42. Thus, the stock remains in the permissible buy range.Notice on a daily chart how the RS line, painted in blue, continues to pump into new high ground. Good. It confirms that the enterprise software play is beating the S&P 500. Since its February 2017 breakout from a first-stage base at 80.47, Salesforce has rallied more than 65%.The San Francisco-based firm has emerged as a real force of change within its field. CEO Marc Benioff, who left Oracle (ORCL) to start Salesforce, pushed for a new business model in which customers could download customer relationship management (CRM) software straight from the internet onto their computers — with no stacks of CDs to upload into their desktops. Salesforce sought to make its products affordable and easy to use.Today, the company has excelled in going beyond the CRM space and into service, marketing, data analytics, collaboration and AI. It continues to win multiple large contracts.In its April-ended first quarter, Salesforce achieved another milestone. Revenue grew 25% to $3.01 billion, marking the first time it logged $3 billion in quarterly sales. Salesforce had a total $3.05 billion in revenue for the entire fiscal year ended in January 2013.On a quarterly basis, revenue has grown 25%, 27%, 25%, 25%, 27%, 25%, 27%, 26%, 25% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past 10 periods.Five Below has cleared a 78.38 entry in a six-week flat base. The Philadelphia-based retail innovator, popular among kids who can spend their allowances on items priced at $5 or less, reports fiscal Q1 results after the close on Wednesday.The Street sees earnings up 120% to 33 cents a share on a 25% rise in sales to $291.4 million. That would mark the biggest year-over-year profit increase since a 175% leap in the quarter ended July 2013.Five Below joined IBD Leaderboard as an earnings-related call option play on Wednesday.Dillard's rose more than 5% and reached as high as 93.58 intraday. At that price, shares stood more than 5% past the 88.61 buy point in a 12-week cup. Disciplined buying means grabbing shares when they are no more than 5% past the proper entry.While on a daily chart Dillard's may have showed handle-type action from May 21 to June 1, such a handle is invisible on the weekly chart. Treat that shakeout period as more attempts by the stock to build the right side of the cup.Dillard's has posted big earnings growth in the past two quarters (up 52% to $2.82 a share and up 36% to $2.89 on an adjusted basis) as the Little Rock, Ark., company ended a nine-quarter drought in sales growth with top-line gains of 6% in fiscal Q4 and 3% in Q1. The Street sees sales inching up 1% to $1.47 billion in the July-ending second quarter.Dillard's joins Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M) as new emerging leaders within the retail sector.

53,KSS,"Adidas (ADDYY) posted double-digit growth across all regions in Q4 and hiked its 2020 profitability target, as an emerging category helps growth in Nike (NKE)-dominated North America.The No. 2 sportswear brand's North America sales jumped 31% in constant currency last quarter. But its resurgence in the U.S. in recent years, once built on the back of retro classics like the Superstar and popular newer lines like the NMD, is now powered by a ""balanced product portfolio,"" Adidas North America Brand President Mark King told Investor's Business Daily.""A year ago it was primarily Originals driving the success, and although Originals still had a great year in '17 and is still doing well, our training apparel — primarily or specifically with Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) — is really growing at a very rapid rate, and that's a big opportunity for us,"" he said, adding that Adidas has also ""about tripled"" its market share in running over the last three years.On Tuesday, Dick's topped profit estimates but disappointed on sales and comps with its Q4 report.But Adidas' top growth driver is the entry-level ""core footwear"" category, which includes styles like Cloudfoam and is sold at stores such as Kohl's (KSS), DSW (DSW) and Famous Footwear.""We were really nonexistent there a few years ago,"" he said. ""(But) it's probably our fastest-growing category right now, and it's a massive category.""But fulfillment of online orders continues to challenge Adidas in North America, Cowen analyst John Kernan noted Wednesday, though distribution expansion will help drive growth in the U.S.""We heard several times from (management) on its Q4:17 earnings call that they believe the brand remains under-distributed in N. America and will look to expand further in the family footwear channel,"" wrote Kernan.Overall, revenue of 5.06 billion euros fell short of consensus views. The company earned 0.17 euro per share, minus the impact of tax reform. Margins also pleasantly surprised analysts.Management now expects an average 22%-24% annual growth in net income from continuing operations between 2015 and 2020, up from prior guidance for 20%-22% gains. It reaffirmed currency-neutral revenue growth of 10%-12% during that time frame.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.Nike remains the leading athletic apparel brand both at home and globally, and King admits that Adidas has struggled in basketball, an area in which Nike dominates.As it elbows out a now-less-powerful-looking Under Armour (UAA) from the American spotlight, Adidas sees room to grow.""We're now about a 10% market-share brand in North America, and we really believe at some point in our future, we should be 15%,"" said King, pointing to growth opportunities across categories. ""We're three times better than we were three years ago but we've got a long way to go.""Adidas sees currency-neutral sales growth of 10% in 2018, with double-digit growth expected in North America and Asia-Pacific. Basic EPS is seen rising 12% to 16%, which Piper Jaffray analysts called ""one of the best in peer growth.""U.S.-listed shares of Adidas closed up 9% on the stock market today, while Nike edged up 0.1%, and Under Armour fell 2.9%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Adidas' U.S. Boss Talks Amazon, Retail Strategies, And Kanye's Real ImpactBroadcom, IBD 50's Adobe, Recent IPOs To Report: Investing Action PlanStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

The deal could even help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and will be a test case to see if the Trump Administration and Pentagon still have concerns over the size of prime contractors.RELATED:Why The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop GrummanOPEC and noncartel members did not extend or deepen production cuts at Friday's meeting, but a move for increased monitoring and other steps hinted that production would not soar in 2018.

67,KSS,"The latest ""Star Wars"" movies have no doubt been good at bringing people to the theater, but is the Force strong enough to draw fans back to stores for Lucasfilm merchandise... again?XAhead of the Dec. 15 release of ""The Last Jedi,"" Disney's (DIS) second-ever ""Force Friday"" event, comes complete with midnight store openings and never-before-seen toys and products, much like its predecessor two years ago. Target (TGT) is notably hyping its Rey-related products, which should appeal to the many people who noted in 2015 the lack of toys bearing the likeness of the film's lead character.This time around, though, Disney is taking a page out of the ""Pokemon Go"" book and using augmented reality to get people walking to places they might not have previously gone to — in this case, the mall.A three-day ""Find the Force"" AR ""treasure hunt"" requires users to download an app, then head to one of the 20,000 participating stores to scan a correlating ""Find the Force"" logo and see ""Star Wars"" characters on their screen, layered on top of reality.The idea is that fans will return to stores on each of the event's three days to uncover all 15 characters — and hopefully buy some products in the process.(Plus, Entertainment Weekly said Wednesday to expect augmented reality Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters to appear over Central Park, the Eiffel Tower and other global landmarks.)The Disney Store, Toys R Us and Target will all fling open their doors at 12:01 a.m. Friday, but the list of ""Force Friday"" sequel participants is much longer.Wal-Mart (WMT) is hosting events in certain store parking lots and unveiling a giant Lego Luke Skywalker at one of its Orlando locations. Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen (both owned by Williams-Sonoma (WSM)) are offering ""Star Wars"" bedding, furniture and home decor. Staples says it will have ""Star Wars"" drones.Best Buy (BBY), GameStop (GME), Kohl's (KSS), J.C. Penney (JCP), Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) are also taking part in the festivities.At a time when brick-and-mortar stores are struggling to find new ways to ramp up sales and foot traffic, Lucasfilm's movies and merchandise have proved to be big hits, with Macquarie estimating in 2015 that ""The Force Awakens""-related products would likely make Disney $5 billion in revenue.And not that Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) need any help driving retail traffic, both companies are touting ""Star Wars"" events and products of their own, with Apple hosting kids' coding and illustrating workshops at Apple Stores, and Amazon boasting new products and discounts through the month of September.Walt Disney shares rose 0.3% to 102.87 on the stock market today.RELATED:Netflix's Success In Brazil Shows It Doesn't Need DisneyNetflix Might Hold On To Disney's 'Star Wars' Movies After AllDespite Comic-Con Hype, Hasbro Unit Selling Disney Toys Had Slow Sales

74,KSS,"Analysts are seeing good things ahead for Under Armour (UAA) and Michael Kors (KORS), while withholding their usual enthusiasm for Lululemon (LULU).Under Armour's valuation is ""in the eye of the beholder,"" but first-quarter and full-year guidance seems within reach and international growth looks pretty good, a Deutsche Bank analyst said Monday.Analyst Paul Trussell gave the Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY) rival an upgrade to hold from sell, calling out ""robust"" growth abroad, less discounting, and a push to reduce costs.Under Armour's wholesale trends in North America are still seen facing pressure — Nike too has struggled in the key region in recent quarters — but that has been partly offset by Kohl's (KSS) and DSW's (DSW) new partnerships with Under Armour, according to Trussel.Even as Deutsche Bank sees a return to mid-single-digit to high-single-digit EBIT margin, the bank is ""not quite bullish"" on the athletic brand.Risks include ""lost shelf space in U.S. sporting good stores, fierce brand competition for the consumer's attention and wallet, execution risk of strategy both domestically and internationally and perhaps most importantly the need to create product that is functional while also resonating with consumer from a fashion standpoint,"" wrote Trussell.Shares of Under Armour were up 4% at 16.75 in the stock market today, forming a bottoming base with an 18.85 entry and retaking support at the key 50-day moving average.

Same-store sales are expected to dip 0.3%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: EPS of $2.82 on revenue of $8.67 billion. Comparable sales on an owned basis were up 1.3% and up 1.4% on an owned plus licensed basis.Macy's also said it has sold floors 8-15 of its State Street store in Chicago for $30 million and is exploring the sale of the I.

RBC analyst Brian Tunick said in a research note last month that the gains partly reflect the chain's push into beauty, shoes, jewelry and its Backstage discount spaces.But he also said the gains came against easy comparisons, and followed a few years of declines. And Wall Street appeared unconvinced the pickup in sales marked a sustained turnaround, sending Macy's shares reeling after the release of the figures from November and December.The company is working its way through plans, announced in 2016, to close 100 stores.

Lumentum said China's inventory correction could last until the December quarter.Drug and biotech earnings were a mixed bag with Perrigo (PRGO), Horizon Pharma (HZNP), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) topping views while Mylan (MYL), Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) lagged second-quarter expectations.

In other news, Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) hit a two-year high after bumping up its timeline to file applications for two cholesterol-lowering treatments.Wendy's (WEN) second-quarter results topped Street estimates, with Stephens analysts attributing the strong showing to its value 4 for $4 meals and marketing of fresh, never-frozen beef in its hamburgers. Jack in the Box (JACK) same-store sales came in better than expected, but some analysts hope the chain can reclaim customers with a bigger push on cheap combo offerings and other deals. The company also continued to weigh whether to sell, or do something else with, Qdoba, its Mexican chain. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) beat on the top and bottom line. McDonald's (MCD) set its sights on China, forming a partnership that will aim to expand the number of locations there to 4,500 from 2,500.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) reported second-quarter EPS growth of 20% with revenue up 13% to $13.441 billion, both better than expected.

83,KSS,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Thursday: What you need to know as an investor.XIPOs and competition from FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) factor into a variety of earnings reports due Thursday, from Snap (SNAP), Blue Apron (APRN), three big department stores and digital advertising platform The Trade Desk (TTD). Nvidia (NVDA) and highly rated Chinese internet stock YY (YY) also report.Estimates: Wall Street expects the parent of the messaging site Snapchat to report a second-quarter per-share loss of 14 cents on revenue of $187 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.Shares of Snap have tumbled since it began trading in March on concerns about user engagement and competition from Facebook (FB).Instagram, the photo- and video-sharing site that Facebook bought in 2012, has introduced Instagram Stories, a feature that does much of what Snapchat allows its users to do. That is, string together photos and videos and decorate them with messages and other images over the course of the day. Instagram Stories now has more users than Snapchat overall.A ""lockup period"" for Snap's IPO also ended last week, allowing early investors to sell shares.Shares rebounded 4.3% to 13.58 in the stock market today after hitting a record-low 11.91 last week.Estimates: Wall Street expects the maker of graphics chips to report a 57% surge in second-quarter EPS to 69 cents, as revenue jumps 36% to $1.948 billion.Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a research note Wednesday, according to CNBC, that he expected the company's PC gaming business to get a lift from the demand for the Nintendo Switch, as well as from digital-currency mining — the verifying and recording of transactions, for currencies like bitcoin, done with graphics-processing units.Firmer pricing from Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) also bode well for Nvidia, he said.Shares rose 1.1% to 172.11. The stock recently cleared a cup base with a 168.60 buy point, but in low volume.Estimates: A second-quarter net loss of 26 cents a share on revenue of $235 million. The earnings report will be the first since the company's late-June IPO.Blue Apron delivers high-quality meal kits intended to take the hassle out of planning and cooking. But some two weeks before the company began trading, e-commerce giant Amazon said it planned to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods (WFM) for $13.4 billion. The deal led to speculation that Amazon would use Whole Foods to dramatically widen its food-delivery network. Amazon reportedly has also planned to expand its meal-kit offerings.Blue Apron priced its July IPO at 10, at the low end of a lowered range.Less than a month after its IPO, Blue Apron said that co-founder Matthew Wadiak was stepping down as chief operating officer to become a senior company advisor.Shares leapt 7.4% to 6.24 Wednesday after hitting a record low of 5.51 intraday.Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) are set to report Thursday. As with Blue Apron, Amazon has for years presented a fundamental threat to department stores, which have struggled to repurpose excess retail space and compete with off-price retailers. Investors and analysts will be looking for any evidence that the retail giants are making any headway with various initiatives.Macy's is seen reporting Q2 EPS of 44 cents, a 23% drop, as revenue slips 6% to $5.501 billion.Kohl's Q2 EPS is seen down 3% to $1.18 on revenue of $4.109 billion, down 2%.Nordstrom is expected to report Q2 EPS of 62 cents, down 7%, with revenue up 2% to $3.732 billion.Macy's and Kohl's shares sank 2.1% Wednesday. Nordstrom retreated 1.1%. J.C. Penney (JCP), which reports Friday morning, fell 4.3%.Estimates: Q2 EPS of 19 cents on revenue of $69 million. The company, whose digital advertising platform locates and buys online multimedia advertising space in a fraction of a second, relative to customers' budget and strategy, began trading in September.The Trade Desk in May said its Q1 earnings had doubled, and it reported ""incredibly strong customer wins"" and ""exceptional"" international gains, and it said the results pointed to ""a strong 2017 for our business.""However, analysts have expressed concern about Trade Desk's much bigger rivals, like Facebook and Google-owner Alphabet, which also run their own ad platforms.Shares sank 1% to 53.99. The stock has tried to break out of a consolidation with a 57.67 entry.Estimates: Wall Street expects the Chinese live-streaming and social platform to report Q2 EPS of $1.34, climbing 34%, as revenue charges 22% higher to $364 million. Shares rallied 2.2% to 77.97.

89,KSS,"Macy's (M) shares hit a seven-year low and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) breached its key 200-day moving average amid a report that department stores are now discounting prestige beauty products, a segment once thought to be untouchable by price slashers.XLord & Taylor and Macy's-owned Bloomingdale's are following Macy's in offering slight discounts on beauty products, according to the Wall Street Journal.Macy's fell 7% to 21.08 in the stock market today, hitting its worst levels since September 2010 amid the latest retail rout. Kohl's (KSS) shares skidded 4.2%, cutting its 50-day. Kohl's is near a recent 52-week low. Nordstrom (JWN) tumbled 2.7% to 46.24.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) sank through its 200-day line for the first time in 16 months. Ulta fell 2.9% to 268.82, continuing a downward march from a recent all-time high of 314.86 in early June.Specialty beauty retailers Ulta Beauty and Sephora have typically been regarded as Amazon (AMZN)-resistant companies, immune to the promotional downward spiral facing apparel sellers and the woes befalling Macy's and other department stores. Both also have strong rewards programs that court shoppers' loyalty.But Monday's story in the Journal, while not indicative of greater discounting at Ulta or Sephora, may point to concerns over potential ripple effects. It is unclear how much pressure specialty beauty retailers would experience should heavy cosmetics discounting at department stores become widespread.Estee Lauder (EL), a prestige brand found at major department stores (and to a certain degree at Ulta and Sephora), fell below its 50-day moving average for the first time in three months. Shares closed off session lows, losing just 1 cent to 94.27, but that's below the rising support line.Estee Lauder cleared a 94.57 entry point from a cup-with-handle base in late May, rising as high as 98.40.

90,KSS,"Known retail disruptor Amazon.com (AMZN) is at it again, reportedly.WWD said Wednesday, citing market sources, that online cosmetics-retailer Violet Grey could partner with Amazon to sell its luxury brands through the e-commerce behemoth.Violet Grey was founded in 2013 by Cassandra Grey, the wife of late ex-Paramount Pictures CEO Brad Grey. The company has a brick-and-mortar presence on Melrose Place in Los Angeles, offering ""expertly curated beauty products and exclusive offerings, all tested and approved by Hollywood's leading hairstylists, skin care experts, and makeup artists.""X Its e-commerce site features photo shoots with celebrities such as ""Game of Thrones"" star Emilia Clarke and stories like ""Lessons on Hair Volume"" and ""Violette's Rules of Foundation.""Why does it matter? The news of Violet Grey's potential deal with Amazon is likely what's weighing on specialty retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) in the stock market today. Ulta fell 3.65% to 247.24, hitting a fresh 2017 low intraday as shares continue their downward trajectory from early June.Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan, who wrote that he was ""unsurprised"" by the report, called a potential Amazon-Violet Grey deal a ""negative for retailers, including Ulta and Sephora, and to (a) lesser extent department stores, which rely on beauty to drive foot traffic.""Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and peers certainly have their own troubles, and a recent Wall Street Journal report — on department stores discounting prestige beauty products — sent Macy's shares to a seven-year low. J.C. Penney (JCP) has seen beauty sales grow, thanks to its Sephora shop-in-shops.One small online beauty retailer getting the backing of Amazon doesn't pose an imminent threat to cosmetics stores or retailers that carry makeup and skin care. The worry, though, is what it indicates about Amazon's interest in entering the space — and how hard the e-commerce heavy will pummel away once it has something in its cross hairs.Grocery stores, after all, could tell its counterparts in beauty a thing or two.Estee Lauder (EL) and L'Oreal-owned brands are also sold on Violet Grey.""We ultimately think it makes sense for companies such as Estee Lauder, L'Oreal, and LVMH to offer a limited assortment of prestige beauty brands for sale on Amazon, given the substantial shift in consumer shopping behavior online,"" said Astrachan.He thinks the owners of brands sold on Violet Grey would have right of refusal to sell on Amazon, but if a deal were to happen, ""we would anticipate the independent brands would be most likely to embrace Amazon, with a likely far-more-limited assortment of larger brands being offered for sale in time.""Estee Lauder shares rose 0.2% intraday to 98.92. The stock is at the edge of the buy zone from a 94.57 cup-with-handle base entry point.Prestige beauty brands keep a tight cap on distribution in order to assert control over pricing and brand image. But this news and e-commerce focus is ""modestly favorable"" to both L'Oreal and Estee Lauder, said Astrachan, especially since a broader online presence would ease Estee Lauder's reliance on mid-tier department stores for its sales.... Exactly what kind of impact Amazon is looking to make on the beauty space. And it might be too early to panic, says one expert.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said that Violet Grey's estimated revenue is ""well below"" $5 million a year (while noting Ulta's market cap has taken a $550 million hit so far Wednesday), and that it has a ""tiny"" social-media presence compared to Ulta and Estee Lauder. But it does have ""decent"" traction with celebrities, she said.And according to Piper Jaffray, Violet Grey carries 130 brands, mostly skin care and cosmetics. But only 15 of the brands overlap with Ulta's offerings, such as Dior, Giorgio Armani, MAC and others.""Bottom line, while we recognize the ""headline"" risk of seeing AMZN & any category (in this case, beauty) in the same line, we don't see a near-term risk for the beauty category being disintermediated by Amazon at this juncture,"" wrote Murphy.She has an overweight rating and 330 price target on Ulta Beauty.Amazon, meanwhile, rose 1.2% to 1,052.80, hitting a record high but in buy range from a 1,016,60 entry.

92,KSS,"Stocks wrestled to a healthy finish Thursday in a session where early gains were dented by Senate testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.XThe Dow Jones industrial average slimmed to a 0.1% gain, after climbing almost 0.2% in late trade.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended up 0.2% each.  Small caps posted a weak session, with Russell 2000 futures ending only slightly below the break-even line.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped hard just after 10 a.m. ET, during the first half hour of the Fed chair's Senate testimony Thursday. The S&P 500 rallied back to retake its early-morning high. The Nasdaq posted its high of the day just ahead of Yellen's testimony.The day's economic data had a mixed effect on trade, including a more slight-than-expected drop in weekly unemployment claims and a smaller-than-forecast increase in core producer prices for June.Thursday's action left the Nasdaq composite ahead nearly 2% for the week and tracking toward its best weekly finish since late May.  The S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the Dow Jones industrial average held a 0.6% gain.Six of the 10 strongest gains among industries came from retail groups, with department stores and auto parts chains leading the procession.Target (TGT) appeared to launch the retail rally, rising nearly 5% after boosting its second-quarter same-store-sales and earnings guidance, based on strong April and May traffic.

The stock spiked to new highs, but its consolidation was too short to be a cup base and too deep for a flat-base pattern, so offered no valid buy point.Fiber-optic peer Lumentum Holdings (LITE) bolted 6% higher, gaining volume support on its rebound from its 10-week moving average.RELATED:For Vacation, Watch These Travel Stocks: Investing Action PlanNetflix Earnings Power Underappreciated, Gets Price Target HikeFiber Stocks Rally As Applied Opto Preannounces Q2 BeatIs Apple Basing Now?

96,KSS,"J.C. Penney (JCP) and Nike (NKE) have joined forces to launch Nike ""brand shop environments"" in more than 600 J.C. Penney stores, the department store chain said Tuesday.The linkup between the midlevel department store company and major sports apparel brand pits them directly against another similar duo. Under Armour (UAA) announced last July a move to roll out products at around 600 Kohl's (KSS) locations starting early this year.On the surface, the most notable difference in the two alliances appears to be the gender of their target consumers.The 500 sq. ft. Nike shop-in-shops, which are now available, have been placed in a ""prominent location within the men's department,"" said J.C. Penney, and will feature basketball, training and running product areas. The details found in the press release appeared primarily geared toward men's products, though the company said ""similar visual elements are available in select stores for women and kids.""Meanwhile, Under Armour Chief Executive Kevin Plank acknowledged last year that the majority of Kohl's customers are women shoppers.""We think Kohl's is a great evolution for us,"" said Plank in Under Armour's second-quarter call in late July, adding he thinks there's ""a big opportunity"" in the women's market.IBD's TAKE: What's in store for American shoppers?

Comps in the Americas sank 4%. Sales at the Fifth Avenue store tumbled 14%, ""at least partly to post-election traffic disruptions,"" Tiffany said. Trump Tower is located right next door to Tiffany's flagship location.Tiffany had warned in November that post-election disruptions could hurt sales.

98,KSS,"Nike (NKE) shares are falling Thursday after the No. 1 sports apparel brand said it expects to cut about 2% of its global workforce as it implements leadership and organization changes. Separately, Under Armour (UAA) got an estimate cut as one analyst says stores are ""likely canceling"" product orders.The changes are meant to ""streamline and speed up strategic execution,"" said Nike in a press release. Its new ""consumer direct offense"" targets a dozen cities — New York, London, Shanghai, Beijing, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, Mexico City, Barcelona, Seoul, and Milan — that are seen accounting for over 80% of its growth through 2020.Nike, a Dow Jones industrial average component, has had its eyes set on reaching $50 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal 2020, with North America making up 40% of that target.Nike shares fell 3.2% to 52.90 on the stock market today, falling back below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Nike had more than 70,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2016.Aside from the job cuts, Thursday's announcement includes shuffling around of leadership positions and the creation of new segments.Its previously announced ""triple double"" strategy aims to halve the product-creation cycle, and the company said Thursday that its head of product and merchandising, Michael Spillane, will become President of Categories and Product, a new unit, to ""supercharge this faster pipeline.""More resources will be dedicated to running, basketball, Nike sportswear, men's and women's training, soccer and young athletes, the ""categories with the highest potential to fuel growth.""Its new Nike Direct unit marries its website, direct-to-consumer retail and Nike+ digital offerings.IBD'S TAKE: This follows a recent change in Nike's ""futures"" reporting that indicated a shift in its mix of retail and e-commerce sales: That Nike Metric That Sank Shares? Stop Looking At It, Says NikeAs part of the changes, the company will start divvying up its financial reporting into four geographic areas — North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Greater China and Asia-Pacific and Latin America (APLA) — down from six.Meanwhile, Susquehanna reduced its Under Armour profit and sales estimates for fiscal 2017 and 2018 on expectations that stores such as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Hibbett (HIBB), Academy, Modell's and Scheel's ""will shrink their exposure to Under Armour in response to the poor product segmentation and the little progress in fixing the problem.""Analyst Sam Poser said it's ""becoming clear"" that sales of Under Armour products at Kohl's (KSS), DSW (DSW) and Famous Footwear won't be enough to offset lost sales from shuttered sports-apparel retailers, and that stores are beginning to promote Under Armour items to price-match Kohl's, spurring concerns of more promotional activity.""There is also little to no progress being made by UAA to create product that resonates from a fashion perspective,"" added Poser.Under Armour shares fell 4.4% to 21.71.Nike, however, segments its items ""well enough that its customers that shop at (Dick's) have no interest in the product at (Kohl's), regardless of the price, and the Nike brand remains unscathed,"" he said.Adidas (ADDYY), which has revived its brand in the U.S., fell 3.1% to 96.91, backing away from a potential buy point of 102.09.

99,KSS,"Like a pro athlete, Nike (NKE) knows that it needs to tweak its strategy from time to time to stay competitive.XOn its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Wall Street will likely be looking for more commentary on the athletic footwear and apparel maker's new consumer-focused initiatives intended to keep it in sync with a digitally driven retail environment and ahead of rivals Adidas (ADDYY) and Under Armour (UAA). Nike's recent sales arrangement with Amazon (AMZN)? Expect questions about that too.For the quarter, Wall Street expects flat year-over-year per-share earnings of 49 cents on 4.5% revenue growth to $8.61 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. That would mark a second flat Q4 for EPS and a slight slowdown in sales growth.The results will come roughly two weeks after Nike announced a new ""consumer direct offense"" alignment. That effort reorganizes Nike's leadership and geographic structure and tightens its focus on a dozen key cities across the world that are expected to account for 80% of its projected growth through 2020.Part of Nike's new game plan also involves what it calls a ""triple double"" goal to double innovation, speed to market and direct engagement with customers. The plan also includes laying off 2% of its global workforce. Nike shares fell more than 3% on June 15, the day of the news.Nike and other major athletic apparel and footwear brands are all developing manufacturing and supply-chain technologies to get on-trend products on shelves faster. Under Armour this week also announced a leadership shuffle of its own, reviving its COO position.The sluggish retail environment has raised questions about how and where individual brands will sell their products, as brick-and-mortar stores like Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) struggle to shore up store traffic amid competition from Amazon and off-price chains.Nike will reportedly sell footwear directly on Amazon in an attempt to combat the sale of knockoff goods at the e-commerce giant. That could spell trouble for J.C. Penney and Kohl's (KSS), Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom said last week.Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) immediately took a hit on news of a possible Nike-Amazon team-up — perhaps not without reason. Nike, Adidas, Hanesbrands (HBI)-owned Hanes and Under Armour are the most frequently bought brands on Amazon, Morgan Stanley said in April.As Nike dials down the emphasis on its self-created ""futures orders"" — a metric designed to reflect retailer demand — it is dialing up its own in-house manufacturing and selling capabilities, with aims to halve its product-creation cycle and streamline its brick-and-mortar and online retail experiences.Still, Cowen this month trimmed its price target on Nike to 53 from 54 on increased promotional activity amid its rivalry with Adidas and Under Armour, and JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight.Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole said earlier this month that the market is expecting Nike to guide fiscal 2018 profit below consensus for $2.52 per share — Zacks currently puts consensus at $2.44 — but that those expectations have already been priced into the stock. He has an equal-weight rating on the stock.Given ""poor"" sentiment and high short interest in Nike, Sole sees bulls snapping up shares of the athletic brand after the market digests the company's full-year guidance on Thursday.Nike shares closed up 0.8% at 53.36 on the stock market today, hitting resistance on the underside of their converging 50-day and 200-day lines. The stock is up less than 5% so far in calendar 2017, underperforming the S&P 500.

Macy's is even looking at how to rework its parking lots.A liquidation of Sears Canada would follow Target's (TGT) plans, announced in 2015, to exit Canada, and it would join a growing list of retailers in bankruptcy or on the brink.In March, discount department-store chain Gordmans Stores filed for bankruptcy with plans to liquidate. Wet Seal, BCBG Maxzria and Payless ShoeSource have filed for bankruptcy in recent months as well.In April, women's apparel chain Bebe (BEBE) said it would close all its stores by the end of May to become an online-only retailer, and Vince (VNCE) said it had ""substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue"" over leverage debt ratio concerns.Sears Canada's potential move toward creditor protection would also come as Sears' legal disputes with suppliers increasingly occur out in the open.Sears Holdings has sued two suppliers of Craftsman tools in the past two months over their agreements to deliver products to the retailer. Sears this month settled with the first of those companies, One World, which Sears CEO Eddie Lampert said had tried to ""embarrass us in the media to force us to let them out of their contract.""RELATED:Amazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesWhat Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will Work

103,KSS,"Under Armour (UAA) shares are in a tailspin Tuesday after fourth-quarter earnings disappointed and the athletic apparel brand said CFO Chip Molloy is stepping down ""due to personal reasons.""During the key holiday shopping season, the Nike (NKE) rival logged a penny's profit decline from the prior-year to 23 cents a share on 12% revenue growth to $1.308 billion, the weakest gain in eight years. North American sales grew just 6% while international revenue (16% of the total) jumped 55%.Analysts had expected a 4% EPS rise to 25 cents with sales up 20% to $1.409 billion.""Numerous challenges and disruptions in North American retail tempered our fourth quarter results,"" said Kevin Plank, Under Armour Chairman and CEO, in a statement.The quarter is prompting something of a reset — at least of Plank's well-known whiteboard. He scrubbed the board clean of his maxims and motivational phrases (most notably ""Don't forget to sell shirts and shoes"") and replaced it with ""Keep Under Armour simple,"" he said during the earnings call.For 2017, management expects net revenue to rise 11%-12% to reach nearly $5.4 billion, well below analyst views for $6.05 billion. Along with this ""tempered"" sales growth, ""strategic investments"" will lead to a drop in operating income.Shares crashed nearly 26% to 21.49 in the stock market today, setting a three-year low. Under Armour is on track for its worst one-day stock loss since it came public in 2005.The guidance left one analyst wondering if the brand might be struggling more than it is letting on.""The revenue guidance is peculiar given the rollout into Kohl's (KSS),"" wrote Susquehanna's Sam Poser, who downgraded the stock to neutral from positive. ""However, the decision to go to the moderate channel may have been more reactive than we had previously thought.""Athletic footwear stocks have largely been having a tough go of it for the last year. Under Armour, Nike and Skechers (SKX) all posted double-digit share-price declines in 2016 amid a tough consumer environment. NPD Group said Monday that the athletic footwear industry grew a below-average 3% in 2016, with slight declines during the holiday quarter as the bankruptcies of Sports Authority and Sport Chalet.Nike stock fell 0.3% intraday, but rebounded from morning lows to close back above its 50-day line. Skechers rose 0.8% after undercutting its 50-day intraday.And as retro and classic trends rule the sneaker set, Under Armour is acknowledging that the brand does not have as much fashion cred as it could.""We need to become more fashionable with the products that are out there,"" said Plank during the call. He said the company had been counting on core basics, but today's consumer ""frankly has more options"" from good brands that are discounting their prices, he said.""The consumer expects more today, he later added.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy, who downgraded the stock from overweight to neutral, noted the slowdown.""By segment, apparel grew only 7% — well below the 17% growth rate we anticipated and while footwear was still a healthy 36%, we see the slowing apparel as a significant concern to the brand given the importance of this category,"" she wrote.But Plank, predictably, still sounded bullish on the future, particularly the China and womenswear markets.""Our eyes are wide open and we're ready to run in 2017 and beyond,"" he said.When Molloy steps down, senior VP David Bergman will take over as acting CFO on Feb. 3, said Under Armour.RELATED:Spring Retail Playoffs: J.C.

104,KSS,"With Amazon.com (AMZN) breathing down its neck, Wal-Mart (WMT) has reorganized its e-commerce unit and assigned new executive positions.The changes are meant to make Wal-Mart more ""customer-centric,"" says a report from Bloomberg. Wal-Mart is investing heavily in online operations. It bought e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion in September. The founder of Jet.com, Marc Lore, is now CEO of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operation.The company is streamlining its web team so that it can better serve customers when they shop online, via smartphones or in stores, according to a Wal-Mart memo obtained by Bloomberg.Amazon has put increased pressure on Wal-Mart in fields like food and grocery and apparel. And last month, Amazon announced Amazon Go, a high-tech convenience store in Seattle, where Amazon is based. The 1,800-square-foot store is in beta-testing for now; it's slated to open to all in early 2017. Amazon Go takes dead aim at the physical-store world and poses an increasing threat to Wal-Mart and others.Amazon stock rose 0.44% to 817.24 in the stock market today, and it's risen all but one trading day in 2017. Wal-Mart stock fell 1.2% to 67.13.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to its bold e-commerce play, Amazon is leading the market in cloud computing services with other plans to spread its tentacles far and wide.The threat of Amazon is putting the squeeze on Wal-Mart and other big retailers such as Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Sears (SHLD), and the company looks to be getting larger. On Thursday, Amazon said it would boost its full-time U.S.-based workforce by 100,000, aiming to reach 280,000 jobs by mid-2018. Amazon employed 30,000 in 2011.Amazon said many of the new jobs will be in fulfillment centers that have been announced over the past several months and are currently under construction in Texas, California, Florida, New Jersey and other states. Amazon delivered more than 2 billion packages for independent merchants in 2016, more than double its 2015 tally.But a report by Pacific Crest Securities says the new hires could also be part of Amazon's push to accelerate efforts to build physical stores.""Amazon will also add nonfulfillment center jobs, but we think that still leaves a significant and unexplained gap,"" the Pacific Crest report said. ""We believe that this could be explained by an accelerated rollout of physical stores. In particular, we think that a potential grocery pickup concept looks particularly promising.""Already this year, Macy's has detailed plans to shutter 68 stores and cut more than 10,000 jobs. It plans to close a total of 100 locations. Macy's and Kohl's both slashed holiday-quarter earnings estimates after their same-store sales for November-December fell 2.1%.Sears said it would close another 150 Sears and Kmart stores. The Limited said it would close all 250 of its stores, and ax 4,000 jobs, as it moves its entire operation online.RELATED: Amazon Spreads Its Tentacles Far Beyond 'World's Biggest Bookstore'Amazon's Latest Perk For Prime Members? 5% Back Visa CardAmazon's Next Big Growth Opportunity Could Be ApparelAmazon: Still The E-Commerce Elephant In The Retail Room?

106,KSS,"Retail sales rose 0.6% in December and 0.2% excluding autos, as the holiday shopping season ended on a so-so note.Wall Street expected a 0.7% monthly bump, or 0.5% excluding auto sales. November sales were revised to a 0.2 % rise and 0.3% excluding autos.Stocks weakened slightly after the report.The 2.4% gain in auto sales came as strong December results from General Motors (GM) helped lift industry sales to an 18.4 million annual pace. General Motors, which reported a 10% year-over-year U.S. gain, gave a bullish forecast for 2017 earnings this week.Sales at nonstore retailers led by Amazon (AMZN) jumped 1.3% in December and 13.2% from a year ago. Amazon was seen as grabbing a share of e-commerce holiday sales growth. Meanwhile, the shift away from mall clobbers department stores including Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Sears (SHLD). Amazon said Thursday that it will add 100,000 full-time jobs in the U.S. by mid-2018. Meanwhile, Macy's and Sears announced store closures after Macy's and Kohl's slashed earnings forecasts as both reported November-December comps fall 2.1% vs. a year earlier.General merchandise sales fell 0.5%, with the department store category down 0.6% in December and 8.4% from a year ago.

107,KSS,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose in January after surging at the end of 2016, as enthusiasm following Donald Trump's election continues to build into the new year.The Economic Optimism Index climbed 0.8 point in January to 55.6, just below the November 2006 peak of 55.7. That followed December's 3.4-point jump in the wake of the presidential election. That 8.2% gain over two months almost exactly matches the 8.3% rally in the Dow Jones industrial average since Election Day through Tuesday. Not only is the stock rally fattening investor portfolios and 401(k) accounts, it's providing tangible evidence that ordinary Americans should feel more upbeat.It's not unusual for confidence to improve after an election, especially when the party in power changes hands. After a grueling campaign season, voters are relieved to move on and hopeful that Trump's agenda of tax cuts and deregulation can boost economic growth and their own finances. And while big businesses worry about Trump singling them out for criticism on Twitter, many Americans see a decisive leader working for them.""Americans are hopeful that President-elect Donald Trump will deliver on his promises to boost U.S. employment and grow the economy,"" said Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica, IBD's polling partner. ""Since Mr. Trump's victory, various companies, such as Ford (F), Alibaba (BABA), and Softbank (SFTBY), have committed to creating jobs here and investing in U.S. production. Further, the stock market has hit record highs, and is inching closer to 20,000. These encouraging signs are why many Americans see a bright future for the U.S. economy under Trump.""The warm feelings aren't universal, as Americans continue to see the economy via a partisan lens. Republicans and independents became slightly more optimistic after turning sharply upbeat last month after the election. But Democrats were slightly more pessimistic after their sentiment cratered in December.The Economic Optimism Index has three main subindexes. They all are much higher since the presidential election.Meanwhile, the Financial Related Stress Index fell to 52.2 from 56 in December and 58.3 in October. That's the lowest reading — meaning less financial stress — since the gauge began in December 2007, when the recession started.IBD'S TAKE: In his final month of office, Americans give President Obama poor marks on the economy and race relations, but say his presidency was a success, according to the IBD/TIPP Poll.Consumers aren't alone in feeling more confident. The NFIB's small business optimism index for December soared to its highest level since the end of 2004. A net 50% of small firms see the economy improving, vs. 12% in November and -7% in October. Homebuilders' confidence has hit a decade high even with mortgage rates jumping in recent months.As businesses become more willing to invest and expand, consumers may step up their spending, especially with wage gains picking up.But not all retailers will be winners.Amazon (AMZN) appears to have had a strong holiday season yet again. But Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) slashed profit forecasts as they were among several brick-and-mortar chains — but not all — warning of grim holiday sales as shoppers made purchases at Amazon and other online stores. It's unclear what Macy's and other department stores can do to stop the slide.Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) on Tuesday gave a bullish 2017 earnings forecast after reporting a surprisingly strong 10% U.S. sales gain in December. Ford announced a special dividend Tuesday and sees ""improved profitability"" in 2018 after an investment-heavy 2017.The IBD/TIPP Poll surveyed 904 adults from Jan. 3-9 via live interviews. It has an margin of error of +/- 3.3 points.RELATED:Trump Bump: Small Business Optimism Soars To 12-Year HighGeneral Motors Soars To 21-Month High On Bullish Earnings ForecastAmazon: Still The E-Commerce Elephant In The Retail Room?JCPenney Joins Macy's, Kohl's With Weak Holiday SalesMore Holiday Winners, Losers: Maybe Amazon Didn't Ruin Everything?

109,KSS,"JCPenney (JCP) said that same-store sales fell 0.8% in November and December, making it the latest department store giant to put up uninspiring holiday results as malls become increasingly barren and Amazon.com (AMZN)-led e-commerce thrives.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) late Wednesday cut profit forecasts due to tepid holiday sales, with both saying November-December comps slid 2.1%. Macy's also said it planned to slash 10,000 jobs as it closes 68 stores as part of a plan to shut 100 locations over time. The forecasts also came after Macy's in November expressed optimism about the holiday quarter.Meanwhile, Sears (SHLD) said this week that it would sell Craftsman to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) and close 150 Kmart and Sears locations.JCPenney fell 3.7% to 7.57 in the stock market today after tumbling 7.2% on Thursday.The retailer said the first three weeks of November were ""challenging,"" but that comps from the Thanksgiving week through the end of December were positive. Sluggish sales in women's apparel continued to weigh on the chain's results, JCPenney said.The picture was a brighter for appliances, jewelry, outerwear, boots, toys and Sephora beauty products. JCPenney's e-commerce division saw ""double-digit growth,"" the company said, and it held to its EBITDA goal of $1 billion for fiscal 2016.""As we prepare for a new fiscal year, our turnaround in profitability remains on track, and I am pleased that we expect to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating profit,"" CEO Marvin Ellison said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: As traditional and specialty retailers struggle amid the galactic expansion of Amazon, off-price retailers have done better. Burlington Stores, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, was among the few growth stories in retail. As retailers reel, Adobe (ADBE) this week reported that online holiday sales rose 11% to a record $91.7 billion. Meanwhile, the December jobs report showed that nonstore retailers reported a 5.5% employment gain over the past 12 months. While neither report named Amazon, other surveys suggested that it was grabbing a huge share of overall e-commerce sales.Amazon rose 2%, continuing to advance after clearing its 50-day moving average earlier in the week.Macy's dipped 0.1% Friday after crashing nearly 14% Thursday.

Shares have been trying to recover from a recent slide after finding support near 100. Despite a decline stemming from a sharp 7% loss Dec. 28, the stock remains well above its 50-day line.

Japan's services sector grew at the fastest pace in 11 months. Ireland's services index popped to a five-month high in December.But in India, the services gauge for December contracted for a second straight month.

Shares of the Grapevine, Texas-based company fell hard on the news.GameStop stock fell 8.1% to 22.73 on the stock market today, at a two-month low.The retailer has had a rough couple of years, hurt mainly by the shift to digital game downloads and away from packaged media. In response, GameStop has diversified its business from video games to mobile devices and pop-culture collectibles. In addition to GameStop stores, it also runs shops that sell AT&T (T) and Apple (AAPL) products.GameStop said its total sales for the holiday period declined 16.4% year over year to $2.5 billion. It said comparable store sales dropped 18.7%, hit by weak sales of the Activision Blizzard (ATVI) game ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" and Electronic Arts (EA) game ""Titanfall 2,"" as well as aggressive console promotions on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday.IBD'S TAKE: GameStop stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 26, meaning it has been outperformed by 74% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on GameStop stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""During the holiday period, sales in the video game segment were impacted by industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure and lower in-store traffic, amidst a difficult holiday season for many retailers,"" GameStop CEO Paul Raines said in a statement. ""We are disappointed with our overall results, but looking broadly, we did see continued growth in our non-physical gaming businesses and we expect this category to approach 40% of our earnings in fiscal 2016.""As we look forward to 2017, we remain focused on our transformation plan, which includes growing our non-gaming businesses, right-sizing our global store portfolio by continuously evaluating non-productive stores for closure, and maintaining strong financial discipline, including reducing SG&A (selling, general and administrative expenses) by $100 million by 2019.""GameStop sales of new game hardware fell 30.3% in the holiday period, dinged by slowing sales of Sony (SNE) PlayStation 4 and Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox One consoles.GameStop sales of new software decreased 22.8% due to difficult comparisons to titles launched a year earlier, lower average selling prices and decreased store traffic. Pre-owned game software sales dipped 7.9% compared with the 2015 holiday season.The company said its Technology Brands revenue, which is not included in comparable store sales, rose 44% to $192.4 million, driven by store growth and strong sales of the Apple iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7.GameStop reiterated its fourth-quarter earnings per share guidance of $2.23 to $2.38.

But Russia's energy minister said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks. The International Energy Agency said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. OPEC said Saudi Arabia pumped a record amount of crude oil in July, and the cartel left its 2017 demand outlook unchanged at 95.41 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million for the week ended Aug 5. And U.S. production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels, a second straight week of declines.U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 15 to 396 in the week ended Aug. 12, Baker Hughes said.

Wal-Mart has sizable online sales, but growth has been decelerating. Wal-Mart also will put Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, though Jet.com will remain separately. Lore previously founded Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, before Amazon bought it.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.2%, hitting a 14-month high during the week.Solar stocks after SunPower cut its 2016 guidance and inverter-supplier SolarEdge (SEDG) cited a slowdown at U.S. installers. For Q2, SunPower's Q2 revenue growth and adjusted loss topped estimates. But SunPower sees Q3 revenue of just $700 million to $800 million vs. the consensus for $1.13 billion, as demand for utility-scale solar projects tumbles. And SunPower also cut its 2016 view to $2.8 billion-$3 billion, missing analysts' view for $3.3 billion.SolarEdge's $124.8 million in fiscal Q4 sales missed analysts' expectations for $129.4 million, but 44 cents EPS minus items beat by a nickel. The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million-$139 million trailed the consensus at $137 million, and EPS missed by a penny.SolarCity (SCTY), which has agreed to a takeover deal by Tesla (TSLA), topped analysts' Q2 projections for adjusted loss and revenue. But its current-quarter view for $155 million-$168 million in revenue lagged the consensus for $174.6 million.SunPower stock crashed 28% to a 3-year low.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), involved in everything from gaming to autonomous driving and AI, rose 8.3% for the week to a fresh high after the Tesla partner reported $1.43 billion in sales and 40 cents earnings per share. That topped the consensus for $1.35 billion and 37 cents, and was up 24% and 700%, respectively, vs. last year. Nvidia sees current-quarter sales at $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts' model for $1.45 billion.With China, telecoms and data centers spending heavily for higher-speed connections, makers of fiber optic components are seeing huge demand.Hot IPO Acacia Communications said Q2 revenue rose 101% to $116 million, and adjusted earnings soared 305%. Lumentum (LITE) and Inphi (IPHI) also reported stronger-than-expected figures. NeoPhotonics (NPTN) sales growth fell short due to sluggish demand for older parts, but production of 100-gigabit gear is ramping up. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group hit a 15-year high Thursday and ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups.Acacia rose 41% Friday and nearly 50% for the week, blasting to new highs. Lumentum rose more than 4% and Inphi 16%, also to new highs. NeoPhotonics climbed 2.6% to 14.01, clearing a 13.85 buy point on Friday.Related:IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications is among several tech leaders that have risen 20% past a buy point, putting them in profit-taking zone.

IBD's latest Tech Leaders column explains when to hold onto winning stocks, and how those rules apply to Acacia, Weibo and others right now.Recent IPO Twilio (TWLO), a communications software firm, reported a narrower than-expected non-GAAP loss. Q2 revenue jumped 70% to $64.5 million, vs. Wall Street estimates of $58.2 million, although sales from its top customer, Facebook (FB)-owned WhatsApp, fell 8% year over year. Twilio's full-year guidance edged consensus estimates.Twilio shares surged 28% for the week, hitting a new high.Medpace Holdings (MEDP) soared 20% to 27.79 in Thursday's debut after pricing at 23, the high end of its expected IPO range. Shares edged up 0.9% to 28.04 on Friday. Medpace provides outsourced clinical development services for drug and medical device companies.Specialty drugmakers ended what had been a strong Q2 season for the drug industry on a more ambiguous note. Allergan (AGN), freshly divested of its generics business, beat expectations slightly but trimmed its sales guidance. Shares fell 1.7% for the week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) missed Q2 numbers but affirmed its guidance as it reorganized. It said its deal with Walgreens (WBA) was finally turning profitable and that it was willing to sell $8 billion worth of non-core assets. The stock soared 25% Tuesday, but pared weekly gains to 13.5% on a report that Valeant could face criminal charges of defrauding insurers.Medivation (MDVN) reported a ho-hum quarter, but profit will likely be flat until an expected market expansion for its drug Xtandi in Q4. Shares rose 4.4% to 66.02, a 14-month high and just barely in buy range from a 63.04 entry. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed EPS estimates and lowered guidance, partly due to a change in tax reporting and partly due to higher costs. Its stock dropped 9.3%. Mylan (MYL) beat its profit estimate slightly and affirmed its guidance, with its controversially high-priced EpiPen making up for light generic drug sales. Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4.

130,KSS,"Kate Spade (KATE) plunged Wednesday after the handbag and fashion company missed estimates and slashed guidance, blaming tourism and general retail woes. The move also dragged down peers including Michael Kors (KORS) and Coach (COH) and exacerbated concerns about the consumer sector. Kate Spade's Q2 earnings per share rose 38% to 11 cents, missing estimates by 3 cents a share. The retailer topped earnings expectations in Q1 after missing the prior four quarters in a row.""Several factors contributed to our second-quarter results falling short of our expectations, the most impactful of which are the retail landscape and continuing tourist headwinds,"" CEO Craig Leavitt said in the written earnings statement.Terror fears and a rising dollar is hurting travel from Europe.The New York retailer sees full-year earnings of 63-70 cents, far below analyst consensus of 78 cents a share. It cut its 2016 revenue outlook to $1.37 billion to $1.48 billion, down from $1.39 billion-$1.41 billion, and below projections of $1.41 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Kate Spade's earnings miss and weak outlook is stoking fears that weakness in the consumer sector and a slump in tourism could be a negative economic indicator. To see how Kate Spade ranks vs. other retailers see the IBD Stock Checkup.Kate Spade shares dived more than 18% to 16.47 at the close on the stock market today. On Tuesday it fell more than 6% in sync with a broad consumer retail decline, falling below both its 10-week average and 200-day lines where it was trading on Wednesday.Rival handbag maker Michael Kors fell 2.6% to 49.02, while Coach was up slightly to 41.75.Luxury jewelry chain Tiffany (TIF), whose flagship New York location is highly dependent on tourism, was unchanged at 61.42 after falling as low as 58.76. Tiffany fell 3.6% on Tuesday.Meanwhile, JCPenney (JCP)  fell 1.6% to 9.13. Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M) each were up more than 2% after opening sharply lower with Kohl's at 38.72 and Macy's at 33.43. JCPenney, Kohl's and Macy's all tumbled Tuesday amid a widespread sell-off in consumer-related stocks.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported declining July U.S. sales Tuesday, following Ford's weak earnings and industry guidance last week. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported weak July revenue, bringing down airline stocks that day. And Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) tumbled Tuesday on weak sales and sales guidance, following weaker-than-expected U.S. sales at McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX).
"
131,KSS,"The consumer stock sell-off intensified and broadened Tuesday, as bad news from General Motors (GM) added to concerns from McDonald's (MCD), Ford Motor (F) and others.The consumer slide fueled a general market retreat. But it's also a warning for the broader U.S. economy.Recent economic data on consumers have been positive. Consumer spending rose at a robust 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, with a Tuesday report showing a 0.4% monthly gain in June. But consumers were a rare bright spot, with business investment falling for a third straight quarter and homebuilding spending also falling. If consumer spending falters, the economy may struggle to match its anemic second-quarter growth of 1.2%.General Motors and Ford reported July U.S. sales that fell vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCAU) eked out a gain, but less than expected. Ford had reported weak earnings last week amid rising incentives spending and stalling U.S. demand. It sees U.S. industry sales falling in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains.General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell 4.4%, 4.3% and 4%, respectively, on the stock market today.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which has been a top-rated restaurant stock, fell 12.4% Tuesday. The steakhouse chain missed on second-quarter revenue and said same-store sales growth was slowing in the early weeks of the current third quarter. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) dived 5.6%, taking a round trip on its breakout.Those follow weaker demand at McDonald's, which had been a great turnaround story in recent months. But last week McDonald's said U.S. comps in the second quarter fell short of Wall Street forecasts, and cited ""softening industry growth."" Starbucks (SBUX) also reported weak U.S. comps.More generally, analysts have been issuing warnings about the retail sector.McDonald's fell 0.3% Tuesday and Starbucks 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Texas Roadhouse and Dave & Buster's have been among the best-rated restaurant stocks in recent weeks. For a complete look at these stocks and other consumer giants, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) cut its 2016 outlook Tuesday, citing higher fuel costs and the weak British pound following the Brexit vote. Royal Caribbean stock sank 6.3% Tuesday. Carnival (CCL) lost 3.1%.Airlines sold off Tuesday as Delta Air Lines (DAL) said unit revenue fell sharply in July. Also hitting the sector: A Zika virus warning for a Miami neighborhood and  German carrier Lufthansa saying that terror attacks and global unease have had a ""tangible"" impact on demand. Delta Air stock fell more than 7% intraday, while American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell 6%.Department stores were among the biggest losers, with Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) down 8% and Nordstrom (JWN) tumbling 7%.Kroger got a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform, citing the deflationary environment for groceries. Shares are off 4.1%, on track for their lowest close since early January 2015. That follows weak same-store sales from natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM).One relative bright spot for consumer stocks has been consumer products producers such as Procter & Gamble (PG). P&G edged past profit views Tuesday, rising 0.4% to 86.78 for a 52-week high. But Procter & Gamble and other consumer- and food-product giants have been relying on cost cuts to offset declining revenue.

134,KSS,"Exchange traded funds tracking major stock indexes wobbled at the open on Friday as investors digested weak jobs numbers and lower oil prices.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) nudged 0.1% lower on the stock market today in early trading. This ETF, a proxy for the broad U.S. market, is eyeing a weekly gain of more than 1% in the first trading week of the new year.Retail and consumer discretionary ETFs continued to slide Friday, a day after Sears (SHLD) became the latest retailer to announce that it was restructuring after a weak Christmas season.SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) slipped 0.3% in morning trade and is poised for its fourth down week in a row after a 2.6% drop in Thursday's session.

135,KSS,"Gap (GPS) shares rebounded late Thursday after the apparel retail giant reported solid holiday sales. Among other after-hours movers, burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK) will see its CFO leave, Helen of Troy (HELE) topped earnings views, while G-III Apparel (GIII) and Ruby Tuesday (RT) had poor results. Meanwhile, Amgen (AMGN)jumped late after winning a ban on a rival drugmaker's cholesterol fighter.Gap reported November-December same-store sales rose 2%, with December comps up 4%. That 4% gain defied views for a 1.7% drop and was the biggest gain in two years. It also contrasts with  Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS), which both reported that November-December comps sank 2.1% late Wednesday. Gap raised its full-year EPS targets slightly.Gap shares rose 7.3% in late trade after falling 3.9% to 23.25 during regular stock market trading as retailers tumbled on the department store warnings.Amgen won a U.S. ban on Regeneron (REGN)-Sanofi (SNY) cholesterol fighter Praluent, which competes with its drug Repatha.Amgen shares rose 5.1% in late trading. France's Sanofi tumbled 4%. Regeneron was halted.Amgen had won a patent ruling Tuesday regarding its Repatha vs. Praluent. Sanofi and Regeneron presumably will seek an emergency stay to temporarily block the ban.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi LDL-Buster At Risk After Judge Upholds Amgen PatentsShake Shack announced that CFO Jeff Uttz will retire, stepping down around March. The upscale burger chain also named Zach Koff to a new chief operating officer position.Shares fell 1.7% in late trading.Shares had closed up 1.4% Thursday to 39.45, just below a 39.61 buy point, after soaring 7.7% on Wednesday. Shake Shack was added to the small-cap S&P 600 after Wednesday's close.Helen of Troy, maker of various of household, health and beauty products, announced Q3 EPS of $3.27 on revenue of $444.41 million.

Ruby Tuesday shares tumbled 17.6% in late trade.G-III Apparel said Q4 retail sales and operating profit will be weaker than expected, citing unseasonably warm weather early in the quarter.

136,KSS,"The holiday retail numbers are rolling in, and they do not look good. Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) shares were set aflame late Wednesday (and continue to burn Thursday) on same-store sales declines and slashed earnings targets.The dismal department store results have also singed Michael Kors (KORS), Coach (COH), Kate Spade (KATE) and Fossil (FOSL). The accessories brands are feeling the heat following Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren's comment that handbags and watches performed poorly over the major selling period.""Accessories was the single consistent 'negative' at both"" retailers, wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy. ""This leads us to believe the (North American) handbag category is tracking for another flat to down quarter, which likely impacts KORS.""Some specialty retailers are logging worse-than-expected holiday sales results. Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works parent L Brands (LB) said comparable sales declined 1% for the five weeks ended Dec. 31, and now projects fourth-quarter per-share profit toward the lower end of guidance for $1.85-$2, below consensus views for $1.98.The decline surprised Street analysts who had been expecting a comp increase of 1.5%.Shares of Macy's collapsed 14% on the stock market today, and Kohl's plunged 19%. L Brands sank 7.9%, Fossil tumbled 7.6% and Michael Kors fell 3.2%. Coach dropped 2.6% but Kate Spade, which could put itself up for sale, rallied to close up 0.7%. lost 2%.IBD'S TAKE: This year will be one of ""reckoning"" and ""awakening,"" said NPD Group's Marshal Cohen, as retailers grapple with modern consumption habits.But it's not all coal in Christmas stockings, at least in the e-commerce realm. Adobe (ADBE) said the November and December holiday season brought in an 11% year-over-year online sales rise to $91.7 billion, a little more than a tenth percent above predictions for $91.6 billion.And among individual retailers, Costco (COST) logged a 3% comp gain for December, which Retail Metrics said is the warehouse retailer's greatest monthly comp gain in two years.Shares of Costco were up 2% Thursday.Children's Place (PLCE) ""was one the few bright spots in retail so far reporting a solid 6.9% holiday same-store sales gain for the November-December period,"" said the research firm's president Ken Perkins in a report.Comparable retail sales rose 6.9% in the first nine weeks of Q4, prompting the company to raise Q4 and full-year earnings guidance.Children's Place shares fell intraday to 100.35 but closed up 0.1% at 104.20.
"
137,KSS,"Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) is ""still very much in control of its own destiny,"" says Goldman Sachs, which upgraded the nation's largest brick-and-mortar retailer to a buy from neutral on Thursday, adding the stock to its ""conviction"" list.X For the last decade or so, retailers have been wrapping their heads around the increasingly digital-first consumer landscape with varying degrees of success, particularly as the act of shopping has evolved from mall strolls and mail-order catalogs to a high-tech logistics battle to be the first to shoppers' doorsteps.But Goldman analysts have faith in Wal-Mart's longtime retail strategy, i.e. ""selling consumables to middle-income consumers in small markets,"" even as other retailers face such uncertainty. They boosted their price target on the stock to 117 from 115.Tax reform and stronger income growth will benefit the mass market, they said, prompting them to edge up their same-store sales and earnings estimates for the company. They also expect the big-box retailer to raise its dividend amid the redeployment of cash from tax savings. A chunk of those savings should go toward Wal-Mart's decision last week to raise its minimum wage to $11 an hour and dole out bonuses.But Goldman Sachs analysts noted that Amazon (AMZN), among other things, remains a potential risk, saying ""the potential for incremental competition from AMZN, hard discounters, and traditional grocers remains significant.""Shares of Wal-Mart rose 1.6% to 104.30 on the stock market today, remaining in buy range. Solid holiday figures have been lifting some retail stocks, such as Kohl's (KSS), although it's uncertain whether strong sales in November and December will carry over through the new year. Target (TGT) climbed 1.4%, while Amazon dipped 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: What does retail look like in 2018? Well, for one thing, the whole ""death of the mall"" narrative might be a bit exaggerated. Read our comprehensive outlook for the year. Wal-Mart's wage-hike announcement, however, was overshadowed by the sudden closure of 63 Sam's Clubs, which it owns, a move that caused a stir, since employees were reportedly not given any notice prior to the closings.In addition to the thousands of layoffs that would produce, the company also plans to cut more than 1,000 corporate-level jobs.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Wal-Mart Trademarks 'Wam!

Meanwhile, President Trump did not announce sweeping new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports Thursday morning, despite reports that he would do so.

144,KSS,"Amazon's (AMZN) second annual one-day Prime Day was a rocky event for many consumers.During the 24-hour sales-apalooza, many customers posted complaints on social media sites about glitches with the online retail Christmas-in-July.Amazon's checkout process in particular drew consumer ire. Several shoppers said they got failure messages when they tried to add items to their shopping carts. Amazon's ""Lightning Deals"" seemed to be at the heart of the problem.Around 9:30 Eastern time on Tuesday morning, Amazon posted a Twitter apology. ""Some customers are reporting difficulty with checkout. We're working to resolve this issue quickly,"" Amazon tweeted. Around 12:30 Eastern time, Amazon told IBD that the issue had been resolved.On Wednesday, Amazon crowed that the Tuesday event a success. The retail platform operator said that customer orders were more than 50% higher in the U.S. and more than 60% higher worldwide than last year's event.Also, in the U.S. and abroad, small businesses and sellers on Amazon had racked up more than a 30% increase over last year in the number items sold.Overall, consumers had been drawn in by deals such as a Fire tablet variety 3-pack for $89.97, which regularly retails for $169.97, Amazon boasted.A key purpose of the sale was to entice consumers to subscribe to Amazon's $99 per year Prime service. The sale had been forecast to generate up to $1 billion in sales, more than double the haul during last year's first-ever Prime Day, Citi analyst Mark May projected on Monday. ""Prime Day's impressive results in 2015 came as a surprise, notching Amazon $400mn in incremental sales . . . in 3Q15,"" he wrote in a report.But consumer complaints were widespread on social media on Tuesday. At one point on Tuesday, Amazon stock was down 1.8%. It closed down 0.74%.Shares had gained more than 1% in each of the prior two trading sessions.Prime Day was a bonanza binge of 100,000 deals that are available only to members of Amazon's Prime subscription program, which costs $99 a year. After days of appetite-whetting deals and other hype from the e-commerce colossus, shoppers hit the site in droves to nab deals.Prime Day began at midnight Pacific time as Monday turned to Tuesday.But the volume appears to have been more than even Amazon was able to handle smoothly -- at least at the outset. And complaints were not confined to Lightning Deals.Graze, whose handle is @GraceCore, complained on Twitter, ""Has anyone been able to find a shelf or rack for cassette tapes on Amazon or Prime? I am realizing I need one but can't find any.""Luke Blackburn asked fellow shoppers, ""Has anyone managed to download an Amazon or Prime Video yet?""Tony Pocknell fumed that he had been charged 79 British pounds ""for @amazonprimenow when I do not use Amazon or Prime... How do I get the money refunded when Amazon have no record of the charge!""Not all prior Prime Day deals lived up to Amazon's own hype. Industry publication Market Track reported that Amazon's 2015 Black Friday prices were 9% lower on average than they were on 2015 Prime Day. ""The best Prime Day deals did in fact rival the best Black Friday deals, however Amazon didn't include some of their most in-demand products in their Prime Day offerings last year,"" the site reported.This year lots of competitors put up more fight, offering their own special sales.Last year, Amazon lured in legions of new customers and sold lots of stuff. Prime memberships soared 51% in 2015, although Amazon does not credit any one cause.This year, too, deals were available only to existing Prime members, who pay for the service -- which provides such things as free fast delivery of certain categories of items and free videos, music streaming and photo storage -- and for people who signed up for a free 30-day trial.Amazon shares rose on Monday, closing at a fresh all-time high.Last year's inaugural discount delirium day was a success, breaking Black Friday records, Amazon says, with 398 items sold every second, from beginning to end of the consumer fest.But Prime Day was also a lightning rod for criticism and mockery on social media. In the Twitterverse in the days before the giant sale, for example:Carmine Scarpaglia called Prime Day ""a bigger bust ... than Dolly Parton!""Kevin Ross tweeted that Prime Day was a ""garage sale of #junk"" and ""garbage.""Derrick Trumaine warned Amazon that ""you not gonna fool me this year!!!""And SeanaLyn sarcastically sneered at Prime Day as a collection of ""stellar deals"" like ""a 20 pack of slinkies, 12 used condoms, & a week old sandwich.""But despite such negative reviews, Prime Day is generating enough new business for Amazon that rivals are getting in on the act.Wal-Mart (WMT), J.C. Penney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS) and e-commerce vendor Newegg were launching competitive sales -- or had already done so before Tuesday, getting a jump on Prime Day.Wal-Mart was discounting items, including many consumer electronics, and offering free shipping this week, without requiring customers to make a minimum purchase. It is offering a free 30-day trial of its ShippingPass program.Retail Dive reported, ""Wal-Mart in particular appears to be pointedly undercutting Amazon's prices on items like electronics that, as on Black Friday, are of particular interest to bargain hunters. Moreover, its 'Dare to Compare' sale does not require a 'Shipping Pass' membership, Wal-Mart's answer to Amazon's Prime; Amazon requires Prime membership to access Prime Day deals.""Also, third parties like DealNews are jumping on Amazon's coattails by offering online advice for how to find Prime Day deals that meet your needs. Example: use Alexa, an Amazon voice service, to get extra deals. If you don't have an Alexa-supported device, use a friend's.DealNews is also offering a list of non-Amazon retailers' discounts and coupons.

147,KSS,"Economists have been puzzled all year over how retail employment has surged despite the fact that Wal-Mart (WMT), Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and other major players were closing stores and laying off thousands of workers.The retail hiring boom has been happening even as customers have accelerated their shift to nonstore retailers like Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, Home Depot (HD), the leader in a category that has done relatively well in fending off online competition, stopped opening new stores in the U.S. more than a year ago.Nevertheless, retailers have added 323,300 workers over the past year -- a spurt of growth that's nearly the best since 2000.Getting to the bottom of this mystery is important because the explanation suggests that the job market hasn't been quite as strong as it appears, yet there may be less slack in the labor market due to Obama administration policies than dovish Federal Reserve policymakers suspect.Early in June, Jefferies fixed-income economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons noted the ""incongruous"" retail job gains of more than 50,000 per month during the first quarter, and they predicted some payback with a weak reading in May's employment report. Yet even though the overall report was lousy, with a net 25,000 private-sector jobs added, retailers accounted for nearly half of those gains.Given the sector fundamentals, it makes little sense that retailers would need to bolster their ranks in a big way. But upon closer examination, they really haven't: While they may have more workers, they aren't doing more work. Since August, the retail sector has added more than a quarter-million jobs, but aggregate hours worked haven't budged. While seasonally adjusted retail employment has climbed 1.6%, those nearly 16 million workers are clocking 1.6% fewer hours, as the workweek has slumped from 31.5 hours to 31.0.Supermarkets are a notable example: Over the two past years, employment is up by 70,000, or 2.9%, but the sector's 2.5 million workers are working, in aggregate, 1.5% fewer hours per week.Here's the puzzle: Shorter workweeks and more part-time workers are supposed to be evidence of slack in the labor market, giving employers some flexibility to raise hours and easing the pressure to hike wages. Yet take a look at the supermarket sector, where wage gains have accelerated to more than 6% from a year ago, even as the average workweek has shrunk -- to a record-short 27.8 hours for nonsupervisors in April from 29.5 hours two years ago.The logical takeaway is that there may be less labor market slack than there appears to be, and Obama administration regulations offer a likely explanation because they're designed to make employers pay a stiff price for longer workweeks.ObamaCare's employer mandate requires companies with at least 50 full-time-equivalent workers to offer ""affordable"" coverage to workers who average 30 or more hours per week. Fines for failing to comply range from $2,160 to $3,240 per worker in 2016. Because those fines aren't deductible from taxes, they equate to between $3,547 and $5,123 in pretax wages. In other words, there's a big potential cost cliff for allowing workers to exceed 29.9 hours per week.While the ObamaCare employer mandate hasn't led to the dramatic work-hour cuts that some critics feared, that's likely because employers have figured out how to minimize liability by offering coverage that qualifies as ""affordable"" even if it costs far more than low-wage workers can pay. Yet the mandate has clearly had an effect: The number of U.S. workers clocking just above 30 hours has fallen to a record low relative to those with work hours just below ObamaCare's full-time threshold.The second regulation that will encourage shorter workweeks is the Department of Labor's new overtime rule that will require time-and-a-half pay above 40 hours per week for salaried workers who make up to $47,476 per year, up from $23,660 currently. While the rule change won't take effect until December, it was first proposed in June 2015, so employers have had a chance to begin reacting.Asking full-time workers to clock in excess of 40 hours per week has allowed employers to spread out the costs of benefits over more hours, reducing per-hour compensation costs. But overtime pay eliminates that as a cost-saving option.For retailers seeing their profit margins squeezed by higher wages and online competition, these two regulations add costs for both full-time workers and for part-timers working at least 30 hours per week. In that context, it's not entirely surprising to see a shift to a lower average workweek.Yet it's not just employers who have an incentive to hold down work hours or face a cost cliff. ObamaCare also provides such incentives to modest-wage workers who, along with their spouses, lose eligibility for subsidies via HealthCare.gov and the state insurance exchanges if they work at least 30 hours and their employer offers health coverage.For a full-time worker earning $17,500, paying $1,690 for bronze coverage with a $5,000-plus deductible qualifies as ""affordable."" That's $1,000 more than someone at the same income level would have to pay for an exchange plan that caps total out-of-pocket expenses at about $550 in 2016.

Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches

152,KSS,"An afternoon rally took the bite out of a decline by some key indexes on Thursday, and the Nasdaq showed enough strength to post a third straight gain Thursday.Apple (AAPL) acted bullishly, rising 0.5% to 116.61 and putting more work into the crafting of a handle on its latest cup-with-handle pattern.While a new base-on-base pattern has produced a 118.79 entry, 10 cents above the new base's left-side high, check out the daily chart and you'll see that the iPhone and iPad giant has now etched a downward-slanting handle over the past week, presenting a slightly lower buy point at 118.12.In September, as noted in an IBD Stock Market Today column, Apple cleared a 110.33 buy point within a cup with handle that was lodged within a long, deep, bottoming base pattern, then rallied 7.5% before pulling back and testing vital support at the long-term 200-day moving average.Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) continued to show signs that while it's indeed undergoing a price correction, the decline has so far been controlled.The leading graphics processors firm fell 2.5% to 101.74, extending its decline from a 119.93 high to 15%. That's the maximum allowable price decline for a flat base, which must form over a minimum five weeks.That's totally normal for a stock that achieved one of the biggest gains last year, rising 262% past a 33.16 cup-with-handle buy point in mid-March 2016.The Nasdaq composite erased mild morning gains by around 12:45 p.m. ET and finished the day up 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 did even better, gaining more than 0.5%, as Apple and other large-cap techs rallied.Retailers, however, fell hard after poor guidance and plans of massive store closings from big-box retailers Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M). Both stocks got trampled by sellers, falling 19% and 14%, respectively. The S&P 500 closed less than 2 points lower; the Dow Jones industrials fell 0.2%.Volume was slightly lower on both exchanges vs. Wednesday, according to preliminary data.Returning to Apple, the megacap's RS Rating of 56 has been largely unchanged over the past nine weeks, which is unsurprising given the long basing nature of the stock lately.On the other hand, the B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is bullish, indicating funds are on net accumulating shares.Wall Street sees Apple's sales rising 2% to $77.4 billion in the December-ended fiscal fourth quarter. That could mark an end to three quarters in a row of falling revenue and signal that Apple is gaining market share in the smartphone industry and succeeding in keeping up fast growth in its services-related businesses.A sharp beat on the top line could also lead to a surprise increase in quarterly profit, which may catalyze the stock to further gains. Right now, the Street sees earnings falling 2% to $3.22 a share, but then rising 12% to $2.13 a share in the current quarter that ends in March.Apple's earnings fell 13%, 15% and 9% in the prior three quarters.Constellation Brands (STZ), one of the largest alcoholic beverage companies in the world, slid 7% to 146.75 and slumped back below its 50-day moving average despite posting a 38% bulge in fiscal third-quarter earnings per share. After-tax margin rose to 22.3%, the highest in at least four years.Sales grew 10% to $1.81 billion, the smallest year-over-year gain in four quarters. In the prior three quarters, Constellation's sales grew 14%, 15% and 17%.Constellation shares have been in correction mode since it failed to make much headway following a breakout past a long flat base-like pattern in the week ended Oct. 7.

153,KSS,"The broadest and most timely indicator of the state of the job market -- federal income and employment tax withholdings -- shows that the new conventional wisdom has got it roughly backwards.The job market didn't suddenly start sputtering over the past few months, as suggested by the surprisingly weak May employment report. Actually, the labor market has been getting stronger over the past several months after steadily losing steam last fall and then sinking with the stock market early this year.The latest data through Friday June 3 show that, over the previous four weeks, withheld taxes rose 4.7% from a year earlier, the fastest growth rate in seven months, an IBD analysis finds.The good news is that the tax data are consistent with the economy picking up after two weak quarters. Still, the news isn't necessarily all that great, because income gains are recovering from really low levels over the winter and are still pretty tame, especially when one factors in a rise in headline inflation since last fall. Further, the data suggest that the Federal Reserve may not keep hitting the pause button on rate hikes for very long.After bottoming out at about 2% year-over-year growth in February, income and employment taxes have staged a recovery, fueled in part by announced pay hikes at Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST). A number of companies reporting earnings over the past six weeks also have highlighted wage pressures.“We’re facing an unprecedented environment for retaining and hiring talent,” Panera (PNRA) President Drew Madsen said on the restaurant chain’s first-quarter earnings call.The company noted a 5% rise in retail hourly wage inflation during the quarter, as well as an increase in bonuses for bakery cafe managers.Wendy's (WEN) said it’s seeing wage inflation of 5% to 6%, driven both by minimum-wage hikes and the need to offer a competitive wage “to access good labor.”Kohl's (KSS) CEO Kevin Mansell said the retailer also is “experiencing significant wage pressure.”Earlier in the year, the tax data, which don’t rely on limited sample sizes and seasonal adjustments, had been signaling much weaker wage gains than the monthly employment reports, which do require such guesswork. The puzzle over why job growth had looked so strong, even as the economy barely grew over the past two quarters, may be explained to some extent by faulty data or seasonal factors.The 4.7% rate of growth in withheld income and employment taxes is roughly consistent with annual payroll gains of 2% and wage gains of 2.5%. But the data reflect aggregate pay, so changes in the average workweek or incentive pay also can affect the growth rate.Over time, higher income growth should flow through to better economic growth. But there are reasons to doubt that the upturn in nominal tax withholdings, a proxy for income gains, is a precursor to GDP growth breaking out of its modest range.Companies have been facing a challenging earnings environment and may respond to wage pressures and increases in other input costs by hiring less and trying to boost productivity. That's what Wal-Mart did earlier this year, closing 154 U.S. stores while boosting its own minimum wage to $10 an hour. Kohl's closed 18 stores, including 9 of its 125 stores in California. Meanwhile, Wendy's is making self-order kiosks available to its roughly 6,000 franchise restaurants.Employers are increasingly complaining about their difficulty in finding qualified workers. That's leading Fed policymakers to think that the economy is close to full employment and that they should get on with the process of raising interest rates.

Analysts were modeling 50 cents and $8.31 billion.Best Buy also announced that CFO Sharon McCollam is stepping down on June 14 but will remain with the company in an advisory capacity through the fiscal year ending Jan. 28. Corie Barry, a 16-year veteran of Best Buy and its current chief strategic growth officer, will become the company’s chief financial officer at the conclusion of Best Buy’s annual shareholder meeting, set for June 14.Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said strong growth in wearable fitness devices, home theater and appliances was offset by continued weakness in mobile phones and tablets in the first quarter.McCollam said she expects slight declines in revenue in the first half of the fiscal year, followed by growth in the back half.""We recognize this will be challenging without a strong mobile cycle and improvements in (consumer electronics) categories overall,” she said in a statement.Best Buy is the latest U.S. retailer to deliver disappointing Q1 reports.

157,KSS,"For those who haven't seen it by now, the ""Happy Chewbacca"" video posted from Facebook (FB) Live has made a lot of people happy: With over 140 million views, it is now the most-viewed video ever on Facebook’s new live streaming platform.But this bit of social media stardom is probably also making a lot of companies happy, including Facebook, Disney (DIS), Kohl's (KSS) and Hasbro (HAS). In fact, shares of Hasbro might actually be getting a bit of a stock boost Tuesday as a result of this viral video.For the unfamiliar, #HappyChewbacca first went online late last week, with Texas mom Candace Payne unboxing and donning a Chewbacca mask that emits the Wookiee's trademark growl every time she opens her mouth. That sets off a cycle of hysterical laughter and Wookiee growls.""I'm such a happy chewbacca.."" This lady is still making me smile. Lovely video to come out on my birthday 🙂 pic.twitter.com/khUizi6nFf— Peter Mayhew (@TheWookieeRoars) May 21, 2016The mask is now sold out almost everywhere online, including Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), and of course Kohl's, where Payne first bought it. And that, in turn, led investment bank Piper Jaffray to say today that the video might fuel demand for over 1 million units of the $30 mask, which translates to roughly $18 million-$19 million in potential gross sales, or a 2-3 cent near-term earnings-per-share contribution for Hasbro.Shares of Hasbro rose as much as 3% earlier in the day, bringing it closer to its 88.63 buy point, before closing up 2.1%.Who else stands to laugh from Happy Chewbacca?There’s Facebook, whose live-streaming platform has gotten a nice publicity boost from the video. The previous record holder for most-watched video is a BuzzFeed video of an exploding watermelon that hasn't gotten even a tenth of the views. Then there are all the retailers that are selling out of at least this one item on the heels of some very lackluster earnings results over the last couple of weeks.And then there's Disney, obviously, which owns Lucasfilm and ""Star Wars."" Piper Jaffray said the video highlights the new face of ""Star Wars"" superfans and the power of viral videos, which ""are rarely anticipated but can catalyze significant demand for an item"" -- just like the mask seen in Happy Chewbacca.

Indexes rallied into the close, sending the S&P 500 and Dow back above the 50-day moving average.That was a favorable signal, as was the break from the past four days, when indexes had a habit of erasing early gains and closing low in the day's price range.Preliminary data showed volume was lower, maybe the only blemish on the session. Winners led losers by 9-2 on the NYSE and by 7-5 on the Nasdaq.The market seemed to shake off worries about rising interest rates as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 5 basis points to 2.87%. The benchmark rate has been near four-year highs. Rate-sensitive stocks that compete against bonds for yield rose. The Dow utilities average climbed 2.6% and the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) climbed 1.6%.Department stores — an industry that has rebounded to the top 30 of IBD's 197 industry group rankings — was one of Friday's best, rising nearly 3%. The group sparked higher after Reuters reported that the Nordstrom (JWN) family group is finalizing plans to submit an offer to take the company private. Kohl's (KSS) leaped nearly 3% and J.C. Penney (JCP) advanced 3%.Other retail, oil and some technology groups also led. The price of crude rose more than 1% to $63.55 a barrel. But solar, steel machinery, homebuilding and other building-related groups lagged.Fiber optic stocks also lagged after Acacia Communications (ACIA) late Thursday gave soft guidance for the first quarter. Acacia shares, already depressed, fell 11% more.The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) rose 1%. The fund lagged the main indexes partly because of Wingstop (WING), which slid to its 50-day moving average after the chicken wings restaurants gave weak guidance. But the stock found support at the 50-day line and closed 5% lower, trimming about half its loss at the session's low.Universal Display (OLED) plunged below its 200-day moving average after the company reported better-than-expected results, but guided 2018 sales below views. Universal Display signaled a slowdown ahead in the transition to organic light-emitting diode displays.Planet Fitness (PLNT) broke out of a base after the chain of gyms beat profit and sales expectations.

BlackRock fared the best, rising 3%. JPMorgan also did well with a gain of around 1.5%. Wells Fargo and PNC lagged.In the stock market today, Facebook (FB) had a rough day, falling 4.5%, as Wall Street worried about the fundamental impact as a result of a change to the company's News Feed. Facebook ended the week just below the 50-day moving average and below its 184.35 buy point.Inside the IBD 50, Paycom Software (PAYC) gapped up bullishly out of a flat base with an 86.20 buy point.

Further, the increasing costs to handle online traffic and online shopping is continuing to cannibalize the company's brick-and-mortar sales.""Management cited full-line brick and mortar traffic levels as the worst since 1972 with the accelerating model shift from brick and mortar to online yet to reach equilibrium citing 'no easy answer' to re-stimulating foot traffic,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote in their note.Nordstrom shares plunged 8.7% to 50.48 on the stock market today, after closing just below its 50-day line on Thursday.On CNBC's ""Mad Dash,"" host Jim Cramer said the JPMorgan note was a ""very damning piece about the mall.""

165,KSS,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

The BofA report alone wasn't enough to restrain the Nasdaq early progress Friday, with the index hauling in a new high, but peaking in the first 45 minutes of trade.IBD 50 stock and recent highflier Nvidia (NVDA) appears to have helped trigger the slide, after a report from short-selling specialist Citron warned of weakness in the chipmaker's core gaming businesses.

173,KSS,"To the ever-expanding list of Things Uber Is Disrupting, add malls and their parking lots.At Macy's (M) investor day on Tuesday, Doug Sesler, executive vice president for real estate, suggested that the increased use of Uber had led to a decrease in the need for the vast stretches of land reserved for mall-customer parking.""We're all talking about driverless cars, we're talking about the increased use of Uber,"" he said. ""The fact of the matter is we don't need the massive parking lots that we needed in the 1970s.""Macy's has been bruised by retail's woes in the era of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a reinvigorated Wal-Mart (WMT). It's thrown a variety of ideas at the wall to make use of its stripped-out floor space and 130-plus million square feet of real estate, and half-filled parking lots could offer a new option.Sesler said that when Macy's owns store space, they also typically own parking space with it. He said those swaths of pavement can be used for other retail space – a Starbucks (SBUX) at the corner of a parking lot, he suggested – or residential, office or hotel space.The company has formed an alliance with Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), a real estate company, to look at different ways to use its stretches of real estate.Macy's has also considered bolting restaurants onto the outside of its big-box locations to generate traffic and add atmosphere and rental income. The company has put office space above its stores in Seattle and is marketing the upper portion of its State Street flagship store in Chicago, where it hopes to make similar conversions to office space.The company is overhauling its large Union Square location in San Francisco to create 10,000 square feet for small shops across the front – space the company has just started to market for rent, Sesler said. In New York, the company said it is looking at ways to jumpstart shopper traffic in its Herald Square flagship – possibly with an indoor-and-outdoor rooftop area featuring restaurants and after-work hangouts.IBD'S TAKE: As Amazon and off-price retailers wear down department stores, retailers like Ulta Beauty have gotten by relatively unscathed. Here are five takeaways from Ulta's most recent quarterly earnings. What's more, Sesler said, Macy's department stores are in 72% of the nation's high-end 'A' malls — those most likely to weather the ongoing storm of store bankruptcies and closures.Still, nothing at the 2-1/2 hour presentation could distract Wall Street from the company's gross-margin forecast.Shares finished 8% lower on Tuesday after CFO Karen Hoguet during the presentation warned that gross margins for the year were on track to be 60 to 80 basis points lower than last year. Among the factors she cited were excess inventory following the holidays and heavy promotions in the beauty business. She said she expected inventory levels to even out by the fall season.Macy's fell 0.4% to 21.81 on the stock market Wednesday, sinking intraday to their lowest level since September 2010.Macy's initially rebounded Thursday morning after Nordstrom (JWN) announced that it is mulling a ""going private"" move, but Macy's closed down 0.2%. Nordstrom shares skyrocketed 10.3%, though that was well off their intraday highs.J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS), which tumbled Tuesday on Macy's warning, reversed lower Thursday to end down 4.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Sears (SHLD) closed off 1.7%.Still, management on Tuesday said that beauty and home products were doing well within its off-price ""Backstage"" concept. Within apparel, where Amazon has become a big threat, Macy's is trying to rid its inventory of duplicate items and bring more exclusive items and faster fashion to store racks.CEO Jeff Gennette also emphasized the changes in the way people shop – the way physical stores and websites can play off one another when a consumer weighs what they want to buy – and Macy's opportunities in that evolution.""There's a place for both Amazon and Macy's to succeed with our customer,"" he said.Management said that it was ""open to all options"" in developing its e-commerce, and said that Wal-Mart's approach to its online business – including buying outlets like Jet.com – was ""quite interesting.""Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, in a research note Wednesday, said Macy's had done a ""good job articulating its challenges"" and that if its turnaround succeeded, ""America's love for shopping will be reengaged."" But he said an epic battle with Amazon would continue.""We think customers are 'familiar' with Macy's but don't really 'love' it,"" he wrote.Wal-Mart edged higher Thursday after rising slightly Wednesday following a retreat Tuesday. Amazon on Tuesday offered discounted Prime subscriptions to people on government aid, going after key Wal-Mart customers.RELATED:This Is Keeping TJX Bullish Amid The Broader Retail MeltdownSears Stock Tanks As CEO Accuses Suppliers Of Exploiting It

174,KSS,"X Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 rose slightly early Wednesday morning.During the regular session, the major averages faded for modest losses late as Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reversed lower or pared gains. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index slid 0.3% while the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.2%.The FANG stocks' market impact is striking, given the modest moves. Facebook fell 0.5%, Alphabet 0.7% and Amazon 0.8%, with Netflix clinging to a 0.1% gain. But because their valuations are so high, those tiny percentage declines translated to a loss of $11 billion market cap, with bigger declines from their intraday highs.Until the final slide in the FANG stocks the major averages were hovering around break-even. That's despite another wipeout for retailers. Macy's (M) warned on gross margins, sending the stock down 8.2% to a fresh five-year high. Kohl's (KSS) tumbled 5.8%, Nordstrom (JWN) 3.6%, J.C. Penney (JCP) 4.1% and Dillard's (DDS) 3.4%. But department stores' market valuations have tumbled over many years, so those big losses shaved little more than $2 billion from their collective market cap.Simply put, despite the still-large presence of department stores for consumers, investors have largely written them off. The merest breeze from FANG stocks is more important to the broader averages than a retail hurricane.(Investors haven't written off discount giant Wal-Mart (WMT), which has been a market leader in 2017. Wal-Mart sank 1.7% on Tuesday, trimming its market cap by $4 billion.)Futures for the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 index rose more than 0.1% vs. fair value Wednesday morning. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%. U.S. crude oil futures edged lower, just under $48 a barrel, ahead of U.S. inventory and production data this morning from the Energy Information Administration.Tesla (TSLA) edged down 0.5% in Wednesday's morning after rising fractionally late Tuesday as the company held its shareholder meeting. Tesla rose 1.6% to 352.85 in Tuesday's session, hitting a fresh intraday high of 359.49.Tesla investors voted to keep three-year terms for board members, rejecting a bid by some pension funds for annual votes amid concerns that the board is too beholden and too closely tied to CEO Elon Musk.Musk once again spoke optimistically about the upcoming Model 3, the new solar-roof tiles and the future of a Model Y crossover SUV and a September unveiling of an electric semi-truck.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei closed just above break-even, while China's Shanghai composite advanced 1.2%.In European trading intraday, stocks rose modestly. The U.K.'s FTSE climbed 0.3%, France's CAC-40 0.8% and Germany's Dax 0.3% ahead of British elections and a European Central Bank meeting.RELATED:5 Surging Chinese Stocks And What You Could Do: Investing Action PlanMacy's Triggers New Retail Rout On Gross Margins WarningAmazon's New Wal-Mart Assault: Prime Cut For Government-Aid Recipients

175,KSS,"Stocks headed south into the close, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq giving up a slim afternoon gain.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%, as Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) turned lower while Netflix (NFLX) pared gains.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average eased about 0.2%. All three major indexes remain near record highs.Volume was tracking higher compared with the same time Monday. Despite that, the Nasdaq had an edge over other main indexes.Energy, medical and semiconductor stocks were higher. Oil rose rose 0.5% to $47.64 a barrel in a day that saw uncertain trading for crude.Retail was the biggest drag on the market, with department stores, discount chains, apparel shops and 10 other retail industry groups languishing in the bottom 25 groups on the stock market today.The broad sell-off in retail started after Macy's (M) warned of weaker gross margins. The department store is trading at the lowest level since February 2011. Kohl's (KSS), Michaels Stores (MIK) and Foot Locker (FL) are near 52-week lows after falling in heavy volume.Fiber-optics stocks were one of the top industries, with Lumentum Holdings (LITE) leaping 9% to a record high. The stock is now extended from the 56.02 buy point of a cup-without-handle base. Shares are making progress despite a recent breakout from a late-stage base. There's speculation that Lumentum could provide 3D sensors to Apple (AAPL) for the next iPhone model.NetEase (NTES) broke out past the 301.92 buy point of a cup-with-handle base intraday, but dipped just below that entry as the market rally reversed. Volume was one-third larger than average, which was less than ideal for a breakout. More of a concern is the pattern itself, which is risky late-stage base. NetEase, a leading provider of online games in China, has not reset its base count in more than two years.RELATED:Macy's Triggers New Retail Rout On Gross Margins Warning5 Surging Chinese Stocks And What You Could Do: Investing Action PlanGold Gaps Higher; Is This The Right Time To Buy?What Apple Investors Liked Most From WWDC Will Surprise You

177,KSS,"Never accuse the country's biggest retailer of resting on its laurels. After disrupting and transforming one retail segment after another, Amazon (AMZN) has the checkout line in its sights. And investors are returning to ETFs that have big stakes in the stock.Amazon Go, unveiled Monday, promises a new kind of brick-and-mortar store. Its marquee feature is checkout-free ""grab and go"" shopping. So no more dealing with long lines at cash registers or scrambling for a debit card, although details of Amazon's plans are scarce.Convenience is highly valued by consumers, and the Amazon Go news should help exchange traded funds tied to consumers' disposable income, said David Haviland, a managing partner at Beaumont Capital Management.""This appears like a positive announcement in a very exciting technology,"" he added. ""If it works as described, it seems like it could be applied to all retail.""A positive development tied to Amazon matters in the ETF investing world, where roughly 100 funds hold the stock. It matters especially to investors who make tactical and strategic bets on equity sectors to tap growth, diversify portfolios and manage risk.Amazon's stock was down 9.70, or 1.26%, at 758.95 Monday. Amazon accounts for 13% of the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500, more than any other company.That makes Amazon the top stock in the $11.11 billion Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY). Amazon also is the No. 1 holding with a 10% to 16% portfolio weighting in cap-weighted ETFs such as Vanguard Consumer Discretionary (VCR), iShares U.S. Consumer Services (IYC), Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary (FDIS) and VanEck Vectors Retail (RTH).Of them, the Fidelity ETF has the lowest expense ratio at 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services represent the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. Strong earnings growth (the C and A in CAN SLIM, for Current earnings and Annual earnings) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but new products or services often generate stellar profitability.Haviland, whose Massachusetts-based firm has $2.7 billion in assets under management, is cautiously optimistic about the consumer discretionary sector for two reasons.""We think the sector will do relatively well as the Trump administration is focusing on tax cuts and government spending, and this will put more money into the economy,"" he told IBD via email. ""Also, the proposed infrastructure spending may be inflationary, which may help Americans by reducing their debt burdens in real terms.""Consumer discretionary funds have had a hard slog of late, but are starting to perk up.Apart from the Trump factor, the seasonal factor is in play. Holiday shopping often delivers a boost to retailers in the run-up to the ""Santa Claus rally"" that stocks tend to see in the final week of the year.In the month ended Dec. 8, XLY leapt 6.7%, outpacing the S&P 500, and it pegged a 52-week high of 84.34 on Thursday.Year to date, XLY is up 8.9% vs. 12.2% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Consumer discretionary has outperformed virtually all S&P 500 sectors over the past five years and longer periods of time.Investors have piled back in as the sector regains its footing. XLY saw $1.1 billion in net inflow in the month ended Dec. 7, according to FactSet data. That contrasts with a $1.1 billion in net outflow since the start of this year.XLY and most of its peers had bled money earlier in the year amid a multitude of woes: falling foot traffic in brick-and-mortar stores; disappointing reports across the retail landscape; and an uncertain economic outlook that made consumers reluctant to spend.Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, finds it worrisome that all major industries in retail came out with weaker-than-expected results in the third quarter.""We saw that with the online vendors, the restaurants and even the big-box retailers,"" Mian said. One big exception was Best Buy (BBY).Department stores such as Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and Kohl's (KSS) did relatively better, ""but that was largely as a result of tight inventory controls,"" Mian added.Haviland of Beaumont Capital, despite his increased optimism about the sector, notes a big risk in rising interest rates.""If Americans have to spend incrementally more of their incomes servicing debt burdens, then they'll have less to spend on discretionary items,"" he said.Consumer discretionary ETFs that skew toward small caps and value stocks have beaten their cap-weighted peers on the stock market so far this year.PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary (PSCD) is up 21.5% through Dec. 8, while Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary (RCD), SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) and First Trust Consumer Discretionary Alpha (FXD) are up between 11% and 13%.Small-cap and value stocks are also favored by some strategists in the changing landscape under President-elect Donald Trump.RELATED:Small-Cap Value ETFs Show Again Why They Are Darlings Of The MarketHow To Play Small-Cap ETFs In Strong Equity Markets With Rising Rates

"
183,KSS,"During Macy's (M) first-quarter earnings call on Thursday, the typical analyst refrain of ""great quarter, guys"" was often replaced with some version of ""good luck, guys.""Shares of the ailing department store giant crashed 17% to 24.35 in the stock market today as the stock hit their worst levels since late 2011 after Macy's said same-store sales slid 5.2%, badly missing estimates for around a 3% drop. The key measure fell 4.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Earnings per share of 24 cents missed expectations for 34 cents. Total revenue of $5.34 billion fell 8%, short of estimates for $5.469 billion.Macy's grim report triggered a broad, sharp sell-off in the retail sector as investors questioned if brick-and-mortar stores have much of a future.Management didn't exactly answer how it'll turnaround the retail giant's fortunes. Instead, it's trying a variety of initiatives to see what, if anything, works.Executives left open the possibility that store closures could creep higher than the 100 that Macy's has said it would shutter.""I'm not going to say that we're not going to close more stores beyond those hundred, but we do feel like we got to the right level when we made the decision that we did in 2016 that we're executing now in '17,"" said new CEO Jeff Gennette during the call.Still, Macy's said it remained ""on track to meet our 2017 guidance."" Sensing that analysts would ask how that was at all possible, management tried to address those questions early in the call.CFO Karen Hoguet said that Macy's had expected the first quarter to be its weakest as it rolled out turnaround plans, adding that the benefits of closing stores, and the accompanying going-out-of-business sales, weren't going to kick in until later in March.She also said that weaker trends seen in the first quarter would rebound later in the year, citing expanded pilot programs, a revamped marketing strategy, heightened consumer engagement — something Gennette characterized as a ""nexus of technology and the human touch"" — and growth in digital and mobile shopping.Macy's has rolled out new offerings including self-service shoe sections, a jewelry pilot program and new furniture and mattress offerings — initiatives that the company wants to introduce nationwide this year and says will clean up what has been a messy few years for an industry struggling to find itself in an ever-digitizing shopping landscape.""These are unusual and challenging times for retailers,"" Gennette said. He later added that ""we've known for some time that the United States is over-retailed,"" so the contraction in square footage was not surprising.The company has tried a variety of ways to make use of vacant store space, converting floors to office space or installing its off-price ""Backstage"" stores, which have been set up in unused areas of traditional Macy's stores.But analysts at Gordon Haskett, in a research note this week, worried that Backstage was ""a defensive move and one that could cannibalize core M sales.""Management said it was careful to avoid cannibalizing full-price items. Gennette also tried to position Backstage as an appeal to millennials — many of whom he said came to Macy's to seek bargains.The company said it would add 19 more Backstage locations this year and that it was ""encouraged"" by those combined stores' performance as well as its new clearance section, called Last Act. Whichever does better will be rolled out ""aggressively"" next year, Hoguet said.The company said it was encouraged by double-digit growth in digital sales, but said it was difficult to break out what constituted a digital sale, given the increasingly connected way people shop, using a combination of electronic devices and stores.Many brick-and-mortar retailers are seeing big percentage gains in online sales, but the absolute e-commerce activity isn't enough to move the needle as in-store sales deteriorate.When asked how the company could compete with Amazon.com (AMZN), which has been bulking up on its artificial intelligence and Big Data capacity and aimed to push fashion, Gennette insisted that aspects of the department store were as relevant today as ever, and said that exclusive products and the pilot programs, along with working harder to be part of local communities, would help the company maintain relevance.And as more retailers try to make being in a store a memorable experience in and of itself, he said he hoped Macy's would have a store platform that addressed consumers' experience needs by the end of next year.As with the other big middle-class retailers, Macy's has suffered at the hands of higher-end and discount retailers, as well as Amazon.Meanwhile, Kohl's (KSS) reported mixed results early Thursday. EPS of 39 cents beat views for 29 cents. But revenue of $3.84 billion slightly missed expectations as same-store sales slid 2.7% vs. forecasts of a 0.6% dip.  Shares for Kohl's tumbled 7.8% to 47.77.Regional department store chain Dillard's (DDS) dived 17.5% on its mixed results Thursday.Nordstrom (JWN) closed down 7.6% to 46.21.

Analysts consensus called for Kohl's to report a profit of $3.64 a share for the year, according to Thomson Reuters.""We are very pleased with our holiday-period sales, which were consistently strong through November and December,"" said Kevin Mansell, Kohl's CEO. He reported positive comps across ""all lines of business and all regions,"" as well as growth in online sales and stronger foot traffic in the holiday period.Shares of Kohl's gained 4.7% to 56.90 on the stock market today, pulling back from a 13-month high of 59.09 soon after the open.

195,KSS,"Sears Holdings (SHLD) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Thursday. The operator of Sears and Kmart stores' results were not as bad as analysts had expected. But the adjusted per-share loss was wider than a year earlier while sales fell rapidly, as the venerable retailer fights to survive in the face of Amazon (AMZN) and fierce competition among brick-and-mortar chains.Estimates: A per-share loss of $3.05, widening from a year-ago loss of $1.86 per share. Revenue was seen diving 25% to $4.054 billion. (Net income, before excluding a slew items, was a $244 million, the first positive reading in two years and above Sears' forecast, swinging from a loss of $471 million a year earlier.)Results: Adjusted per-share loss of $2.15. Revenue sank 20% to $4.30 billion. Same-store sales tumbled 11.9%.Stock: Shares jumped 13.5% to 8.48 on the stock market today, after hitting 9.90 intraday. J.C. Penney (JCP) rallied 0.2% and Kohl's (KSS) 2.5%.Sears' stock-market downward spiral deepened last week after CEO Eddie Lampert began calling out some of the struggling retailer's vendors in public, accusing one supplier of trying to ""embarrass us in the media to force us to let them out of their contract."" In March, the company said ""substantial doubt"" hung over its ability to keep operating.Lampert's dispute with the supplier, One World, which provided tools for Sears' Craftsman brand, followed more depressing results from Macy's (M) earlier this month, leading to a wide retail sell-off. J.C. Penney's dismal results dragged shares to an all-time low. IBD'S TAKE: The dire financials out of the retail sector has led to speculation over whether it has any hope left at all. Analysts aren't ready to call retail dead, but they do believe the industry has too many stores. The narrative for mid-tier retailers like Sears is that they've suffered over the years due to a retreat from shoppers to e-commerce sites like Amazon and discounters like TJX (TJX).But even TJX's results this month missed expectations, although its push into home goods and optimism against a bleak industry backdrop appeared to assuage investors.Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) on Wednesday sank on weak earnings, guidance and April housing data. However, Home Depot (HD) fared better. The stronger housing market during the quarter had meant more business from DIY homeowners and contractors.RELATED:Abercrombie Spikes On Buzz Of American Eagle, Cerberus BidHere's One More Thing Amazon May Be Killing

196,KSS,"TJX (TJX), the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, disappointed investors with a first-quarter revenue and profit guidance miss early Tuesday, but shares started creeping back up during the call as management announced plans to introduce a new home-decor concept, Homesense, to American shoppers and expressed bullishness in the face of broader retail combustion.""Home is a driver for TJX,"" said CEO Ernie Herrman in response to an analyst query, adding that the company's home businesses have been ""a little stronger than apparel."" He also alluded to home goods being less susceptible to the impact of poor weather, which weighed on comparable sales during the quarter.""We think nobody can replicate the fashion and the quality level we have at our home businesses,"" he said on the call. ""We think strategically this is not a short-term vision.""Herrman was fairly mum about the details, but said that there would be an ""extremely visible difference"" between Homesense and its American sister, HomeGoods, that would propel customers to shop at both stores.While Homesense shares the same name as TJX's home-goods stores in Canada and Europe, spokespeople told Investor's Business Daily that the U.S. Homesense would be different.In Canada, the self-described ""home fashions off-price"" store can be found as stand-alone locations or as superstores, in which a HomeSense is teamed up with a Winners or Marshalls store, according to the HomeSense site. There are currently 106 stores across 10 Canadian provinces.The U.S. concept is slated to debut toward the end of the summer, said Herrman.While TJX's Marshalls and T.J. Maxx locations in the U.S. logged flat comparable sales, HomeGoods comps grew 3% during the April-ended quarter, better than FactSet views for 2.4% growth.Aware of the broader troubles of the retail sector, management brushed off the threat of e-commerce and Amazon (AMZN). People are still shopping for clothes at TJX-owned stores, was the message.Herrman said Q2 is ""off to a solid start,"" with inventory in a good position, and later added that the company is ""still gaining apparel market share in the U.S.""Shares of TJX tumbled 4.1% to 73.76 on the stock market today after falling to a six-month low of 73.17 earlier. On May 10, TJX tried to break out of a consolidation resistance area. But shares have sold off since then in the wake of grim news from other retailers. Off-price rival Ross Stores (ROST), which reports earnings on Thursday, was down 1.4%.In Q1, TJX's profit rose 8% to 82 cents on 3% revenue growth to $7.78 billion, vs. consensus for 79 cents a share and $7.88 billion in sales. Same-store sales rose 1%, below some estimates.Management sees Q2 EPS of 81-83 cents vs. 84 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected 92 cents. TJX sees full-year profit of $3.71-$3.78, up 5%-7%, also below views. The company said currency effects and wage increases weighed on its guidance.Off-pricers like TJX and Ross enjoyed a reputation for being untouchable by Amazon, thanks to the in-store treasure-hunt nature of bargain-rack shopping. But Tuesday's weak sales and guidance raised concerns that status may be under threat as the rest of retail suffers a face-melting sell-off.Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), J.C. Penney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS) plunged last week amid grim results and a growing fear that department stores don't know how to stop the bleeding. Macy's and Dillard's have hit their lowest levels in more than five years, while J.C. Penney is at record lows.And Sears Holdings' (SHLD) CEO has resorted to blasting vendors in a blog post, in a bid to un-smear the long-ailing retailer's name in the press.

197,KSS," Nike (NKE) rival Under Armour (UAA) reported first-quarter results early Thursday that were better than expected, sending shares soaring.Estimates: Swing to a 4-cent per-share loss from prior-year quarter profit of 4 cents a share, as revenue rises 6% to just a little under $1.11 billion.Results: Under Armour lost 1 cent a share as sales climbed to $1.17 billion.Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said that Steph Curry basketball shoe sales are ""sluggish,"" but said that it is already factored into the company's guidance.Stock: Shares jumped 9.9% to 21.67 on the stock market today, moving above their 50-day moving average for the first time since August 2016.Under Armour is well off its all-time high of 52.95 from September 2015. The stock has come under pressure following investor disappointment from the previous quarter's results, CEO Plank's ill-received comments about President Trump, a lukewarm outing at Kohl's (KSS), and a resurgent Adidas, among other factors.Shares of Nike edged 0.6% higher. U.S. shares of Adidas (ADDYY) fell 0.15%.Leading up to the report, Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon expressed last Thursday that he remains cautious on Under Armour.""The trifecta of headwinds that plagued (Under Armour) last year (overexposure to sporting goods, overexposure to NA, and overexposure to performance apparel) has not abated, in our opinion,"" he wrote. ""While UA is working to diversify its channel mix as evidenced by its recent entry into KSS (and forthcoming entry into DSW and Famous Footwear later this year), our checks suggest the apparel segmentation efforts have fallen short of expectations.""RELATED:Foot Locker Sees Weak Earnings: Here's Why The Stock Is RisingGoogle Backs Up Teens: Nike Rival Under Armour Isn't Hot AnymoreNike Is No Longer The Top New Apparel Brand For Teen Boys: Piper Jaffray SurveyUnder Armour Falls On Tepid Kohl's Debut, 'Intensifying' Price War With Nike

200,KSS,"Wal-Mart (WMT) on Thursday reported much-better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and higher U.S. same-store sales. It's a positive sign for the retail sector after disappointing results or outlooks from the likes of Target (TGT), Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) in the face of sluggish economic growth, rising labor costs and competition with Amazon (AMZN).Wal-Mart shares spiked 9.6% to 69.20 on the stock market today, its best day in more than 7 years and gapping above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Wal-Mart fell 3% on Wednesday, falling below its 200-day moving average, after Target reported weaker-than-expected sales and guidance. Target itself fell 7.6% Wednesday, hitting its lowest intraday level since late 2014. Target fell more than 1% intraday Thursday.Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, reported fiscal Q1 profit of 98 cents a share, beating estimates by 10 cents but down from $1.03 a year earlier. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.90 billion vs. analysts' forecast for a drop to $113.22 billion.U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, double Wall Street targets. It was the seventh straight quarter of higher domestic comps.As for the current Q2, Wal-Mart expects to earn 95 cents to $1.08 per share, with the $1.015 midpoint above estimates for 98 cents. The discount giant expects U.S. comps to rise about 1%.""There is momentum in many parts of the business,"" CFO Brett Biggs said in a statement.Wal-Mart reiterated its full-year EPS forecast for a 6%-12% decline.One negative note: E-commerce sales rose just 7% vs. a year earlier, decelerating vs.prior quarters.

It also cut the annual fee by $1 to $49.

201,KSS,"Most stock mutual funds in May extended the rally that began in March. And some strategists are figuring ways to deal with expected stock market headwinds in the summer months.The average diversified U.S. stock fund in May rose 1.55% vs. setbacks in January and February, followed by a 6.50% rally in March and a 0.48% inch-up in April, leaving it 1.92% higher year to date. By comparison, the S&P 500 advanced 1.80% in May.Going forward, most investors who spoke with IBD expect market volatility into the summer. But they're ready.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersLew Piantedosi, manager of four Eaton Vance mutual funds with total assets of $1.2 billion, has a guardedly optimistic, glass-half-full outlook. ""We believe in a core portfolio of secular growers,"" he said. ""Those include names like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL).""Another such name he likes is NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). ""They provide semiconductor content to the automobile and industrial spaces,"" said Piantedosi, who is a manager of Focused Growth (ELCIX), Focused Growth Opportunities (EIFGX), Tax-Managed Growth (EITGX) and Tax-Managed Multi-Cap Growth (EACPX). ""There's a huge secular shift in those areas toward automation and other new technologies that are driving demand for new semiconductor content.""He added, ""In cars, the new features include crash avoidance, music, rear-view cameras, driver-assisted sensors, other safety systems and an overall trend toward electrical vehicles."" In industrial products, there's a comparable shift into robotics and other forms of automation, he said. ""In both areas, NXP is a leading provider,"" he said.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceAmong more cautious investors, with a glass-half-empty view, is James Wong, lead manager of $716 million Payden Equity Income Fund (PYVLX). ""I'm bracing for volatility,"" he said. ""We're entering the summer, when it does not take a lot of bad news to move the market. So, because I'm an equity income investor, I will drink my own Kool-Aid and say investors would be served well by focusing on companies that continue to provide income in a low-volatility manner.""Theme-parks operator Six Flags Entertainment (SIX) is the sort of stock he likes right now. ""They came out of bankruptcy at the start of this decade,"" Wong said. ""They're improving their revenue stream. Management has improved the quality of their parks and introduced new rides. They've increased membership rates, which means people go more often and spend more money. And they've introduced go-to-the-front-of-the-line passes that people gobble up.""The changes have helped. ""They've improved their recurring-revenue model,"" Wong said. ""So they're a steady-cash-generating company, able to maintain and grow their 4% dividend yield.""The market notched a modest gain in May because investors were emboldened by stock market news that turned out to be less scary than they had feared at the month's outset, Wong said.""Earnings season was negative, but not as bad as people had expected,"" Wong said. The prospect of a ""Brexit"" -- a U.K. exit from the European Union -- faded slightly, he added. And the price of oil rose, from just under $46 a barrel on April 29 to just over $49 on May 31.In addition, many investors grew more comfortable with the prospect of an interest-rate hike as soon as June or July.Small-cap growth funds led by tacking on 2.46% in May.Science and technology funds paced sectors by jumping 4.83%. ""When investors are optimistic, they gravitate toward growthier areas of the market,"" Piantedosi said. ""That's tech.""World equity funds fared far worse, losing 0.35%.Japanese funds did best abroad, gaining 2.38%.Taxable bond funds lost 0.14%. U.S. Treasury funds edged up 0.19%. Tax-exempt funds gained 0.55%.May capped a streak of three months in a row of market gains. ""The fear that dominated at the start of the year kept fading in May,"" Piantedosi said.He added, ""U.S. consumers have been strong. Housing was robust. Europe was looking better.""In the near term, investors will focus on day-to-day events such as the Brexit decision, Federal Reserve meetings, November's U.S. elections, monthly jobless reports and the monthly Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), an indicator of the health of the manufacturing sector.Amid all of that noise, remember that the Fed will raise rates because it sees signs of a strengthening U.S. economy. ""And that should help corporate earnings,"" said Karyn Cavanaugh, the senior market strategist for Voya Investment Management and a member of its multiasset strategies and solutions group. ""At the end of the day, stock buying boils down to buying corporate earnings.""Cavanaugh expects an uptick in corporate earnings in Q3 and Q4. Still, if that fails to occur, don't expect U.S. consumer spending to stay strong, warned Cavanaugh, who is also a manager of $39 million Voya Global Perspectives (IWPVX).Wong, for one, says the market's winning streak is likely to end. Valuations are high and earnings growth is weak, he noted.Piantedosi expects disruptive innovators to continue to grab market share. So he likes Amazon instead of brick-and-mortar department stores. Macy's (M), Dillard's (DDS) and Kohl's (KSS) all reported lower quarterly earnings per share in May. All suffered stock-price declines.Amazon reported a 992% EPS gain in April, accelerating from 122% and 118% in the prior two frames. Shares gained 10% in May.He likes Facebook and Google for similar reasons. ""The huge shift continues in advertising (spending) from traditional media to online and social media,"" he said.Ditto for health care. Despite political talk about potential drug-price regulation, he's bullish in the long term on big-cap biotechs like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). ""Who knows how the pricing issue will shake out,"" he said. ""But there's plenty of growth in these companies as they continue to innovate.""Piantedosi is not confining bets to high-flyers. ""In any diversified portfolio, you don't want to be pedal-to-the-metal at all times,"" he said. ""Some names in consumer staples, while not cheap, provide stability and predictability and yield.""Philip Morris International (PM) is a favorite. He said, ""It is 100% focused overseas, where the anti-smoking headwind is less than in the U.S. It has a lot of pricing power. The currency headwind is (diminishing) and likely to turn to a tailwind.""Its dividend yield is 4.1%.Pinnacle Foods (PF) is another he likes. ""It's a nice Steady Eddie food company with decent growth characteristics in a food group that doesn't show great characteristics,"" he said.Pinnacle's dividend yield is 2.4%.

202,KSS,"JCPenney (JCP) missed on first-quarter revenue and cut gross margin guidance for the year on Friday, adding to the retail massacre that was earnings week.Shares closed down 2.8% as the struggling lower-tier department store reported a 32-cent per-share loss, though the result was better than views for a 38-cent per-share loss and narrower than the prior-year loss of 57 cents a share.But sales had been expected to rise from the previous year, and an unexpected 2% dip to $2.81 billion missed consensus estimates for $2.92 billion. Same-store sales dipped 0.4% during the quarter.

205,KSS,"Retail sales rose 1.3% in April, the Commerce Department said Friday, the biggest monthly gain in more than a year and easing some fears about consumer spending and consumer-related stocks following weak reports from Apple (AAPL), Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), J.C. Penney (JCP) and others recently.Economists expected a 0.9% gain after falling 0.3% in March.Auto sales rebounded 3.2% last month -- after a 3.2% drop in March. But sales excluding autos rose 0.8%, far above the 0.2% increase expected by Wall Street. Sales climbed 0.6% without autos or higher-priced gasoline.Internet and other nonstore sales spiked 2.1% last month and 10.2% vs. a year earlier, both the best in more than a year.

Amazon shares have hit new highs this week even as bad news sinks the rest of retail and consumer sector.Even outside auto dealers, Internet retailers and higher-priced gasoline, gains were broad-based. But that followed a raft of bad reports in the last few days. And many issued grim outlooks.Among department stores, Macy's, Kohl's, Nordstom, J.C.

The move comes amid continued business struggles and buyout buzz.""We are accelerating our path to enhanced value creation to deliver better returns for our shareholders,"" said Whole Foods CEO John Mackey in a statement that outlined updated strategic initiatives. ""Today's announcement is a powerful combination of accelerated initiatives and new cost savings with clear timelines to deliver. We are on a path to return to positive comparable store sales and earnings growth next year.""Incoming CFO Keith Manbeck, who starts in one week, comes from Kohl's (KSS) as senior vice president of digital finance, strategy management and business transformation.Gabrielle Sulzberger, a longtime independent director, was named new chair of the board. Mary Ellen Coe is the grocer's new chair of nominating and governance committee.Among the new independent directors: Panera Bread (PNRA) CEO Ron Shaich, as his bakery-cafe chain recently accepted a buyout from JAB Holdings.The Wall Street Journal reported before the close, citing people familiar the matter, that the board changes were not a settlement with Jana Partners, the activist hedge fund that recently disclosed a sizeable stake in Whole Foods.Estimates: Profit to tumble 16% to 37 cents a share on a 0.8% revenue dip to $3.73 billion. That would be the first sales drop in years.Results: 37 cents per adjusted share on revenue of $3.74 billion. Same-store sales tumbled 2.8%.Outlook: Diluted EPS of $1.30 or greater, vs. prior outlook for $1.33 a share. Revenue growth of 1% or more, down from previous guidance for 1.5% gains.

Buyout chatter has lifted the stock in recent weeks, most noticeably on April 10, when shares popped 10% on news of Jana Partners' 8.3% stake in the company and the hedge fund's reported interest in a Whole Foods sale.The stock is up about 18% so far in calendar 2017.Why It Matters: Because of all of the M&A whispers. Ceberus Capital Management-controlled Albertsons is reportedly exploring an acquisition of Whole Foods, according to a late April report from Financial Times. Jana Partners has taken an 8.3% stake in Whole Foods, seeking big changes or a sale. The reported Whole Foods board shakeup could be a preemptive move to fight Jana Partners.Among other takeover news, a Bloomberg report from earlier last month that Amazon (AMZN) had ever-so-briefly internally toyed with the notion of buying out Whole Foods, and an earlier Bloomberg story from March that said Albertsons was in early talks to buy Whole Foods peer Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and take it private.Sprouts topped estimates when it reported last week, as EPS grew 10% to 33 cents and revenue rose 14% to $1.13 billion. Analysts had expected 30 cents in per-share earnings on $1.11 billion. Sprouts rose 1.3% to 23.63, its best close since July 2016.Grocer sellers from Whole Foods to mainstream giants such as Kroger (KR) to dollar store operators have come under pressure amid food cost deflation, in part due to renewed price cutting by retail giant Wal-Mart (WFM). Wal-Mart is offering curbside pickup while Amazon is expanding its AmazonFresh home delivery.

In addition, net sales growth will be in the low teens, compared with the previous outlook of up mid- to high single digits.Operating expense is expected to be up slightly from $553.7 million last year, but primarily due to the higher-than-anticipated net sales.""We are pleased by our performance across all brands and channels during the holiday season, with continued strength at Hollister, and the Abercrombie brand on track to deliver positive comparable sales for the quarter,"" CEO Fran Horowitz said in a press release.The results are ""generally consistent with the better trends we've seen this holiday season,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Tunick said in a research note, but added that the return to positive comps are ""worth a mic drop.""Abercrombie also said in its forecast that it expects to take a significant income-tax charge in the fourth quarter, mainly related to the one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings following the Trump administration's tax overhaul.The firm also announced on Monday that Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez is to step down on Feb. 3.

223,KSS,"XThe Adidas rocket ship shows no signs of slowing: the latest semiannual teen survey from Piper Jaffray says that the resurgent athletic apparel brand has become the No. 1 new label worn by male teens, knocking out Nike (NKE), the Dow Jones industrial average component that has reigned in that category since fall of 2014.And overall, it the third most preferred fashion footwear brand among upper-income teens, ""the highest it has been in 10 years,"" notes Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy in a separate note, raising her price target to 194 euro from 190. She also notched up full-year estimates on the Three Stripes.That doesn't mean that Nike is anywhere near losing its market share dominance, however. Among all upper-income and average income teens, the Swoosh remains the top athletic clothing brand with 69% of the vote in each segment. Adidas, while still the fastest growing brand in Piper Jaffray's poll, sits in the No. 2 spot with less than 10% of the vote.And in athletic footwear among all teens, Nike holds on tight to its top position with 80% share of the survey.""While (Nike) remains the No. 1 footwear brand, we are seeing strong signs that adidas is gaining back share among males & hitting an all-time high with females,"" said Murphy.Meanwhile, Under Armour (UAA) topped one of the charts in a less stellar way, becoming the No. 1 brand that's no longer being worn by upper-income teenage boys.Under Armour recently was added to midmarket department story Kohl's (KSS), which some analysts wondering if that would undermine the brand. Nike has been at Kohl's and other big-box retailers for years.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour's first month at Kohl's was considered underwhelming, amid an ""intensifying"" price war between the Baltimore-based brand and Nike.Dow's Nike fell 0.4% to 54.90 in afternoon trade in the stock market today. Under Armour sank 0.65%, stuck in a long downtrend.

224,KSS,"XThe main indexes remained higher in afternoon trading Thursday, as small caps and retail stocks led a soft bounce in the market.Despite a bearish reversal Wednesday, the S&P 500 was up 0.4% and finding support near the 50-day moving average. That suggests the index can stay on track with its uptrend, although some institutional selling over the past several weeks poses a threat.The Dow Jones industrial average, also up 0.4%, is tracing a similar chart. Most of its 30 components were higher, with Home Depot's (HD) 0.6% rise adding to the gains in retail. Wal-Mart (WMT), however, was flat.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. But it was small caps that shined brighter, as the Russell 2000 climbed 0.5%. The index, though, remains below the 50-day moving average. Volume was lower across the board.Retail stocks led the market today. Apparel firms, discounters, department stores and other retail groups — all of them in the lagging industry rankings — were up 2% to 4.5%. Kohl's (KSS) jumped 6.5%, but like other department-store stocks it remains deep in a correction.Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS) broke out of a cup-with-handle base, leaping past the 61.77 buy point in about one-third more volume than usual. The company's home brands include Master Lock, Moen faucets and several cabinet lines.Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) broke out of a base-on-base pattern, surging past a 34.94 buy point in nearly double its usual volume. The Chilean provider of fertilizers and lithium and other chemicals is turning itself around, going from a few quarters of declining EPS to gains of 320% and 82% the past two quarters.Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) found support after a sharp pullback to the 10-week moving average. Volume was tracking at three times the average.The IBD 50 was indicated 0.6% higher, and some of its semiconductor stocks behaved favorably.Cavium (CAVM), one of the many new technology components on the screen, rose 0.5% as the stock climbs from support at the 50-day moving average. Volume was tracking well below usual levels, so the stock may need more of a push before it can be considered in a new buy area. It would be a secondary entry for the chip stock, which has glided well from a flat base breakout Dec. 6.Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) made a bullish reversal after touching its 50-day line.

225,KSS,"X Shares of Under Armour (UAA) dropped Monday amid a downgrade to underperform from FBR Capital and lukewarm findings from Piper Jaffray on the athletic apparel brand's performance at Kohl's (KSS) so far.FBR analyst Susan Anderson cut her rating on Under Armour and pulled her price target to 14 from 20. Among other factors, she cited the brand's declining popularity in an FBR poll, dearth of footwear innovation, plus an ""intensifying"" price war between Nike (NKE) and Under Armour following the latter's debut at Kohl's a month ago.At direct-to-consumer channels, Nike outlets have been more promotional, said Anderson, and Under Armour has been discounting ""significantly"" year over year. At the wholesale level, athletic goods outlets such as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and department stores such as Macy's (M) have ""ramped up promos, we believe in response to intensified promos now at Kohl's, particularly in men's/kids',"" she wrote.Piper Jaffray noted separately that both brands have been promotional at Kohl's, though ""Nike still outsells Under Armour,"" despite consumer interest in Under Armour's arrival at the midtier department store. Analyst Erinn Murphy also pointed to Under Armour's sluggishness at Kohl's in the key women's segment, and concern that the brand's debut isn't bringing in incremental customers.""We worry that Kohl's $3.5 billion Athletic & Wellness category cannot sustain (double-digit) growth in 2017 and the addition of UAA will likely have cannibalistic effects on peer athletic brands,"" she said. ""Our concerns about UAA's ability to drive sales as KSS were escalated further when DSW (DSW) announced it will be carrying UAA in time for back-to-school 2017.""Meanwhile, a Barron's report that the stock could ascend by 30% in a year, reportedly on its prospects at Kohl's and room to run abroad.Under Armour shares initially rose in the stock market today, reversed as low as 19.20 before closing at 19.63, off 0.8%.Barron's highlighted Under Armour's investments in collegiate sponsorships and its prominence in the NCAA Final Four after spending $71 million across a decade to become the outfitter of the South Carolina Gamecocks.South Carolina brought home the women's national championship title on Sunday after beating Mississippi State. In the men's division, the Gamecocks lost 73-77 to the Gonzaga Bulldogs on Saturday.North Carolina and Gonzaga will face off in the championship game Monday night.

That comes as many major retailers, including Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Target (TGT), have been falling near multiyear lows.IBD'S TAKE: The retail industry is facing an existential crisis, and not in the depths of the recession. Amid brutal competition and a massive shift online, death stalks retail, but hope lives on.Wal-Mart has revitalized its e-commerce efforts, helped by a series of acquisitions, including Jet.com last year. Wal-Mart put Jet.com founder Marc Lore in charge of all its online efforts.Fourth-quarter online sales surged 29%. But Wal-Mart is doing more than holding its own. It's actually forced Amazon to adapt.In late January, Wal-Mart ended its ShippingPass subscription program, its attempt to imitate Amazon Prime. Instead, Wal-Mart announced that it would offer free two-day shipping for online orders of at least $35. Amazon soon cut its non-Prime free shipping to $35, though its deliveries will take five to eight days.Separately, Alphabet's Google denied Labor Department claims of widespread pay disparity between men and women. ""Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,"" Google said in an emailed statement Sunday.A Labor Department official reportedly testified Friday that the government found women being paid less ""pretty much across the entire workforce.""Alphabet has been trying to deal with an uproar from advertisers for their Google YouTube ads being placed against racist or other objectionable videos.

The managers of $799 million Oppenheimer Discovery Mid Cap Growth Fund (OEGAX) are applying that adage about finding shelter in a storm to their mutual fund.Amid a blah macroeconomic environment, they've been betting that the few companies capable of generating superior growth will be increasingly attractive to investors. Those are the stocks they are aiming for, according to their March 31 commentary.Hasbro (HAS), the world's second-largest publicly traded toy company, was a key contributor to fund performance in the first quarter. It was helped by holiday-season sales of toys based on the big success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" a film that was released in December.Q4 sales rose 13% as earnings per share climbed 14%. Hasbro has quickened its pace. Q1 revenue rose 16%, driving an 81% EPS surge.

And it as a 99 Composite Rating from IBD.The stock got powerful free advertising in recent days. Texas mom Candace Payne donned a mask depicting ""Star Wars"" character Chewbacca that emitted the Wookiee’s trademark growl every time Payne opened her mouth. A video of Payne laughing hysterically as the mask growled -- dubbed ""Happy Chewbacca"" -- was posted on Facebook (FB), drawing over 140 million views as of Tuesday.As IBD reported, Piper Jaffray said the video could drive sales of 1 million units or more of the $30 mask, generating 2 to 3 cents of near-term EPS for Hasbro.Kohl's (KSS) posted a video of Payne and her family, further promoting Hasbro products.Then Payne appeared on CBS’ (CBS) ""The Late Late Show,"" recreating her viral video hit, with host James Corden and ""Star Wars"" director J.J. Abrams also wearing the Hasbro-made masks.The highest Comp Rating is 99. The Comp Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating.Seven of the fund's top 10 holdings as of March 31 had Comp Ratings of 80 or higher. So did eight of the fund's 10 top new buys.Trading around 256, top-10 holding Acuity Brands (AYI) is extended from an earlier entry at 225.28 and from an alternate entry at 242, as IBD's markets team points out.

The company is debt free.After EPS shrank in all four quarters of 2014 and grew just 1% in Q1 2015, it has grown at a double-digit pace in four frames since then. Revenue grew 7%, 12% and 12% the past three stanzas.Intuitive Surgical was not hurt by a May 12 U.S. District Court ruling that, if upheld, would bar government payments of billions of dollars to insurance companies participating in ObamaCare, enabling the insurers to reduce customers' out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles for low-income people.Shares of many insurance-oriented health care stocks went down after the decision.Ronald Zibelli Jr. took the fund's helm on June 5, 2007.

236,KSS,"Department stores such as Macy's (M), J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) sold off Monday on little news, as investors continue to lower their prospects for traditional retailers as shoppers increasingly shift to Amazon.com (AMZN) and other e-commerce sites.Macy's fell 3.8% to 29.37 on the stock market today, trading at its lowest levels since early February, when takeover buzz began.Kohl's sank 4.8% to 38.56, setting a seven-month low intraday.J.C. Penney retreated 2.3% to 5.85, hitting a five-year low. Regional department store operator Dillard's tumbled 4.5% to 49.79, also hitting its worst levels since early 2012.IBD's Retail-Department Store group, rated dead last out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, was the biggest losers in Monday's session. Macy's and Kohl's were among the very worst performers on the S&P 500 index Monday.Department stores are working hard to try to be viable, emphasizing their online presence. But Amazon is grabbing a huge share of online sales growth and boasts bigger shipping discounts than even major retailers. Brick-and-mortar chains hope to better-leverage physical stores for online pickups and returns. But at the same time they are slashing their store count. That lowers costs, but calls into question the very omnichannel model they are trying to use to battle Amazon.IBD'S TAKE: Despite their brick-and-mortar woes, traditional retailers are seeing big online sales gains, but from very low levels.Target (TGT) fell intraday to a five-year low, though the retailer closed up 8 cents to 54.37. Target has been lumped in with department stores, especially after its weak Q4 earnings report and guidance.Amazon, for its part, rose 0.55% to 856.99. Amazon is still in buy range from an 821.75 entry and is setting up in a four-weeks-tight pattern with an 860.76 buy point.As for other retailers, Wal-Mart (WMT) isn't doing as badly as some of its rivals. Wal-Mart saw sharp online sales growth over the holidays, with U.S. same-store sales rising. Wal-Mart is re-emphasizing lower prices, a push that's squeezing everyone from Macy's to Target to grocers such as Kroger (KR).Wal-Mart shares closed up 0.1% to 59.98 Monday. But Wal-Mart stock is below its 200-day line and its relative strength line shows the retail giant is an S&P 500 laggard.Off-price retailers such as TJX (TJX) and Burlington Stores (BURL) are near highs, but they too retreated Monday, down 1.3% and 2%, respectively.RELATED:Macy's, Costco, Kohl's And Other Retailers Are Getting SlammedRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingTarget Dives To 2014 Levels: 'We're Slow And Have Too Much Inventory'J.C.

Kohl's also lost 3.4%, Nordstrom 1.8%, J.C. Penney 4.8%. IBD's Retail-Department store group fell 3.3% Monday, one of the very worst performers out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Macy's has been added to IBD's Leaderboard, which provides annotated chart analysis of actionable stocks. Leaderboard typically focuses on growth stocks at or near buy points, but Macy's is among a new crop of possible short sales.February store sales sank 17%, said Business Insider on Monday, citing Bloomberg and First Data. That data appeared to be public last week, per a tweet from Bloomberg reporter Jodi Xu Klein:U.S. department store Feb sales downs 17%, tax refunds may help, says Bloomberg Intelligence #retailers— Jodi Xu Klein (@jodixu) March 3, 2017Meanwhile, the New York Post reported late Friday that Macy's bidder Hudson's Bay isn't pleased with the ""high price"" being asked for the nation's largest department store chain. Hudson's Bay also hasn't lined up financing yet for a Macy's bid, Reuters reported on Friday.And NPD Group said Monday that apparel sales grew 3% in 2016 to reach $218.7 billion, but were struggling to rise beyond that.""The industry had positive overall performance with growth in most categories, but it has struggled to exceed 3% sales growth since 2013, as significant gains in select consumer and retail segments were offset by declines in others,"" said NPD.Costco and Target (TGT) are also swept up in Monday's downward action. Costco fell 2.1%, undercutting its 50-day line intraday. Costco gapped down 4.4% on Friday following its report of weaker-than-expected earnings and sales.Target, which crashed 14% last week on its own weak results and guidance, lost 2.2%. But Wal-Mart (WMT) dipped just 0.2%.Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins says there's ""no specific reason"" he's aware of for the broad sector decline, though ""you can probably take your pick.""Among those issues he cited: delayed tax refunds, broader Q4 earnings weakness — down 2.1% year-over-year, he said — concern over the border adjustment tax, high levels of distressed debt in retail, and of course, Amazon (AMZN).Perkins also noted that retail earnings pre-announcements ""are running 5-1 negative-to-positive so far this earnings season.""RELATED:Target Dives To 2014 Levels: 'We're Slow And Have Too Much Inventory'Costco To Raise Membership Fees After Fiscal Q2 Earnings, Sales MissJ.C.

239,KSS,"Macy's (M) stock plunged to its lowest level since 2011 on Tuesday, reflecting a broader market sell-off and an ongoing plunge for department stores and many other brick-and-mortar retailers as they deal with an ever-larger Amazon.com (AMZN) and a reinvigorated Wal-Mart (WMT).The department store chain's stock was down 3.2% to 28.42 in the stock market today, tumbling through its January support levels. Shares closed off their session lows but are nearing their next level of support — 22.66 — the low point of a cup base formed in the summer and fall during that year.J.C. Penney (JCP) fell 3.8% to a fresh 3-year low, Dillards (DDS) 3.6% to a five-year low. Nordstrom (JWN) lost 1.9% and Kohl's (KSS) 2.4%, both hitting their lowest levels since last August. IBD's Retail-Department Store group, ranked dead last out of 197 industry groups, is one of Tuesday's big losers after being Monday's worst performer.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) stabbed through the bottom of a flat base, falling 2%.IBD'S TAKE: After a wave of grim holiday-quarter reports, retailers have been rushing to invest more in e-commerce. The existential crisis among brick-and-mortar retailers has grown more acute in recent months.Grim holiday-quarter results, bankruptcy filings and planned store-closures have piled up as Amazon sucks the life from malls and a younger generation of shoppers spends its money on experiences rather than things. Home-improvement and off-price retail, which are seen as more immune to e-commerce, are among the few bright spots. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, has begun a new price war — pinching discounters, department stores and grocery stores. Wal-Mart had strong online sales, and has continued an e-commerce buying spree and expansion.Amazon fell 1.6% after hitting an all-time high in morning action. Wal-Mart edged down just 0.1%.Department stores are working to develop their own small-but-fast-growing e-commerce sales, but closing physical stores also limits the omnichannel pickup and return options.RELATED:Department Stores Continue To Dive As Investors Doubt Viability Vs.

240,KSS,"Federal withheld income and employment taxes, the broadest and most reliable gauge of the state of the job market, grew 4.5% from a year ago in the four weeks through May 20, an IBD analysis of daily Treasury statements finds.That's the fastest pace in more than six months, providing confirmation that the economy is gaining steam after two weak quarters.The tax data, which don't rely on limited sample sizes and seasonal adjustments, had been signaling weaker wage gains than the monthly employment reports, which do require such guesswork. That may help explain how the economy slowed so much over the past two quarters even as job growth remained solid.The upturn in tax-receipt growth since mid-April could be a precursor to another strong employment report, including a further rise in wage growth that pushes the Federal Reserve closer to a June rate hike.After bottoming out at about 2% year-over-year growth in February, income and employment taxes have staged a recovery, propelled by announced pay hikes at Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST).A number of companies reporting earnings over the past month also have highlighted wage pressures.""We're facing an unprecedented environment for retaining and hiring talent,"" Panera Bread (PNRA) President Drew Madsen said on the restaurant chain's first-quarter earnings call.The company noted a 5% rise in retail hourly wage inflation during the quarter, as well as an increase in bonuses for bakery cafe managers.Wendy's (WEN) said it's seeing wage inflation of 5% to 6%, driven both by minimum-wage hikes and the need to offer a competitive wage ""to access good labor.""Kohl's (KSS) CEO Kevin Mansell said the retailer also is ""experiencing significant wage pressure.""The 4.5% rate of growth in withheld income and employment taxes is roughly consistent with annual payroll gains of 2% and wage gains of 2.5%. That's still pretty modest compared to gains upward of 5% in the first half of 2015 and 7% before the recession. But Fed policymakers aren't prepared to wait for more normal wage growth to resume normalizing interest rates.The U.S. is ""basically at full employment or very near it,"" San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Monday.

242,KSS,"Shares of Children's Place (PLCE) gapped up in the stock market today, a rare bright spot for the retail space after the children's apparel retailer beat first-quarter estimates and boosted its profit forecasts.Children's Place reported a 59% surge in first-quarter earnings per share to $1.32, well above estimates for $1.04 and the best gain going back at least past five years. Net sales also topped views, rising 3.6% to $419.4 million, compared with expectations for $417.59 million. Comps rose 5.1%.The clothier expects full-year earnings per share of $4.17-$4.27, up from an earlier outlook $4.00-$4.10. The more upbeat forecast comes ""despite the challenging environment and continued weakness in store traffic,"" Children's Place said.The full-year outlook includes a 12-cent hit from adverse foreign exchange, ""assumes a low single digit comp sales increase, expansion of gross margin and disciplined expense control.”Still, for the second quarter, the company sees a net loss of 22-30 cents per share, worse than analysts' consensus for 22 cents per share.Children's Place stock rose 4.1% to 71.05 Tuesday after climbing as high as 74.40 in the morning.The stock jumped in March after Children's Place reported fourth-quarter results, but shares began to crumble last month and were driven down further last week amid grim news and forecasts from retailers like Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Gap (GPS) and Nordstrom (JWN).Macy's stock fell 1.1%, Kohl's 2.7% and Nordstrom 2.3%. Gap, which reports full first-quarter results on Thursday, sank 1.2%. E-commerce sites like Amazon (AMZN), competitive promotions and a mild winter in some areas have hurt retailers' results, although some analysts believe that value chains have an advantage over their upscale rivals.""We believe that the current trend to value over brand is here to stay,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar said in a note about discount apparel chain operator TJX Cos.

243,KSS,"TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) are on tap to report this week, so here's a brief look at what investors can expect from the off-pricers in the wake of last week's retail beatdown.Department stores collectively crumbled on earnings results last week, with Nordstrom (JWN) shares descending a whopping 18.5% by Friday's close, while Macy's (M) lost 17.1%, and Kohl's (KSS) sank 13.6%.But analysts generally agree that off-price retailers are the best positioned in a broader sector plagued by pure plays like Amazon (AMZN), weak apparel trends, and younger shoppers that are shying away from the mall.TJX profit is expected to climb 3% to 71 cents a share on 6% revenue growth to $7.3 billion.  The T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods parent reports Tuesday before the open.Meanwhile, Ross Stores earnings and revenue are both expected to rise 6%, posting 73 cents a share profit on sales of $3.1 billion. The company discloses results late Thursday.TJX shares are building a flat base above their 200-day line, though the stock is currently trading below the key 50-day level. Ross shares look similar, also working on a flat base above their 200-day line but below their 50-day.Both stocks held steadier than their retail counterparts last week, only losing around 5% by Friday's close. On Monday, Ross closed up 2.6%, and TJX added 3.45% on the stock market.RELATED:Retailers Lick Wounds, As JCPenney Results Cap Week From HellRetail Sales Spike 1.3%, Best Gain In A Year, Easing Consumer Fears.

244,KSS,"Home Depot (HD) crushed first-quarter estimates and raised its full-year guidance, as customers of the home improvement retail giant paid an extra 2.4% per visit, or an average $60.03 during the period, the company said Tuesday.But its shares fell early on the stock market today after Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome told analysts on the earnings call that sales at stores open at least a year fell from 10.2% in February to 6.7% in March and then to 4.3% in April. Home Depot stock stayed down and ended the trading day off 2.5% to 132.""It does dovetail with a bit of a spending slowdown we saw at a number of retailers that pointed to April being a slower month,"" Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins told IBD.Home Depot is more insulated from the Amazon.com (AMZN) effect than other retailers, such as apparel chains, Perkins said. So its slowing same-store sales at outlets open more than a year aren't as much of a red flag as they are for top chains like Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl's (KSS) and Gap (GPS). Those four retailers reported dismal results last week, sparking a sell-off in the sector.Perkins likes prospects for Home Depot and rival Lowe's this year.""We visited a number of retailers including Home Depot throughout the spring and they and Lowe's (LOW) were the busiest stores we visited,"" Perkins said.Home Depot's adjusted first-quarter earnings of $1.44 a share were up 24.1% year over year, according to figures provided by Thomson Reuters. Revenue grew 9% to $22.76 billion amid continued strong housing market growth, favorable spring weather and sustained consumer spending.Wall Street expected $1.36 earnings per share and $22.39 billion in revenue for the fiscal quarter ended May 1.Home Depot Chief Executive Craig Menear said in a press release that it was a ""stronger-than-expected start to the year"" and noted it came in ""a quarter marked by week-to-week demand spikes caused by weather variability.""Home Depot raised its 2016 earnings view to $6.27 a share, a penny above analysts' forecasts. It also lifted its sales projection for the year to 6.3% growth to about $94.097 billion, topping estimates of $94.082 billion. The company also projects same-store sales -- sales at outlets open more than a year -- will be up about 4.9% for the year, though that would be below first-quarter same-store sales growth of 6.5%.Shares initially fell more than 2% in morning trading, falling through their 50-day moving average. They recovered somewhat before tumbling even further by the close.After consolidating for nearly three months, the company's stock climbed above a 135.57 buy point on April 18 and rose to a fresh all-time high at 137.82 on May 10 before consolidating again.Jared Wiesel, partner at corporate consulting firm Revenue Analytics noted that the company is focusing on engaging millenials. For example, Home Depot is employing omni-media marketing that employs everything from print to digital.""Their online sales were up 21.5% for the quarter, which is excellent,"" Weisel said.Wiesel said that some investors may be concerned that what would normally be early summer sales were pulled into the first quarter because of favorable weather, which could hurt second-quarter results.""There could be an expectation that this quarter was so strong at the expense of future quarters,"" Wiesel said.Home Depot’s earnings came on the heels of the Commerce Department's announcement on Monday that U.S. housing starts climbed a strong 6.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units, topping estimates of 1.13 million.The government also revised March starts up a bit to a 1.10 million-unit rate from 1.09. The housing starts data and strong April retail sales indicate that economic growth is picking up momentum after getting off to a sluggish start in 2016.""Our view of the macro environment remains consistent. We believe housing data indicates continued tailwinds for our business,"" CEO Menear told analysts on an earnings call early Tuesday.CFO Tome added: ""We estimate weather driven demand positively impacted U.S. sales growth by approximately $250 million.""Lowe's (LOW) is set to announce first-quarter financial results early Wednesday. Analysts predict earnings per share will rise 21% to 85 cents and revenue should jump 5.1% to $14.87 billion. Shares lost 1.2% at the close.

Delta Air Lines fueled a big boost in airlines, while Lennar and KB Home showed that builders remain a leading group. Many big retailers rallied on solid holiday sales. Intel and many chip-equipment stocks struggled.Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google and Amazon.com (AMZN) battled for the spotlight at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Google Assistant will be built into a wide range of consumer devices, including TVs, headphones and third party home speakers. It will also roll out in cars featuring Android Auto software. But Amazon's Echo devices remain the connected-home market leader, with estimated 70% share. Amazon said it has created a new division called Alexa Voice Services. Kohler strutted out a smart mirror that uses Alexa and plays music. Reports resurfaced at CES that Amazon could begin testing ads on Alexa.Autonomous vehicles also were in the CES spotlight. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) announced a pact with ride-hailing service Uber, as well as expanding ties with Volkswagen (VLKAY) and Baidu (BIDU). Nvidia, citing customer feedback, said self-driving cars will begin to be deployed on a wide scale in 2020. Uber rival Lyft also was active, disclosing partnerships. Intel said that two million vehicles from BMW, Nissan (NSANY), and VW will leverage Mobileye technology to build high-definition maps for autonomous vehicles. Intel bought Mobileye last year for about $15 billion.Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich in a CES keynote speech addressed the chip security flaw that rattled investors in early January. Krzanich framed the chip problem as an industrywide issue and said progress has been made in patching the vulnerabilities.  Meanwhile, Microsoft reported a setback in its efforts to fix the security issues. It suspended issuing patches to guard against the threats after users of PCs with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) chips complained that the software updates froze their computers.Banking giants JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) topped fourth-quarter earnings views, though Wells' revenue was below estimates. JPMorgan reported a big drop in trading revenue, including a huge loss on a single equity trade for a client. Asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) earnings rose 21%, topping views, as assets topped $6 trillion.Target (TGT), Nordstrom (JWN) and Kohl's (KSS) reported strong November-December holiday sales, following Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) in the prior week. Shares of Target, Kohl's and J.C. Penney enjoyed double-digit weekly gains while Macy's leapt nearly 10%. But Five Below (FIVE), American Eagle (AEO), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Express (EXPR) added to a string of generally weak holiday reports from specialty and apparel retailers. Long-ailing Sears Holdings (SHLD) said it'll close more than 100 additional locations as its holiday sales were weak.Wal-Mart (WMT) will raise its base wage to $11 an hour and offer a bonus of up to $1,000 for employees, as more employers hike wages following the Trump tax cuts and labor markets continue to tighten. But 63 Sam's Club locations are closing, some already, affecting thousands of workers at Wal-Mart's warehouse membership chain.U.S. crude futures rose 4.7% to $64.30 a barrel, hitting their highest levels since late 2014.  Brent futures broke above $70 for the first time since December 2014. Domestic production fell to 9.49 million barrels per day last week from 9.78 million bpd in the prior week, the The Energy Information Administration said that. Inventories fell by 4.9 million barrels, while gasoline stockpiles rose by 4.1 million barrels. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts had forecast a 3.5 million-barrel drop in crude and a 2.3 million-barrel increase in gasoline supplies. The EIA raised its 2018 global crude demand growth outlook by 100,000 barrels per day in its short-term energy outlook report.Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and sharply raised its 2018 EPS outlook, citing strong demand and business fares. Airline stocks soared on the report, with Delta moving out of a buy zone and American Airlines (AAL) breaking out.Bitcoin prices fell sharply as South Korea moved toward banning cryptocurrency trading. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end, even as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he regrets calling Bitcoin a fraud. MoneyGram (MGI) rallied, at least briefly, after announcing a pilot program to test using Ripple, another digital currency and network, to transfer funds.Commercial jet deliveries rose to 763 last year from 748 in 2016, as Boeing (BA) ramped up production of the 737 and started deliveries of its new 737 MAX. Total 737 deliveries climbed to 529 from 490 in 2016. Deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner dipped to 136 from 137. Boeing had 912 net orders for the year, valued at $134.8 billion at list prices, from 71 customers. Boeing emphasized the importance of Asia: 40% of its record 5,864 airplane backlog, about seven years of production, is for customers in the Asia-Pacific region. Boeing shares shot up to fresh record highs.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index climbed into solidly optimistic territory, hitting a 10-month high of 55.1 in January and close to the decade-high 56.3 in February 2017. Readings over 50 are positive. Among the subindexes, Americans' views of their personal financial outlook hit a 14-year high amid tax cuts and loftier stock prices. Yet views of government policies soured, as disaffection from Democrats and independents swamped Republicans' giddiness.Lennar (LEN) reported a surprise earnings decline, but only due to a shift in the timing of a transaction to take advantage of tax cuts in 2018. Revenue rose 12%, double expectations, amid a strong economy, tight supply and a fast recovery from recent hurricanes. Lennar, which is set to become the nation's largest homebuilder when its CalAtlantic acquisition closes next month, said its order backlog rose 23% to $3.6 billion. KB Home more than doubled year-ago profits to 84 cents a share as its order backlog grew 9% to $1.7 billion. Lennar and KB Home shares soared.SpaceX said that its Falcon 9 rocket ""did everything correctly"" on Sunday, when a spy satellite made by Northrop Grumman (NOC) was reportedly lost after launch. The launch had been delayed from November so SpaceX could analyze protective nose cone data from another launch. Northrop declined to comment, citing the classified nature of the Zuma mission. Higher-than-usual secrecy surrounds the Zuma satellite and little is known about it except it was made for government customer and was supposed to be launched into low Earth orbit. Meanwhile, SpaceX delayed a planned test of Falcon Heavy — the most powerful rocket since the Apollo program's Saturn V.Reports surfaced that disk drive company Seagate Technology (STX) made an early investment in a cryptocurrency called Ripple that had recently soared in value. A wave of venture capital investment is pouring into blockchain technology startups. Ripple Labs was founded in 2012 and uses the Ripple protocol to move money internationally. Seagate was interested in using it for supply-chain management.  Seagate also guided fiscal second-quarter revenue forecasts higher. Seagate shot up 19%, just clearing a buy point.Facebook (FB) announced changes to its News Feed to promote posts from friends and family more at the expense of publishers and businesses. The goal is to make social interactions more meaningful, the internet giant said, but said that ""engagement"" could fall. Facebook shares fell 4.5% Friday, dropping below a recent buy point.Celgene (CELG) will buy cancer drugmaker Impact Biomedicines for up to $7 billion, but only $1.1 billion upfront. Celgene's preliminary Q4 earnings were slightly above views. The biotech kept its recently lowered long-term outlook.Tesla (TSLA) kicked off production of its long-awaited electricity-producing shingles that Elon Musk says will transform the rooftop solar industry. Manufacturing of the textured-glass tiles began last month at Tesla's Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, N.Y.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) sees full-year EPS ""slightly above"" previously announced guidance of 98-99 cents, in addition to 15.3% in sales growth and 2.9% comps for the year. Zacks says consensus is for 99 cents EPS and 14.9% sales growth. Shares of the natural foods grocer rose nearly 5%, clearing a buy point.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is exploring strategic alternatives including a sale, Bloomberg reported citing unnamed sources. The networking and cloud solutions provider has been under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management, which owns a 6.5%, to maximize shareholder value. Shares spiked on the news, but then turned lower. Some of Akamai's biggest customers, including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), are bypassing the company with a DIY route.

250,KSS,"Target (TGT) management said it is rolling out more small-format locations and turning local stores into fulfillment centers, among other initiatives, after telling analysts at an investor presentation Tuesday that ""we're slow and have too much inventory.""And on the heels of a fourth-quarter earnings and sales miss, plus disappointing guidance, Target's stock is reaching a level it hasn't seen since 2014.Shares plummeted 12% to finish at 58.77 on the stock market today. Rival Wal-Mart (WMT), which reported last week, closed down 1.1%.Target's share price isn't the only thing reminiscent of 2014. Calling its stores ""local fulfillment centers,"" Target said that by 2019, most stores will be shipping orders from the backroom.The effort hearkens back to Macy's (M) efforts from several years ago that entailed turning each of its department store locations into mini-fulfillment centers that would ship out online orders from the nearest store.No doubt Macy's then and Target now rolled out such strategies with Amazon.com (AMZN) in mind, though Macy's efforts haven't kept profit and sales from falling for the last eight quarters. Target has the additional big-box battle of meeting Wal-Mart's digital and low-pricing initiatives head on.Among other challenges, ""WMT's price investment strategies are likely helping yield superior traffic vs. TGT,"" wrote Cowen analyst Oliver Chen in a note Tuesday, prior to the investor presentation. Wal-Mart also recently acquired Jet.com, which uses a real-time algorithm to find the best price possible for consumers.Target will ramp up its investments in a ""smart network of physical and digital assets as well as our exclusive and differentiated assortment"" that will include the debut of more than a dozen new brands over the next two years, said CEO Brian Cornell in the earnings release.""In addition, we will invest in lower gross margins to ensure we are clearly and competitively priced every day,"" he said.During its presentation, the company announced plans to invest $7 billion in capital over three years, plus $1 billion in operating profits. Its small-format store expansion will target college campuses, dense suburban areas and urban neighborhoods.For the quarter, Target logged per-share profit of $1.45 on revenue of $20.69 billion, short of estimates for $1.51 EPS on $20.7 billion. Same-store sales fell 1.5%, worse than the 1.3% drop predicted by Consensus Metrix, though comparable traffic in Q4 ticked up 0.2%. By contrast, online sales rose 34%.""Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,"" said Cornell in the statement.Target management said it would not provide explicit guidance beyond this year due to uncertainty. For Q1, it sees EPS of 80 cents to $1, below consensus views for $1.33, and full-year EPS of $3.80 to $4.20, well below consensus for $5.06.Same-store sales are expected to decline by mid-single digits for Q1 and by low-single digits for the year.IBD'S TAKE: As the 'Amazon Effect' barrels on, here's how big box retailers are faring online. It was already known that Target's holiday-period sales were not great. The company said last month that its November-December same-store sales fell more than 3%, although more-than-30% digital sales growth offset that brick-and-mortar softness.Last week, Wal-Mart reported Q4 earnings and U.S. same-store sales beat forecasts Tuesday as online sales jumped 29%, and its guidance for full-year revenue growth exceeded Wall Street estimates.Retailers are struggling to figure out how to build their e-commerce presence while stemming the bleeding of foot traffic from physical stores. Department stores like Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) have seen their shares crater so far in 2017 on the heels of weak holiday sales.Macy's stock fell 1%, and Kohl's lost 2.7%.RELATED:

251,KSS,"Dow Jones Industrial Average component Goldman Sachs (GS) was downgraded Friday, while Acacia Communications (ACIA), Kohl's (KSS), L Brands (LB) and Nordstrom (JWN) had their price targets lowered.The investment banking giant was downgraded to sell from hold at Berenberg, which said that all of Goldman's positives were already priced in the stock.Goldman shares fell 1.5% to 247.35 on the stock market today, with falling 10-year Treasury yields also weighing on the Dow stock.Acacia's price target was lowered to 100 from 125 at Needham, but did keep a buy rating, after the fiber-optic gear maker gave first-quarter earnings guidance of 63-70 cents per share, below the 78 cents analysts expected, and also offered a weak revenue outlook. But its Q4 results beat Wall Street expectations.Acacia shares plunged 14.8% to 54.04 after sinking as low as 52.60.Acacia Plummets On Weak Guidance, But Analysts Rise To DefendKohl's price target was cut to 43 from 47 at Telsey Advisory Group. Victoria's Secret parent, L Brands' price target was lowered to 51 from 62 at Mizuho and to 60 from 83 at Telsey.Telsey also cut Nordstrom's price target to 50 from 52, after the department store chain reported mixed Q4 results and gave weak earnings guidance late Thursday.Earlier Thursday, Kohl's reported quarterly earnings above analyst views but revenue was in line with expectations. On Wednesday, L Brands reported mixed Q4 results and gave weak Q1 and full-year guidance as it warned of a 20% plunge in February same-store sales at Victoria's Secret.Kohl's shares rose 5.1% Friday after falling 2.1% Thursday. L Brands rallied 4.2% after tumbling 16% on Thursday to its lowest level in nearly four years. Nordstrom shares climbed 5.7% to 46.46.Retailers struggled over the important holiday season as shoppers continued to avoid crowded malls to shop online instead. So Kohl's, Macy's (M) and others have expanded their online offerings to help compete against Amazon (AMZN).RELATED:
"
252,KSS,"The ""Amazon (AMZN) effect"" is well documented. Foot traffic at brick-and-mortar stores across America are declining as people spend their dollars online.But it's also shaping what is perhaps the new normal among department stores and other retailers as they fight for market share through a beefier online presence.At Kohl's (KSS), sales for the key holiday quarter were ""weak,"" said CEO Kevin Mansell in the company's earnings release Thursday, as brick-and-mortar traffic declined. But that softness was ""offset somewhat by strength in online demand.""Kohl's shares fell 2.1% to 40.91 in the stock market today. For the key holiday quarter, total sales fell almost 3% to $6.21 billion, missing views for $6.22 billion, as comparable store sales drooped 2.2%. Per-share profit fell 9% to $1.44, besting expectations by 11 cents. Kohl's also raised its dividend by 10% to 55 cents.Fellow department store Macy's (M) logged similar Q4 results on Tuesday, with sales and comps down but ""double-digit growth"" in its online business.Wal-Mart (WMT) on Tuesday boasted a 29% U.S. e-commerce gain as its overall 1% revenue gain came up short.Soft in store, strong online is a recurring theme. Target's (TGT) November-December comparable store sales fell 3% as digital sales popped 30%. (That discounter reports next week.)But online sales are still a fraction of traditional stores' business, so it's hard for even strong e-commerce gains to move the needle.IBD'S TAKE: In an e-commerce-driven consumer landscape, the raison d'etre of malls is waning. Some shopping arenas are calling on mayhem and drama to boost foot traffic.Reducing store count is one way to combat crummy foot traffic. Kohl's said it closed 19 locations in 2016 and opened nine small-format locations, as well as a number of outlets.Macy's is 66 stores into its 100-store closure plan. The rest will be shuttered over the next few years. That will give the department store operator a ""healthy physical portfolio"" that will complement its growing online sales, said CEO Terry Lundgren on the Macy's earnings call on Tuesday.But the kicker is: as department stores close more stores, that may only in turn weigh on their e-commerce sales.""Our customers buying online love to return in store,"" said Macy's CFO Karen Hoguet on the same call. ""They love to shop in store, buy online. So we are, I think, forever going to lose some of that Macys.com business when we close a single-store market.""Macy's shares rose 0.3% on Thursday but are continuing to find resistance at their 50-day line.Wal-Mart has taken a slightly different tack with its acquisition of smaller Amazon rival Jet.com and its push into online groceries. That helped drive its strong online sales gain as the big box retailer also gave bullish overall revenue guidance. Wal-Mart's 29% online sales gain is faster than Amazon's overall revenue growth of 22%, and that's flattered by its Amazon Web Services cloud division.""We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top three online retailers by traffic and our Wal-Mart app is among the top three apps in retail,"" said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon on the call Tuesday.Wal-Mart shares fell 0.6% on Thursday but are still up solidly for the week.Wal-Mart recently dropped its Amazon Prime membership rival and announced that it would offer free two-day shipping for minimum orders of $35. Amazon this week dropped its free shipping minimum order to $35 for non-Prime members, but deliveries will take five to eight business days.Meanwhile, faster fashion and athleisure — two other ongoing trends — appear to be on the minds of Kohl's execs going into the new fiscal year.""In 2017, we will accelerate our focus on becoming the destination for active and wellness with the launch of Under Armour (UAA) in early March,"" said Mansell. ""We will also extend our efforts on improving our speed to market across all of our proprietary brands into all apparel areas and home.""Kohl's said it expects $3.50 to $3.80 in diluted per-share earnings for fiscal 2017 and a 1.3% decline to 0.7% growth in total sales, vs Wall Street forecasts for $3.73 EPS on flattish sales.Comps are expected to range from a decline of 2% to flat sales for the year.Nordstrom (JWN) reported so-so results and guidance late Thursday. The upscale department store said Nordstrom.com sales topped $2.5 billion in 2016, more than 17% of total revenue.

Revenue fell 4% to $8.52 billion. It was the eighth straight quarter of year-over-year declines on the top and bottom line. EPS did top estimates for $1.96 but analysts had expected $8.62 billion in sales.Same-store sales fell 2.7% on an owned basis and were down 2.1% when also including licensed stores. Online sales grew at a double-digit pace, Macy's said.Macy's sees EPS for the current year of $2.90-$3.15, below consensus of $3.20. It expects sales to sink 3.2%-4.3%, in line with Wall Street forecasts. Company-owned comps are seen falling 2.2%-3.3%, with total same-store sales off 2%-3%.""We will be investing for the future in 2017. Looking at the continued challenges in the retail environment and changing consumer shopping behaviors, we know we must evolve our strategy and execute faster,"" said Lundgren in a statement.""Key to this is enhancing the customer experience in our stores where we are developing and testing concepts that feature new merchandise and entertainment options alongside enhanced technology to make shopping simpler. Additional initiatives that we believe will improve sales trends in 2017 include continued omnichannel improvements, an updated marketing strategy and a simplified pricing structure.""Macy's said its off-price Backstage brand as a store-within-a-store format is boosting productivity.

Some shopping arenas are calling on mayhem and drama to boost foot traffic.It's been quite the roller coaster for Macy's stock in recent months. Department stores got a postelection bump, but that rally was short-lived after Macy's, Kohl's and others reported disappointing holiday-period sales figures. Shares have been trading below their 50-day moving average since mid-December.Macy's shares rose in recent weeks on reports that Macy's might be looking to sell itself, according to reports. Saks Fifth Avenue parent Hudson's Bay approached Macy's about a potential acquisition, said the Wall Street Journal in early February, although real estate talks were also said to be on the table.Macy's said it would not discuss ""rumors or speculation,"" but executives did say they would ""work closely"" with its real estate team and ""get a lot done"" this year.Broadly, department stores have been in a rut, to put it gently. Amazon (AMZN) and e-commerce alternatives threaten to pressure brick-and-mortar stores even further, and retailers are stuck in a vicious cycle of heavy discounting that's tough to escape.Macy's insists that brick-and-mortar stores can thrive, with the goal of grabbing a larger of share of a declining pie.""There's enough customers in the mall,"" CEO Lundgren said on the conference call.

And home repairs are a high priority for consumers, especially in springtime.Consensus is for Home Depot to record a 17% increase in earnings per share to $1.36 on a 7.1% hike in revenue to $22.37 billion. If it meets EPS expectations it would be the 12th quarter in a row of double-digit profit growth on a year over year basis.

It has now posted a loss for three straight weeks after rallying 8% from the Feb. 11 market bottom.One investing expert described the week as disheartening.

Macy's and upscale Nordstrom slashed outlooks after sharp EPS declines. Kohl's posted a same-store sales drop that was the worst ""since the height of the Great Recession,"" according to Retail Metrics.Macy's stock fell 17% to a four-year low, and Kohl's fell nearly 14%, setting to its seven-year worst. Nordstrom, JCPenney and Dillard's lost 18.5%, 8% and 11%, respectively.Meanwhile, watchmaker and seller Fossil collapsed 31% after missing Q1 views and slashing guidance. Fossil hinted at competition from the Apple Watch and other wearables. Gap said Q1 same-store sales sank 5%, with April comps down 7% ahead of its full Q1 results on May 19. Its shares plunged nearly 19% to the worst since late 2011.Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Ross Stores (ROST) also continue the flood of retail earnings next week.The media conglomerate delivered its first earnings miss in five years as per-share profit grew 11% to $1.36 and revenue grew 4% to $12.97 billion, short of consensus. ESPN lost subscribers once again, but the media networks segment didn't appear to disappoint Wall Street too badly. Studio revenue shot up 22% on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" fanfare. ""Captain America: Civil War"" should keep movie box office receipts high in Q2.Disney shares tumbled 4.8% to 100.52, falling out of a cup-with-handle base and well out of buy range. Disney closed just above its 50-day line.Apple stock fell last week amid new evidence that Apple suppliers are seeing weak orders for the upcoming iPhone 7. That suggests Apple's sales woes may continue for quite some time. Separately, Apple will invest $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service and app. Apple stock fell 2.4% to its lowest level since June 2014 and lost its market cap crown, barely, to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Amazon intensified its rivalry with Alphabet’s Google by launching a new video streaming service comparable to YouTube. Sanford Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner on Tuesday raised his price target on Amazon to a whopping 1,000.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced its subscription service would offer two-day free delivery vs. three days before. But, as brick-and-mortar retailers struggle, Amazon rose 5.3% to 709.92, with investors betting its share of consumer spending will keep expanding.Facebook released guidelines revealing that the social media giant relies far more on people for its ""trending"" news topics, contradicting earlier company claims that they were largely driven by computer algorithms. Earlier, Gizmodo suggested that Facebook was suppressing news stories from conservative media outlets. Facebook strongly denied the allegation, saying it has “rigorous guidelines in place” for its review team, seeking to ensure consistency and neutrality.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he would meet with conservatives to discuss Facebook's policies.Facebook stock rose 0.3% to 119.81 for the week, extending a recent breakout but still in buy range.Staples (SPLS) and Office Depot (ODP) called off their proposed merger late Tuesday after a federal judge agreed with the Federal Trade Commission that the deal would have limited office supply competition with big corporate customers. Staples crashed 19%, and Office Depot dropped 40%. The Obama administration has blocked several megamergers recently, including that of Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Analysts say health insurance consolidation could get a hard look, with Aetna (AET) seeking to buy Humana (HUM), and Anthem (ANTM) set to acquire Cigna (CI).The Treasury Department on Tuesday called for greater oversight of the nascent industry, whose quick, easy online payment and lending solutions threaten to upend traditional banking but have raised questions about safeguards and potential for abuse.That came a day after Lending Club (LC) said CEO Renaud Laplanche was stepping down after the company found misconduct within the online lending platform relating to loan sales and lack of financial oversight. Several large and small banks halted work with Lending Club. Shares shed 51%, hitting a record low.Peer-to-peer lending firm Prosper recently announced a large round of layoffs, and disappointing quarterly results from OnDeck (ONDK) have prompted worries over insufficient loan-volume growth.Online gaming platform NetEase (NTES) more than doubled revenue in Q1, beating estimates, boosted by mobile games such as “Fantasy Westward Journey” and newer releases such as “Kung Fu Panda 3.” EPS also topped. Shares rose 9.3% for the week, moving above the 200-day line.Weibo (WB), a Twitter (TWTR)-like social-media platform majority owned by Sina (SINA), fared well, helped by mobile-user growth, strong ad revenue and expansion beyond major cities. Shares rose 2.1% for the week.Online media company Sina itself also topped Q1 views, with better sales and a narrower net loss than expected. The strong Weibo performance was a key help. But ad revenue from its Web portal segment lagged. Shares lost 11.2%, plunging through the 50-day line but closing just above the 200-day.Online retailer JD.com (JD) reported a Q1 loss in line with expectations. Sales surged but were just below expectations, and Q2 revenue guidance was just shy of analysts’ consensus. Shares tumbled 10.2%.LGI Homes (LGIH) on Tuesday reported a surprisingly strong 73% surge in first-quarter adjusted earnings per share. But the entry-level homebuilder's revenue fell short, and gross profit margins declined. LGI Homes, which briefly flirted with a 29.87 buy point, fell 8.9% to 25.69.Trex (TREX), the world’s largest maker of wood-alternative decking and railing products, topped Q1 views. But Trex guided Q2 revenue below consensus. Shares reversed hard, down 9.6% this week.Gypsum wallboard and related products maker Continental Building Products (CBPX) Q1 profit climbed 173%. Shares rose 7.5%, breaking out of a base to a seven-month high. TopBuild (BLD), which installs building insulation, also bested Wall Street Q1 earnings and revenue estimates. Shares of the July 2015 IPO rose 2.8% after the prior week's breakout.Several housing reports, including housing starts and existing-home sales for April, are on tap for next week.SolarCity (SCTY) torched Wall Street’s Q1 sales views late Monday, but losses swelled, and the No. 1 residential installer cut 2016 installation guidance as bookings fell short after Nevada cut net-metering payments to solar customers.Also Monday, rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) reported a 93% revenue rise that still missed views as losses widened.But No. 2 installer Sunrun (RUN) late Thursday reported a surprise Q1 profit ex items, while revenue nearly doubled.SolarCity fell 10.3% for the week, while Vivint was off nearly 8.9%, hitting record lows. Sunrun was down nearly 12%, even with Friday's 7.5% pop.Israeli giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) beat Q1 earnings and sales estimates, but it guided Q2 slightly below consensus. Teva said its $40 billion buyout of the Allergan (AGN) generics business is on track to close in June, despite some earlier delays. Teva stock rose 3 cents to 50.30 for the week.Allergan reported mixed Q1 results -- earnings beat and sales missed -- but the drugmaker said it'll buy $10 billion in stock. Allergan, fresh off a failed takeover by Pfizer (PFE), signaled it'll focus more on improving operations than on making big buyouts in the near future. Shares rose 10.8%.A third generics giant, Perrigo (PRGO), hit a four-year low after its Q1 report on Thursday, though since it issued guidance last month there were few surprises. Perrigo fell 4.4% for the week, working on its fifth straight weekly loss.Smaller player Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed estimates, but its stock rose on news of a deal with two generic drugmakers not to sell knock-offs of its lead drug Xyrem until the end of 2025.

259,KSS,"Upscale burger joint Shake Shack (SHAK), solar installer Sunrun (RUN) and Tesla (TSLA) chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) rallied on strong quarterly earnings after the close Thursday. Nordstrom (JWN) became the latest department store chain to crash on earnings and guidance that was well below expectations.Upscale apparel retailer Nordstrom reported first-quarter EPS that slid 60% to 26 cents, including 10 cents for severance costs and higher credit chargeback costs, badly missing estimates for 45 cents. Sales rose 2.5% to $3.2 billion, missing forecasts for $3.3 billion.The company slashed its full-year EPS outlook to $2.50-$2.70, well below consensus for $3.20, from $3.10-$3.35, and trimmed its sales growth view to 2.5%-4.5% from 3.5%-5.5%, while Wall Street sees 3.4% growth. Nordstrom now sees its same-store sales ranging from a 1% dip to a 1% gain, down from a prior view of 0%-2% growth.Shares crashed 18% in late trade. Nordstrom had closed down 0.4% after hitting a 4-year low intraday, after falling 7% on Wednesday.Nordstrom has spent heavily on its online presence and has had to keep apace with rivals’ aggressive discounts. As with other apparel retailers, balmier winter has also hurt sales of seasonal items.E-commerce giant Amazon (AMNZ), tepid holiday sales and insufficient discretionary spending despite lower gas prices have also hurt retailers' shares. Concerns about the space were heightened Wednesday by Macy’s (M), among the biggest retail chains, which led retailers downward after cutting its full-year outlook and reporting weak quarterly results. Kohl's (KSS) followed with a weak report Thursday, closing down 9%.Macy’s fell 0.5% Thursday while Amazon rose 0.7%, hitting another record high.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia reported Q1 EPS minus items rose 38% to 33 cents, beating by a penny. Revenue grew 14% to $1.31 billion, topping views of $1.26 billion on strong growth in all platforms including gaming, professional and auto.

Sunrun recorded 13 cents diluted earnings per share, vs. estimates for a 48 cent loss. No comps are available for the August 2015 IPO.Shares shot up 18% in extended trading after closing down 3.5% at 6.15. Rival SolarCity (SCTY) reported weak guidance earlier in the week.

260,KSS,"Ulta Beauty's (ULTA) estimate-beating results and double-digit same-store sales make it a retail outlier amid a landscape beset with weak traffic and comparable sales declines. But can it keep up this pace?When the specialty beauty retailer reports late Thursday, Wall Street expects 26% profit growth to $2.13 a share on 21.5% revenue gains to $1.54 billion.Shares fell 2.1% to 269.92 in the stock market today, moving back below a 274.09 buy point and testing its 50-day moving average for the first time in three months. The stock has been rising just above or below the entry area for the past several weeks.Other retailers — including Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Target (TGT) — have disappointed investors. Amazon.com (AMZN) looms ever larger as the reason for many retail woes.But the off-price, home improvement and specialty beauty sectors frequently get call-outs for eluding Amazon's tentacles.And one indicator of Ulta's holiday-quarter performance may come from rival Sephora, whose parent company LVMH reported results in late January.""We're optimistic on the opportunity for sustained growth at ULTA, as LVMH reported further (double-digit) growth in revenue and profit at Sephora, driven by market share gains in all regions,"" wrote Cowen analyst Oliver Chen in late January, adding that strong shopper demand for specialty beauty products ""bodes well for Ulta.""In fact, he appears to prefer it over Sephora, which only carries high-end ""prestige"" brands. Ulta carries mass brands such as Revlon (REV), Maybelline and NYX in addition to upscale products from the likes of Urban Decay Cosmetics and Nars.""While we acknowledge ULTA and Sephora overlap on some brands, we continue to like ULTA's exposure to a wider demographic with a broad spectrum of brands from mass to prestige.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding back Amazon and other e-commerce pure plays from eating into Sephora and Ulta's market share? There are several reasons why Amazon has been powerless against beauty stores. But even strong reports don't always provide Ulta shares with an immediate post-earnings boost. Its last two quarterly disclosures have been accompanied by declines before shares picked up steam again.E.l.f. Beauty (ELF) reports Q4 results Wednesday after the closing bell. The value-cosmetics brand's stock fell 2.9% to 25.92 on Tuesday. E.l.f. came public last September at 17 a share, rising as high as 32.54 on Nov. 29, but has struggled since then.RELATED:Ulta Beauty Forms New Holding Company For 'More Efficient' StructureMacy's, Costco, Kohl's And Other Retailers Are Getting SlammedE.l.f.

TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington frequently get Wall Street call-outs for thriving amid a dismal brick-and-mortar environment that has knocked about Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and other department stores, as well as many specialty apparel retailers.The bargain-hunt nature of digging through discount racks is said to give off-pricers some Amazon (AMZN) resistance; stores like Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT), by contrast, are beefing up their digital capabilities to handle the threat.TJX climbed 1.2%, hitting its best level since mid-August intraday.

Late Thursday, Nordstrom (JWN) reported mixed Q4 results and gave weak full-year earnings guidance.While Amazon (AMZN) has been threatening to eat up more market share, sending brick-and-mortar foot traffic down further, retailers now face the prospect of a tax on imports.President Trump told Reuters Thursday that he ""certainly support(s) a form of tax on the border,"" though he did not endorse the current House Republicans' plan. The primary concern over a tax on imports is that it would ultimately raise prices for shoppers.But on Friday, Trump economic aide reportedly told CEOs that the White House opposes the House GOP border tax plan.Wal-Mart stock finished 1.5% higher, with Macy's up 2.3%. Kohl's and Nordstrom climbed 5.1% and 5.7%, respectively, helped by postearnings analyst calls and comments from a White House economic adviser downplaying a House proposal for an import tax.RELATED:White House Opposes House GOP Border Tax Plan; Retailers RallyAs 'Amazon Effect' Barrels On, Here's How Big Box Retailers Are Faring OnlineMacy's Eyes 'Entertainment Options' After Profit, Sales Fall For 8th Quarter

263,KSS,"The White House on Friday denied a report that President Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn told CEOs Friday morning that the Trump administration opposes House Republicans' border adjustment tax plan.""There is no daylight between Gary Cohn and the President ... At no point during this conversation did Gary make a statement of support or opposition to the House border adjustability plan,"" reported Axiom, which also issued the original news on Cohn's comments at a private meeting of The Business Council.It's a new a layer of contradictory statements and signals from Trump and his administration on a border adjustment.  On Thursday, Trump told Reuters that he supports ""some sort"" of border tax.Before he took office, Trump panned the idea of a border tax, saying it would be too ""complicated"" and push up the dollar.Trump will have a new opportunity to clarify his position on a border tax —  or add to the confusion — in a speech before Congress Tuesday night.But a 20% border tax would raise some $1 trillion in revenue, helping to pay for a cut in the federal corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%.Chiefs at General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and four other members of the Dow Jones industrial average are among 16 CEOs who recently endorsed a House GOP plan. But fellow Dow stock Wal-Mart and many retailers are strong opposed, saying it will send prices soaring for consumers.

265,KSS,"Macy's (M) dismal first-quarter results and guidance Wednesday bolstered views of Amazon's (AMZN) unrelenting dominance, sending shares of the department store chain -- and most stocks in the retail and consumer sectors -- down.Companies ranging from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Michael Kors (KORS) to Nike (NKE) to Tiffany (TIF) to Williams-Sonoma (WSM), sold off. But Amazon stock rose 1.45%, hitting a fresh high.Macy's report followed Gap's (GPS) forecast late Monday of a 5% drop in Q1 same-store sales and weak earnings. The chain also noted a ""tepid macro environment for apparel retail.""""In light of AMZN and M's recent results, we feel more confident that AMZN will displace M as the #1 US Apparel retailer by '17,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Wednesday note, doubling down on his assessment from last year.Macy's earnings fell 29% to 40 cents a share, 4 cents above views, on a 7% revenue decline to $5.77 billion that fell short of estimates for $5.93 billion.Same-store sales -- sales at facilities open more than a year -- at both Macy's-owned outlets and licensed operators dropped 5.6%.

And how does it compare to retail rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupMacy's is still in the best position among its department store peers, said Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins, despite Macy's recent struggles, although ""Amazon is doing so many things that a retailer like a Macy's, Target (TGT), Wal-Mart . . . just aren’t able or willing to do.""Adding to the sell-off was Macy's warning on weak consumer spending. Shares of companies not in direct competition with Amazon dropped as well, including McDonald's (MCD) and Panera (PNRA).""We are seeing continued weakness in consumer spending levels for apparel and related categories,"" Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said in a statement. ""In particular, our sales trend relative to expectations meaningfully slowed beginning in mid-March, and first-quarter results are below our original outlook.""The company now sees full-year per-share profit of $3.15-$3.40, down from its previous outlook of $3.80-$3.90 and far below Wall Street estimates for $3.80 a share. It also expects 2016 same-store sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis to fall 3%-4%, vs. prior outlook for a 1% decline.""We are not counting on the consumer to spend more,"" Lundgren said, so the department store is ""working harder to give customers more reasons to buy from us by delivering outstanding style, quality and value.""For the second straight year, tourist spending is falling in the double digits, he said, and noted a slowdown in some ""center core"" categories. But he also said that the first quarter is a ""relatively small portion of the total year"" and sees a chance to play catch-up over the next three quarters.Still, Macy's isn't exactly the next Sears Holdings (SHLD), which has seen years of falling sales and store closures.""That's a leap,"" laughed Perkins, though he also said the department store's current struggles are more than just a bump in the road.But like Sears, Macy's is evaluating real-estate proposals for joint ventures or similar arrangements. Macy's has been under pressure to spin off its real estate holdings to raise cash.

270,KSS,"In Wall Street's eyes, retailers not named Amazon (AMZN) stunk in 2017, until they didn't, buoyed toward the end of the year by holiday hopes and anticipated corporate tax-cut benefits.X Now that the eggnog and bubbly have worn off and we're beginning to see which stores really felt the Christmas spirit, what can we expect from a sector challenged by a massive cultural shift in the way people shop? Does 2018 spell more doom for your neighborhood mall, or a turning point for brick-and-mortar shops?The ""retail Armageddon narrative can moderate in 2018 as better holiday season results demonstrate that a good balance of bricks & clicks can yield growth,"" wrote Baird analysts.But if Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney's (JCP) solid November-December results – but crummy stock reaction – tell us anything, it's that not everyone has faith that one good retail Christmas can translate into continued momentum through the brand new year.""It's amazing – everybody is so short-sighted,"" NPD Group retail analyst Marshal Cohen told IBD, adding that the holidays have ""nothing to do with the success of 2018. (It's) a statement into the consumer psyche at the time.""The key festive season can account for up to 30% of some retailers' revenue for the entire year, per National Retail Federation calculations. Retail Metrics says December same-store sales are up 10.3% as of Monday, better than consensus for 7.2% comps.But thanks to aggressive discounting and year-round promotions, selling a lot of goods doesn't necessarily translate to a lot of profit for stores.And that ""false read on good news"" could lead to a ""lot of bad news and challenging news come February,"" said Cohen, as shoppers close up their wallets after chucking out the tree and taking down the lights.""Nowadays, you could be so far in the hole that a good holiday is just going to basically break you even,"" he told IBD. ""And does it mean good momentum going into the next? No. You're as good as your last sale was.""Expect more consolidation and store closures. In fact, commercial real estate services giant Cushman & Wakefield estimates more than 11,000 closures this year, a jump from last year's 9,000 shuttered storefronts.So far in 2018, Macy's has already named 11 more of the 100 stores it's in the process of closing. And Sears Holding (SHLD) on Thursday announced a deathblow to over 100 Kmart and Sears stores, as the storied department store chain, once the nation's largest retailer, continues to cling on for life.But closing a few doors isn't a bad thing, per se, in this ""over-stored"" America filled with dead malls and an abundance of shops and half-hearted foot traffic. Savvy brick-and-mortar retailers are instead beefing up their digital side in order to take on Amazon, as well as each other.""The market shouldn't ignore all traditional retailers and fawn all over Amazon and other digitally native companies,"" wrote Jefferies retail analyst Randal Konik in a Tuesday report. He said that brick-and-mortar stores' efforts to shutter stores and improve their e-commerce operations ""should lead to profit margin stabilization and improving (free cash flow) over the next 12 months.""Even department stores, despite all the murmurs about the death of the mall, should be fine.Konik sees potential headwinds for Macy's and J.C. Penney this year, ""given the success click-to-brick players have had in apparel/accessories,"" but also highlighted the steps department stores have taken to adapt, such as Kohl's (KSS) partnership with Amazon.""We keep waiting for the shoe to drop on a couple of retailers, the J.C. Penneys and the Sears,"" Cohen said. ""But you know, again, if they can make it through '15 and '16, they can certainly make it through '17.""But there's a lot of debt coming due in the next two to three years, Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins told IBD in December. It's ""hard to imagine a retailer being able to grow their business enough to grow a cash flow strong enough to pay off high debt levels.""Who's most likely to run into trouble this year? Mid-size specialty chains, predicts Cohen.Wal-Mart (WMT) gets its fair share of kudos for focusing on its digital operations, starting with the acquisition of Jet.com in 2016 and continuing with the pickup of a handful of online players such as ModCloth, Bonobos, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy last year. That, combined with its forward-looking tests – in-fridge delivery, anyone? – and competitive measures have given it decent Street cred against Amazon.Off-price retailers such as TJX (TJX) should do well, say experts, who mostly still have faith in the ""treasure hunt"" vibe that stores like Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington Stores (BURL) emanate. In the clothing space, few things appear more Amazon-proof to research firm Cowen than a bargain bin filled with the promise of discounted brand names.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen hails T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX as his ""best idea"" for the year, and believes off-pricers as a whole will continue to grab market share from department stores and other full-price peers. He holds an outperform rating and recently increased price target of 88 on TJX.""In a challenging retail environment where most retailers are seeing traffic declines, off-price is driving traffic gains,"" wrote Jefferies' Konik, who has a hold rating on TJX and Ross Stores. ""This has led to strong, consistent comparable sales performance and well-controlled inventories in the channel, as their wide and shallow inventories rapidly turn to give shoppers something new and fresh to discover with every visit.""But Konik offers a word of caution. He sees an ""imminent"" threat in Amazon, and says off-price retailers' lack of a proper online presence – irregular inventory and e-commerce listings don't exactly go hand in hand – ""will eventually take a toll.""Smart-speaker/AI technology could be the next big thing to upend regular old commerce.Research firm Magid says voice-enabled commerce and artificial intelligence tools have ""the potential to disrupt and disintermediate retail and manufacturing.""That may leave retailers out in the cold if manufacturers go directly to consumers. In fact, packaged goods companies ""will either merge or forward integrate and acquire retail, as they realize a voice-controlled world is really, really bad for them,"" predicted L2's Scott Galloway in late December.Cowen's Chen believes voice recognition, which should reach 25%-30% penetration, will be the next mobile phone. ""Retailers will need to interject themselves into the smart and connected home and find ways to make their brands relevant to frequent audio interaction despite the challenges of lack of visual cues,"" he said in a Dec. 26 note to clients.Chen also predicts that ""previously unlikely consolidation will occur,"" and that Wal-Mart and Target (TGT) ""will undergo a cycle of M&A in order to develop customer capabilities similar to AMZN.""Loup Ventures even believes Amazon will acquire Target, calling it the ""ideal offline partner for Amazon"" because of its ""shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.""Analysts tend to have mixed emotions about Target, pegging it either as a distant third wheel in the Amazon-Wal-Mart war, or a contender making some smart moves. NPD's Cohen falls into the latter camp, highlighting Target's recent acquisition of same-day delivery company Shipt, its holiday performance and private-label successes in apparel.""I think Target is going to be a huge winner,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How Private Labels Could Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash CowRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAmazon Holds Prime Position With Record 60 Million Subscribers

273,KSS,"J.C. Penney (JCP) reported third-quarter results Friday that easily topped estimates, following quarterly figures from Nordstrom (JWN), Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) the day before.Estimates: Per-share losses to deepen to 43 cents from 21 cents a year ago, as revenue slips 3.4% to $2.76 billion. J.C. Penney has said it expects Q3 same-store sales growth of 0.6%-0.8%, while Consensus Metrix sees a 0.7% gain.Results: A per-share loss of 33 cents on revenue of $2.81 billion. Same-store sales rose 1.7%. Home, Sephora, footwear and handbags, women's specialty and salon were the top-performing divisions.Outlook: Full-year EPS still seen at 2 to 8 cents with same-store sales down 1% to flat.""During the third quarter, we took aggressive actions to clear slow-moving inventory, primarily allowing for an improved apparel assortment heading in to the holiday season,"" said Chairman and CEO Marvin Ellison in a statement.""While these actions had a negative short-term impact on profitability in the third quarter, we firmly believe it was the right decision for the company as we transition into the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018.""Stock: Shares jumped 15.3% to 3.17 on the stock market today, after hitting a record-low 2.35 earlier this week.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon's moving in on retailers' turf, in more ways than one. The e-commerce giant's private label lines are giving clothing stores a run for their money. Last month, J.C. Penney slashed its full-year EPS outlook to 2-8 cents from 40-65 cents, with comp sales being down 1% to flat vs. a prior view of down 1% to up 1%.Late Thursday, Nordstrom beat earnings and revenue estimates, but missed on same-store sales and trimmed the high end of its full-year EPS view.Nordstrom erased intraday losses Friday to close unchanged after rallying 4.5% on Thursday.Early Thursday, Macy's and Kohl's turned in mixed quarterly results, but their shares rallied as Macy's remained upbeat on the upcoming holiday season.

"
278,KSS,"Black Friday. Cyber Monday. Super Saturday. The annual retail running of the bulls is a treacherous terrain of sharpened elbows and trigger-happy mouse clicks for shoppers trying to get the best deal possible.The stakes are even higher for the stores themselves: The National Retail Federation has said that sales in November and December can account for anywhere from 20%-40% of a retailer's yearly sales. Perhaps fortunately for department stores like Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and others, there's nowhere to go but up this Christmas.""Given the fact that last year was so horrible, the comps are easy,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar.As weather, inventory issues, heavy discounting and e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) weighed, Macy's reported a 4.7% same-store sales decline in November and December of last year. Kohl's Q4 2015 comps edged up a mere 0.4%. Overall, last year's holiday retail sales disappointed with only 3% growth, said the NRF, less than expected.Holiday 2016 should prove to be a little less dire. The NRF predicts a 3.6% retail gain in November and December to $655.8 billion; online sales are seen rising 7%-10% to $117 billion. And retailers are feeling bullish. Target (TGT), Macy's and Nordstrom (JWN) all raised guidance going into the all-important shopping season.Predictably, online sales continue to eat into brick-and-mortar market share. Traditional stores are again gearing up to do battle with Amazon and friends.Wal-Mart (WMT) is pushing up its ""Cyber Week"" deals from Monday to Friday so that they start essentially the minute Thanksgiving Day is over. Target's ""10 Days of Deals,"" which include both in-store and online promotions, already started on Saturday.""If you look at the companies that reported earnings, it's e-commerce that's driving a significant amount of the growth,"" said Weishaar. ""What's unique in it is mobile is becoming a higher penetration of the digital section, so that would be something new. I don't think a lot of the companies have figured out how to convert the sales on mobile.""Shopping via smartphone is the next frontier. Thanksgiving Day and Christmas are projected to be the biggest mobile-shopping days of the year, said Adobe.One consequence of a ramp-up in retail digital wars, however, is that fewer people head into brick-and-mortar shops.Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins says the industry could see a ""significant slowdown"" in Black Friday foot traffic.Traffic fell in the mid-single to high-single-digits on Black Friday 2015, and retailers could see an equal or even greater decline this time around, he said, particularly as other shopping events during the year dilute the impact of the post-Thanksgiving sales day.Besides Cyber Monday and Super Saturday, the menu of existing shopping holidays has grown to include Amazon's Prime Day and even China-based Singles Day, among others.Foursquare's data are a little more optimistic; the company predicts a 3.5% year-over-year slide in Black Friday foot traffic, which would be ""far less severe"" than the prior year's figures.""The importance of Black Friday from a traffic (perspective) to brick-and-mortar stores is going to continue to decelerate,"" said Weishaar. ""With more people shopping online, the one specific day becomes less important.""IBD'S TAKE: Adobe data indicate that Black Friday sales will be the ""biggest ever,"" growing 11.3% from last year to $3.05 billion in sales. For a look at what else is happening this week, check out IBD's Investing Action Plan. Broadly speaking, inventory levels are cleaner in Q4, which translates to more targeted, strategic discounting instead of promotional wars, said Weishaar. But even in the absence of ""everything must go""-type sales, that doesn't mean that consumers shouldn't expect to see a whole lot of deals floating around.Which retail names will be winners this year?Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel pointed out in a recent note that execs at various retailers have alluded to a challenging, promotional holiday season. But there are gems to be found.""Although the election triggered a surprising sense of hope (and short squeezes), we believe much uncertainty remains and would rather buy quality companies that have lagged,"" he wrote, calling out Ulta Beauty (ULTA) as his top pick and noting that the recent Lululemon Athletica (LULU), HBI and Kate Spade (KATE) sell-offs look ""interesting.""Still shining is the off-price sector, as consumers remain hesitant about paying full retail for products and stores have a tough time escaping the ""always-on-sale"" cycle. Athletic wear also continues to dominate street fashion.Nike (NKE), TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) remain Siegel's long-term choices.Holiday shoppers, unconcerned about the fate of retail stores, will continue to like what they like.Millennials, who favor experiences over tangible goods, may not be retailers' favorite customers. But PwC research found that the teen set, Generation Z, likes ""stuff — and shopping in stores.""""To them, stuff matters,"" said the report.

282,KSS,"Retail sales rose 0.8% in October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday morning, providing fresh evidence of consumer strength. Retail stocks have rebounded after the election and heading into the holiday season, though many pulled back Tuesday.Sales also rose 0.8% excluding autos and 0.6% excluding autos and gasoline.Economists had expected retail sales to rise 0.6% with sales up 0.5% ex autos and 0.3% excluding autos and gasoline.Meanwhile, September figures were revised up, with total sales now up 1% vs. 0.6% initially. Ex auto sales were revised up two-tenths to 0.7%, whith ex auto and gas sales revised up two-tenths to 0.5%.Auto dealers, grocery stores, restaurants, apparel chains reported solid gains, with gas station sales jumping on higher fuel prices.Year over year, retail sales rose 4.3%, the best since November 2014.The recent gains in retail sales are a good sign for the U.S. economy and holiday shopping. And it comes amid big gains in retail stocks, though several notable retailers fell after reporting earnings Tuesday morning.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Home Depot (HD) and TJX (TJX) reported earnings before Tuesday's open. Home Depot and TJX topped views and raised their outlooks but fell nearly 2% in morning trade on the stock market today. TJX edged higher. Dick's Sporting Goods tumbled 7% on weak holiday guidance.Home Depot and TJX found resistance at the 200-day moving average on Monday, reversing to close down nearly 2%. Dick's nearly broke out of a base Monday, but that doesn't seem likely Tuesday.Department store sales fell once again in the retail sales report, but the department store stocks are rebounding from downtrends. Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) reported strong results, Macy's (M) missed but raised full-year guidance while JCPenney (JCP) gave generally weak results. But all four enjoyed double-digit gains last week, and continued to climb Monday. They pulled back on Tuesday, retreating 1%-3% in morning trade.E-commerce and other nonstore sales jumped 1.5% in October, the best gain since May. The sector has been a big retail leader for years. But Amazon (AMZN) shares have been selling off hard since reporting weaker-than-expected profit growth on Oct. 27. Amazon profit tripled (up 206%), but fell well short of views. Amazon also gave cautious holiday guidance.Amazon stock fell 2.7% Monday, approaching its 200-day line. But Amazon rose 2.6% before Tuesday's opening bell.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump's surprise presidential win has boosted blue chips and small caps.

It does not appear to be a blowout year for gadgets. Apple (AAPL) has the iPhone 7 and other new products. But Apple missed sales estimates in the latest quarter and gave a conservative outlook, even with Samsung reeling from its Note 7 overheating fiasco.Fitbit (FIT) issued a dismal holiday sales forecast, though the wearables maker may face tougher competition from the Apple Watch 2.

283,KSS,"Under Armour (UA) reported a solid third-quarter earnings and sales beat, but that was overshadowed Tuesday morning by lowered growth projections, despite management's bullish assurances that it has the long-term game in mind.""While we expect to continue to significantly outpace the apparel industry, the growth rate going forward will be less than expected than investor day in 2015,"" said Under Armour CFO Chip Molloy in prepared remarks, outlining plans to ""invest more heavily in areas that we can grow faster,"" such as footwear, international and direct-to-consumer as it ""aggressively"" enters the sports lifestyle and sport fashion categories.""We could choose to optimize for more near-term profits but we believe it is more prudent to invest to maintain superior growth rates while gaining both share and scale,"" he said.At last year's investor day meeting, management planned for operating income of $800 million by 2018, a 23% compound annual growth rate.While it upheld broader revenue goals of $7.5 billion by 2018, Molloy said the company sees annual operating income growth ""in the midteens in each of the next two years as we focus on investing to get big fast.""Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, sounding agitated at times during the earnings call, repeatedly hammered home the point that his growth plans required more investment dollars in the short term.""We're not saying we're losing money,"" he said, ""we're moving and marching forward.""But investors fled, with shares nose-diving 13% to close at 32.89 on the stock market today. Under Armour has been under its 200-day moving average for most of the last 11 months.Meanwhile, Nike (NKE) shares finished 1.6% lower.Plank also laid out three key areas for Under Armour: ""getting big fast, making retail a core competency, and getting more shoes on feet.""Funding growing markets abroad might require additional investments in the near future, but they are ""central"" to the goal of market leadership, he told analysts on the call.Under Armour's footwear and international segments are performing better than the management expected, but the lost revenue from the recent sporting goods retailer bankruptcies — such as Sports Authority and Sports Chalet — weighed on the quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Adidas first made inroads with the runway set, then came back with a vengeance for the retro-loving, sneaker-wearing masses. Now it's poised to get the spotlight this holiday season: ""Uh-Oh, Nike, Under Armour — Adidas Is 'It' Brand This Christmas."" Other costs are in play. Sponsorship partnerships are now 10- to 15-year deals, up from 5-year agreements, he said, citing the 15-year UCLA partnership.Plank said he is ""looking honestly at this moment in time and saying it is time for us to invest.""CFO Molloy said that as the company approaches the $10 billion revenue mark and gains scale, it should see gross margin improvement and be able to leverage its investments in IT systems, distribution and other areas.In the short term, however, gross margin should be ""flat"" over the next couple of years, Molloy told analysts.Before the call, at least one analyst didn't seem fazed.""While this is clearly below our expectations, we believe the sell-off in the stock is overdone and would be buyers on weakness,"" wrote Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy early Tuesday.The company's quarter, by numbers, below:Estimates: Profit growth of 9% to 25 cents a share on 21% sales gains to $1.46 billion.Results: Earnings rose 23% to 29 cents a share as sales climbed 22% to $1.47 billion. But gross margins fell to 47.5% from 48.8% a year earlier ""reflecting negative impacts from the timing of liquidation, increased promotions, and foreign exchange rates.""Outlook: Q4 revenue growth of 20%, below consensus views for 22.2% growth. Management sees 2016 gross margin shrinking by 0.80 percentage points and slowing growth in the North American apparel business.Bonus detail: On Monday, Under Armour rolled out plans to launch the Curry 3 next week. The sneakers will retail at $140, slightly pricier than previous iterations. And if there are concerns about Kevin Durant nicking some of Steph Curry's Golden State glow — and Curry shoe sales — don't be worried, say R.W. Baird analysts on Monday.""Durant joining Golden State likely will help to elevate Curry's national presence, and the enhancements to the Curry 3 should strengthen broader confidence in near-term footwear projections ... and the longer-term opportunity,"" wrote Baird's Jonathan Komp.Here's a peek at the new shoe:

285,KSS,"Donald Trump's unexpected presidential win shook up global markets, triggering a major sector rotation. Alibaba (BABA) reported solid sales for Singles Day. Walt Disney sees better growth, but not until 2018, while most department stores generally see a positive holiday season while Nvidia (NVDA) led strong chip results.Stock futures crashed Tuesday night as Donald Trump won the presidential election, but rallied Wednesday as investors saw upside to his tax and infrastructure plans. Investors rushed into banks, drugs, materials-related stocks and out of big-name techs such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), as well as defensive consumer staples and gunmakers. The Dow soared 5.4% for the week, its best since December 2011, hitting a record high Thursday. The S&P 500 jumped 3.8%, its best week in two years, rebounding above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq also rose 3.8% but ended the week below its 50-day. Gold prices initially jumped on Trump's win but crashed  as stocks rallied, Treasury yields skyrocketed and Fed rate-hike expectations firmed. Copper prices boomed. Nvidia and Priceline (PCLN) were among leading stocks reporting strong results.Top chip companies Nvidia, Microchip Technology (MCHP), MaxLinear (MXL) and Microsemi (MSCC) saw their stocks rise after posting better-than-expected quarterly results. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia earned 84 cents a share, up 91% year over year, on sales of $2 billion, up 54%. Wall Street expected 57 cents and $1.69 billion. Nvidia also raised its Q4 sales target above views. Microchip EPS rose 42% and sales 56%. MaxLinear also topped views, though guidance was weak due to legacy-product declines. Nvidia shares skyrocketed 30% on Friday to a new high. For the week so far, Microchip rose 4.8%, MaxLinear 12% and Microsemi 9.7%.Walt Disney (DIS) missed fiscal Q4 estimates and warned that 2017 would be ""an anomaly"" in its growth arc, with the box-office-melting success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" making for a tough year-over-year comparison. But investors may already be looking to fiscal 2018, when Disney will release four Marvel movies and two more ""Star Wars"" films. Disney also said that the factors that have caused ESPN to lose subscribers ""have abated,"" and that the sports network would likely continue to grow as ESPN adapts to more digital platforms. Disney shares rose nearly 6% for the week so far.Macy's (M) missed Q3 estimates but cited strong results from Apple and Michael Kors (KORS) products that should continue in the current holiday quarter. (But luxury apparel maker Kors itself warned on its holiday sales). Macy's raised its full-year same-store sales forecast. Kohl's (KSS) reported Q3 EPS and revenue above expectations, with strong back-to-school and October sales that should continue into the holiday season. Nordstrom (JWN) crushed EPS growth estimates. The upscale department store operator raised its full year EPS guidance to $2.85-$2.95, well above Wall Street estimates. However, J.C. Penney (JCP) sales missed expectations and cut its sales forecast.But shares of all four retailers enjoyed double-digit percentage gains for the week.Priceline reported Q3 earnings and revenue that topped estimates, sending its shares to an all-time high. Priceline also said interim CEO Brett Keller is taking over as permanent chief executive, effective immediately. TripAdvisor (TRIP), a Priceline rival, reported weaker-than-expected Q3 revenue, sending shares falling.E-commerce giant Alibaba Group processed $17.8 billion worth of sales on China's biggest online shopping day of the year, known as Singles Day. That busted last year's record of $14.3 billion. But growth slowed to 24% from 60% last year. Alibaba takes a small percentage of sales for managing the transaction for vendors. Alibaba shares fell 1.4% Friday, extending a slide since late September.The Singles Day event towers over the U.S. shopping events known as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Black Friday last year had total sales of $4.5 billion, and Cyber Monday had $3 billion.Chinese online game maker and portal NetEase (NTES) earned $3.42 per U.S. share excluding items in the third quarter, up 47%. Sales rose 38% to $1.38 billion in Q3. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected NetEase to earn $2.89 per share excluding items on sales of $1.43 billion. Online games accounted for 71% of revenue. NetEase tumbled 3.6% for the week afternoon, falling significantly below its 50-day line for the first time since April.Gold prices skyrocketed Tuesday night as stock futures and the dollar initially tumbled on fears that a Trump win would spur massive selling and put the Fed on ice. But with stocks actually faring well and bond yields spiking, gold prices quickly reversed for a weekly loss of more than 6%, the worst since 2013. Gold mining stocks that retook some key technical levels went back down. Newmont Mining (NEM) fell 16%, Barrick Gold (ABX) 19%. Meanwhile, industrial miners rallied as Trump infrastructure plans lifted copper, other industrial metals and materials.China-based Momo (MOMO) reported Q3 earnings that beat estimates, which the company credited to its success with live video. The provider of a video streaming website and mobile social platform said revenue surged 319% to $157 million, soaring past estimates of $130.5 million. Momo sees Q4 revenue of $185 million-$190 million, above forecasts for $140.2 million.But Momo's stock, which initially rose to a new high, reversed sharply lower to trade down more than 8%.Acacia Communications (ACIA) late Thursday reported Q3 earnings minus items that rose 240% to $1.01, as revenue jumped 107% to $135.3 million. Analysts had modeled non-GAAP EPS of 81 cents and revenue of $130.8 million after Acacia revised guidance twice during the quarter. The maker of high-speed optical devices for communications networks sees adjusted EPS of 85-92 cents vs. views of 78 cents. But revenue of $138.5 million at the midpoint of its guidance is just above the consensus for $137.2 million. Acacia fell 1% Friday but rose 12.8% for the week.Fabrinet (FN) late Monday said fiscal Q1 EPS leapt 78% to 80 cents while revenue was up 53% to $332 million, its fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Both easily beat analyst estimates. Fabrinet also gave upbeat EPS and sales guidance for the current Q2. Fabrinet shares rose 8.9% for the week.Oil prices initially rose but closed down 1.5% to $43.41 a barrel — the third straight weekly slide — amid concerns about rising supply and weak demand. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has called for less regulation and more drilling for the U.S. industry, which could ultimately boost supply further. Weekly U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.43 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, an increase that was above analyst expectations. OPEC said its October production hit a record high, adding doubts that it will finalize and implement a production-cut agreement. The International Energy Agency warned that sluggish economic growth will continue to weigh on oil demand, and ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capital spending for next year.

286,KSS,"Stocks were mixed in early afternoon trade Thursday as the Dow hit a new high, but the Nasdaq reversed sharply lower, hurt by Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9%, the S&P 500 was mostly flat and the Nasdaq tumbled 1.2%. Volume was tracking slightly higher on the NYSE and Nasdaq in the stock market today vs. the same time Wednesday.The Nasdaq was weighed down by weakness in NetEase (NTES), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), which showed losses anywhere from 4% to 9%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, sank more than 3% in heavy trade, nearing a test of its 200-day moving average. Shares are now 10% off their 52-week high and 5% below the 50-day line. Baird in a Wednesday note cited a potential negative impact on the iPhone maker due to ""meaningful changes in global trade policies"" under a Trump presidency. Microsoft (MSFT) fell nearly 3%, briefly undercutting its 50-day line. Shares slipped below a 58.80 flat-base buy point.Steel, department stores and other retailers were among the biggest gainers, while gold miners, solar and internet stocks saw big losses. Department stores got a boost from Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS), which popped 8% and 13%, respectively, following their quarterly earnings reports. Kohl's shares broke out past a 46.79 flat-base buy point in huge trade.Pfizer (PFE) scored the biggest gain on the Dow as the drugmaker added 4% to Wednesday's 7% jump. The stock reclaimed its downward-pointing 50-day line for the first time in three months.IBM (IBM) gapped up and rose 3% to a six-week high in fast turnover.

Weekly rig-count data is due out from Baker Hughes (BHI).Meanwhile, several top stocks are trying to break out or hold buy points amid significant sector rotation following Tuesday's presidential election.Microsoft (MSFT) closed down 2.4% at 58.70 dipping below buy range from a 58.80 flat-base entry in August but still performing better than some of the other big tech players. Microsoft fell as low as 57.63 intraday Thursday, below its pivot point and its 50-day moving average.Papa John's (PZZA) fell 0.6% to 81.27 as its morning breakout attempt met resistance. Shares hit 83.10 intraday, briefly clearing an 82.64 buy point of a flat base begun in September.Data-security software provider Proofpoint (PFPT) also is trying to break out. It rose to 82.96 early then reversed to end down 0.7% at 79.01.Proofpoint has formed a cup-with-handle base with a 79.88 buy point.Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) gapped 4.2% lower to 46.97, still just above a 46.88 buy point. The stock broke out last week following the video-game developer's earnings report.Analysts expect the department-store giant to post a per-share loss of 21 cents, an improvement from the 47-cent per-share loss seen a year ago. Overall sales are seen rising 2% to $2.951 billion.Shares bolted 5.4% higher in the stock market today, but found resistance intraday at their 50-day and 200-day averages. Those key support lines crisscrossed over the past year and did so again this week.JCPenney's results will come as shopping-mall mainstays like Sears (SHLD) and Macy's close stores and cut jobs amid a migration to e-commerce. JCPenney hasn't been immune to that trend, but it has tried to put more effort toward better customer service and new items on its shelves as its rivals struggle.Before Thursday's market open, Macy's reported weaker-than-expected earnings while Kohl's topped views. After the market close, Nordstrom reported a surprise increase in quarterly earnings and sales that also topped views, while lifting its earnings outlook above consensus as well.Shares surged 6.5% late and pushed Macy's, Kohl's and JCPenney higher after hours too.Baker Hughes will report weekly U.S. rig count data. More rigs have come back online in recent months as oil prices have rebounded from longtime lows earlier this year.

288,KSS,"Under Armour (UA) is no longer a smart-alecky young upstart but a well-known contender in athletic apparel, talked about in the same breath as Nike (NKE) and settled in the good graces of American teenagers.Yet sales threaten to slow, if Street estimates are correct, when Under Armour reports early Tuesday.Earnings are expected to rise 9% to 25 cents a share. Sales should grow 21% to $1.46 billion, which would mark both a sequential and year-over-year revenue deceleration.Under Armour shares closed down 0.1% at 37.90 on the stock market today. The stock has been trading sideways for the last month or so, remaining below their key 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Its peers haven't been doing much better. Nike stock rose 0.2%, but has been steadily sliding further below its two key averages since early September.Still, a solid swath of Wall Street has a positive view of Under Armour, with outperform, overweight, positive or buy ratings from the likes of Baird, Cowen, Piper Jaffray, Susquehanna and Mizuho Securities.The Sports Authority and Sports Chalet bankruptcies are in the rearview mirror, and Kohl's (KSS) will start carrying Under Armour merchandise nationwide in early 2017, which Cowen analysts see benefiting the brand by $400 million to $700 million in annual wholesale volume.Other positives from Q3 likely include: solid exposure at the Rio Olympics, back-to-school shopping season and Stephen Curry's Under Armour-branded tour of China as the company aggressively expands its reach in international markets.And Piper Jaffray's latest teen survey indicate that while Adidas might be the hot brand of the holidays, Under Armour is edging up in the rankings.However, Morgan Stanley remains typically bearish on the stock with an underweight rating, citing faster-than-anticipated brand maturation and valuation concerns.IBD's TAKE: Adidas first made inroads with the runway set, then came back with a vengeance for the retro-loving, sneaker-wearing masses. Now it's poised to get the spotlight this holiday season: ""Uh-Oh, Nike, Under Armour — Adidas Is 'It' Brand This Christmas."" Analyst Jay Sole said the bank's research suggests that Under Armour stores have produced same-store sales declines in two of the last three quarters.""Plus, our reads indicate sales in the premium channels not covered by industry data sources such as Foot Locker, Finish Line and Dick's Sporting Goods are average at best,"" he said.Foot Locker (FL) shares ended 1.4% higher Monday.

289,KSS,"Here's your weekly Investing Action Plan: what you need to know as an investor for the coming week.Markets around the world will look to the results of the U.S. presidential race, which has tightened in the past week. Earnings season slows down but highly rated stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), NetEase (NTES) and Acacia Communications (ACIA) will report, along with Walt Disney (DIS) and department store chains. Also keep an eye on shares of Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB).Political scores will finally be settled on Tuesday, when Americans vote. Stock indexes in the U.S. and elsewhere sold off over the past week as poll numbers showed Hillary Clinton's once-comfortable lead over Donald Trump shrinking or even disappearing. The S&P 500 dropped for eight consecutive sessions, marking its longest losing streak since the financial crisis in 2008.Some analysts believe that the possibility of a Trump victory still isn't fully priced into markets, suggesting a further dive if he wins Tuesday night. Results of House and Senate races will also determine how much gridlock the next president could face. But close calls in key battleground states may add another wrinkle, if any recounts delay a final result for the presidential contest.With the market uptrend under pressure and distribution days piling up, growth stocks presenting actionable buying opportunities have been few and far between. But three names — VMWare (VMW), T-Mobile (TMUS) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) — are trading in or near buy range.IBD 50 member VMWare, a provider of corporate data center software, jumped past a 77.09 buy point from a flat base after issuing an estimate-beating quarterly report on Oct. 26. The stock dipped below buy range Friday but is just 0.3% away from it.T-Mobile also cleared a buy point on its better-than-expected earnings Oct. 24. The stock gapped up 9.5% that day and has since pulled back within buy range from a flat base with a 48.21 buy point.Take-Two Interactive on Thursday popped into buy range from a flat base with a 46.88 pivot with a nearly 8% gain, as adjusted EPS surged 50% to top views late Wednesday. The video game publisher is now 3% above the buy point, with a stock's buy range extending 5% past a buy point.Meanwhile, tech giants Facebook and Apple have been trading lower since issuing their quarterly earnings reports.Facebook triggered sell signals after plunging well below its 132.08 and 128.43 buy points. The stock is 9.6% below its all-time high reached Oct. 25. And after breaching its 50-day line, the social media leader is now looking for support at the 200-day line.Apple hit its lowest level since mid-September on Friday after breaking below the 50-day line several sessions prior. With a loss of 4.3% for the week, the iPhone maker's shares are now below a 110.33 buy point initially cleared several weeks ago.RELATED:Facebook, Alphabet Fall Below Recent Buy PointsCloud Deals Drive Top Software Stock To HighsThe graphics chipmaker is expected to post its sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating sales growth when it reports Q3 earnings on Thursday. Analysts expect the company to earn 57 cents a share, up 30%, on sales of $1.69 billion, up 29%. But revenue growth should slow down to 20% in Q4. Nvidia is best known for graphics cards used in PCs and video game consoles, but it has charged into hot growth markets such as self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.

Analysts expect the fiber-optics components maker to post EPS ex items of 81 cents, up from 26 cents in the year-earlier quarter, while sales double to $130.85 million. But shares of the once-hot IPO are in a downtrend since it announced, and completed, a secondary stock offering in early October. Fabrinet (FN), also part of the fiber-optic boom, reports Monday after the close.

After trading largely sideways for most of the year, Momo shares broke out in August and are now more than 50% extended past a buy point, though they recently lost support at their 50-day average. Still, the IBD 50 stock is among the top-ranked companies in IBD's Internet-Content group.Online travel website Priceline (PCLN) reports late Monday, and analysts see EPS rising 16% to $29.32, with revenue expected to climb 17% to $3.62 billion. TripAdvisor (TRIP) reports early Wednesday, and EPS is seen flat at 53 cents, on 5% revenue growth to $436 million. Hurricane Matthew and the strong dollar may weigh on results. Late last month, rival Expedia (EXPE) reported earnings that fell short of forecasts, though revenue topped.RELATED:What To Expect When Priceline Reports Q3 EarningsThe media and entertainment giant, which reports fiscal Q4 late Thursday, is expected to log EPS of $1.16, a 3% year-over-year decline, on flattish revenue of $13.52 billion. Despite the success of ""Finding Dory,"" the quarter lacks the string of blockbusters that fiscal Q3 enjoyed, though home video sales will benefit. The theme parks business will likely see a bounce from the June opening of Disney's Shanghai resort. Still, subscriber losses at ESPN and other cable channels remain a sore point.Comparisons in the current quarter will get more difficult as results come up against year-ago results from the megahit ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" which is unlikely to be topped by the December release of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.""Management's conference call with analysts may also shed some light on Disney's streaming strategy as AT&T's (T) $84.5 billion deal for Time Warner (TWX) is the latest sign of the tech and media sectors converging.RELATED:Hulu Live Service Gets Fox And Disney, Waiting On CBS, NBCU Disney-Netflix Deal?

291,KSS,"Run DMC's sneaker-themed hit came out 30 years ago, but 2016's teens are all about ""My adidas"": Piper Jaffray's semiannual teen survey points to the iconic Three Stripes — not Nike (NKE) or Under Armour (UA) — being the ""It"" brand this holiday season.The firm, which initiated adidas at an overweight, with a 173 euro ($190) price target, said that the brand is in a good spot to take advantage of the ongoing athletic trend. Adidas trades on the Frankfurt exchange.""For the last several years, Nike has dominated the athletic brand space from a share and growth perspective,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy on the heels of the firm's semiannual survey of teens. ""This year, we believe brands like adidas are clawing back share. We expect healthy competition between the major brands to fuel further innovation in the category.""The results suggest adidas is the ""It"" brand this holiday, she said.Adidas' popularity with the fashion crowd in recent years appears to be trickling down to mall shoppers, as shoes like the Superstar and Stan Smith — in all their retro goodness — make a comeback. The company has pumped up its outlook no less than four times this year.Once considered something of a fading star in the U.S., adidas burst through to the top 10 list for both young men and women who were asked about the most popular brands in school, according to the survey.It is now the No. 4 preferred footwear brand among upper-income teens, up from the No. 7 spot last year, and is gaining share among upper-income young women.Meanwhile, Under Armour received an upgrade to overweight from the firm. Under Armour shares are ""poised for re-accelerated global growth,"" wrote Murphy in a separate note following the survey, citing an uptrend in athletic shoes, improved traction in womenswear, accelerating growth abroad and Kohl's (KSS) introduction of the label to its stores.IBD'S TAKE: What else are the young excited about? Apple and Fitbit, says the survey. The GoPro? Not so much: ""Teens Stoked About iPhone 7 But GoPro Is So Yesterday.""The Baltimore-based brand, endorsed by NBA star Steph Curry, has been ""taking shelf space in markets like the UK and Germany, and brand awareness continues to rise."" And Curry's recent tour of China went over well, said the Piper Jaffray analyst, who expects more solid quarterly results from the company's China segment.Under Armour hit No. 7 — its highest spot ever in the poll — on the list of preferred footwear brands for upper- and average-income male teens.Under Armour shares rose 0.8% to 38.49 in the stock market today. Nike dipped 0.8% to 51.62. Both household names are still trading below their key 50-day and 200-day moving averages.RELATED:Teen Spending On Makeup Soars: Here's How Investors Can Benefit

292,KSS,"Under Armour (UA) is getting a little sunshine on this autumn Monday. Wells Fargo upgraded the Nike (NKE) rival to outperform, and even typically bearish Morgan Stanley had some nice things to say about the Baltimore-based athletic apparel brand.A ""top-line reacceleration"" could be in Under Armour's future over the next year to year and a half, thanks to distribution expansion, wrote Wells Fargo analysts Tom Nikic and Ike Boruchow, as the ""noise"" settles from Sports Authority's bankruptcy proceedings.The brand's growth story is still in early days, and it has ""noteworthy"" opportunities to close in on its rivals abroad. Star endorser Steph Curry recently went on an Under Armour-branded tour of China, and the company flexed its marketing muscle at the recent Rio Olympics.Plus, there's Kohl's (KSS) introduction of Under Armour products, which should help offset the loss of Sports Authority, they said. Wells Fargo upped its price target range to 44-46 from 38-42.Under Armour shares rose 1.3% to 38.27 in the stock market today. The stock remains below its 50-day and 200-day moving average. So does Nike's stock, which closed unchanged at 51.79 Monday.IBD's TAKE: Not sure what to do when it comes to moving averages? Here's one guideline: ""Law Of Averages: Sell When Stocks Breach 200-Day Line.""Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole, in a note on Finish Line (FINL), remarked that Under Armour has a ""big opportunity"" after being a ""major share gainer"" at the sports apparel retailer over the past year. Like Adidas, the brand's share of Finish Line sales has doubled.Under Armour sales now represent 6% of the store's sales, he said; Adidas has expanded its Finish Line share to 10% as its resurgence powers higher.Under Armour's ""Curry franchise has the opportunity to become even bigger than it already is if (Under Armour) can tap into Curry's status as not just a great basketball player, but also

294,KSS,"U.S. retail sales this holiday season may grow at a faster pace than last year, fueled by rising wages and a stronger job market, the National Retail Federation said.Consumer purchases may increase 3.6% to a $655.8 billion in November and December, excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales, the Washington-based NRF said in a statement Tuesday. Sales climbed 3% last year, and the seven-year average since the recession ended in 2009 is 3.4%, the group said.U.S. shoppers may be feeling more holiday spirit, with the unemployment rate holding at an eight-year low and bigger paychecks putting more money in shoppers' wallets. There are signs that consumers already are loosening their purse strings: The U.S. personal savings rate fell to 5.7% of disposable personal income in August, down from 6.2% in March, according to the Commerce Department. Still, weak mall traffic may force traditional retailers to work hard over the holidays to entice customers.""All of the fundamentals are in a good place, giving strength to consumers and leading us to believe that this will be a very positive holiday season,"" NRF Chief Executive Matthew Shay said in the statement.IBD'S TAKE: NRF says e-commerce and other nonstore sales will rise 7% to 10% to $117 billion. While department stores and other brick-and-mortar stores struggle, Amazon continues to enjoy huge growth, with shares hitting new highs. Amazon is on IBD's Leaderboard, a premium service with annotated chart analysis of top stocks, many at or near buy points. Take a free trial.The NRF's holiday sales estimate was lower than a projection from Deloitte, which said last month that sales in stores may increase as much as 4%. A separate survey of about 1,000 U.S. consumers by AlixPartners indicated that 83% of shoppers expect to spend about the same or more this holiday season.In preparation for the holiday rush, retailers are making their annual push for seasonal workers. Target (TGT) and Kohl's (KSS) have said they plan to hire the same number of temporary employees as last year, with both adding about 70,000 apiece. Macy's (M), meanwhile, is hiring 83,000 holiday workers, down about 2,000 from last year.Political uncertainty abroad and at home, as well as the chance of unseasonably warm weather, are the biggest threats that could restrain holiday spending, NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in the statement. Still, the strong U.S. economy is likely to fuel shoppers this season.""Consumers have seen steady job and income gains throughout the year, resulting in continued confidence and the greater use of credit, which bodes well for more spending throughout the holiday season,"" Kleinhenz said.

295,KSS,"Just as Wal-Mart (WMT) upended Sears (SHLD) and Kmart decades ago, competition with Amazon (AMZN) has been ugly for many retailers. But Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has emerged relatively unblemished. Jeff Bezos' e-commerce behemoth has drawn shoppers into its Amazon Prime ecosphere, leaving rival retailers like Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) struggling to maintain and expand their customer base. But Ulta Beauty's…
"
296,KSS,"The overall 0.6% bounceback in retail sales last month comes with a caveat: Total spending looked healthy, but much of the gain came in categories that may not drive growth going forward.A core measure of goods spending that strips out restaurants, cars and gas, as well as building materials, rose just 0.1% in September. That was well below the 0.4% gain expected by economists and came after a 0.1% decline in this broad ""control group"" category of retail spending.Sales at electronics and appliance stores like Best Buy (BBY) remained a sore spot. Despite the midmonth launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7, seasonally adjusted sales fell 0.9% from August and 3.8% from a year ago. Best Buy shares fell 1.3% on the stock market today but are still near 52-week highs. Apple is near 2016 highs amid strong initial iPhone 7 demand and rival Samsung's overheating problems with its Note 7, which finally prompted the company to end sales and production of the smartphone.Slumping demand for PCs and printers led Hewlett-Packard (HP) on Thursday to announce a gradual reduction of 3,000 to 4,000 jobs. Electronics retailers also are being squeezed by the likes of Amazon (AMZN). Nonstore retailers saw September sales rise 0.3% from August after a 0.1% dip the prior month. Though online sales momentum has cooled a bit in the past few months, nonstore retailers still are posting double-digit year-over-year gains — 10.6% in September.Department store sales slid 0.7% from August and 6.4% from a year ago. Some of the slide reflects store closures. Still, analysts at Sterne Agee downgraded shares of Macy's (M) to neutral from buy on Friday, noting a slowdown in same-store sales growth. JPMorgan cut price targets and Q3 estimates on Macy's, JCPenney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS).Macy's, Kohl's shares fell about 3% Friday while Dillard's skidded 4.6%. Kohl's and Nordstom fell fractionally.Everything to do with the housing market shined in September. Sales at building materials and garden equipment stores like Home Depot (HD) surged 1.4% from August, more than reversing a 0.8% decline the prior month. Meanwhile, furniture store sales rose 1.0% from August and 2.7% from a year ago.Home Depot shares rose 0.1%.One of the surprises in the retail report was the strong gain in spending at food service and drinking places, up 0.8% from August, when sales rose 0.7%. Sales have moderated on a year-over-year basis to 6.1% from the 8%-plus pace that prevailed for most of 2015. Still, the gains over the past two months are a pleasant surprise given that McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN), Jack in the Box (JACK) and others have cited pressure from the growing cost gap between eating in and eating out.McDonald's stock fell 1.1%, while Wendy's and Jack in the Box rose fractionally.IBD'S TAKE: The Retail-Restaurants industry group is ranked in the lower tier by IBD, No. 113 out of 197 based on share performance. Investors will generally have more success buying leaders in top-tier groups, when the market trend is favorable. Sill, Papa Johns and Dunkin' Brands, are close to buy points and worth watching. Go to IBD Stock Checkup to find out why they're the two top stocks in the group.September restaurant sales data out Thursday from TDn2K covering 25,000 locations shed further light on industry trends. Overall, same-store sales fell 1.1% from a year ago in September, while customer traffic slumped 3.5%. The sector is on pace for its worst performance since 2009.Still, overall sales are performing better than same-store sales because of continued industry expansion, and the quick-service industry is doing a whole lot better than the rest, growing same-store sales 2.2% from a year ago in the third quarter, Nation's Restaurant News reported.On Friday, Bank of America analysts upgraded Domino's Pizza (DPZ) to buy from underperform, noting that the research firm expects 10.4% U.S. same-store sales growth in the third quarter. Domino's reports on Tuesday before the open. Domino's rose 0.5%.Auto sales jumped 1.1% in September, as U.S. vehicle sales rose to a 17.76 million annual rate from 17 million the prior month. Sales of higher-margin pickups and SUVs outperformed at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), helping offset their unit sales declines vs. a year ago.""The decline in gasoline prices relative to a year ago is likely to continue to support SUV sales,"" wrote Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons. ""Nonetheless, overall vehicle sales are at a level that may be close to a ceiling.""Ford shares closed unchanged. GM rallied 1.1% and Fiat Chrysler shares 2.3%.Gas station sales helped pump up the overall retail sales gain, rising 2.4% from August. McCarthy and Simons noted that the big rise was based on seasonal adjustments: Gas prices fell in 0.8% in September, but they usually fall 2.8% during the month after the peak summer driving season.RELATED:Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

297,KSS,"Amazon (AMZN) on Thursday announced that it will hire more than 120,000 seasonal holiday workers this year, up 20% from a year earlier, as the e-commerce giant continues to deliver blistering growth. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar retailers plan flat to lower holiday staffing.Amazon's second-quarter revenue rose 31% vs. a year earlier, the best gain in more than four years. Part of that is due to its booming Amazon Web Services cloud-service unit, but the company's core business of selling goods is still robust.As for traditional retailers, Target (TGT) has said it will hire 70,000 in-store staffers this holiday season, unchanged from 2015. Kohl's (KSS) will add 69,000 temporary workers for a fourth straight year. Macy's (M), which is closing many stores, is adding 89,000, down 2%. Target, Kohl's and Macy's have reported multiple quarters of declining sales.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon continues to expands into groceries, reportedly planning to set up convenience stores as well as curbside pickup locations. That could boost Amazon revenue by billions of dollars and pose a bigger threat to Wal-Mart, Target and other big grocery sellers.Meanwhile, FedEx is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers, down slightly vs. last year. UPS says it will hire 95,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year. UPS cited efficiencies that will allow it to ship more with less.FedEx and UPS have been big winners from e-commerce shipments, but Amazon is building up its own fleet of planes for shipping.Some 14,000 seasonal workers were brought on full-time after the 2015 holidays, Amazon said, predicting even more permanent hires this time.Amazon shares fell 0.6% to 829.28 on the stock market today, but are still close to record highs set last week.Macy's fell 2% and Kohl's lost 1.85%, while Target nudged a few pennies higher. All three are well off highs. UPS stock dipped 0.4% while FedEx slid 1.5%, both still relatively close to 52-week highs.RELATED:Retail Sales Report To Show Apple iPhone Launch EffectHoliday Sales Growth Seen Accelerating On Stronger Wage Gains

298,KSS,"A future with slow-growing productivity — and by extension, slow-growing incomes — seems close to becoming conventional wisdom. But the strides that Wal-Mart (WMT) is making with technology that streamlines everything from tracking inventory to simplifying check-out suggest a brighter outlook.The retail giant was considered a prime force behind the last productivity boom (think bar codes, scanners and retailer-supplier data links) and the subsequent productivity bust (heavier reliance on temps and part-time workers come to mind).But facing competitive threats from Amazon (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST), and the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own wage scale, Wal-Mart is re-engineering virtually every aspect of its business. New technologies and strategies have been tested, sending drones flying through warehouses, equipping shoppers with their own scanners and putting apps in the hands of efficiency-seeking store managers. Now sales are on the upswing, though profits have yet to follow, as the pace of change at Wal-Mart is accelerating.The payoff for investors won't be immediate. On Oct. 6, Wal-Mart cut its profit outlook again as it invests heavily to improve operations in stores and online. The stock has a lousy 19 Composite Rating out of 99, which means the stock only outperforms 19% of all other stocks based on earnings, share price performance and other key criteria. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is No. 190 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart, like many retailers and companies in other modest-wage industries, have seen profit margins pressured amid intense competition and rising wage pressures. But some have thrived. On Thursday, Ulta Beauty predicted earnings growth above 20% through 2019. Read this Investor's Corner primer on profit margins.The good news for consumers is that the retail giant is sharing some of its efficiency gains via lower prices, which means you can expect its efficiency measures to spread to other companies. Amazon may be the most disruptive force in retail, but Wal-Mart's sheer scale still gives it an outsized influence on the economy. Kroger (KR), Target and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts, the companies have hinted at and analysts have signaled in recent weeks. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.Here's a look at some technology programs underway at Wal-Mart and how they could change the productivity paradigm for retailers and the broader economy.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is the best stock in its sector, but its Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked 190 out of 197 by IBD based on stock performance and Wal-Mart shares aren't near a buy point. For a primer on how to find stocks to buy at the right time, visit IBD University.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on the Aug. 16 earnings call that the company will roll out its new self-scan-and-pay technology at all Sam's Clubs this fall, letting members of the discount warehouses ""skip the checkout line.""Customers can use the ""Scan & Go"" app to ring up items as they put them in their shopping cart and see a running receipt total on their phones. The app also handles payment, so customers just show their receipts to greeters on the way out.The technology has been a long time in development. In 2014, the company pulled the plug on a year-old Scan & Go pilot program at 200 Wal-Marts using an app that was only compatible with Apple (AAPL) iPhones.But the company isn't reserving its latest innovations for Sam's Club customers. In June, Wal-Mart rolled out mobile payment technology at all of its 4,600 U.S. locations. It is testing out customer handheld scanning devices provided by the store in a number of Wal-Mart locations, but management has noted the logic of offering the same self-scan capability via smartphone that it's doing at Sam's Club.Scanning items as you put them in your cart relieves one of the frustrations of people who prefer the self-checkout lane. But like shoppers who check out with the help of a cashier, they still face another frustration: Finding bar codes slows everything down.Wal-Mart is experimenting with a technology called digital watermarking that, in the words of McMillon via Instagram in June 2015, ""could transform the way our customers check out.""Digimarc (DMRC), which subsequently confirmed that its bar code technology was the subject of McMillon's post, invisibly embeds bar code information repeatedly over retail packaging so there's no need to locate it or reorient the merchandise before scanning.Adoption of this next-generation bar code, if broad adoption is to occur, must proceed in steps. Bar code scanners must be designed to read the digital watermarking, and Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Datalogic are now equipping their scanners to do so.Regional grocer Wegmans has begun using digital watermarking on its private-label packaging in a logical first step before broader adoption by consumer packaging companies. Wegmans, which has 89 stores, expects $2 million in annual savings for every extra item scanned per minute vs. the usual 21, noted Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone in a recent research report.The next big breakthrough would be for major producers like Procter & Gamble (PG) to update their packaging. A push from Wal-Mart could certainly provide an impetus, but there's another important catalyst: By mid-2018, food labels of large manufacturers must meet new standards, making nutrition information easier to read, Stone notes.Eventually, Digimarc has said, shopping carts equipped with scanners could read its bar codes when customers put items in the cart.Wal-Mart said in June that it will start using drones to take inventory in its warehouses by late 2016 or early 2017, identifying when stocks are misplaced or running low. The drones will make a one-day job out of work that now takes employees a month to complete, while reducing the risk of accidents, Wal-Mart says.The drones are part of a larger push to manage inventories more efficiently. Wal-Mart, like other retailers including Home Depot (HD), Target and Kohl's (KSS), has been making a big push to keep inventories to a minimum and improve efficiency by rationalizing product selection (such as three sizes of salad dressing instead of six) and having more frequent supplier deliveries. Wal-Mart also is keeping more inventory in distribution centers to facilitate e-commerce shipping. One goal is simply limiting the number of times merchandise has to be moved by an employee from the time Wal-Mart receives a supplier shipment to final purchase.The latest U.S. economic data show that inventories at general merchandise stores fell 0.6% from a year earlier in July. In the short term, better inventory management may hold down economywide output and make productivity look awful, even if it's actually a partial result of retailers making efficiency gains. In the second quarter, leaner inventories subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP.Over time, though, inventory efficiencies reduce costs and permit lower prices and, possibly, better product selection. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.Now every member of Wal-Mart's in-store management team has a My Productivity smartphone app to request restocking of certain items and check sales trends while they roam the aisles and assist customers.""Prior to My Productivity, management associates were spending thousands of hours in the backrooms of our stores annually,"" wrote Mark Ibbotson, Wal-Mart executive vice president, in a June blog post introducing the new technology. ""That simply cannot be in today's world.""Wal-Mart's latest move to improve productivity, like many of its efficiency gains, involved using old technology in a new way. In early September, the company said it was cutting 7,000 cash accounting and invoicing jobs in its U.S. stores. Instead, the company will use cash recycler machines to count money and will handle invoicing at a central office.Wal-Mart also has been dreaming up new ideas for fixing the age-old problem of unused shopping carts left in the parking lot or cluttering the shopping aisles. This year, Wal-Mart filed a patent for a robot that collects unused shopping carts. A related idea would let customers hail a shopping cart via smartphone.While there's no telling how long it may take that burst of creativity to materialize in stores, the key point is that Wal-Mart is leaving no stone unturned or idea unconsidered to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. On Oct. 6, the company hosted a few dozen companies out of 250 original applicants in a ""Technology Innovation Open Call."" The winners got to pitch their technology solutions for retail, logistics, big data, security and social media.Wal-Mart's efficiency moves have swept through the economy before. An influential McKinsey & Co. study on productivity in the second half of the 1990s found that the retail sector accounted for nearly one-fourth of the U.S. rise, adding that ""more than half of the productivity acceleration in the retailing of general merchandise can be explained by only two syllables: Wal-Mart.""Big information technology breakthroughs, such as bar codes, wireless scanning guns and electronic data interchange with suppliers, came long before productivity took off. Wal-Mart's efficiency gains in that era were as much due to managerial efforts, McKinsey found. The key was that its tech and management changes were both geared toward achieving ""everyday low prices."" Wal-Mart reached a scale that compelled its business partners and rivals to follow suit or risk being left behind.U.S. output per work hour at general merchandise stores, excluding department stores, soared by nearly 150% from 1995 to 2007.But over the past eight years through the end of 2015, productivity in this sector has risen just 3%.What went wrong? A sluggish economic recovery, modest wage gains, and an overabundance of stores as Amazon gained market share. Wal-Mart, which opted to close 154 U.S. stores at the start of 2016, went through a six-quarter string of same-store sales declines through mid-2014 as its customer-satisfaction rankings tumbled.Retailers and other modest-wage employers such as fast-food chains took what might be viewed as profit shortcuts. Wal-Mart reportedly boosted its temp workforce and had understaffed stores. Other employers boosted their ranks of part-timers clocking fewer than 30 hours per week to dodge paying for health insurance or facing a fine under the ObamaCare employer mandate.Wal-Mart's penny pinching hurt sales and productivity, ultimately spurring lower profits and a change in strategy.As the economy nears full employment and employers recognize that cutting corners hasn't paid off, wage gains are picking up as companies try to raise their game. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront, raising its own base wage to $10 an hour, pushing other modest-wage employers to follow suit or suffer low morale and high turnover.Yet whatever productivity gains Wal-Mart is seeing from initiatives launched in the past year or two have yet to catch up to its extra spending on wages and on technology to improve customer satisfaction and narrow the gap with Amazon. While sales rose 3.1% from a year ago at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores in the second quarter, expenses rose 8.3% and operating income fell 6.2%.The company warned last week that it won't turn the corner on earnings growth until 2018, forecasting roughly flat per-share profits next year, prompting some analysts to reel in their price target for Wal-Mart shares. Wal-Mart also said it would scale back plans to grow its U.S. store base, adding just 55 stores in the next fiscal year, compared with 135 this year, while building more distribution centers for online orders.Ultimately, consumers will decide with their feet and their wallets how productive Wal-Mart investments turn out to be. On that score, Wal-Mart's 1.2% same-store increase in customer traffic last quarter looked like a good sign, even as fewer people were shopping at rivals Target and Dollar General.Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip Cashier Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

402,KSS,"Fitbit (FIT) stock went on a post-Thanksgiving turkey trot on Monday after getting an analyst upgrade. Barclays analyst Matthew McClintock on Monday upgraded Fitbit stock to overweight from equal weight with a price target of 49. Fitbit was up more than 2.5%, near 28.50, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Fitbit, the top maker of activity trackers and fitness bands, went public on June 18 at 20. It climbed as high as 51.90 on Aug. 5 before investors got vertigo. Its shares tumbled on concerns about increased competition and profit erosion.Fitbit's recent stock decline is unwarranted, McClintock said in a research report. The company has ""meaningful catalysts"" ahead including holiday season sales, the CES trade show, new product launches and corporate wellness deals, he said.""Considering that Fitbit is the fastest-growing meaningful consumer company in the world at 140%+ revenue year over year in 2015 (in a world lacking true growth stories), we believe the current valuation levels are just too compelling to ignore,"" he said.Wearables appear to be one of the winning product categories this holiday and Fitbit is the brand of choice, according to retail channel checks, he said. Plus, Fitbit was less discounted than its peers over the Black Friday weekend, McClintock said.Retailers Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT) and Kohl's (KSS) cited strong wearable device sales in recent reports.""We estimate that Fitbit can grow annual revenue by at least 40% over the next several years, which could ultimately prove conservative (our upside case is for Fitbit to grow revenue almost 70% over the next several years),"" McClintock said. ""Our estimates for revenue growth are entirely driven by overall category growth/consumer adoption as well as geographic expansion (Fitbit's global operations currently represent less than 25% of sales).""Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson said his retail channel checks on Black Friday indicated soft in-store fitness tracker sales. However, online sales may have offset weaker brick-and-mortar sales.Fitbit saw ""slightly disappointing in-store demand,"" Erickson said in a report Sunday.""Our checks indicate that wearable devices overall, and Fitbit specifically, underperformed store expectations on Black Friday, driven by strong Apple Watch sales and a likely channel shift toward online,"" he said. ""Historically, Fitbit has done as much as 40% of its sales through online channels, and we think this holiday could index above those levels. So while we're noting the in-store feedback as a modest negative, we're not ruling out that the fitness category's likely higher proclivity toward online channels may have provided Fitbit some offset to this softness.""Erickson rates Fitbit stock as overweight with a price target of 47.Fitbit likely didn't see any meaningful market share loss to rival activity trackers from Garmin (GRMN) and others over Black Friday weekend, he said. But Apple 's (AAPL) Apple Watch smartwatch, which was discounted by some retailers, could have impacted wearables demand, he said.RELATED:Fitbit, Apple Watch demand up ahead of holidaysFitbit takes ill as secondary stock offer cuts value.

429,KSS,"Never mind ""Let It Snow."" Heading into the crucial holiday shopping season, retailers are more likely singing ""Let It Go"" from the movie ""Frozen"" as they try to shake off disappointing quarterly earnings results and a bad week that collectively sank merchant stocks.Nordstrom (JWN), Macy 's (M), J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) were among those that reported the week of Nov. 9, with Nordstrom and Macy's turning in weak results and discounted forecasts, and J.C. Penney and Kohl's shares falling despite beating consensus views.An October retail sales data miss — a worse-than-expected 0.1% gain — didn't help either, though Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce sellers notably logged a 7.1% rise from the previous year as consumers continue to do much of their shopping online. Cowen & Co. predicted in July that Amazon would knock out Macy's as the top U.S. apparel retailer by 2017.Even much-lauded off-pricers haven't been immune to the pummeling that retail stocks were subjected to over the past week. Shares of TJX (TJX), the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, lost 12% over the past week.In a possible sign of things to come, Q3 same-store sales at Nordstrom's off-price arm, Nordstrom Rack, fell 2.2%.""This type of miss from Rack is surprising to us, and we acknowledge the Rack's off-price slowdown could be a negative indicator for TJX,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen on Friday.But he added that TJX, which reports Tuesday, could ""offset some secular weakness"" based on a few factors, including the strength of the company's sourcing and buying teams, home goods offerings and international reach.The company is expected to report a slight earnings dip of 1% to 84 cents a share. That would mark the third straight quarter of earnings deceleration and a swing from earnings gains of 7%, 8% and 15% in the three preceding periods.Revenue is seen rising 5% to $7.73 million, which also would reflect a slowdown.With a 75 IBD Composite Rating, TJX is the highest ranking member of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which ranks a feeble 144 out of 197 groups.Peers in the group include Ross Stores, Foot Locker (FL), L Brands (LB) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO).Fellow off-pricer Ross Stores (ROST) gapped down ahead of its Thursday earnings release, losing 11% for the week. Analysts expect over 6% EPS growth to 50 cents on 6% sales growth to $2.77 billion.And what about the big-box retailers?Target's (TGT) earnings are seen accelerating, with a predicted 59% climb to 86 cents a share on a 1% revenue dip to $17.57 billion. Shares retreated 6.9% last week.And Wall Street expects Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings to slide 15% to 98 cents a share on a 1% revenue decline to $117.79 billion.

464,KSS,"Plunging energy prices sent the stock market into a tailspin in afternoon trading Thursday.The Nasdaq was down 0.4%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average bore the brunt of the damage, off 1% in the stock market today.Volume was tracking higher than the same time Wednesday on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges.Oil prices turned tail and were trading nearly 3% lower, well below $42 a barrel.

It was up 3%.Among industry groups, energy, machinery and miners were among the worst performers on the day.Department stores were the top-performing groups. Kohl's (KSS) rose 5% after a cheery earnings report. But a disappointing Macy's (M) report on Wednesday sent the whole group deeper into a correction.

474,KSS,"Macy's (M) reported a third straight quarterly decline in sales early Wednesday, prompting it to slash its full-year profit and sales forecasts, and sending shares crashing early Wednesday.

475,KSS,"Consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell for a third straight month in March, according to the latest University of Michigan survey, as Americans suspect that the era of cheap gas is ending. That's a bad sign for consumer spending from Apple (AAPL) iPhones to Tiffany (TIF) jewelry.The Michigan sentiment index's flash reading was 90, down 1.7 points from the February's final reading of 91.7, January's 92 and December's 92.6. It's the lowest reading since October. Wall Street expected a flash March reading on 92.2.The index hit 95.9 in April, the highest since January 2007, but quickly retreated to 87.2 in September.The survey measures consumers' attitudes toward current economic conditions and future expectations. The current conditions gauge fell 1.2 points to 105.6, while an expectations measure declined 1.9 points to 80.""Consumer confidence eased in early March due to increased concerns about prospects for the economy as well as the expectation that gas prices would inch upward during the year ahead,"" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.But the connection between consumer confidence and consumer spending isn't always clear.Retail sales have fallen in the first two months of 2016. Much of that reflects cheaper gasoline, but shoppers haven't rushed to spend the extra cash. Electronics sales have retreated, with Apple iPhone sales declining this quarter and Apple Watch sales failing to excite. (Apple may hope for some sales boost as it reveals new products, including a new smaller phone at Monday's product event.)Auto sales have held up well, but General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) remain down for the year and below their 200-day moving averages. GM, Ford and other automakers increasingly have relied on subprime and ever-longer long terms to boost demand, while cheap gas has fueled low-mileage, high-margin SUV sales.Meanwhile, Kohl's (KSS) issued a big profit warning, while Macy's (M) has shut some stores. But the Retail-Department Stores stock group has been one of IBD's strongest industry groups so far in 2016.Tiffany shares rose 2.1% in afternoon trade on the stock market today after the luxury jeweler reported declining earnings that still topped views. But Tiffany warned of more weak profit ahead, as tourists spend less.The rebounding stock market could fuel consumer spending, at least among higher-income households with large portfolios.
"
476,KSS,"Are department store chains sitting ducks in the new retailing jungle of the Amazon.com (AMZN)?It seems that in 2016 so far, bullish investors would disagree.IBD's Retail-Department Stores industry group has a trashy rating for six-month relative price performance -- at No. 158 out of 197 groups and subgroups as of Thursday's newspaper. Yet the group is also up more than 10% since Jan. 1. Only four other groups, including Food-Meat and Mining-Gold, can match that performance.What's more, a positive trend within the Retail sector is emerging; five more retail subgroups -- discount & variety, leisure products, apparel and shoes, restaurants and auto parts -- show year-to-date gains of 3% or more. The S&P 500 is down 5%.Macy's (M) has the largest market cap in Retail-Department Stores at $13.6 billion. The 37 RS Rating is wretched. Yet the stock is up more than 23% since Jan. 1. Even with the stout gains, Macy's is still 41% below its 52-week peak of 73.61.Macy's continues to see slumping sales; in the past four quarters, they fell 1%, 3%, 5% and 5% below year-ago levels. Yet the big box retailer is still profitable; Wall Street sees earnings in fiscal 2017 (ending in January next year) slipping only 3% to $3.80 a share. That's still sharply above the $1.29 it pocketed in fiscal 2009 amid the Great Recession.Macy's has mastered the practice of making every week feel like Black Friday. Customers are bombarded with big-discount coupons nearly every week via email, the Sunday paper or by snail mail. It seems to be working. Its one-day Saturday Sale events have brought loyal customers into its cavernous stores.Macy's strives for innovation; on Feb. 18 it unveiled a new line of men's clothing with snowboarding and skateboard superstar Shaun White. The collection pledges to reflect White's ""adrenaline-pumping, eclectic style.""Macy's has driven its annual pretax margin to the 7% to 8% level over the past five years, up from the 3% to 5% range seen from 2008 to 2011.Nordstrom (JWN), No. 2 in market cap at $9.6 billion, has rebounded in recent days following its Q4 report of a fifth quarter in a row of declining EPS (-11% to $1.17, despite a 4% pickup in sales) and is up more than 5% year-to-date. Watch to see if the stock can climb back near its 200-day moving average, near 63 for now.Kohl's (KSS)  ($8.7 bil market cap) and Dillard's (DDS) ($3 bil), both forecast to grow FY 2017 profit by 6%, are also struggling to regain their long-term 200-day moving averages.
"
477,KSS,"Warmer-than-expected weather hit Kohl's (KSS) and Sears Holdings (SHLD) results in the holiday quarter, while Kohl's said it will pilot a new, smaller-format concept this year.Kohl's fourth-quarter earnings fell 14% to $1.58 a share, 2 cents above views. Revenue nudged up 0.8% to $6.39 billion, more or less in line with estimates. Same-store sales grew 0.4%, missing estimates. The holidays were strong, said management, but softness in November and January weighed on comp growth. The company had logged 3.7% comps during the prior-year quarter.On Wednesday, it declared an 11% dividend hike to 50 cents a share.For 2016, it expects diluted EPS of $4.05 to $4.25 and total sales ranging from a 0.5% decline to 0.5% growth. Analysts expect 1% sales growth to $19.41 billion for the year.""Is flat growth the new norm for department stores?"" asked Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen in a Thursday note on Kohl's.Many retailers such as Kohl's and Macy's are now exploring off-price offerings as they aim to compete with TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST), leaders in the off-price space.Kohl's said it will close 18 underperforming stores this year -- less than 1% of total sales -- and has plans to open seven new, smaller-format stores around the country as part of a pilot program. It will also open two additional off-price Off/Aisle pilot stores in Wisconsin.Shares closed up 2.7% in the stock market today.Macy's (M), which bested expectations when it reported Tuesday, closed 40 stores and opened 26 in fiscal 2015, also announcing plans to open 15 off-price Backstage locations inside Macy's stores this year.Meanwhile, Sears reported Thursday a wider-than-expected loss of $1.70 vs. views for a $1.36 per-share loss. Revenue fell 10% to $7.3 billion, slightly above estimates for $7.26 billion.Kmart comps fell 7.2%. Sears Domestic comps declined 6.9%.Shares rose 3.2%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

478,KSS,"Discount giant Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and high-end department store operator Nordstrom (JWN) will likely report yet another quarter of weaker earnings over the holiday season. And sales won't be so hot either.The 2015 holiday quarter was tough sledding for many retailers. Abnormally warm weather kept shelves bulging with cold-weather goods at many retailers, leading to heavy markdowns that hurt margins. Another drawback: The ongoing shift to online shopping and growing competition from e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) led to a slowdown in traffic at the malls.Friday's retail sales report showed January purchases rose 0.2%. But while Amazon and nonstore retailers reported a 1.5% jump, department store sales slid 0.8%. Earlier this month, Kohl's (KSS) issued a big warning, sending its shares down 19% on Feb. 4. (Amazon, for its part, crashed 16% over five sessions after its 122% EPS gain failed to reach even-loftier expectations.)There are no such lofty expectations for Wal-Mart. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Wal-Mart to see an 11% decline in adjusted earnings from a year earlier to $1.43 a share when it reports Thursday before the open. Much of that expected EPS slide is ""attributable to increased labor costs,"" Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said in a report on Q4 retail earnings.This would be the sixth straight EPS decline for Wal-Mart, though smaller than its Q3 drop of 14%. Still, analysts expect weaker profits for the next four quarters as well.Wal-Mart's earnings have been under pressure due to costs from boosting wages, watchers say.Last month, the giant discounter announced more than 1.2 million Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam’s Club associates will receive a pay increase under the second phase of the company’s two-year, $2.7 billion investment in workers. The pay raise, which takes effect Feb. 20, will be ""one of the largest single-day, private-sector pay increases ever,"" Wal-Mart said in a statement.All associates hired before Jan. 1, 2016, will earn at least $10 per hour. New entry-level associates will continue to start at $9 per hour and move to at least $10 an hour after successfully completing the company’s new retail skills and training program known as Pathways, the company said.Also last month, the company said it will close 154 locations in the U.S., including the company’s 102 smallest format stores, Walmart Express, which had been in pilot since 2011.Analysts expect Wal-Mart's Q4 revenue to slip 0.6% from a year earlier to $130.75 billion. That would be less than the decrease the company saw in Q3. U.S. same-store sales have risen for the past several quarters.Wal-Mart shares rose 1.3% on the stock market Friday, finding resistance near the 200-day moving average.Analysts forecast Nordstrom will see Q4 earnings slip 7% from a year earlier to $1.22 a share when it reports results Thursday after the close. That would be less than the 22% earnings decline in Q3. But it would be the fifth straight quarter of EPS declines -- with the streak continuing for the next three quarters.Analysts see sales rising 4.5% to $4.224 billion.While Nordstrom is an upscale retailer, much of its growth has been in its off-price (but not cheap) Nordstrom Rack chain.Nordstrom just unveiled the footprint and exterior design of its first Nordstrom store in New York City. The store will encompass four properties in the Columbus Circle neighborhood in Manhattan. The approximately 363,000 square-foot store is expected to open in 2019.Nordstrom stock fell 0.6% on Friday.

S&P futures were originally up – small, but up…. then after the rash of more disappointing macro data hit the tape at 8:30 am – you could feel the air pressure change……Challenger Job Cuts – soar! US companies announced 75k job CUTS last month – that is up 200% over December and up 42% from one year ago! Initial jobless claims higher, continuing claims higher, and then the retailers HIT.....Kohl's ( (KSS)) and Ralph Lauren ( (RL)) shocked the mkts with very disappointing earnings and sales figures for December and guidance for the new year…. This is where the concern about the consumer hits you right between the eyeballs....Remember all the chatter last fall - How great the shopping season was going to be, how the consumer was flush with cash, how the tide had turned and retailers were going to be the beneficiaries??? Does any of that ring a bell?Futures did a complete 180 and fell out bed……the pressure was mounting – the storm clouds were building….….

"
481,KSS,"""Negative Rates in the US? Here's Why It Could Happen""
"
482,KSS,"In this expose by Jeff Cox – he makes it very clear that the next move for US interest rates may be down and not up…..and he goes so far to say that down means going to the dark side - Yes folks - get ready for negative rates… and the reasons are many as WE all know - but apparently not to many in DC know - so let me highlight just a few: Building recession fears in the US, unstable financial mkts, currency devaluations by some ‘emerging mkt' countries, weakening global macro data, collapsing oil and commodity prices and pressure from other central banks that have already moved towards negative rates.Jeff points out that while it may seem highly unlikely – ""Snow White and the 10 dwarfs' would have to consider the possibility of going to the dark side ""should financial conditions tighten and threats to economic growth increase."" BankAmerica rates strategist – Mark Cabana echoes that sentiment saying: ""While not our baseline scenario, if the U.S. economy were to sufficiently weaken we believe the Fed could consider negative rates as a means to ease policy,""So I must ask – How could we go from being so strong 6 weeks ago – as indicated by the FED in December, when they raised rates citing 'explosive growth'....which was then echoed by the President in January – to being so weak so quickly? I mean just last week – Vice Chair Stanley Fischer told us that ""4 more rates hikes were in the ballpark for 2016"" – and Wednesday KC Pres Ester George – backed him up!So what gives? Did he mean that ‘4 more rate DECREASES were in the ballpark for 2016?' I mean Fischer is 72 yrs old – maybe he was just confused…..I mean we all know that Greenspan (now 90) was most definitely confused/borderline stunata (Sicilian for nuts) during his tenure at the FED – because this whole mess – I mean THIS WHOLE MESS started under his watch….(but that's a story for another day).
"
483,KSS,"So - we must consider the possibility that Cousin Stanley was confused…..In the end – the broad mkt fell 15 pts to 1900, then rallied 27 pts to 1927 only to fail again and then rally again into the close to end the day at 1915 or up 2.92. Oil also had a bit of nutty day…..trading in a 5% range – initially +3% then falling 1.7% by days' end. And all of this makes sense – remember – the mkt has suffered some real damage of late – trading well below any support levels as it thrashes around trying to build a base amid deteriorating macro reports...... Add in all the global geo-political issues and you can see why the mkt is struggling.The Fed is trying desperately to stay calm and hold the mkt steady…..and to do this – they MUST keep crude oil prices from moving lower so how do they do that? Well given the relationship between oil prices and the US dollar, the Fed has been very actively JAWBONING (see yesterday's note) the dollar lower by floating the idea of negative US interest rates. By doing so – they manage to create some demand for gold – which has rallied nicely – since the December lows. The China Yuan devaluation and the threat of more to come coupled with the Japanese move to the dark side – (negative rates) – saw Gold react beautifully as many investors embrace it as the safest haven of all. As of yesterday – it has now managed to pierce all 3 resistance levels – the 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages – which now sets it up for a run….Look for it to test the October highs of $1185/oz and if we blow thru that - then a run to $1250 is clearly a possibility. Back to the FED – Who is kidding who? Rates are not going any higher at all….not now, not in March and not in the summer….at most – the FED will return us to a zero rate policy – because in the end – negative rates suggest desperation, no matter how you slice it. You CAN'T possibly argue that negative rates are just another ‘tool in the toolbox' ....They are the nuclear option....not a place I want to be.Overnight Asian mkts were essentially lower.....no significant news to report - other than more speculation about what China has up their sleeve and what the FED has up her sleeve.....Japan -1.23%, Hong Kong +0.55%, China -0.63% and ASX -0.08%.European mkts are all higher - breathing what feels like is a sigh of relief.....German factory orders the only notable report....and they weren't good....falling by 0.7% vs. the estimate of -0.5%....FTSE +0.48%, CAC 40 + -0.48%, DAX -0.06%, EUROSTOXX +0.38%, SPAIN +1.28% AND ITALY +0.64%.US futures are now UP 2 pts....as the clock ticks on the 8:30 bombshell......What will the gov't tell us today about Non Farm Payrolls and the jobs created? Will it 'blow the doors off the bus?' Expectations are for +200k jobs, but in reality – the range is +150/+220. Anything less than 150k will only add to the angst of a slowing economy – remember what Challenger Gray and Christmas told us yesterday morning…..We announced lay OFFS of 75k people last month – so an NFP that ‘blows the doors off the bus' would hardly be believable at all….

485,KSS,"Did department stores Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) move their earnings out of the doldrums and back onto the growth track in the third quarter?Investors will learn the answer when the two top department stores kick off retail earnings season and report quarterly results this week. If analysts' expectations are on target, both companies will see their earnings decrease.So far, the signs aren't good, analysts say. The department store group saw their shares get hammered on Monday as several negative reports came out on the segment.Macy's shares tumbled after Citigroup lowered its price target on the retailer. Deutsche Bank also issued a negative report on Macy's and other mid-tier department store operators Kohl's (KSS) and Dillard's (DDS), noting they ""may be about to limbo underneath what is already a very low bar as they report potentially very underwhelming Q3 results and Q4/holiday guidance.""Macy's shares closed down 5.4% on the stock market today.JPMorgan also issued a negative report on several department stores on Monday noting Macy's, Dillard's, Kohl's and Nordstrom have ""too much cold-weather inventory,"" among other things. Nordstrom shares closed down 4.7% on Monday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Macy's to see earnings decline 13% from a year earlier to 53 cents a share when it reports third-quarter results on Wednesday before the opening bell. That comes on top of a 20% drop in the second quarter.They see a 1.6% decline in sales to $6.1 billion, following a 3% decrease in the second quarter, to mark the third straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines.Macy's is generally regarded as a well-run chain, with a strong sales channels, but it has reported lower year-over-year revenue in five of the last seven quarters.The sales trend comes as spending has been shifting from traditional shopping-mall department stores and apparel chains toward experiences and non-tangible goods such as wireless services and entertainment, amid ever-growing competition from Amazon (AMZN) and other online players.Investor's Business Daily's department store industry group ranks retailers No. 192 out of 197 industry groups.Macy's has recently undertaken a number of initiatives to propel growth, including entering the lucrative off-price retail arena, where it would compete with operators such as TJX Cos.

That bodes well for Skechers.""While ""not a lot is going on in apparel,"" he says, accessories such as handbags and footwear have taken up the slack.Skechers products are ""aligning with what is essentially a very strong trend in active and athletic-derivative (footwear),"" Van Sinderen added. ""What are females wearing today? A lot of leggings, yoga pants. Skechers sits in the sweet spot of selling footwear that links up with active apparel.""McCoy notes that memory foam is a steppingstone to more advanced technologies planned for launches next spring. Those developments include a new GOmat insole that mixes memory foam with gel for cushion and ""rebound support,"" the latter being important for running. A new GOwalk women's line will also debut next spring, she says.The GOwalk line is something of a sore point for Skechers, which in June filed a lawsuit against larger rival Adidas AG's Reebok International for selling footwear that it says infringes on its proprietary GOwalk product line.A Run Against NikePerformance shoes, whether for running, walking or gym workouts, are still a relatively small portion of Skechers' revenue. McCoy estimates the category accounts for about 15% of sales.But the still-young business ""has been doing amazingly well and continues to grow,"" she said. ""It's a significant opportunity.""Marathon runner Meb Keflezighi, a 2004 Olympic silver medalist, won the 2014 Boston Marathon in Skechers' new GOmeb Speed 3 shoes. He's been on Skechers' celebrity endorsement team since 2011. It includes, among others, former quarterback Joe Montana and billionaire investor-entrepreneur Mark Cuban, who owns the Dallas Mavericks NBA basketball team and film-industry holdings.The Skechers brand is gaining market share within the mid-tier channel ""where newness was needed,"" Svezia wrote. ""This has allowed the brand to attack the 'white space' below the Nike (NKE) and Adidas of the world and gain share.""

562,KSS,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsLAS VEGAS — As Fitbit ([STOCK[FIT]]) stock fell hard for a third straight day, the company's chief executive remained upbeat that the maker of wearable fitness devices is on the right track.In an interview with IBD on Thursday, Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park defended the company's ""smart fitness watch,"" the Fitbit Blaze, announced Tuesday at the CES trade show. Some analysts speculated that the device could fare poorly against the full-featured Apple ([STOCK[AAPL]]) Watch smartwatch.""There's clearly a disconnect between investors and what our customers and retail partners are excited about,"" Park said. ""We've had a lot of great meetings at CES with Wal-Mart ([STOCK[WMT]]), Target ([STOCK[TGT]]), Kohl's ([STOCK[KSS]]), etc. They expect Blaze to do really well. And the feedback we're getting from customers (is positive).""The Fitbit Blaze fills a gap in the company's product lineup, he said. It's targeted at fitness enthusiasts who want a device with a bigger screen that has more general-purpose capabilities.For Fitbit, the device will provide a higher average selling price and offers high-margin accessories.Fitbit Blaze will cost $199 when it goes on sales in March. That's a ""sweet spot"" for consumers, Park said. By comparison, the entry-level Apple Watch costs $349.People like to speculate about how competitive Fitbit is with Apple, but Park says that's not his concern.""Ultimately we are focused on our customers,"" Park said. ""General-purpose smartwatches really haven't taken off. There's confusion about what they're good for. Consumers are confused by the shear amount of stuff that these devices can do.""So, look, our focus is: Fitness first. Our mission is around digital health, having devices and services that address people's lifestyle health goals, and in the future, hopefully more chronic conditions.""Meanwhile, new competitors in the fitness tracker space emerged at CES including Under Armour ([STOCK[UA]]), Fossil ([STOCK[FOSL]]) and New Balance.Fitbit has successfully fended off such rivals as Nike ([STOCK[NKE]]) and Philips, Park said. It will continue to focus on its competitive advantages of its large user base and community features.Park says it's still early days for market penetration of wearable fitness devices.Fitbit also is facing a consumer class-action lawsuit about the accuracy of the heart-rate monitors on its fitness bands. Park said the lawsuit is without merit.""Consumers are really happy with the device,"" Park said. ""All you have to do is go to Amazon ([STOCK[AMZN]]) and see the reviews for Charge HR. Regardless of what the litigation says from the plaintiffs' attorneys, you have to look at the true consumer sentiment and I think people are pretty satisfied.""Fitbit stock fell 6.1% to 21.50 on the stock market today, hitting a record low for a third straight day. Fitbit stock fell 18.4% on Tuesday and 5.8% on Wednesday, as the stock market overall corrected. On Thursday, Fitbit came close to hitting its IPO price of 20 from last June, but it closed its first day of trading near 30.

598,KSS,"Stocks closed lower on Friday finishing the week on a sour note — the selling violated the second level of support leaving the mkt in limbo with only the final support level needing to be tested at S&P 2005.  The Dow lost 202 pts while the S&P lost over 1%, closing lower by 23 pts….led by a continued free fall in commodities and the glaringly weak reports on retail sales and PPI (producer price index)…For the week — the S&P lost over 3.5%, the energy sector lost 6%, retailers lost 9%, Tech lost 4.7% , Consumer Discretionary lost 5.1%. Well you get the picture.  The PPI at -0.4% was so bad it is now indicating DEFLATION….but no worries — Janet and her band of merry men and women are singing about the benefits of that still strong NFP report from two weeks ago — in fact on Friday — Cleveland Fed Pres Loretta Mester said that the time to hike rates was ‘quickly approaching’….suggesting that the time is now for rates to rise…and so what we are seeing is a re-pricing of risk assets across the spectrum — why?  Because they (the FED)  clearly missed that opportunity 2 or 3 times already and the mkt is telling us that NOW is not the time to move on rates - especially in light of the weekend's events…..what’s the rush?  I mean the DATA is really not cooperating...but she is trapped - trapped like a rat..... (Remember December is a ‘self imposed’ deadline.)

599,KSS,"And it was a very disappointing day for retailers on Friday — in fact the retailers rolled over and played dead…..October retail sales rose by 0.1% vs. the 0.3% expectation and if you look at retail sales EX autos, gas, building materials and food services rose by 0.2% vs. the 0.4% expectation.  Add in some weaker than expected earnings and the retailers got slaughtered…..JW Nordstrom (JWN) gave up 15% on horrific earnings, terrible revenues and a cut in full year sales and profit forecasts…. JC Penney  (JCP) also closed down 15% on terrible earnings, but the silver lining for them was that comparable store sales rose by 6.4%......The Gap, Inc. (GPS) -3%,  Kohl's (KSS) -3.2%, Macy's (M) gave up another 2% on top of the 24% in the last week alone.....Target (TGT) lost 2.5%......not a pretty picture by any stretch.....
"
600,KSS,"Now Friday afternoon also brought word of a terrorist attack in Paris….and the chaos and confusion that that event created only served to put more pressure on an already weak mkt as investors/traders tried to understand the extent and impact of this horrific event.  As the day drew to a close — more information became available — and the selling pressure picked up into the bell.  Over the weekend — we learned of the very horrific events that engulfed the ‘City of Lights’ — the world mourned — allies stood together, world leaders who had gathered in Turkey for the G20 meeting denounced the actions of those pathetic souls that call themselves ‘jihadists’ — calling this an ‘attack on the civilized world’……. and then President Hollande of France declared ‘war’ on Isis…..Sunday night unleashing a barrage of French bombs — (neatly packed in French air force Rafale Fighter Jets…)  upon the nerve center in Raqqa, Syria — wiping out a command center, a weapons facility, and a training ground… and this is only the beginning…..there is now a global commitment to intensify and eradicate this terrorist organization…… and so it begins - the instability, the fear, the bombs and the continued threats of chaos will now become some of the directional drivers in the global mktplace. Asia was the first mkt center to open — and stocks moved lower as mkts react to the worst terror incident in over a decade…..investors kneejerk reaction is to hit the SELL button (fear) as they assess the impact that this event will have on the European economy and the global economy…. Weaker macro data in Japan also did not help the tone — GDP for the 3rd qtr fell by 0.8% on top of the -0.7% in the 2nd qtr.  Sending that country into RECESSION — this is the second recession since PM Shinzo Abe took office in December 2012.  This news put renewed pressure on Abe and the BoJ Governor Kuroda to do MORE!

Well you get the picture.  The PPI at -0.4% was so bad it is now indicating DEFLATION….but no worries — Janet and her band of merry men and women are singing about the benefits of that still strong NFP report from two weeks ago — in fact on Friday — Cleveland Fed Pres Loretta Mester said that the time to hike rates was ‘quickly approaching’….suggesting that the time is now for rates to rise…and so what we are seeing is a re-pricing of risk assets across the spectrum — why?  Because they (the FED)  clearly missed that opportunity 2 or 3 times already and the mkt is telling us that NOW is not the time to move on rates - especially in light of the weekend's events…..what’s the rush?  I mean the DATA is really not cooperating...but she is trapped - trapped like a rat..... (Remember December is a ‘self imposed’ deadline.) And it was a very disappointing day for retailers on Friday — in fact the retailers rolled over and played dead…..October retail sales rose by 0.1% vs. the 0.3% expectation and if you look at retail sales EX autos, gas, building materials and food services rose by 0.2% vs. the 0.4% expectation.  Add in some weaker than expected earnings and the retailers got slaughtered…..JW Nordstrom (JWN) gave up 15% on horrific earnings, terrible revenues and a cut in full year sales and profit forecasts…. JC Penney  (JCP) also closed down 15% on terrible earnings, but the silver lining for them was that comparable store sales rose by 6.4%......The Gap, Inc. (GPS) -3%,  Kohl's (KSS) -3.2%, Macy's (M) gave up another 2% on top of the 24% in the last week alone.....Target (TGT) lost 2.5%......not a pretty picture by any stretch.....Now Friday afternoon also brought word of a terrorist attack in Paris….and the chaos and confusion that that event created only served to put more pressure on an already weak mkt as investors/traders tried to understand the extent and impact of this horrific event.  As the day drew to a close — more information became available — and the selling pressure picked up into the bell.  Over the weekend — we learned of the very horrific events that engulfed the ‘City of Lights’ — the world mourned — allies stood together, world leaders who had gathered in Turkey for the G20 meeting denounced the actions of those pathetic souls that call themselves ‘jihadists’ — calling this an ‘attack on the civilized world’……. and then President Hollande of France declared ‘war’ on Isis…..Sunday night unleashing a barrage of French bombs — (neatly packed in French air force Rafale Fighter Jets…)  upon the nerve center in Raqqa, Syria — wiping out a command center, a weapons facility, and a training ground… and this is only the beginning…..there is now a global commitment to intensify and eradicate this terrorist organization…… and so it begins - the instability, the fear, the bombs and the continued threats of chaos will now become some of the directional drivers in the global mktplace. Asia was the first mkt center to open — and stocks moved lower as mkts react to the worst terror incident in over a decade…..investors kneejerk reaction is to hit the SELL button (fear) as they assess the impact that this event will have on the European economy and the global economy…. Weaker macro data in Japan also did not help the tone — GDP for the 3rd qtr fell by 0.8% on top of the -0.7% in the 2nd qtr.  Sending that country into RECESSION — this is the second recession since PM Shinzo Abe took office in December 2012.  This news put renewed pressure on Abe and the BoJ Governor Kuroda to do MORE!

March readings for both categories were revised up strongly, however.Department stores were among the big losers in April, with a 2.2% decline that was among the worst of the current economic expansion. Sales at department stores stand roughly 13% below the numbers they logged in the trough of the Great Recession.Macy's (M) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit Wednesday thanks in part to a stronger dollar, which curbed tourist spending, and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port slowdown, which has snarled other barometers of economic activity.Macy's shares fell 2.2% in afternoon trading, while J.C.

It expects the retailer to earn $4.80 a share in fiscal 2015.

784,KSS,"JCPenney (JCP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, providing further evidence that consumer spending isn't as bad as investors had feared.The department store reported a 5 cent per-share loss minus one-time items, narrowing from a 41 cent loss in the same quarter a year earlier, as JCPenney pushed ahead with a reorganization. Analysts expected a 15 cent loss. Revenue grew 1.4% to $2.92 billion, a bit below consensus for $2.93 billion. Comparable-store sales increased 2.2%.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said in a client note after JCPenney earnings that it was ""the only positive comp"" among reporting department stores. Cowen has a market perform rating on JCPenney with a 10 price target.JCPenney Chairman and CEO Marvin Ellison, credited 60 more Sephora store-within-a-store cosmetics and beauty stops, center core refreshes and the rollout of ""buy online, pick up in store same day"" for lifting results. JCPenney stock has climbed 69% since hitting a 2016 low at 6 per share on Jan. 20, including an 8.6% gain Thursday. JCPenney rose 6% to 10.54 in the stock market today, a four-month high.On Thursday, Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) also beat on earnings, providing what Retail Metrics analyst Ken Perkins called ""rays of hope"" that the struggling retail sector may be bottoming. Macy's skyrocketed 17%, and Kohl's jumped 16% on Thursday, rebounding from recent and longer-term downtrends. On Friday, Macy's rose 2 cents to 39.83, while Kohl's climbed 1.7% to 44.95.Nordstrom (JWN) late Thursday reported better-than-expected profit, but revenue was a bit light. Still, Nordstrom rose 8.1% to 51.40 -- back above its 200-day line -- after soaring 7.5% Thursday.The upbeat reports are seen as part of a relief rally after many consumer-related companies, from General Motors (GM) to Ford (F) to McDonald's (MCD), reported sluggish U.S. demand.IBD'S TAKE: JCPenney shares are climbing the right side of a cup base with a 12.09 entry point. Cup and cup-with-handle bases are among the most common patterns stocks form. For more on how to spot winning bases, see the IBD University.Overall retail sales were flat in July, with non-auto sales down 0.3%, the Commerce Department said Friday. July's total was well under estimates of a 0.4% gain. However, June's gain was revised up to 0.8% from the initial 0.6% reading.
"
785,KSS,"Just how strong is the U.S. consumer and what did Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day mean for the broad retail sector last month?Those are two big questions going into Friday's retail sales report from the Commerce Department to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.After a solid 0.6% rise in June, economists expect to see continued momentum, with overall sales rising 0.4% amid an uptick in auto sales from June levels. Yet, thanks partly to lower gas prices, sales excluding autos are expected to rise just 0.1%.But the latest signal on consumer spending offers a hint of possible upside in the retail report. Both Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) slightly beat modest revenue expectations on Thursday when they reported earnings for the quarter ended July. But Macy's and Kohl's did report lower sales vs. a year earlier.A host of retailers, including Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), offered bargains and free shipping in the week of Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. Amazon said Prime orders in the U.S. surged 50% from its inaugural event in 2015, but it didn't reveal its sales tally.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense. Watch this IBD Video for tips on how to quickly identify and research leading stocks that may be ready to buy.July is typically a slow month for retail before the back-to-school season kicks in, so it's possible the sales push could lead to an upside surprise. Two unknowns: Will Prime Day sales by Amazon and competitors eat into back-to-school shopping, and how will July sales look on a seasonally adjusted basis? The latter may depend on how much the Commerce Department has adjusted its seasonal models after last year's Prime Day.Nonstore retailers (largely e-commerce) have been by far the strongest retail category, with sales up 14.2% from a year ago in June.With low mortgage rates, building-materials and garden-equipment retailers like Home Depot (HD) likely stayed on a roll after June sales jumped 3.9% from May and 7.6% from a year ago. Home Depot and rival Lowe's (LOW) will report quarterly earnings next week.All signs, though, point to continued softness in sales at food services and drinking places after a 0.3% decline in June. The problem cited by McDonald's (MCD) and multiple industry players is that food at home is looking like an unusually good deal relative to the cost of food away from home. On Wednesday, Wendy's (WEN) scaled back same-store sales growth guidance for 2016 from 3% to a range of 1%-2%.

822,KSS,"Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported better-than-feared second strong quarter earnings, boosting shares of both department store chains and the broader retail sector. Nordstrom (JWN) late Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings.JCPenney (JCP) is queued for early Friday. Retail groups dominated the top-performing industries Thursday on the stock market today.The department stores offered some relief after a procession of consumer-oriented companies -- aside from e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) -- reported sluggish demand, from Ford Motor (F) to McDonald's (MCD), that fueled sector sell-offs often led by department store stocks.Macy's reported a 16% drop in earnings per share minus one-time items to 54 cents, beating estimates for 45 cents. Revenue slid 3.8% to $5.87 billion, the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year declines, but still topping consensus for $5.75 billion.Macy's said overall same-store sales fell 2% vs. a year earlier.The Cincinnati-based company plans to close 100 Macy's full-line locations, or 14%. Most of them will close in early 2017. Coach (COH) said on Tuesday it will shutter some 250 locations -- known as ""doors"" -- or about 25% of the total it has within North America, as part of ""the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning.""Macy's said it's still seeing lower-than-normal store spending, but left its full-year guidance intact. The company sees EPS of $3.15-$3.40, with the midpoint slightly above consensus.Kohl's Q2 EPS rose 14% to $1.22, easily topping views for $1.03. Sales fell 2.1% to $4.18 billion, better than the expected $4.16 billion.Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman and CEO, said in a statement, ""Our sales improved over our first-quarter results but were below our expectations."" As a result, the company cut its full-year earnings guidance to $3.80-$4, down from $4.05-$4.25 previously but still above analysts' consensus for $3.83 at the midpoint.Macy's stock spiked 17.1% to 39.81 Thursday, the highest since the beginning of May. Macy's is trading above 200-day line for the first time in a year, as it tries to break a long downtrend.Kohl's rose 16.2% to 44.19. It's still well below below its 2016 high of 52.06, set on Jan. 7.Retails Metrics analyst Ken Perkins said in a report that for Macy's and Kohl's earnings provided ""rays of hope"" as inventories and margins improved. Still, he noted that ""both retailers guided FY16 earnings below the current consensus.""IBD'S TAKE: Traditional department stores such as Macy's, Kohl's and Nordstrom are getting beaten down by online retailers like Amazon. Giant Wal-Mart is trying to stem the tidy by buying a strong online presence.Retailers are under pressure due to a confluence of negatives. Fashion houses Kate Spade (KATE) and Michael Kors (KORS) noted in their reports that tourists visiting certain key cities have cut back on spending at their stores. The strong dollar is seen as the culprit, making some affordable luxury items too pricey for tourists.Spade and Kors also cited less foot traffic in malls. Consumers continue to opt for online bargains shipped to their home, for free if they're members of a service like Amazon's $99 a year Amazon Prime free shipping and video streaming.Brick-and-mortar retailers may continue to lose share in the crucial holiday buying season, while Amazon and other online retailers continue growing.Nordstrom jumped 7.5% at the close, then spiked after hours after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings. JCPenney climbed 8.6%, with analysts expecting a smaller loss Friday morning.The Commerce Department's July retail sales report, due Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show a 0.4% rise, or a 0.2% increase when excluding autos. There could also be an Amazon Prime Day effect in the data.

823,KSS,"Stock indexes chugged ahead Thursday afternoon, as strength in the retail and apparel sectors aided the market.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8%, hitting fresh all-time highs after consolidating for three weeks. The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, also setting a new record. The Nasdaq rose 0.6%, just below its peaks. Volume was running narrowly lower on the NYSE but much lower on the Nasdaq in the stock market today.The S&P 500's biggest gainers came from the retail and apparel sectors. Macy's (M) surged 17%; Kohl's (KSS) rose 16.5%; Nordstrom (JWN) climbed 7%; Ralph Lauren (RL) added nearly 6%; and Under Armour (UA) was also up 5%.Macy's, Kohl's results were not great, but they topped Wall Street's consensus earnings estimate by margins of 18% to 20%, a day after Ralph Lauren did the same. Nordstrom will report after the close. Under Armour reported in late July and matched estimates. Macy's also said it will close 100 stores.None of the stocks is top-rated. The department stores and apparel groups are market laggards. Under Armour has the best earnings rating of the five -- its EPS Rating is 72, which means about 28% of the stocks in IBD's database are growing earnings faster than Under Armour.Despite the weak ratings, the retail and apparel groups are relevant. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of overall U.S. economic activity.On Friday, the Commerce Department will report retail sales for July. The consensus estimate is for a 0.4% increase. Wall Street's estimates range from 0.2% to 0.7%. If the report is positive, it will be the fourth consecutive month of improvement. The report for June came in at 0.6%, easily topping the Street's consensus estimate for 0.1%.Recently, retail sales reports around the world have favored the optimists.In Britain, retail sales in July increased 1.1% vs. the year-earlier period, defying those who said the exit from the European Union would act as a depressant. The July sales pop, which was reported Tuesday, was the biggest in six months.Brazil, which is in a recession, reported Tuesday that retail sales inched up 0.1% in June. While the gain was tiny, most economists expected a drop. Consumer confidence and business confidence have been climbing since Michel Temer, the acting president, took over in May. Temer is seen as more business-friendly than recent presidents in Brazil have been. Deposed president Dilma Rousseff, a leftist, faces an impeachment trial.On Wednesday, Hong Kong's largest mall operator, Wharf Holdings, said revenue jumped 12% in the past six months. This was rare good news on Hong Kong's retail front. A downturn in tourism has hammered Hong Kong retailers. On Aug. 2, the South China Morning Post reported that retail sales skidded 10.5% in the first half of this year. Q2 retail sales, however, improved compared with Q1.

Cirrus Logic (CRUS) slid 7% in busy trading and fell below the 50-day moving average.

But investors soon soured on the athletic apparel maker's quarterly earnings and new moves.During the company's second-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Kevin Plank announced offensives on several fronts, including the takeover of the iconic former FAO Schwarz store on Fifth Avenue in New York City, reportedly beating out Nike (NKE) for the 53,000 square-foot space.He called the move a ""flag in the ground"" for Under Armour's product teams, ""putting the world on notice.""""Being there, at the mouth of Central Park, on the opening of Fifth Avenue, we think it's a great platform for the brand,"" said Plank. ""We're really going to be able to define ourselves as the company we expect to be.""Under Armour will move in by the middle of 2019 at the latest, he said, after another tenant uses the space temporarily.Plank also said the Baltimore-based brand will be found at Kohl's (KSS) as of next year, greatly expanding Under Armour's presence in U.S. stores. He also touted Under Armour's new premium sportswear line, UAS (which he also referred to as a ""flag in the ground."") The first pieces from the collection, designed by Tim Coppens, will be available this September.""This is not about being on trend or capturing the athleisure market,"" said Plank during the call. ""Consumers have the expectation that performance product is not just functional, but is fully executed through fit and style.""Plank sees the collection as an opportunity for customers to not just wear the brand on the field or at the gym, but ""to wear us to school, out at night and other wearing occasions."" He said he was wearing the new UAS line during the call.""I think I look great,"" he said.Investors weren't so sure, with some analysts worried that a move to value department chains would erode Under Armour's brand.Shares initially rose to 44.68 but reversed hard, falling 5.1% to 41.36 in the stock market today and undercutting the 200-day moving average.

Footwear revenue grew 58%, thanks again to the popularity of Stephen Curry's basketball footwear. Accessories sales rose 21%.In North America, Q2 revenue rose 22%. Plank continues to see California as a growth opportunity and says he feels the company hadn't previously been aggressive enough in pursuing the market, hence the ""bold bets"" Under Armour has made in making sponsorship deals with the University of California at Berkeley and UCLA.""We're in the state of California,"" said Plank. ""We do think it's an opportunity for us, but we think it's also a top market globally and something we think is also a bit of a leaping board for us as we look to Asia and other markets abroad too.""International revenue rose 68% (72% excluding currency), and accounted for 15% of total sales during the quarter.The company said it continues to sees full-year revenue of $4.925 billion.Plank added that the ""Connected Fitness"" suite of apps now has 175 million users.""We continue to like UA, given the footwear opportunity (price realization/unit growth), international expansion opportunities and (direct-to-consumer) execution, and see rev growth of (roughly) 30% over the next several years,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson early Tuesday, prior to the call.

873,KSS,"Even with Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day, retail sales were merely flat in July, with non-auto sales down 0.3%, the Commerce Department said Friday.While July's totals came in well below expectations for an overall 0.4% gain, and a 0.2% rise outside the auto sector, the disappointment was softened by an upward revision to June numbers. The overall gain was revised to 0.8% from 0.6%, with sales outside autos rising 0.9%, up from 0.7%.Still, the year-over-year gain in retail sales slowed to 2.3%, which may slightly ding confidence in the strength of the American consumer. While a 2.7% drop in gas station sales held down July spending, consumers didn't put the money to work elsewhere.Non-store retailers continued to stand out, with sales rising 1.3% on the month and 14.1% on the year. That was surely helped by Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. Amazon said Prime orders in the U.S. surged 50% from the company's inaugural event in 2015, but it didn't reveal its sales tally.But efforts by Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and others to piggyback or cut into Amazon's big day may have fallen flat. General merchandise store sales dipped 0.1%, while department stores saw sales continue to decline, off 0.5% on the month and down 4.0% from a year earlier.Both Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) slightly beat modest revenue expectations on Thursday, while Nordstrom (JWN) saw a much smaller drop in same-store sales than analysts expected. All three companies saw sales drop from a year earlier. JCPenney (JCP), a relative bright spot, said on Friday that same-store sales rose 2.2% from a year before, about as expected.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense. Watch this IBD Video for tips on how to quickly identify and research leading stocks that may be ready to be bought.July is typically a slow month for retail before the back-to-school season kicks in, so it's possible the sales push could lead to an upside surprise. Two unknowns: Will Prime Day sales by Amazon and competitors eat into back-to-school shopping, and how will July sales look on a seasonally adjusted basis? The latter may depend on how much the Commerce Department has adjusted its seasonal models after last year's Prime Day.Building-materials and garden-equipment retailers like Home Depot (HD) saw sales ease 0.5% after an upwardly revised 4.2% surge in June. Home Depot and rival Lowe's (LOW) will report quarterly earnings next week.Sales at food services and drinking places continued to be soft, falling 0.2% after an upwardly revised 0.3% rise in June. The problem cited by McDonald's (MCD) and multiple industry players is that food at home is looking like an unusually good deal relative to the cost of food away from home. On Wednesday, Wendy's (WEN) scaled back same-store sales growth guidance for 2016 from 3% to a range of 1%-2%.

It was trading slightly lower Thursday.Discount giant Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), which also reported Q3 results Thursday, was up 0.3% at 79.17. The world's biggest retailer topped profit views by a penny, while revenue came in slightly below. Like Kohl's, it lowered its full-year outlook. Total U.S same-store sales excluding fuel slipped 0.1%.Investors will find out later today if Macy's results mean the middle-to-upper-income retail segment is indeed faring better, when Nordstrom (JWN) reports after the close.

1055,KSS,"It is no secret by now that consumers, especially millennials and younger generations, increasingly desire products that are more convenient, up-to-date with currents trends, and reasonably priced. That is especially evident in the fast-paced and dynamic fashion retail industry, as shown by “fast fashion” and its effects on the entire business.The term fast fashion is defined by retailers that attempt to mimic current fashion trends as quickly as possible—at a price that general consumers in the clothing sector can afford. Companies are able to keep up with fluctuating trends and produce the products in a cost-efficient manner through the use of extremely advanced supply chains and dedicated market research.The Rise of Fast FashionThe move towards fast fashion was initially lead by innovation-focused companies like Zara (IDEXY  -  Free Report) and H&M. These European brands were able to revolutionize the fashion retail industry in the early parts of the 21st Century and become household names.An example of a company that has more recently been able to take advantage of the trend towards fast fashion is lifestyle brand Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report), which is known for catering to a mainly young adult demographic through hip and stylish merchandise.  The stock has soared since this time last year, with prices climbing up over 150% to its current position at around $44.One of the key drivers in the company’s progress has been its ability to accurately adapt to the newest fashion trends, and it is only expected to continue doing so in the future, according to analysts.  Increased analyst bullishness is one part of why Urban Outfitters currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another recent victory for fast fashion was Japanese company Uniqlo partnering with tennis legend Roger Federer. The $300 million deal made headlines due to the shock value of someone as well-known as Federer leaving sports apparel giant Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) for the lesser known Uniqlo.The tennis star’s new sponsor doesn’t even focus mainly on sports like Nike does, but instead would be labeled as a fast fashion brand that tracks the world’s latest trends. Although it may not be a major hit for Nike right now, the move showed the power of fast fashion and its potential for even greater growth in the future.Traditional Retail’s ResponseCaught right in the middle of the fast fashion and online shopping storm are traditional retailers that have been staples in the clothing sector for a long time, including Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report).In order to survive, these major companies are forced to make decisions on how to respond to the changes in today’s retailing and clothing landscape. It comes with no surprise that both companies have already made moves in attempts to maintain their positions in the industry.On Tuesday, Nordstrom laid out a new five-year growth plan that was clearly influenced by the fast fashion movement. The plan centered on boosting the company’s e-commerce presence as foot traffic at malls has continued to decline.  However, the announcement was mainly met with negative reactions due to the costs associated with implementing all of the initiatives. It seems as if the company may have adjusted to consumer trends too and will now have to fight to catch up.While it’s still unclear as to how Nordstrom’s initial moves will play out, its apparel retailing counterpart, Kohl’s, struck gold with its own solution. The company signed a deal with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) in September of 2017, and the massive partnership has paid off big time, with the stock rising 64% since the move was announced.  Kohl’s teaming up with Amazon tremendously bolstered the retailer’s evolution towards becoming more convenient and faster.Bottom LineThere is no denying the shift towards clothing that is easily accessible and consistent with the latest fashion trends. Investors should take note of fast fashion brands, like Urban Outfitters, which are perfectly suited to the new fast-paced environment in retailing.On the other side, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, and similar traditional retailers should be looked at with greater caution as they continue to deal with how to adapt to fast fashion. These companies will have to pursue innovation and continue making strategic initiatives to stay at the forefront of retailing. Clothing retailers like Kohl’s that make successful changes should see growth, while others could be left behind.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1056,KSS,"Investors must take note of Kohl's Corporation’s (KSS  -  Free Report) stupendous bull run. The company, which has been progressing ahead with its robust sales-driving initiatives, has seen its stock rally a significant 100.8% in a year’s time. In fact, Kohl’s also surpassed the industry’s solid growth of 74.3%. Although the company is incurring high SG&A costs, we expect its traffic and sales driving efforts to wipe off these woes and help it grow further. Kohl’s Driving FactorsKohl’s has been trying hard to attract more shoppers and improve sales. In fact, such efforts have been aiding the company deliver positive comps since the past three quarters, thereby driving its overall performance. Strong comps indicate that the company’s strategic initiative, Greatness Agenda, has been yielding favorably. The initiative, which commenced in first-quarter fiscal 2014, was designed to drive transactions per store and sales.Additionally, the company has been strengthening its ties with retail giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to drive traffic. Incidentally, the company has started accepting returns for Amazon’s customers on select products and it will also provide free packing and shipping services for the merchandise to Amazon’s fulfillment centers. This move followed Kohl's decision to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. In the long run, the company is expected to receive significant boost to its business through this partnership. Further, Kohl’s recent partnership with Aldi is also expected to strengthen its store base.We also expect Kohl’s to continue gaining from its strong brand portfolio.  Exclusive brands such as Simply Vera by fashion designer Vera Wang have helped draw customers to Kohl's stores in the past. Moreover, brands like Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) have particularly been doing well in the active category. Kohl’s also regularly introduces new brands in order to keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive traffic.  In line with this strategy, Kohl's revealed its plan to launch a fresh apparel collection named POPSUGAR at Kohl’s, which is likely to expand Kohl’s millennial brand portfolio and help the company identify customers’ needs more accurately.Moreover, the company has experienced significant growth in its e-commerce business since the last few years. In order to improve its online offerings, Kohl’s has been expanding its e-commerce fulfillment centers and opened its fifth facility in August 2017. Additionally, it focuses on strengthening its in-store pickups. The company’s sustained focus on technology improvements and the omnichannel expansion are expected to have a significant positive impact on its online sales that surged 20% during the first quarter.Backed by such efforts, Kohl’s comps increased 3.6% during first-quarter fiscal 2018, with revenues up 3.5%. Moreover, solid top-line performance along with effective inventory management propelled gross margin to expand 50 basis points. Notably, with the first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Kohl’s marked its fourth consecutive top-line beat, while earnings came ahead of estimates for the second successive time. While management expects SG&A expenses to rise in the bracket of 1-2% during fiscal 2018, the aforementioned endeavors and management’s earnings guidance keep us confident about Kohl’s ongoing prospects.Well, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects adjusted earnings for fiscal 2018 to come in the band of $5.05-$5.50 per share.

1057,KSS,"Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime Day event is going to be an extravaganza this year. To be celebrated over 36 hours, longest in the company’s history, the event is set to kick off on Jul 16 at 3 p.m. ET.The annual Amazon Prime Day is an event similar to Cyber Monday or Black Friday. Started in 2015, it offers special deals including deep discounts on Amazon’s own products like Echo Dot, Fire tablet, the Kindle device and Happy Belly bottled water, among others.Notably, Amazon Prime Day is only open to members of the Prime subscription service, which has crossed more 100 million of paid members globally (as of April 2018).Last year, the 30-hour event turned out to be a blockbuster, marking the biggest shopping day in the company's history. As a record number of Prime members shopped across 13 countries, Prime Day sales jumped 60% year over year and reportedly generated $1 billion revenues.Moreover, tens of millions of Prime members purchased items during the shopping event, up 50% from Prime Day 2016. Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote 2018 Event Expected to Surpass All RecordsThis year’s event is expected to beat all records, primarily due to the length of the event as well as deep discounts in all products, including Whole Foods grocery items for the first time.Amazon stated that Prime Day 2018 will feature “more than one million deals exclusively for Prime members around the world, plus select deals at all U.S. Whole Foods Market stores.”Amazon has already started marketing campaigns to promote the event, apart from providing with mouth-watering deals. Reportedly, as a part of marketing campaigns, 25-foot boxes are expected to pop up in New York/Los Angeles, London, Tokyo and Milan. These boxes will open to reveal a pop-up event that will be live-streamed on Amazon’s website.Meanwhile, in a pre-cursor to the main event, Amazon is offering great deals on apparel and accessories (starting Jul 9), Home furnishings, electronics and more (though Jul 15), and Everyday essentials.Per data cited by CNBC data from One Click Retail, the 2018 Prime Day is expected to showcase 80 in-house brands from Amazon, up from almost 40 in 2017.Amazon brands such as Stone & Beam, Rivet, Presto!, Wickedly Prime, Solimo, Goodthreads, Daily Ritual, and AmazonBasics are expected to make significant impact in this year’s event. This is primarily due to accelerating number of Prime members, who have been found to be more loyal toward Amazon’s in-house brands. The company’s strategy of launching new products frequently is also a key driver.This year, Amazon is set to launch 30 new products from Rivet and Stone & Beam, as well as new apparel from brands like Isle Bay Linens.Consulting firm PwC expects home and garden, apparel and accessories, and health and beauty products to be the top product categories in 2018 Prime Day.Prime Program to Get a BoostPrime Day is exclusive for the members of the Prime subscription program. The lengthy 2018 event and portfolio strength is expected to provide a further boost to the program’s subscriber base.Notably, a large number of new members joined Amazon’s Prime on Jul 11, last year (2017 Prime Day) than on any other day in the company's history.In 2017, the company witnessed five billion of item shipments via Prime services across the world. Amazon also announced that more paid members joined Prime in 2017 than any previous year, both worldwide and in the United States.Further, per the Morgan Stanley estimates, Prime subscribers will account for 51% of the United States population in 2018, up 45% from 2017.We believe that Amazon’s continuous efforts in making Prime more customer friendly will continue to drive subscription base of the service, which will eventually drive top-line growth.Moreover, the service is expected to help Amazon improve its dominant position in the retail market space amid intensifying competition from companies like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS  -  Free Report).Currently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1058,KSS,"Online retail sales continue to soar, with bellwether Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) market cap topping $800 billion. But, their outsized gains haven’t hampered traditional retailers much. All of retailers have been part of a broad-based rally so far this year but hardly any of them are trading near peak levels. Obviously, they have more room to run and this growth narrative is well supported by strong fundamentals.From e-commerce and comparable sales trends to profit margins and earnings to traffic, all have improved this year. Given this bullishness, investors should double down on the hottest retail stocks now.Amazon’s Burgeoning Retail BusinessAmazon is well positioned to cash in on the next wave of online retail. The interesting part is that retail accounts for 60% of its revenues. Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market last year and is aiming to expand its fresh food offerings. At the same time, it is trying to succeed in harder-to-deliver categories like apparels through its Prime Wardrobe segment. Such efforts are paying off.Amazon’s share price went up 1.4% on Jun 4 and finished at a record for the sixth straight session. The e-commerce giant’s market capitalization is now at $801.3 billion. Amazon is just behind Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which presently has the highest market cap of $943.7 billion (read more: Amazon's Retail & Budding Web Services Make It a Real Deal).Traditional Retailers Fight Back Traditional retailers, by the way, have adapted against Amazon and other digital commercial threat. They are expanding their omnichannel presence and gaining customers. Lest we forget, not long ago, traditional retailers were compelled to downsize their operations to accommodate low customer flow. However, this discouraging trend appears to be over. After all, a number of malls are getting a facelift, which is driving traffic.Retailers, in fact, are on a hiring spree. They have led the way in hiring by increasing employment by 31,000 last month. This shows that they are in an expansion mode and their businesses are churning out huge profits. And why not? Sales at U.S. retailers rose in broad fashion in April as fatter after-tax pay checks helped compensate the uptick in fuel cost. Per the Commerce Department, sales increased 0.3% in April, matching the median forecast, after a 0.8% rise in the prior month (read more: 5 Stocks En Vogue on a Broad Rise in US Retail Sales).Retail Stocks RallyAs traditional retailers have started to co-exist with Internet retailers, retail stocks are on a rally mode. So far this year, the SPDR S&P Retail is up 3.5% versus a meager 0.8% of the S&P 500. The two big departmental stores, in particular, surged this year. While the Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) soared nearly 32% on a year-to-date basis, Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) was up 41%.Diane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager at TCW Group, added that “departmental stores are doing well because of the massive upgrade of Macy’s by Evercore, which said that the worst is over for the sector.” Macy’s has already exceeded same-store sales expectations in the recent quarter and has lifted its guidance for fiscal 2018.Sports retailers are also among the big winners. Shares of Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report), Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) are all up more than 15% so far this year. Among smaller retailers, Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO  -  Free Report), to name a few, are also up more than 20%. Their margin erosion is moderating, comparable sales are rising and profit margins are stabilizing.5 Top PicksGiven the aforesaid positives, it will be prudent to invest in the best retail stocks. Americans have ramped up spending on wage gains and bigger paychecks owing to the recent tax cuts. This rise in spending levels will lend a boost to retailers.

1061,KSS,"Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) longest Prime Day is expected to hit hard prominent retailers’ efforts to cash-in on the back-to-school season in 2018.Started in 2015, Amazon’s Prime Day offers special deals, including deep discounts on in-house products. Notably, the event is only open to members of the Prime subscription service, which has crossed more than 100 million of paid members globally (as of April 2018).Amazon’s Prime Day has been a success as it helps the company generate strong sales in a traditionally slower part of the year. Per Cowen & Co. and JP Morgan Chase analysis, quoted by CNBC, Amazon generated $1 billion in sales on 2017 Prime Day.Moreover, since 2017 Prime Day (Jul 10), Amazon’s shares have returned 70.6%, better than the industry’s rally of 39.1% and a host of competitors. Amazon's Price Performance (Since Jul 10, 2017) We expect 2018 to be a no-exception, primarily due to growing number of deals (more than one million per Amazon). Moreover, Prime’s expanding international subscriber base is a key catalyst. Per MarketWatch, Prime members in Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg will also participate in the event this year.Amazon Disrupts Back-to-School Season MarketAugust-September has been traditionally considered as the back-to-school season in the United States. The importance of this season lies in the fact that in terms of consumer spending it is second to winter holidays. According to Deloitte, 50% of school related annual spending happens during back-to-school season.Hence, retailers are eager to leverage the increased traffic to enrol customers into their loyalty programs that ensures revenue visibility throughout the year.However, Amazon’s Prime Day, which is held a month earlier, has disrupted this trend.MarketWatch cited data from Cardlytics 2018 Back-to-School Spend Report, which states that Prime Day has brought in a change in consumer behavior. Consumers now prefer to stock-up back-to-school season supplies a month-ahead to benefit from the deep discounts offered by Prime Day.Further, per the Cardlytics report, “back-to-school spending continues to grow, but shoppers are making fewer purchases, while spending more each time.”The change in consumer behavior is also supported by RetailMeNot data. According to its latest survey, 91% parents surveyed are planning to do their back-to-school shopping on Prime Day and almost 40% of their planned spending is likely to be on back-to-school items.Although this trend doesn’t bode well for brick-and-mortar retailers, it is significant for Amazon. The company is leaving no stone unturned to lure back-to-school customers. It recently announced new Back to School and Off to College online stores. The lower-priced stores are expected to further drive traffic and sales.Moreover, Amazon has introduced an option to allow teens aged 13 to 17 shop independently on the Amazon app, under parental monitoring. Per MarketWatch, college students can also rent or purchase textbooks.How Retailers are Preparing to Counter Amazon?Retailers with compelling offers and deep discounts are expected to woo most of the back-to-school spenders, only if they offer it in early summer.Per Deloitte’s survey, 60% shoppers hitting stores before August are anticipated to spend an average of $532, 16% higher than the remaining 40% of parents who start shopping in August or later ($458).Hence, the July event has forced many retailers to match Amazon’s footsteps in offering back-to-school products. Prominent retailers like J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), Kohl’s Corp (KSS  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) have taken a number of initiatives to attract the back-to-school traffic.Notably, J.C. Penny has partnered with Fanatics to launch Fanatics shops that sell licensed sports merchandise.Retail giant Walmart is bolstering its online shopping features by offering 3-D Virtual Shopping Tour, especially for dorm rooms and small living spaces. The company is also offering curated collections that can be purchased together, called “Buy the Room.”Kohl’s has begun seasonal hiring much earlier at more than 300 of its 1,100 stores to support the peak shopping seasons.Moreover, eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) announced an expansion to its price-matching program to more than 100,000 items across its marketplace, up from 50,000 items.ConclusionAmazon’s aggressive retail strategy, expanding seller base and distribution strength will continue to benefit it in gaining traction in the retail space.Retailers are also preparing themselves to counter Amazon’s growing threat in every possible way.However, Amazon and the retailer tussle is ultimately proving beneficial to consumers, who are encashing the deep discounts and deals.While Amazon, J.C. Penny, Kohl’s and Walmart currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), eBay carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1062,KSS,"Shares of Macy's (M  -  Free Report) popped over 1.5% on Thursday to inch closer to their 52-week high as investors begin to assess the possibility of a brighter future for the much-maligned retailer.Some of the most recent Macy’s positivity might be attributed to President Donald Trump’s renewed public attack on Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), based on what he views as unfair tax treatment toward the e-commerce powerhouse.The validity of these concerns aside, Macy’s has to do far more than bank on any Amazon downturn. Luckily for investors, the department store has indeed made improvements to its business that might warrant investor consideration.Macy’s announced last week that it is set to debut app-based mobile checkout at locations around the country, designed to decrease wait times. The company is also expected to roll out a new augmented reality furniture shopping feature that will be accessible through the Macy’s app as early as April.These moves are part of a bigger digital push that includes offerings such as Amazon-like locker pickups for online sales, which have led to real results.The fourth quarter marked the 34th-straight quarter in which Macy’s posted double-digit growth in its digital business. Meanwhile, the company’s overall Q4 revenues climbed by 1.8% to reach $8.67 billion, with comps up 1.4%. Macy’s adjusted earnings surged nearly 40% from the year-ago period and also beat our Zacks Consensus Estimate.Recent Price PerformanceShares of Macy’s have dipped slightly since the company reported its Q4 earnings results last month. However, this shouldn’t detract from the bigger picture, as Macy’s stock has soared over the last six months, outpacing its industry’s average.ValuationInvestors should also note that, despite Macy’s recent price performance strength, the company has consistently traded at a substantial discount to its industry’s average. Macy’s Forward P/E of roughly 8.2 also marks a discount to direct rivals Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), which are currently trading at roughly 13x forward earnings.OutlookMacy’s has earned seven earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days. This has raised the retailer’s full-year earnings estimate from $2.80 per share to $3.63 per share.Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Macy’s first-quarter earnings to soar by 50% to hit $0.36 per share. The retailer’s Q1 revenues are projected to reach $5.42 billion, which would mark a more modest 1.5% climb.Bottom LineMacy’s has been able to fight through some rough times and has seen its shares surge accordingly. The retailer has also committed to improving its e-commerce business and deployed some app-based innovations aimed at sparking continued growth.Furthermore, the department store bellwether is trading at a discount to some of its biggest competitors and is trading at an even more attractive valuation than it was just a month ago. Coupled with the fact that Macy’s stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for both Value and Growth in our Styles Scores system, now might be an intriguing time to buy.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

The company said similar situation will persist in the first half of fiscal 2018.Nevertheless, Collectibles sales surged 22.8% to $260.8 million buoyed by growth of licensed merchandise offerings and promotions during holiday season.GameStop intends to enhance collectibles business to $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2019.

1065,KSS,"Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) saw its stock price pop marginally on Wednesday as part of a month-long climb that has seen shares of the off-price clothing retailer surge nearly 6%. Now, let’s see if Ross’ run looks poised to continue by taking a quick look at its first-quarter earnings outlook.Over the last year, shares of Ross have surged nearly 33%, outpacing its industry’s climb of roughly 23%—which includes the likes of Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report) and TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report). Ross also crushed the S&P 500’s 13.4% climb.With that said, Ross stock could stall if the company reports lower-than-expected first quarter financial results Thursday. Ross might be under even more pressure since fellow brick-and-mortar retailers Macy’s (M), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have all reported their Q1 earnings, with mixed results. This means investors need to pay close attention to Ross’ most up-to-date top and bottom line estimates.Q1 OutlookRoss is projected to report quarterly revenues of $3.53 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. This would mark a 6.9% climb from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to soar by 29.27% to reach $1.06 per share.However, investors also need to understand what chance Ross has to top our earnings estimate as this could help its stock price keep on moving upward, while a miss could lead to a decline—at least in the near-term.  Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Heading into Thursday, Ross’ Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—called for earnings of $1.07 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.Ross is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 1.17%, meaning investors can consider ROST a stock that could top quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday.  Investors should also note that Ross has topped quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing 15 quarters.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1066,KSS,"US department stores are revamping themselves to cope with the changing retail landscape, and they have come a long way in the process. In fact, these stores have borne the brunt of changing consumer spending habits, lower traffic in brick-and-mortar stores due to rise in online shopping, and stiff competition from discount retailers. Not to forget, they even struggled to keep pace with the fast-changing fashion trends and scored lower in offering customers with a better bargain option.Although some of the headwinds still linger, department stores have taken initiatives to be in the race and cater to growing customer needs. From opening smaller-format stores to bringing in new loyalty program and from embracing new technologies to providing fast delivery options on online purchase or via apps, department store retailers have been looking at every nook and cranny for solutions to survive. Notably, better price, omni-channel capabilities and unique products can help them stand in good stead.Apart from these initiatives, conducive economic environment is an added advantage to these department store retailers.Americans are way more confident now, thanks to a robust job market as evident from the fall in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits and jobless rate hovering at an 18-year low. This along with tax reform and sound economic fundamentals are likely to boost consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy. Per industry experts, second-quarter GDP rate likely to come ahead of 4%.Cumulatively aforementioned factors will play a vital role in improving sales and earnings trends of these department store retailers. Based on an impressive earnings outlook, the Retail-Regional Department Stores occupies a favorable position in the list of Zacks industries. The industry currently carries a Zacks Rank of #21, which places it at the top 8% of more than 250 Zacks industries.From the industry we have highlighted three stocks that have advanced more than 10% in the past three months.The Three MusketeersDillard's (DDS  -  Free Report) is one of the prominent players among fashion apparel, cosmetics and home furnishing retailers. The company’s strategy of offering fashion-forward and trendy products acts as a catalyst for attracting more customers. Its focus on increasing productivity, enhancing domestic operations and developing omni-channel platform is likely to strengthen customer base and boost profitability.The company has surged 19.5% in the past three months. Much of this growth can be attributed to the company’s robust surprise trend. Notably, Dillard’s delivered third consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise in first-quarter fiscal 2018, along with fourth straight sales beat. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), which offers moderately priced exclusive and national brands, witnessed its shares rise by 12.6% in the past three months, courtesy of effective sales-driving initiatives that have been driving comparable sales growth. The company’s multi-year Greatness Agenda strategy has been yielding results. Further, the company’s sustained focus on technology improvements and the omni-channel expansion are expected to have a significant positive impact on its online sales.The company also maintains a unique partnership with the e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Incidentally, it has started accepting returns for Amazon customers on select products and provides free packing and shipping services for the merchandise to Amazon’s fulfillment centers. This move followed Kohl's decision to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices in its selected stores. Kohl’s believes that this store-within-store concept will boost stores traffic. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) sustained focus on price optimization, omni-channel capabilities, merchandise planning and online order fulfillment centers are the primary catalysts facilitating in meeting customer-oriented demand. The company introduced various innovative services including Apple Pay, Same Day Delivery, Enhanced Shopping Apps, Macy’s Image Search and Macy’s Wallet/Bloomingdale’s Wallet. The company’s “Buy Online Pickup in Store” initiative is also gaining traction.Macy’s has added a new feature to its mobile app called Mobile Checkout, which allows customers to scan bar codes of items and pay via smartphones. Macy’s acquired STORY, a concept store, to enhance the in-store customer experience. Further, it has taken a minority stake in b8ta, a technology retailer that enables customers to try, buy and learn about new tech products.

1067,KSS,"The online retail stocks were hit hard on Jun 21, 2018 on the ruling of the supreme court of the United States (SCOTUS) on sales tax. The 5-4 ruling permits states to collect sales taxes from online and out-of-state retailers. The latest decision reverses a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that prohibited the practice.Justice Anthony Kennedy noted that the reason for the upturn in the previous ruling was the radical change in online retail industry. The 1992 ruling was mainly concerned about the mail-order business worth $180 billion.But now the online retail industry has ballooned.  ""Last year, e-commerce retail sales alone were estimated at $453.5 billion,” he mentioned. This along with traditional remote sellers amounted to more than half a trillion dollars.Below we highlight a few ETF and stock winners and losers following the Supreme tax ruling.Brick-and Mortar Retailers: A Clear Winner Brick-and Mortar retailers became the most-expected winners. Companies like Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) (up 0.7%) and Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) (up 1.14%) thus gained on Jun 21. The broader retail ETF VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) added about 0.24% on that day.Online Retailers: An Obvious Loser  Online retail ETFs like Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report) (down 1.4%) and ProShares Long Online/Short Stores ETF (CLIX  -  Free Report) (down 2.3%) slid on Jun 21, to reflect the Supreme Court ruling.Amazon: A Surprising Long-Term WinnerThough online retail behemoth Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) lost more than 1.1% on Jun 21, experts do not foresee the company to suffer from the ruling. This is because “Amazon already collects sales tax on the products it sells directly.” Since this makes up about half of all units sold on its site, the court ruling should not have much impact on Amazon.However, the rest of the products are sold by third-party merchants on Amazon's marketplace and “the ruling doesn't make clear how third-party sales should be taxed,” per a law professor at the University of Arizona, as quoted on CNBC. Even Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea believes that whether higher taxes on those smaller retailers’ goods will at all affect Amazon's overall revenues is still unclear.Moreover, companies such as Amazon and eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) (down 3.25% on Jun 21) have wide international exposure, which should cushion them from U.S. State taxes. So, investors can have faith on Amazon-heavy ETFs like Consumer Discret Sel Sect SPDR ETF (XLY  -  Free Report) (read: May's Retail Sales Growth Highest in 6 Months: ETFs & Stocks).Small Online Retailers Likely to be Hard-HitSmaller online retailers with concentrated exposure to the U.S. market are likely to be knocked-down the most. Notably, online retailer Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) shed a solid 7.2% on Jun 21. The company generates sales mainly from the United States.Consumers May Feel the Pinch Overall, if taxes are hiked, companies may choose to pass that burden on to consumers. So, consumers’ shopping bills could see a jump ahead. iShares US Consumer Services ETF (IYC  -  Free Report) should thus be on investors’ radar.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

1068,KSS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Kohl's has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.4. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Kohl's current PE level puts it above its midpoint of over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 31.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Kohl's has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Kohl's stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Kohl's has a P/S ratio of about 0.7. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. This makes the stock undervalued from the P/S aspect as well.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Kohl's currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Kohl's a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Kohl's might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C. This gives KSS a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to none downward revision, while the next year estimate has seen three upward and none downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate, as the current year consensus estimate has surged 1.1% in the past month, while the next year estimate has increased 2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Kohl's Corporation Price and Consensus Kohl's Corporation Price and Consensus | Kohl's Corporation QuoteEven though Kohl's has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineKohl's is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, the stock possesses a solid Zacks Industry Rank (among top 7% of more than 250 industries). In fact, over the past year, its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1069,KSS,"Retail stocks have been the best market performers so far in 2018, handily outpacing the S&P 500.  The industry is up 20% year to date versus 6% for the S&P and some of the best performers, like Amazon (AMZN), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) are up even more.In a blockbuster Q1 earnings season, one retail stock after another reported better-than expected revenues in an environment of low unemployment and Consumer Confidence at an 18-month high.Most of those increased sales have one thing in common – electronic payment. Approximately 67% of in-person sales and virtually 100% of online transactions are made with a credit or debit card. Consumers increasingly prefer the convenience and security of electronic transactions for large purchases all the way down to a cup of coffee.In the shift toward an essentially cashless economy, one big winner is the company who process electronic payments and transfers.Priceless GrowthMastercard (MA  -  Free Report) has been offering credit card processing services for issuing banks since 1966 – way back when credit card transactions happened on those sliding carbon-copy machines.  Originally organized as a cooperative of issuing banks, Mastercard went public in 2006 as an independent transaction processor.Mastercard now has gross sales of $15 billion a year and reported record results in Q1 with gross sales of $3.6B and earnings of $1.50/share, increases of 31% and 49% respectively over the same quarter in 2017. It was the 17th quarter in a row that Mastercard exceeded the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate and 16 subsequent upward revisions now have the consensus for full year 2018 at $6.31/share, an increase of 37% over 2017.  MA is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Payment Solutions for EnterpriseWex Inc (WEX  -  Free Report) provides electronic payment solutions for businesses in three general areas: Fleet Services, Employee Travel and Healthcare. WEX partners with both the customers who utilize the company’s innovative virtual payment solutions and the vendors who provide the goods and services being purchased, using economies of scale to reduce transaction costs.WEX provides detailed information, insights and control over spending, allowing customers to manage costs and reduce paperwork.WEX has also invested in distributed ledger technology especially as it relates to crypto-currencies. Though Bitcoin and other cryptos are not yet widely used for everyday transactions, if they gain favor in the future, WEX will be ready to process payments - and likey one of the leaders in the iindustry.Thanks to steadily growing revenues and earnings, WEX shares have risen 36% in 2018. WEX is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Cash is not DeadAlthough an increasing amount of payments are performed electronically, cash is not dead yet, as many consumers and merchants continue to prefer currency for transactions. Especially when traveling, millions of customers rely on ATM machines for ready cash and operators get paid a fee on every withdrawal.Cardtronics Plc (CATM  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest operator of ATMs, with 230,000 machines in 10 countries processing over 2.6 billion transactions per year. Their customers include large financial institutions like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), TD (TD) and Santander (SOV.C) as well as merchants including Target, Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report).With a history of positive earnings surprises, CATM posted a big earnings beat in Q1, reporting $0.46/share versus estimates of $0.26/share.Cardtronics is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Although new technologies are a lot more interesting to talk about, sometimes the biggest and best company is finding the opportunities for big earnings in the “old” space. Cardtronics certainly has found them in ATMs.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

1070,KSS,"Brush off market volatility, here’s some good news to cherish. With unemployment rate still at a 17-year low, initial jobless claims below the psychological mark, consumer spending being impressive and government expenditure increasing, things appear to be fairly rosy for the U.S. economy. These sentiments were rekindled when the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its third and final estimate for real GDP yesterday.Markedly, real GDP rose 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017, higher than the second estimate of 2.5% and analysts’ expectations of 2.7%. Moreover, real GDP for 2017 climbed 2.3% from the 2016 level, much better than 1.5% growth witnessed in 2016. Also, consumer spending (accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity) grew 4% in the fourth quarter, marking its highest improvement since the fourth quarter of 2014.Apart from this, the favorable economic indicators led to a sixth Fed rate hike last week (since the financial crisis), which was also followed by a raised GDP outlook for 2018. The Fed officials now envision GDP growth rate to be 2.7% up from 2.5% for the year, which may witness two more rate hikes. While President Trump’s latest take on trade policies may hurt business sentiment and expenditure on capital goods, analysts expect government spending and the $1.5-trillion tax cuts to boost economic growth in 2018.Retail Space Rides on Favorable Indicators Clearly, these factors bode well for the Retail-Wholesale sector that has surged 24.6% in a year, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 12.4%. As consumers form the lifeline of the sector, metrics like consumer spending and consumer sentiment remain the deciding factor of the retail space’s fate. Though soft traffic and mounting competition due to consumers’ evolving shopping patterns have made things challenging for retailers, they’re exploiting every nook and cranny to keep pace with the changing trends. Retailers are going all the way to enhance omni-channel capabilities, optimize store fleet and undertake restructuring activities.How to Identify the Potential Winners?That said, we picked five top-ranked stocks from the space that have gained more than 30% in a year, crushing the sector’s solid growth.Backed by sound fundamentals and impressive past records, these stocks are surely to be a valuable addition to your portfolio. Moreover, these stocks carry a favorable Growth Style Score, thereby doubling the treat. Growth stocks have solid earnings or revenue growth potential, which should lead to higher stock prices. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) provide the best returns.Shuffle Your Portfolio: 5 Key PicksCalifornia-based The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), with a splendid earnings surprise history, is a solid bet. We commend Gap’s efforts to expand omni-channel operations and its solid focus on Old Navy and Athleta brands. Driven by these efforts, the company has surged about 31% over the past year, faring better than the sector. With a Growth Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 8%, we expect this premier international specialty retailer to reach greater heights. Notably, this Zacks Rank #2 has seen its estimates for the current quarter and the fiscal go up by 5 cents and 32 cents to 46 cents and $2.63, respectively, over the past 30 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Investors can also count on Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report), which has seen its stock soar 33.5% in a year. This retailer of branded apparel products has been riding on solid comparable store sales and gross margin expansion trends, thanks to its strategic growth efforts like focus on store expansions. Moreover, the company has topped earnings estimates consistently for 17 straight quarters. Further, we remain optimistic about Burlington, given its Growth Score of A and a long-term growth rate of a solid 18.6%. Estimates of this Zacks Rank #2 company have gone up by 9.1% to $1.08 and 7.2% to $5.76 for the current quarter and fiscal respectively, over the past month.You may also consider Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (BOOT  -  Free Report), a lifestyle retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories, headquartered in California. The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. The company’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of nearly 23% in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term growth rate of  20.7%. Further, Boot Barn has seen estimates for the current quarter go up from 13 cents to 17 cents in the past 30 days. Notably, the company has put up a superb bull run over a year, with its shares up a whopping 73.7%.Investors can also place bets on Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), which has returned 67.6% over the past year. Flaunting a Growth Score of A, this department store chain is likely to continue gaining from its superb traffic boosting initiatives, robust brand portfolio, inventory management efforts and growing e-commerce business. These strategies have helped this Zacks Rank #2 company deliver positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters. Also, the company with nine positive estimate revisions (in the last 30 days) for the current fiscal has a long-term growth rate of 6.7%.Finally, we suggest taking a look at Tennessee-based, Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report). This major discount retailer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.3% in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #2. Moreover, the company has emerged as a strong contender with a long-term earnings growth rate of 14.6% and a Growth Score of B. Dollar General’s commitment toward better price management, cost containment, private label offering, effective inventory management, merchandise and operational initiatives should drive sales and margins. With estimates for the current quarter and fiscal moving north in the past 30 days, the company has returned 33% in a year.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1071,KSS,"The S&P 500, which had more than tripled on Mar 9 after a grueling spell following the Great Recession, is now on the second-longest and second-highest bull market run in history. The bull run through the 1990s has been the longest. Stocks scaled new highs on Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad.But, recent trade war tensions, uproar in the White House, higher interest rates and half a trillion dollars of loss for tech stocks in just over a two-week span have pushed the index back to critical support at its 200-day moving average. The S&P, in fact, fell into correction territory, while volatility has more than doubled so far this year.Not all S&P stocks are, however, facing a tumultuous Q1. Some of them have been able to dish out impressive year-to-date gains and have remained unperturbed by the higher bouts of gyrations.What Backed the S&P Rally?The S&P started Q1 on a positive note. Trump’s polices, including tax cuts, repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the S&P move north.The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas. This means around $1.2 trillion in foreign profits that the S&P 500 companies are hoarding be brought back. This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders — something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the campaigns days.Trump’s economy is also in good shape, with the jobless rate near a 17-year low. Initial jobless claims remained near the lowest level since 1970 and the number of people collecting unemployment benefits tanked to a fresh 45-year low.But, there is another major factor behind the strong American growth. It’s the global economic growth, with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy expanded at rate of 3.7% last year, the fastest since 2010.S&P Ends Q1 on a Sour NoteSelling in stocks intensified after the Trump administration announced that it will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports on top of imposing duties on foreign steel and aluminum. In response to Trump’s tariffs, Beijing said that it will target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. Investors panicked as a full-blown trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment.A number of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, in the meantime, pushed political-risk to the highest level since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Such events threatened to upset the Trump administration’s business-friendly policies.Amid all these, the Fedhas tightened its monetary policy. At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. This hasn’t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China.Adding to the downbeat tone is also a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.The S&P tech sector, which was the most crowded trade of the year, peaked on Mar 12 to 1,233.93, putting its market cap at about $6 trillion. However, the market cap is currently down to nearly $5.5 trillion, a decline of 8.8%, per WSJ Market Data Group.5 Best S&P 500 Stocks of Q1The S&P, now, has fallen more than 10% from its peak in January. The average number of stocks on the index is almost 15% below the 52-week high, while the average stock in some of the sectors are already in bear-market territory, defined as a decline of 20%, as per Bespoke Investment Group.Despite the brutal selloff of the past few weeks, some stocks have managed to give encouraging returns, thanks to a great story or maybe a little luck. Here is the rundown of the best stocks from the S&P 500 in Q1. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) provides data storage technology and solutions the United States and internationally. Even though the company is part of the larger tech sector, traders have been ploughing back into STX stock. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 12.5% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to give a solid return of 18.2% this year. Seagate Technology has outperformed the broader industry in the year-to-date period (+36% vs +17.4%).Considering Seagate Technology has done so well in Q1, it comes as no surprise that close-cousin Micron Technology, Inc.’s (MU  -  Free Report) performance has been pretty encouraging. The provider of semiconductor systems has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 11.8% in the last 60 days. Micron Technology is expected to give a staggering return of 121.6% this year, while the stock has already given a steady return of 25.2% in the year-to-date period.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) develops, manufactures, and distributes products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, dairy, and water testing markets. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 9.6% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to give a promising return of 25.3% this year. IDEXX Laboratories has outperformed the broader industry in the year-to-date period (+20.7% vs +6.8%).

Kohl’s has outperformed the broader industry in the year-to-date period (+19.1% vs +13.4%).Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) provides mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software, and services. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 13.1% in the last 60 days. The stock is expected to give an encouraging return of 20.3% this year. Motorola Solutions has outperformed the broader industry in the year-to-date period (+15.1% vs -2.9%).Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1073,KSS,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has been moving up the charts, courtesy of improved store sales and strong e-commerce initiatives. While many retailers have been struggling with soft traffic owing to consumers’ changing shopping preferences, Kohl’s performance continues to impress owing to its well chalked merchandise policies and improving sales across stores and online platforms. Well, these factors were enough to make investors go bullish on the stock. Shares of this retail giant have surged 34% in the last six months, compared with the industry’s rally of 25.8%.Let’s take a closer look at the company’s growth initiatives and see if its ongoing endeavors can add more laurels to its growth story.Impressive CompsKohl’s strategic initiative — Greatness Agenda — designed to drive transactions per store and sales seems to be yielding favorably. Additionally, the company’s store sales are gaining from effective merchandise policies and enhanced focus on prominent brands such as Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Addidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report). Kohl’s is regularly introducing brands to keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to stores and website. Evidently, comps rose 6.3% and 0.1% during the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Moreover, management is encouraged with solid sales trends and better-than-expected results in fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2018, the company projects comps growth in the range of flat to a rise of 2%.Kohl’s has been strengthening ties with retail giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to drive traffic. Incidentally, the company has started accepting returns for Amazon customers on select products and also provide free packing and shipping services for the merchandise to Amazon’s fulfillment centers. This move followed Kohl's decision to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. Kohl’s believes that this store-within-store concept will boost traffic. In the long run, the company is expected to receive significant boost in its business through this partnership. Further, Kohl’s recent partnership with Aldi, which is currently in the testing phase, is expected to result in better utilization of store space across select Kohl’s stores.To top these, Kohl’s innovations have helped the company keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to stores and website. Popular launches include Fit Bed under its active and wellness business and the Jumping Beans collection featuring Disney characters, amongst many others.  Expanding E-commerce BusinessThe company experienced significant growth in its e-commerce business since the last few years. In order to improve its online service offerings, Kohl’s has been expanding e-commerce fulfillment centers and opened its fifth facility in August 2017. The company’s sustained focus on technology improvements and the omni-channel expansion have been propelling online sales. Markedly, online sales have surged 26% during the fourth quarter backed by improved traffic and higher conversion.Focus on Reducing InventoryKohl’s has undertaken several initiatives to reduce inventory to boost profits. During fiscal 2017, the company made significant progress on its initiatives. As a result, inventory per store declined 7% (in terms of units and dollars). Effective merchandising initiatives bore a positive impact upon the company’s fourth-quarter gross margin performance, which expanded 43 basis points bps. In fact, the company’s speed and localization initiatives have been particularly gaining traction in benefiting inventory management and margin performance. For fiscal 2018, the company expects a mid-single digit decline in inventory levels.More Growth in Store?While Kohl’s performance may take hits from the rising selling, general and administrative expenses, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is expected to adequately cushion these through consistent growth in store and online sales, backed by its effective brand and merchandise strategies.

To advance to the next level, we have considered the year-over-year earnings growth for fiscal 2018. Let us once again dig into the Zacks Industry Rank of the four stocks to decide the contenders.Conn's Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report) – Zacks Industry Rank in the top 27%Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) – Zacks Industry Rank in the top 0%Copart Inc. (CPRT) – Zacks Industry Rank in the top 5%VALE S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report) – Zacks Industry Rank in the top 7%So in the matchups, we have Micron Technology and Conn's on one side, and Copart and VALE on the other.Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) vs. Conn's Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report): Micron Technology earnings are expected to grow 114.31% while Conn's will likely see 174.62% growth.

(VALE  -  Free Report): Here, earnings at Copart are expected to grow 34.88% while VALE earnings will see growth of 1.35%. As a result, CPRT wins and will again matchup with Conn's Inc. for the championship.The Championship (April 2)Let’s look at our VGM Score (V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum), which is simply a weighted combination of the three. The VGM score when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential with a frenzy of cheap price, robust growth and strong momentum.Conn's Inc. finally wins over Copart Inc. with a VGM Score of A against D for the latter.ResultBased on our internal research and metrics, Conn's, having a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A, has emerged as the winner of the 2018 March Madness contest and could be a top bet for this year. While it was exciting and fun to dribble toward the winning stock, we expect the twists and turns in the NCAA tournament to lead to some dramatic moves in the investment world.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1076,KSS,"With the oldest members being 37 years old and the youngest just 18, millennials believe that they have a long way to go before they reach retirement. But time flies faster than one thinks and when their retirement age arrives, these millennials may not have sufficient savings.Some experts believe that given their current lack of savings, the majority of this generation won’t be able to retire even in their 70s. This has also been supported by a recent study from National Institute on Retirement Security, which states that two-thirds of the working millennials have saved nothing for their retirement.Some experts believe that the generation’s interest on holidaying rather than saving is the main reason for their failure to save. Others believe that millennials are overburdened with their monthly payments like education loan and credit card bills. Apart from these, one-fifth of the generation supports aging parents by paying for their medical bills and other expenses.All these circumstances have made it tougher for the generation to set aside money for their sunset years.Likely Challenges for MillennialsThe generation is expected to have a longer life span — thanks to the continuous advancements in medical science and healthier lifestyles — which means they will need more funds. Escalating healthcare costs also pose a challenge.Although U.S. citizens will have social security but it is difficult to say whether it will be adequate to maintain their lifestyle. Their woes will mount if the U.S. government closes this facility after 25-30 years. It already costs the federal government more than $1 trillion, which will increase exponentially as the majority of the citizens will fall under the senior category by that time.It’s Never Too Late to Start SavingWhatever small amount you save today, if invested wisely, it can give you a healthy return in the long run. There are plenty of investment options available but given the young age of millennials and their risk taking capabilities, we suggest investing in equities as these offer maximum returns. The improving domestic as well as global economic scenario is likely to have a positive impact on the market. Additionally, with Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policies, the manufacturing sector is poised to witness huge investment in the next few years, thereby generating employment and increasing wage rate opportunities. All this is likely to further strengthen the U.S. economy, which will tend to reflect in the stock market.Considering an annual return of 8%, a monthly investment of just $100 in equities by a 25-year old till his 65th birthday will save him or her approximately $341,120.However, investing in equities has its own share of risks. Not every stock will have a remarkable run. Also, the risk of a market crash remains.Therefore, investing in stocks that generate solid regular returns with minimum associated risks is prudent. Also, the return should cover the investment and inflation costs.Blue Chip Dividend Stocks are the Best ChoiceBlue chip dividend stocks boast solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals, and are less affected by market turbulence. Such stocks are believed to be safer and more durable than an average stock. Most of these companies consistently raise dividends and are typically large in size.The companies’ dominating market position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity help them offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis, irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and offer continued income for investors, as well as more scope for capital appreciation.Choosing the StocksIt is difficult to pick the right stocks from a wide range of available investment opportunities.This is where the Zacks Stock Screener comes in handy. With the help of this screener, we have filtered in Buy-rated stocks that have a market value of $10 billion or more, a decent dividend paying history along with an annualized yield of over 2%.6 PicksThe Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of the world’s largest aerospace company.

1077,KSS,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Results from the traditional retailers have been fairly strong, notwithstanding a few notable disappointments.•    With results from 93% of the Retail sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 out, earnings and revenue growth is on track to be notably above other historical periods, though positive revenue surprises are not as numerous as had been the trend in other recent periods.•    For the 474 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already, total earnings are up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.5% higher revenues, with 77.6% beating EPS estimates and 74.5% beating revenue estimates. The earnings season has ended for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. •    Except for the proportion of these 474 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates, which are tracking roughly in-line with the preceding quarter’s level, growth in Q1 is notably tracking above historical periods.•    Looking at Q1 as a whole, total earnings are expected to be up +24% from the same period last year on +8.5% higher revenues, the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in 7 years. Net Income margins for the quarter are on track to expand by 1.5 percentage points, with the strongest gains at the Finance, Technology and Energy sectors. •    Q1 Earnings growth is in double-digit territory from the year-earlier level for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including the Technology and Finance sectors. The Auto sector has the weakest growth of all 16 sectors, with +0.3% earnings growth on +1.4% higher revenues.•    Energy sector earnings increased +75.7% from the same period last year on +14.2% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, total S&P 500 earnings growth drops from +24.2% to +22.5%.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, we now have Q1 results from 89.7% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +20.9% on +9.6% higher revenues, with 59% beating EPS estimates and 72% beating revenue estimates. In addition to earnings and revenue growth, revenue surprises are notably tracking above historical periods for the small caps.•    For the quarter as whole, total S&P 600 earnings are expected to be up +18.2% on +9.2% higher revenues. We have more details about small-cap data on page 28 of the full report.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.5% on +5.9% higher revenues. For full-year 2019, earnings are expected to be up +9.5% on +4.5% higher revenues.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.4X and index close, as of May 22nd, is $156.19. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $170.98 for 2019 (P/E of 15.9X) and $187.74 for 2020 (P/E of 14.5X). The multiples for 2018 and 2019 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Retail Sector ScorecardWith results from Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and other traditional retailers out now, we have Q1 results from the equivalent of 93% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail sector companies that have reported results are up +21.6% from the same period last year on +9.5% higher revenues, with 72.4% beating EPS estimates and 65.5% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the sector’s Q1 results in a historical context.Please note that the Zacks Retail sector includes the online vendors and restaurant players in addition to ‘traditional’ brick-and-mortar players.The comparison charts above show that while growth (both earnings as well as revenues) is tracking notably above historical periods, the proportion of positive EPS surprises is in-line with historical periods and revenue surprises are tracking below the 4-quarter average (but above the 12-quarter average).With respect to growth, Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) blockbuster numbers, particularly on the revenues front, has a big role in the very strong growth picture at this stage. Amazon’s Q1 earnings increased +125% on +42.9% higher revenues, with the net dollar increase in the online retailer’s revenues an impressive $15.3 billion.The comparison charts below try to look at the sector’s growth picture with and without the Amazon contribution.The right-hand chart that compares the sector’s Q1 earnings and revenue growth on an ex-Amazon basis shows that growth still compares favorably with other periods even without the online giant’s considerable contribution.Weak Revisions TrendWhile growth in Q1 has been very strong, analysts have been hesitant to raise their estimates for Q2. The fact is that aggregate expectations for the quarter have barely budged since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive revisions trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But the estimated trend had been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.There is not much change to estimates for the second half of the year either, as the chart below shows.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the Q1 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate in the coming quarters from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

1078,KSS,"Woman sharing space with men in the business world is no longer unusual. In fact, many companies with female employees in top spots are performing pretty well, if we go by a MSCI’s report released in 2015. MSCI ESG Research’s research revealed in 2015 that “companies in the MSCI World Index with strong female leadership generated a Return on Equity of 10.1% per year versus 7.4% for those without (as of September 9, 2015, measured on an equal-weighted basis).”To further validate women’s leadership in the business world, Stacey Cunningham, the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE) chief operating officer, is set to become its 67th president. In the 226-year history of the exchange, Stacey Cunningham will become its first woman chief.This Friday, Cunningham will take over the reins from Tom Farley, who has served as the president of NYSE since 2014 and is reportedly leaving to join a firm backed by Third Point, the hedge fund founded by Daniel Loeb. John Tuttle, the head of listings at NYSE, will take the Cunningham’s place. Cunningham joined NYSE in 2012. As a point of reference, another big U.S. exchange Nasdaq named Adena Friedman as its chief executive officer in 2017, making her the first woman leader of a global exchange.Rise of Women Empowerment This is not the first time that NYSE is empowering a woman and testifying to its gender diversity. In April, there was an announcement that the statue of the Fearless Girl facing the Manhattan financial district's famous Charging Bull near Wall Street will get a new address by the end of this year in front of the New York Stock Exchange. The sculpture is basically is an embodiment of gender equality and the power of women in leadership (read: NYSE to Soon Greet The Fearless Girl Statue).The Fortune 500 also noted that the percentage of female CEOs has increased since 1998, however with some dips after 2011. There are currently 24 women CEOs at companies that form the 2018 Fortune 500 list, down from last year's record-breaking 32. The reason behind the latest drop is resignation from a third of Fortune 500 female CEOs last year.Against this backdrop, we would like to highlight a few investing options that are focused on women leaders.Stock Picks Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report)Mary Dillon has been serving as the beauty retailer’s CEO since 2013. The company recent made a place for itself on the Fortune 500 list. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report)Michelle Grass took the position of a CEO at this retailer this year. Gass, who was the retailer's chief merchandising and customer officer before being a CEO, led a partnership between Kohl's and Amazon, per CNBC. The Zacks Rank #2 company comes from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 42%).ETF Picks SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that demonstrate greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector by tracking the SSGA Gender Diversity Index.

1079,KSS,"The U.S. retail sector is back with a bang with SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) rising 5.4%, trumping the S&P 500’s 1.9% gains year to date (as of Jun 5). While the growing acceptance of online retailing cannot be denied, struggles seem to be over for department stores.  Consumers’ tendency to shift to online shopping or ‘Amazonization’ has long been a cause of concern for brick-and-mortar retailers. But efficient cost and inventory management have put the spotlight on this neglected space in recent times (read: Online vs. Offline Retail: Recent ETF Winners).Apart from this, there are some developments in the retail space that are driving stocks and ETFs and will keep those well-poised for the second half of 2018.Omni-Channel Retailing Gaining PrecedenceOmni-channel retailing, which is a combination of e-commerce and physical retail, has been coming to the forefront lately. This section of retailing covers all aspects like brick-and-mortar, mobile-browsing, ecommerce marketplaces and so on.Notably, several traditional retailers are expanding in the online space.  Retail behemoth Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) recently bought a 77% stake in Indian e-tailer Flipkart to compete with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Wal-Mart intends to achieve a 40% rise in online sales in fiscal 2019. The company is even starting a same-day delivery service, through just a text message, as part of its omnichannel retail and e-commerce program.Another traditional retailer Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has also been benefiting substantially from its focus on technology improvement and omnichannel expansion. The company’s online sales surged 20% year over year in the first quarter.Online Operators Eye Physical StoresSurprisingly, even e-tailers are eyeing physical stores. The idea is to accomplish a ‘seamless customer experience’, per an article published on Forbes. To mention a few e-tailers, the Canadian cloud-based e-commerce platform company Shopify Inc. (SHOP  -  Free Report) is foraying into the brick-and-mortar arena. Online eyewear retailer Warby Parker, which is a unicorn startup, has chalked out an expansion plan which includes the opening of as many as 100 stores this year. A well-known shirt retailer Untuckit is also trying to open 50 new stores.Solid Hiring Calls for Strength The sector has been recruiting heavily. In May, retailers employed 31,000 heads. Most of the additions (13,000) were at general merchandise stores, while building material and garden supply stores created 8,000 and 4,000 jobs, respectively. In the last year, the sector had created 125,000 jobs (read: 4 Sector ETFs to Profit From Strong May Jobs Data).Uptick in Economic Growth The U.S. economy has been the strongest now since the last recession. The economy grew 2.2% in Q1 and recent estimates call for robust acceleration (which is 3.7%) in Q2 after a moderate Q1. Meanwhile, unemployment rate dived to an 18-year low, giving consumers confidence to splurge on discretionary items.Cyclical Nature of the SectorA pickup in the economy is great for a cyclical sector like consumer discretionary or retail. Such sectors perform better in a rising rate environment that we are witnessing currently in the United States.Upbeat EarningsThe retail sector came up with strong growth rates in Q1. Earnings of the sector is expected to jump 20.4% in Q1 on 8.7% higher revenues, per the Earnings Trends issued on May 31. The sector is expected to post double-digit earnings growth rates in the rest of the three quarters of this year while revenue growth is expected around 5% to 7.5%.ETFs in Focus Thus, if you are bullish on the trend in the retail space, you can play funds like XRT, VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and Invesco Dynamic Retail ETF (PMR  -  Free Report). For gutsy investors, there is a leveraged retail ETF — Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3X Shares (RETL  -  Free Report).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

1080,KSS,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has been riding on rising comps, fueled by effective strategies to drive sales and brand performances. Well, shares of this renowned department store chain have rallied 48.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s rise of 37.2%. Let’s take a closer look at the company’s initiatives and see if it can add more laurels to its growth story.Effective Sales Driving StrategiesKohl’s has been striving to attract more shoppers and improve sales. In fact, such efforts have been aiding the company to deliver positive comps since the past three quarters, thereby driving its overall performance. Incidentally, comps increased 3.6% during first-quarter fiscal 2018, following a rise of 6.3% and 0.1% in the fourth and the third quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Strong comps indicate that the company’s strategic initiative, Greatness Agenda, has been yielding favorable results. The initiative, which commenced in first-quarter fiscal 2014, was designed to drive transactions per store and sales. We expect such endeavors to continue driving the company’s comps performance in the forthcoming periods.Additionally, the company’s sustained focus on technology improvements and omnichannel expansion have been positively impacting online sales. Markedly, online sales surged 20% year over year during the first quarter. In order to further improve its online offerings, Kohl’s has been expanding its e-commerce fulfillment centers. Additionally, it focuses on strengthening its in-store pickups. To top these, Kohl’s has been strengthening ties with retail giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to drive traffic. Incidentally, the company has started accepting returns for Amazon customers on select products and also provides free packing and shipping services for the merchandise to fulfillment centers. Moreover, Kohl's sells Amazon devices, accessories and smart home products across certain select store locations. In the long run, the company is expected to receive significant boost to its business through this partnership. Further, Kohl’s recent association with Aldi is expected to strengthen store base and boost sales.Apart from these, Kohl’s also regularly introduces new brands to keep the inventory assortment fresh and attract customers to its stores and website. In line with its strategy to draw customers, Kohl's revealed plans to launch a fresh apparel collection — POPSUGAR at Kohl’s — in September. The company also announced plans to launch brands in the toys category.Rising Expenses a ConcernKohl’s has been experiencing rising selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for a while now. In fact, SG&A expenses increased 3.7% during first-quarter fiscal 2018, preceded by a 7.3% and 1.4% rise during the fourth and the third quarters of fiscal 2017. Further, management expects SG&A expenses to rise in the bracket of 1-2% during fiscal 2018.Although surging SG&A expenses pose the risk of hurting profitability, we expect Kohl’s sales-driving efforts to suitably cushion the company. Additionally, the company’s speed and localization initiatives have been gaining traction and aiding inventory management as well as margin performance. Advancing with such well-planned endeavors, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to continue to be in investors’ good books.Looking for More?

1084,KSS,"Shares of Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) have climbed 10% over the last four weeks in a sign that investors might be anticipating strong quarterly financial results from the retailer. Let’s take a look to see what they should really expect from Gap in the first quarter.Gap follows a slew of other retail industry giants which have all reported their quarterly earnings results over the last few weeks, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), and  Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report). Not all of these companies have performed well following the release of their Q1 earnings, which means Gap could be under even more pressure on Thursday.With that said, Gap stock has surged 42.5% over the last year as it successfully faces down continued pressure from online sellers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), while also adapting to changing shopping patterns. However, a poor quarter could easily see Gap stock slip—at least in the near-term.Gap Q1 OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Gap’s quarterly revenues to climb by 4.9% to touch $3.61 billion. Moving on to the opposite end of the income statement, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to soar by 25% to reach $0.45 per share.Unfortunately for investors, Gap has experienced some downward earnings estimate revision activity recently. Meanwhile, investors also need to understand what chance Gap has to top our earnings estimate as this could help its stock price climb, especially following its earnings release.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Gap is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and sports an Earnings ESP of -0.37%. This means that investors can consider GPS a stock that could fall short of quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday.  However, it is also worth remembering that the retailer’s earnings are still expected to surge by 25% from the year-ago period.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1090,KSS,"Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 22. The department store chain delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.7% in the last reported quarter and has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Kohl's this time around. Kohl's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Kohl's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation Quote Factors Driving Kohl’s SalesKohl’s is likely to continue gaining from its revenue driving initiatives, while the company’s focus on boosting margins also bodes well. Though the company remains exposed to the risk of losing brick-and-mortar store traffic thanks to consumer shift toward online shopping, its robust e-commerce endeavors and other initiatives to counter these hurdles place it well. In fact, Kohl’s efforts to draw traffic, including its solid ties with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), have been aiding the company to deliver improved comps since the past two quarters. Incidentally, the company started accepting returns for Amazon customers on select products and will also provide free packing and shipping services for the merchandise to Amazon’s fulfillment centers. This move followed Kohl's decision to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. Kohl’s believes that this store-within-store concept will boost stores traffic.Moreover, Kohl’s comps indicate that the company’s strategic initiative, Greatness Agenda, is yielding results. The initiative, commenced in first-quarter 2014, was designed to drive transactions per store and sales. Apart from this, the company is benefiting from enhanced focus on prominent brands such as Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), while it has been cutting down on the number of in-house brands. Kohl’s gained significant market share in active apparel and footwear up until the fourth quarter, and expects the trend to continue, based on assortment improvements.Escalated Costs to be Offset?However, Kohl’s has been experiencing rising selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for a while now. In fact, SG&A expenses increased 7.3% during fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, preceded by a 1.4% rise during the third quarter. Further, management expects SG&A expenses to rise in the bracket of 1-2% during fiscal 2018, which raises concerns for the quarter to be reported as well. Further, competition from discount retailers poses significant threats to the company’s performance.Nevertheless, these hurdles are likely to be offset by the growth endeavors. Also, the company has been strongly focused on curtailing inventories to boost profits. Notably, Kohl’s effective merchandising initiatives bore a positive impact upon its fourth-quarter gross margin performance, which expanded 43 basis points. In fact, the company’s speed and localization initiatives have been particularly gaining traction in benefiting inventory management and margin performance. Going ahead, for fiscal 2018, the company expects a mid-single digit decline in inventory levels. All these factors give out positive signals for Kohl’s upcoming results, wherein we expect both top and bottom line to grow year over year.Estimates in NumbersThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 49 cents, which shows a 25.6% jump from 39 cents recorded in the year-ago period. The estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,951 million, up 2.8% from the year-ago period reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever, our proven model doesn’t show that Kohl's is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Though Kohl's has a Zacks Rank #2, its Earnings ESP of -1.15% makes surprise prediction difficult.

1091,KSS,"A number of factors have kept investors on their toes — thanks to elevated U.S-China trade war tensions, possibilities of three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year, and tech stock related concerns amid stringent regulations related to data privacy and antitrust risks. Without doubt, these issues have spooked the Wall Street. However, market pundits have been shrugging off such gyrations as April has traditionally been a favorable month for investors.Why the Retail Sector?Among the 16 Zacks sectors, we are focusing on the Retail-Wholesale sector, which has advanced roughly 8% in the past six months and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s gain of 1.3%.With unemployment rate still at 17-year low, initial jobless claims plunging to 45-year low, consumer spending being favorable and government expenditure increasing, things appear to be fairly rosy for the U.S. economy. Notably, a strengthening labor market may lead to gradual wage acceleration, and in turn boost consumer confidence. All these sound constructive for retailers.Per the University of Michigan's report, consumer sentiment in March reached the highest level in almost 13 years. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. We note that consumer spending ticked up 0.2% in February, following an equal rise in January. Meanwhile, personal income surged $67.3 billion or 0.4% in February, marking the third straight month of a similar percentage increase.All these factors paint a bright picture for retailers, who are also benefitting from the corporate tax rate cut. Analysts believe that a lower tax burden is likely to allow the retailers to channelize the surplus money to best possible options. They may go for a dividend hike, or reduce debt load, or create a corpus to fund acquisitions, or invest in enhancing omni-channel capabilities, new product launches and any other innovations.Tune in to These 4 Retail StocksWe have identified four Retail-Wholesale stocks based on a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals and a track record of better-than-expected results.We suggest investing in Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) with a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.5% and a VGM Score of A. This seller of apparel and accessories, cosmetics, home furnishings and other consumer goods, delivered positive earnings surprises in the last three quarters. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has rallied 18.4% in the past three months.

(RUTH  -  Free Report), which has a long-term earnings growth rate of 14.3% and a VGM Score of B. This operator of fine dining restaurants delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.8% last quarter. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has advanced 17.1% in the past three months.Investors can also count on Dillard's, Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) — a fashion apparel, cosmetics, and home furnishing retailer. This Zacks Rank #1 company posted positive earnings surprises in the last two quarters and has a VGM Score of A. The stock has surged 33.5% in the past three months.Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), which operates department stores, is a solid bet with a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A.

1092,KSS,"Best Buy Co., Inc.’s (BBY  -  Free Report) extensive investments to upgrade operations, with special focus on developing omni-channel capabilities, supply chain and cost-reduction opportunities, coupled with strengthening partnership with vendors bode well. The company’s “Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue” program aims to explore growth opportunities and optimize cost. These efforts have helped the stock to outpace its industry in a year and continue posting upbeat results.The company has exhibited a bull run in the index when compared with the industry. In a year’s time, the stock has increased roughly 41.7%, while the industry has gained 36.9%. Further, the company’s long-term earnings per share growth rate of 14.6% and a VGM Score of A portray its inherent strength. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock witnessed a positive average earnings surprise of 19.1% in the last four quarters.Investors are encouraged about the company’s strategy called “Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue”. In an effort to drive growth, the company is focused on expansion of multi-channel retail business, offering services and solutions that solve customers’ need. Moreover, it is focusing on accelerating growth in Canada and Mexico. Under this strategy, the top most priority is exploring and pursuing growth opportunities, better execution in key areas, cost optimization, and investing in people as well as systems to drive growth, implementation, and efficiencies. The company targets $600 million of cost reduction and gross profit optimization by 2021. So, we believe that the company is putting efforts to boost its top line over the long term.Meanwhile, Best Buy provided an encouraging view for the fiscal 2019. The company expects earnings per share in the range of $4.80-$5.00 for the fiscal year, reflecting growth of about 9-13%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.99 and $5.41 for fiscal 2019 and 2020 has increased 4.6% and 9.5%, respectively, in the past 60 days.Near-Term ImpendentOn the flip side, analysts believe that Best Buy's investment activities to boost e-commerce operations and supply chains for countering competition may strain margins in the near term. SG&A expenses have increased 18.6%, 2.2% and 3.2% in the fourth, third and second quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively.Management hinted that higher investments in the supply chain and increased transportation costs are likely to weigh on gross profit of the Domestic business by approximately 25 basis points in each quarter. The national roll-out of Total Tech Support offering in the second quarter is also expected to weigh on gross margin of the Domestic business.For the full year, Best Buy expects the rollout to hurt domestic gross margin by approximately 15-20 basis points. International gross margin is also expected to remain under pressure during the first quarter.3 Retail Stocks Hogging the LimelightNordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1094,KSS,"Dillard’s Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) has been moving up the charts mainly due to a robust surprise trend backed by various strategic actions. Notably, the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results marked its third-earnings beat in the last four quarters.

We believe that the company’s strategy of offering fashion-forward and trendy products acts as a catalyst for attracting more customers.The company is well positioned to benefit from growth opportunities in both its brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce business, which is likely to aid in retaining existing customers and attracting new ones. On one hand, the company will gain by enhancing brand relations, focusing on in-trend categories, store remodels and rewarding store personnel. On the other hand, some of the strategies to boost growth across its e-commerce business include enhancing merchandise assortments and effective inventory management.We expect the company’s top and bottom lines to gain from its focus on increasing productivity at existing stores, developing a leading omni-channel platform and enhancing domestic operations in the long term.Further, Dillard’s boasts a healthy cash position which provides it the financial flexibility to take up shareholder-friendly moves as well as engage in store and online business expansion.

1096,KSS,"Though Walmart Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) e-commerce sales did not grow as fast as expected last quarter, the retail giant has ample ways to please its online and instore shoppers. Walmart has planned to make huge investments in the online space this year, while its bricks-and-mortar stores will drive grocery orders and same-day deliveries. Investment in new brands and technology should also attract customers, which will eventually help the company achieve its sales goal.The retail industry expects to see sales growth this year and continue the momentum of a strong holiday season. Higher consumer confidence, record low jobless rate and solid wage growth are expected to boost retail sales throughout the year, while the Republican tax cut will help retailers save a whopping $175 billion, per the National Retail Federation (NRF). This extra cash can be used to buy back shares, pay dividends, and execute mergers and acquisitions.With the overall trend in the retail industry remaining promising, investors should double down on the hottest retailers right away.Efforts to Please Online & Instore CustomersWalmart’s online sales rose 23% in the final quarter of 2017, lagging the previous quarter’s 50% rise. In fact, sales jumped 60% in the two periods prior to that. The decline in growth rattled investors as it implied the company is not in a position to fend off competition from Internet giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). Walmart saw its steepest one-day drop in three decades on Feb 20, plummeting 10.2% (read more: Walmart’s Q4 Earnings Miss Hurts Stock, Comps Up Again).Nonetheless, Walmart has more avenues to regain the interest of online and instore customers. The company is planning to make extensive investments in e-commerce operations later this year, which will drive online sales by 40% in fiscal 2019. The retailer has already scooped up e-commerce sites like Jet.com to strengthen its online presence.Walmart has also dropped “Stores” from its corporate name, giving an impression that it intends to operate as more than a traditional store-based company. By the way, Walmart’s stores does help it gain an edge over Amazon. The retailer is planning to double the locations offering grocery delivery that should boost sales. CEO Doug McMillon in the earnings call has said that “stores are executing better, we’re innovating more, and customers are responding with higher sales and traffic.”Lest we forget, Walmart will completely revamp its website with a focus on fashion and home goods later this spring. The retailer will partner with Hudson’s Bay-owned Lord & Taylor in order to bring high-end clothing items to its website, which should bode well in the near future.  Retail Sales to Grow in 2018 The NRF has predicted retail sales growth of solid 3.8% to 4.4% this year over 2017. When it comes to online and other non-store sales, the numbers are expected to increase by 10% to 12%. Retail sales have grown a healthy 3.9% to $3.53 trillion in 2017 from 2016, as per preliminary estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.Meanwhile, January retail sales fell unexpectedly. After all, U.S. retail sales dropped 0.3% last month largely due to a decline in motor vehicle, gasoline, food services, and home appliances sales. But, the core retail sales that show the GDP’s consumer spending segment remained unchanged, which shows that retail sales remained nearly as good as the holiday season’s strong showing (read more: Retail is Staging a Big Comeback in 2018: 5 Solid Buys).NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay further added that “with consumer confidence high, unemployment low and wages growing, there is every reason to believe that retail sales will be robust throughout the year.”Catalysts Behind the SurgeThe University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index increased from 95.7 in January to 99.9 in February. This was the highest recorded since 2004 and the second highest since the 13-year high hit in October 2017. This reading exceeded most economists’ expectations of 95.5 to 95.7 (read more: Consumer Sentiment Soars to Record High: 5 Picks).The labor market, in the meantime, has come a long way since the Great Recession, with broad-based job gains in January. Non-farm payrolls climbed by 200,000 jobs in January after rising 160,000 last December, per the Labor Department. In fact, the economy added jobs for 88 successive months, while unemployment rate remained unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1%.But, it was wage growth that hit the fastest pace last month in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Needless to say, several states have raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).5 Solid PicksGiven the aforesaid positives, investing in sound retail stocks seems judicious.

1097,KSS,"This week we have several very important economic reports coming out.  These top tier reports will give us key data on future indicators regarding factory orders, inflation, retail sales, housing, and consumer sentiment.The biggest report is coming out Wednesday; the Consumer Price Index.  With the current inflation worries, and the implications of the Fed raising rates at a faster pace, this will be the most closely watched report this week.  The last report showed that wages grew by +2.9% which spooked the markets and caused the flash crash.  Current year over year expectations are for a slight dip from 2.1% to 2%. Any pullback will be viewed as a positive for the markets, but if we see an uptick it could cause the markets to fall once again.Also on Wednesday, the Retail Sales report will be released and this will tell us if the recent strength in the segment will continue.  Expectations are for +0.3% gain which would be the seventh consecutive month of a positive reading. A positive reading would help many retail companies like Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), Conn's Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) all of which currently hold a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy rating.The Retail report will also be tied to Friday's Consumer Sentiment announcement which is expected to remain elevated.  Source: Bloomberg.comAs you can see in the table above, consumer sentiment has been around a reading of 95 for over a year.  If consumer sentiment remains at or near its current levels it bodes well for the retail sector, as this report gauges consumer spending, and the overall attitude of the economy.  This week we will also see two regional manufacturing reports, the Phily Fed, and the Empire State.  These reports will give us the conditions in local regions, and will be an indicator for the more important ISM manufacturing index coming out on March 1st.  The recent readings have been very strong, and have shown positive momentum in production and new orders over the past several months. Currently, the regional reports are expected to show continued strong growth.  Lastly, we will also see two very important housing reports this week.  On Thursday the Housing Market Index will be released. This forward looking report has remained high for the past several months.Source: Bloomberg.comTwo closely watched parts of the report will indicate if the increasing interest rate trend will begin show any signs of having a negative impact on the index.  And if the uptick in mortgage rates is impacting housing affordability.This report coupled with Friday's Housing Starts data will be an important barometer for the housing sector and several other sub sectors that rely on new housing.Housing starts took a bit of a dip last month due to weather related issues as you can see in the chart below.Source: Bloomberg.comBut this month's data should be clean of weather related issues, and is currently expected to show a snap back to 1.23 million units, well above December's reading of 1.1 million units.  Also, housing permits are expected to remain high at 1.3 million. A combination of an uptick in both the housing market index, and housing starts will be beneficial for home builders like KB Homes (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp (LEN  -  Free Report), and D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 Buy rating.The data will also be a forward indicator for companies that depend on new homes who supply them with furniture, appliances, and other household needs. Companies that can benefit from positive housing data include, Restoration Hardware (RH  -  Free Report), At Home Group (HOME  -  Free Report), Beacon Roofing (BECN  -  Free Report), and Eloctorlux ELUX-B, all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy rating. If these data points come in as expected, it will set an overall positive tone for the markets for the next several weeks.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1098,KSS,"With erratic movements of major market indices last week, many analysts found it quite tricky to spot the prime factor behind the extreme volatility. Although The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4% on Feb 9 after a wild week, fears of a downturn in the near future gripped the market.However, chances of a recession are negligible given record low unemployment levels and better-than-expected job additions. Favorable fourth-quarter earnings also acted as an antidote.Markets Bled Last WeekOn average, the Dow moved more than 1,000 points every day through the week. The market saw the index alter directions roughly 53 times, per The Wall Street Journal. Moreover, the weekly decline of 5.2% for the index was the steepest in more than two years.The encouraging wage growth data convinced investors of a probable spike in inflation, which might lead the central bank to raise interest rates sooner than expected. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, private sector workers witnessed 2.9% year-over-year wage growth in January, the highest since June 2009. The fear of impending inflation led the 10% drop in Dow from the record-high mark of Jan 26.  Chances of Recession Negligible Most analysts believe that the market was overdue for a correction and major indices might even plunge further, but that will not lead to a recession anytime soon. The signs of recession are normally reflected in indicators like GDP and employment data, and these parameters show no signs of a recession.GDP Data Solid: The nation’s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017, following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.Notably, in the first quarter of this year, GDP might jump 5.4%, per the latest estimate of Atlanta Fed.Significant Job Addition & Low Unemployment: Per the US Labor Department report, 200,000 new non-farm payroll jobs were created in January, beating market expectations. According to a survey by Reuters, most economists were expecting an addition of 180,000 U.S. jobs.Also, the jobless rate remained at an ultra-low level of 4.1%, and workers’ hourly wages increased 2.9% year-over-year in January 2017.Favorable Q4 Earnings Dispel FearsWe are almost at the tail end of the Q4 earnings season, with 341 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers and 159 yet to report. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for all S&P 500 companies will be up 14.1% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. The expected year-over-year earnings growth for the fourth quarter is way higher than the 6.7%, 11.2% and 13.5% growth rates for 3Q17, 2Q17 and 1Q17, respectively. Moreover, we expect the index’s earnings to increase to 15.7%, 17.5% and 18.1% in 1Q18, 2Q18 and 3Q18, respectively.Which Stocks to Focus On?Given the healthy expectations for earnings, most analysts believe that the market will not be unstable for long.Picking stocks with strong fundamentals seems to be a smart option but the task can be a daunting one.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank and VGM Score. Moreover, we have chosen firms with market capitalization of more than 10 billion, as large cap stocks are comparatively stable and less volatile.All the four stocks, with a VGM Score of A, sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in San Antonio, TX, Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) has a strong reefing presence. The refineries, where the company has operatorship interest, have a total daily capacity of 1.2 million barrels.The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 37.8%. Also, we expect the company to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 58% through 2018.Headquartered in Menomonee Falls, WI, Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), with roughly 1,100 stores spreading across 49 states, is basically an omnichannel retailer.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 37.8%. We expect year-over-year earnings growth of 8.5% and 14.5% for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, respectively.Headquartered in Findlay, OH, Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report) is a leading refiner of crude. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, with average positive surprise of 182.6%. Marathon Petroleum is anticipated to post earnings growth of 34.74% in 2018.Headquartered in Stamford, CT, United Rentals, Inc.

1100,KSS,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Results from the traditional retailers have been fairly strong, notwithstanding a few notable disappointments.•    With results from 93% of the Retail sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 out, earnings and revenue growth is on track to be notably above other historical periods, though positive revenue surprises are not as numerous as had been the trend in other recent periods.•    For the 474 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already, total earnings are up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.5% higher revenues, with 77.6% beating EPS estimates and 74.5% beating revenue estimates. The earnings season has ended for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. •    Except for the proportion of these 474 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates, which are tracking roughly in-line with the preceding quarter’s level, growth in Q1 is notably tracking above historical periods.•    Looking at Q1 as a whole, total earnings are expected to be up +24% from the same period last year on +8.5% higher revenues, the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in 7 years. Net Income margins for the quarter are on track to expand by 1.5 percentage points, with the strongest gains at the Finance, Technology and Energy sectors. •    Q1 Earnings growth is in double-digit territory from the year-earlier level for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including the Technology and Finance sectors. The Auto sector has the weakest growth of all 16 sectors, with +0.3% earnings growth on +1.4% higher revenues.•    Energy sector earnings increased +75.7% from the same period last year on +14.2% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, total S&P 500 earnings growth drops from +24.2% to +22.5%.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, we now have Q1 results from 89.7% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +20.9% on +9.6% higher revenues, with 59% beating EPS estimates and 72% beating revenue estimates. In addition to earnings and revenue growth, revenue surprises are notably tracking above historical periods for the small caps.•    For the quarter as whole, total S&P 600 earnings are expected to be up +18.2% on +9.2% higher revenues. We have more details about small-cap data on page 28 of the full report.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.5% on +5.9% higher revenues. For full-year 2019, earnings are expected to be up +9.5% on +4.5% higher revenues.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.4X and index close, as of May 22nd, is $156.19. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $170.98 for 2019 (P/E of 15.9X) and $187.74 for 2020 (P/E of 14.5X). The multiples for 2018 and 2019 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Retail Sector ScorecardWith results from Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and other traditional retailers out now, we have Q1 results from the equivalent of 93% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail sector companies that have reported results are up +21.6% from the same period last year on +9.5% higher revenues, with 72.4% beating EPS estimates and 65.5% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the sector’s Q1 results in a historical context.Please note that the Zacks Retail sector includes the online vendors and restaurant players in addition to ‘traditional’ brick-and-mortar players.The comparison charts above show that while growth (both earnings as well as revenues) is tracking notably above historical periods, the proportion of positive EPS surprises is in-line with historical periods and revenue surprises are tracking below the 4-quarter average (but above the 12-quarter average).With respect to growth, Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) blockbuster numbers, particularly on the revenues front, has a big role in the very strong growth picture at this stage. Amazon’s Q1 earnings increased +125% on +42.9% higher revenues, with the net dollar increase in the online retailer’s revenues an impressive $15.3 billion.The comparison charts below try to look at the sector’s growth picture with and without the Amazon contribution.The right-hand chart that compares the sector’s Q1 earnings and revenue growth on an ex-Amazon basis shows that growth still compares favorably with other periods even without the online giant’s considerable contribution.Weak Revisions TrendWhile growth in Q1 has been very strong, analysts have been hesitant to raise their estimates for Q2. The fact is that aggregate expectations for the quarter have barely budged since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive revisions trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But the estimated trend had been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.There is not much change to estimates for the second half of the year either, as the chart below shows.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the Q1 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate in the coming quarters from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

1101,KSS,"Sales at U.S. retailers picked up last month disregarding the rise in gas prices. Americans ramped up spending on wage gains and bigger paychecks owing to the recent tax cuts.Apparel outlets, furniture merchants, building-materials outlets, Internet retailers and department stores, to name a few, saw an uptick in sales. Thus, it’s time to invest in retailers that are likely to make the most of the bullish sentiments.Retail Sales – The NumbersRetail sales that measure outlays at stores, online-shopping websites and restaurants increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.3% in April from March, according to the Commerce Department. March sales were, in fact, revised to show a 0.8% advance instead of 0.6%.The so-called core retail sales that exclude food services, auto dealers, building materials stores and gasoline stations rose 0.3%, after an upwardly revised 0.4% gain in March. This indicated that rise in gasoline prices failed to affect consumer spending levels.Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the national average price for a gallon of gasoline came in at $2.76 in April, up almost 17 cents from March and the highest since mid-2015. With global oil prices rising after Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal and impose tougher sanctions on Tehran, gasoline prices are likely to remain elevated (read more: Trump Nixes Iran Nuclear Deal: Winners & Losers).Winners & LosersRetail sales were mostly broad-based, excluding gasoline and autos. Nine of the 13 major retail categories saw a rise in sales, with clothing and accessories retailers notching the highest increase last month. This is because Americans purchased new outfits for the warm weather. Sales at clothing stores shot up 1.4%.Receipts at furniture stores increased 0.8%, while sales were up 0.2% at department stores and 0.3% at general merchandise outlets. Receipts at building material stores also rose 0.4% last month and online retail sales advanced 0.6%.Grocery-store sales, in the meantime, went up 0.5% in April from the prior month. Kemper Isley, chairman and co-president of Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc., a Colorado-based chain said that they “are pleased with the continued sales momentum.”But, sales at restaurants and bars dropped 0.3%, the steepest decline since February 2017. Receipts at electronics and appliance stores, sporting goods and hobby stores, and health and personal care stores also fell 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.4% last month, respectively.What Drove Spending?Consumer outlays were off to a firm start this quarter after slowing sharply in the first quarter. April’s increase in spending came on the heels of a strong jobs market in at least two decades. April marked the 91st successive month of job additions, by far, the longest streak of job gains on record. At the same time, the jobless rate was 3.9%, the lowest since 2000. Average earnings also ticked up by 4 cents an hour and 2.6% year over year (read more: In a Tight Employment Market, Staffing Services are in Demand).The recent cut in taxes increased take-home pay. This in turn gave Americans the means to spend. The “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” lowered the individual income tax brackets. While the top rate got trimmed from 39.6% to 37%, the 33% bracket declined to 32%, the 28% bracket to 24%, the 25% bracket to 22%, and the 15% bracket to 12%.The rise in spending level easily outpaced the uptick in prices of essential commodities. After all, the consumer price index increased 2.5% in April from a year earlier, per the Labor Department.5 Top WinnersTaking the spending spree into account, retailers are set to witness a strong rally.

1102,KSS,"Selecting stocks from the vast investment universe is not an easy task. For this, one has to understand the company fundamentals and try to place them against the present economic background to figure out how it may fare as an investment.One way to cut this task out is to follow broker recommendation. Brokers have more insight into what’s happening in a particular company as they directly communicate with management. Also, they have a deeper understanding of the overall industry.Brokers research on a company’s publicly available financial statements, listen to conference calls and engage in talks directly with top management. At times, they even talk with customers to gauge what they like or dislike about the products and services offered by the company.Therefore, after thorough research, brokers decide to rate that particular company’s stock. Naturally, when an analyst upgrades a stock, one can easily depend on it.But solely depending on analysts’ upgrades is not the right way to build investment portfolio. One should also take into consideration other factors to ensure solid returns.Choosing the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (4 weeks) of 1% or more: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must be trading above $5.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank equal to #1 or #2: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) have a proven record of success.

1103,KSS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Kohl's has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.91, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.02. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Kohl's current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 12.19 over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 30.11. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Kohl's has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.01, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Kohl's stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Kohl's has a P/S ratio of about 0.58. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.37 right now.

The company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same.Following the results, the stock declined 5.4% on Mar 2.

1107,KSS,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surged over 4% on Friday to touch a brand new all-time high one day after the e-commerce powerhouse posted strong first quarter results. But while much attention has been paid to Amazon’s massive bottom line beat and continued online sales expansion, let’s dive into the company’s physical retail growth along with its booming subscriber business.Amazon posted adjusted Q1 earnings of $3.27 per share, which crushed our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 per share. Meanwhile, the company’s overall first quarter revenues surged 43% to $51.04 billion. This also beat our $50.17 billion consensus estimate.Investors should note that Amazon Web Services, or AWS, soared 49% from the year-ago period to $5.44 billion—topping our estimate. Amazon also posted online sales of $26.94 billion and third-party seller revenues of $9.27 billion.With that said, two other important Amazon growth areas deserve some more attention.Physical Stores The company reported first quarter physical stores sales of $4.26 billion. This is only the third period that Amazon reported such revenues, but its sales soared from $1.28 billion in the third quarter of 2017.Amazon bought Whole Foods almost a year ago for $13.4 billion, marking the biggest move in the company’s effort to expand its physical retail presence. And Whole Foods revenues, from its 479 stores, account for a large portion of these physical stores sales. But Amazon has also expanded its retail footprint in other ways.Amazon opened its first bookstore in November 2015. The company now has 15 total Amazon Books locations throughout the U.S., from California to New York. Amazon plans to open three more new locations soon.The e-commerce giant also has an array of pop-up stores throughout the country. Amazon sets up these temporary shops in malls, Whole Foods, and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) stores in order to sell different Amazon products, including Kindle and Echo devices.Amazon’s physical retail revenue also included the company’s unique, no checkout Amazon Go store in Seattle. Cleary, Amazon is slowly expanding its brick-and-mortar presence, with the nascent unit accounting for roughly 8.3% of total first quarter revenue.Subscription ServicesMoving on, Amazon’s subscription services unit is made up primarily of annual and monthly fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships, audiobook and digital music fees, as well as all other non-AWS subscriptions services. Just last week, CEO Jeff Bezos publicly revealed for the first time that its Prime program currently boasts 100 million paying members worldwide.Amazon’s quarterly subscription revenues surged 60% from $1.94 billion in the year-ago period to hit $3.10 billion. The big climb was larger than both AWS and online sales, and can be attributed to Amazon Prime’s expansion.Subscription Services are also set to get a boost after Amazon announced a planned rate hike on its first quarter earnings call that will see its yearly Prime membership fees jump from $99 to $119, starting on May 11.Amazon’s latest rate hike comes only a few months after it raised Prime's monthly membership from $10.99 per month to $12.99 per month.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1108,KSS,"After an exponential rise throughout 2017, the U.S. stock markets have been witnessing turmoil since February 2018. Markets remain highly unstable with rapid ascent being observed one week, followed by a sharp decline the very next week.  Investors remain skeptical about the U.S. mid-term elections and high expectations from first-quarter earnings.One of the easiest ways for any company to raise its shareholders’ wealth is to hike dividend rate. Investment in high-dividend paying stocks, over a reasonable time period, is likely to bring good returns, especially when the market is plagued with severe volatility. At this stage, investors should choose stocks which promise strong dividend yield and carry a favorable Zacks Rank to capitalize on future growth.Political Issues Loom Large With mid-term elections in the United States imminent, several opinion polls have predicted that Democrats are likely to get majority in the House of Representatives even though Republicans are expected to maintain an upper hand in the Senate. However, a divided government doesn’t bode well for investors.Trump administration is deeply concerned about national security and China’s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.These concerns compelled the government to adopt and impose protectionist policies. However, Trump’s strategy might not succeed with a majority of Democrats in the House. Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee is drafting a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired by President Trump. Mueller is investigating into whether Trump’s campaign team colluded with Russia in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.Earnings Expectations SkyrocketFirst-quarter earnings results have been exhibiting strong momentum so far. In fact, investors have pinned high hopes on first-quarter 2018 earnings. These massive expectations are often resulting in day-to-day market volatility.On Apr 15, share price of three major banks JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC  -  Free Report) shed 2.7%, 1.6% and 3.4%, respectively. These banking behemoths lost significantly despite reporting better-than-expected first quarter results.The earnings and revenue growth rates along with the proportion of positive earnings surprises are tracking materially above historical periods. With expectations too high, it is possible that actual results may not live up to expectations, which will weigh on the sector’s stock market performance in the coming days. (Read More: Can Tech Earnings Live Up to Expectations?)Our Top Picks Despite strong economic fundamentals, several concerns plague the investors.

1109,KSS,"Shares of several major department store retailers gained on Tuesday morning following positive earnings from Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report). With several more players in the industry set to report this week, the focus will now shift to the likes of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) to continue the trend of strong results.Macy’s shares climbed more than 11% in early trading following the release of its latest report. The industry bellwether posted adjusted earnings of $2.82 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.69.The company saw revenue figures of $8.67 billion, missing our consensus estimate of $8.72 billion but improving 1.8% from the year-ago period. Same-store sales increased 1.3% during the holiday quarter (also read: Macy's Soars on Earnings Beat & Strong Guidance).Macy’s expects fiscal 2018 earnings to fall in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share—well ahead of our current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89. Management also said that it expects comps to be flat to up 1% on the year.Meanwhile, department store chain Dillard’s also topped earnings expectations. The company reported adjusted profits of $2.82 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.82 and soaring more than 50% on a year-over-year basis. Dillard’s shares popped more than 15% in the wake of the report.Upbeat results from Macy’s and Dillard’s helped lift fellow retailers, including Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and JCPenney (JCP  -  Free Report) on Tuesday morning. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) was up nearly 1% in early trading hours.But now the attention will turn to those yet to report this week, including Macy’s rival Nordstrom. The Nordstrom family is expected to finalize a go-private deal soon, and that premium is likely factored into the stock already. However, the company’s results will still be a great indicator of the health of the retail industry right now, so investors will want to pay close attention.So what does Nordstrom have in store? Let’s take a closer look.Latest OutlookBased on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Nordstrom to report adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share and total revenues of $4.61 billion. This bottom line result would represent a year-over-year slump of 9.5%, but the company’s top line is expected to improve by more than 6.8%.Nordstrom already posted its November and December sales figures, reporting revenue growth of 2.5% and comps growth of 1.2% for that period.Earnings ESPInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Nordstrom surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Just a few days before its report, JWN is sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of -0.72. This is because the company’s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at $1.23 per share, meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been lower than the consensus.Despite the stock’s strong Zacks Rank, our model does not conclusively indicate that we are in store for a beat.Want more market analysis from this author?

1110,KSS,"Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 1. While the company reported a negative earnings surprise in the last quarter, the departmental store retailer has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 12.5% in the trailing four quarters. We expect the company to continue gaining from its robust sales driving efforts, which also helped the company to put up solid holiday sales numbers, which was revealed last month.Let’s delve deeper into these factors, which appear to be major growth drivers for Kohl’s — also giving out positive signals for the upcoming results.Factors Driving the QuarterKohl’s has been gaining from its various sales-driving initiatives, which also helped it witness its first quarterly comparable store sales (comps) growth in a long time, when it reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Among its various efforts, alliance with online giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) seems to be yielding results for Kohl’s. Incidentally, the company started accepting returns from Amazon’s customers on select products. This move followed Kohl's decision to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices across 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago.  Additionally, the company is gaining from enhanced focus on prominent brands such as Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report). Further, Kohl’s has been regularly introducing brands to keep inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to stores and website.Kohl's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Kohl's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation Quote Also, Kohl’s gained significant market share in active apparel and footwear up until the third quarter, and expects the trend to continue, based on assortment improvements. Such efforts to expand store traffic and sales are reflected in the company’s share price performance. Kohl’s shares have gained 60.1% in a year, compared with the  industry's increase of 9.9%.Holiday Results Hint at a Strong Q4Fueled by these factors, Kohl’s revealed that both, comparable store sales (comps) and total sales of the company advanced 6.9% year over year, for the combined November and December 2017 period. Notably, this marks a significant improvement from a 2.1% and 2.7% respective drop in comps and total sales witnessed in the 2016 holiday season. Notably, Kohl’s performance remained sturdy throughout November and December, backed by positive comps across all businesses and regions. This, in turn was fueled by Kohl’s robust strategies, which helped it attract strong traffic and record solid digital sales during the season.Final Thoughts & Q4 ExpectationsWe believe that sustained focus on technology improvements and omni-channel expansion is likely to fuel further growth at Kohl’s. In fact, the department store retailer’s better-than-expected holiday performance and optimistic anticipations for January stimulated management to raise its fiscal 2017 earnings outlook. Nonetheless, management stated that the updated guidance doesn’t include any impact from the latest tax reforms, which is likely to have a favorable effect on the company’s effective tax rate.Apart from this, the company has also been undertaking several initiatives to reduce its inventory, in order to boost its profits. During third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company made additional progress on its initiatives and as a result, inventory per store decreased 2%, while units per store were 4% lower. Lower inventory levels led to improvement in merchandise margins, and the company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017. Clearly, all these factors bode well for the fourth quarter.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.77, which shows a nearly 23% surge from $1.44 recorded in the year-ago period. The estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6,743 million, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever, our proven model doesn’t show that Kohl’s is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.While Kohl’s sports a Zacks Rank #1, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Notably, the top line comfortably surpassed management’s guidance of $1,175-$1,200 million.Sales for the quarter mainly gained from healthy performances at the international wholesale business, company-owned global retail business and domestic wholesale business.In spite of the decent outcome, the stock plunged 22.7% during after-market trading session yesterday.What Hurt the Stock?Analysts pointed that bleak outlook for the second quarter hurt investor sentiment. Management now projects second-quarter earnings between 38 cents and 43 cents a share compared with 38 cents delivered in the year-ago period. We note that the company’s guided range is significantly down from the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents, which could witness a downward revision in the coming days.Additionally, the company anticipates net sales in the band of $1.120-$1.145 billion compared with $1,025.9 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Sales projection includes an expected shift in shipments from the second quarter to the later part of the year for quite a few important international distributors and domestic accounts.

1112,KSS,"The S&P 500 topped a 54-year old record for all-time highs in January. The broader index, in fact, met and exceeded Wall Street analysts’ projected average of 2,819 by the end of this year in just about 14 days of trading. Such relentless rally is merely an indication of a bull market that has an ability to discard any geo-political headwind.The index has been supported by a flurry of tailwinds. Corporate earnings results have so far exceeded expectations, assuring investors that in spite of anxieties over high valuations, demand remains healthy. A series of strong economic data and euphoria over the Republican-led tax cut also helped the benchmark scale north.Given the bullish trend, investing in sound stocks listed on the index seems alluring at the moment. These stocks not only outpaced the broader index so far this year but are also slated to gain further in the near term.S&P 500 Tops 54-Year Old RecordThe S&P 500 scaled the 12th record close so far in January, topping the previous high of 11 since 1964, according to the WSJ Market Data Group. The broader index ended in the green in 12 of the 15 trading sessions this year.In fact, the index has posted its longest stretch without a 5% pullback. This reflects the equity market’s resilience in recent times. The index had risen 19.4% in 2017, its best year since 2013. The index has continued its winning run for 14 straight months. It also posted 62 record closing highs last year, the second-highest number in its history. In fact, the index posted 77 record closes in 1995, the best year so far.Equities Supported by a Series of TailwindsThe index’s stellar run came at a time when market volatility has essentially been nonexistent. Astute investors have shrugged off all kind of political uncertainty. Instead, they focused on upbeat corporate earnings results, accelerating economic growth both domestically and abroad, and the recently passed tax overhaul policy.Q4 Earnings to See Strong GrowthThe Q4 earnings season kicked off on a positive note. For the 53 S&P 500 members that have reported results already, earnings are up 11.7% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues, with 81.1% beating EPS estimates and 75.5% surpassing revenue estimates. In fact, Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 10.3% from the same period last year on 7.1% higher revenues. This will follow the 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the Q3 of 2017 on 5.9% higher revenues.Estimates for Q4 earnings for most of the sectors are expected to be positive, with Energy, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Technology poised to post strong gains. An uptick in oil output is expected to boost the energy sector, while a rise in sales on housing demand post-hurricanes will drive manufacturing activities. Meanwhile, substantial growth in cloud computing, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence are cited to be some of the reasons that will benefit the tech sector.Solid Economic DataEconomic recovery worldwide gave a boost to profitability, reduced the jobless rate to 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high last November. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, added that “consumers’ expectations remain at historically strong levels, suggesting economic growth will continue well into 2018.”Lest we forget, workers’ pay has increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017. Such a low level of unemployment, rise in income and more confident consumers drove spending at both online and bricks-and-mortar stores as well as restaurants. In fact, spending might get a boost from the $1.5-trillion package of tax cuts approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Trump last month. These massive tax cuts will drive household income and in turn increase the propensity to consume.Tax Overhaul EffectsThe corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.Lowering of domestic tax rates will boost profits, while a one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will encourage companies to bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities.5 Top WinnersGiven the S&P 500’s record breaking run, investors should double down on the hottest stocks from the said index.

1114,KSS,"Shares of J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) dipped 1.06% on Monday, before climbing briefly after-hours, in a sign that investors might be unsure what to expect from the struggling department store’s first quarter financial results. Let’s take a quick look to see how J.C. Penney’s top and bottom lines are projected to perform and if it is expected to beat or miss earnings estimates.J.C. Penny has seen its stock price fall 46% over the last year and 25% during the last 12 weeks. The department store, like many other retailers, faces continued pressure from online sellers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) as well as increased competition from other lower-priced retailers like Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report).With that said, J.C. Penny could turn things around, at least in the near-term, if the company is able to report strong Q1 results.J.C. Penny Q1 OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for J.C. Penny’s quarterly revenues to fall by 3.8% to touch $2.6 billion. Meanwhile, on the opposite end of the income statement, the retailer is projected to swing from adjusted quarterly earnings of $0.06 per share in the year-ago period to a loss of $0.22 per share in Q1.Moving on, investors also need to understand what chance J.C. Penny has to top our earnings estimate as this could help its stock price climb in the near-term despite its expected quarterly loss. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.J.C. Penny’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for a loss of $0.28 per share, which comes in 6 cents worse than our current consensus estimate. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of -28.44%.Therefore, investors can consider J.C. Penny a stock that could fall short of quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday.Fellow department store giants including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) also report their quarterly earnings result this week.

1115,KSS,"A robust job market and rising disposable income spell hope for the retail industry. For investors who are on the hunt for stocks yielding high returns, Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) is a great option. The stock, which has a long-term expected growth rate of 12%, scaled to a 52-week high of $40.23 on Apr 18, eventually closing a tad lower at $39.68.The company’s strategies have resulted in better-than-expected earnings and revenues for the third straight quarter, with the latest release being that of fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.Let’s Delve DeeperThis Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has adopted various strategic initiatives to attract customers. The latest one is the partnership with Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), whereby more than 200 items from Anthropologie Home are now available at select Nordstrom full-line stores and on Nordstrom.com, effective Mar 19. Earlier, the company had made an unprecedented move by acquiring Philadelphia’s The Vetri Family group of restaurants, including the Pizzeria Vetri chain. The attempt is seen as part of the company's strategy to target and attract millennials to the stores.This multi-brand and multi-channel retailer offers flexible merchandising strategy to attract customers. We believe new store openings, increase digital penetration, merchandising improvements and international expansion bode well for the long term. Management is also making all possible efforts to enhance the performance of brands through store refurbishment and by bringing in more compelling assortments.Lifting investor sentiment, management has provided a solid guidance, courtesy of strategic initiatives undertaken by the company. Management has hinted that retail segment sales are off to a solid start in first-quarter fiscal 2019. Based on current sales trends, the company expects gross margin rate to improve approximately 100 basis points during the first quarter on a year-over-year basis.During the final quarter of fiscal 2018, comparable retail segment net sales, including the comparable direct-to-consumer channel, were up 4% year over year. Moreover, comparable retail segment net sales inched up 2% at Urban Outfitters, 5% at Anthropologie Group and 8% at the Free People.Notably, the stock has gained 9.1%, as against the industry’s decline of 0.5%.Looking for More?

1116,KSS,"As competition is intensifying in the retail space, Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to drive revenues. The company, which has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 11.2%, is banking on several strategic initiatives to enhance customer base. The company's strategic endeavors have helped the stock to gain 8.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.2% in the past six months.Tiffany is gradually coming up with new jewelry designs, range of watches and fragrance. It has also introduced “build-your-own program” on its website under which customers are allowed to personalize their charm bracelets. Also, Tiffany is allowing customers to customize rings.Apart from this, the company renewed its licensing agreement with Luxottica Group — slated to expire on Dec 31, 2027 — for the development, production and global distribution of sunglasses and prescription frames. These initiatives reflect the company’s customer-centric focus which is likely to help strengthen its customer base.The company is focusing on opening smaller stores that offer select collections of low priced and high margin products. Tiffany also focuses on improving sales per square foot by driving customer traffic and converting visitors into buyers through targeted advertising, sales training and customer-oriented initiatives.Management also intends to expand its distribution network by adding stores in new and existing markets. On the international front, the company is now focusing on expanding business in the Middle East, Russia, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.However, despite the company’s efforts to boost the top line, rising SG&A expenses are likely to dent the operating margin. In this regard, we note that management expects fiscal 2018 SG&A expenses to increase at a rate higher than sales on account of increased spending on technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations. We noted that in the first, second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, SG&A expenses had increased 0.2%, 3.7%, 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively.Given the pros and cons embedded the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).3 Retail Stocks to Steal the ShowMacy's, Inc.

1117,KSS,"Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.’s (OLLI  -  Free Report) business model of “buying cheap and selling cheap”, cost-containment efforts, focus on store productivity, sturdy comparable-store sales (comps) performance and expansion of customer reward program, Ollie's Army, fortify its position in the Consumer Staples space. These initiatives positioned the stock to augment both its top and bottom-line performance in the long run.A glimpse of Ollie's Bargain share price movement reveals that it has surged roughly 17.6% so far this year. The stock has not only outperformed the industry that witnessed a decline of 7.1% but also the overall sector that fell 5.4%. Notably, shares of this Harrisburg, PA-based company are hovering in proximity to its 52-week high of $63.75, and there is no doubt why Ollie's Bargain could not breach that mark in the near term.A Brief IntrospectionOllie's Bargain has an impressive streak of beating quarterly earnings and revenue estimates. The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the trailing seven quarters and sustained a decent year-over-year improvement.In the trailing four quarters, the company has outperformed the consensus mark by an average of 7.7%. In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 4.1%. We noted that net sales grew 25.9% to $356.7 million, while adjusted earnings per share surged 30.8% to 51 cents during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Comps increased 4.4% during the quarter under review.Management now projects net sales growth of 13.2% to 14.1% during fiscal 2018 and envisions adjusted earnings in the band of $1.65-$1.69 per share compared with $1.25 reported in fiscal 2017. Ollie's Bargain now anticipates comps growth of 1-2%. However, we notice that the projected rate of sales growth for fiscal 2018 is down from 21%, what the company attained in fiscal 2017.Meanwhile, since the announcement of its fourth-quarter results on Apr 4, Ollie's Bargain shares have increased approximately 3.6%.Certainly, the company’s growth initiatives that involve increasing store count to more than 950 in the long run from its current base of 268 are well on track. Also, the company has been making concerted efforts to lower its debt burden and expects to be debt free by the end of fiscal 2018 with a cash balance of about $70-$80 million.Valuation PerspectiveA glance at some valuation metrics indicates that the stock is trading at a high premium. A Value Score of D also indicates the same. The stock looks expensive with respect to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 37.9x versus industry’s 14.0x. Its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 4.8 and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.8 are higher than the industry average of 3.1 and 1.6, respectively. A similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. The company’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 36.4 is higher than 16.7 for the industry.Wrapping UpOllie's Bargain strategic endeavors and long-term prospects place the stock favorably on a growth path. However, an expensive valuation along with a possible fall in rate of fiscal 2018 sales growth may make investors rethink before picking this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.3 Key PicksMacy's, Inc.

1118,KSS,"Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19 after the market closes. In the trailing four quarters, it had outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 23.6%. In the preceding two quarters, it surpassed the consensus mark by 61.5% and 37.2%, respectively.The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Skechers will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the first quarter or not. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The company is likely to report bottom-line growth for the third straight quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 75 cents compared with 60 cents in the prior-year period. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.20 billion, reflecting more than 11.7% growth on a year-over-year basis.Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Quote Encouragingly, management had earlier projected first-quarter  net sales in the band of $1,175-$1,200 million compared with $1,072.8 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the company anticipates earnings per share in the range of 70-75 cents. On top of it, management expects to witness stable-to-better gross margins in the first quarter.Factors at PlaySkechers’ greater emphasis on new line of products, store remodeling projects, cost containment efforts, inventory management and global distribution platform are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, its e-commerce business has also contributed to sales growth. Notably, the company currently operates e-commerce sites in Chile, Germany and the UK, and has launched additional sites in Spain and Canada.Skechers’ international business also remains a considerable sales growth driver for the company, with Europe and China being the biggest markets outside the United States. Furthermore, it is poised to enhance its global reach in the footwear market through its distribution networks, subsidiaries and joint ventures (JVs).However, analysts remain concerned about higher selling, general & administrative expenses that may hurt the company's margin, and in turn the bottom line. Selling expenses have increased 37%, 31.6%, 32.1% and 7.4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Following the same chronological order, general & administrative expenses have also increased 16.6%, 25.5%, 21% and 24.7%, respectively. Nonetheless, the growth rate of general & administrative expenses has decelerated sequentially.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Skechers is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Skechers has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1119,KSS,"The U.S. economy is on a bumpy ride right now as investors are apprehensive about a trade war with China and rate hikes by the Fed.

1120,KSS,"L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) failed to continue with its comparable sales (comps) growth in the month of April. Comps for four-week ended May 5, were flat following an advancement of 4% in March, 3% in February and 7% in January. Sluggishness in Victoria's Secret brand hurt the company’s overall comps performance. An earlier Easter this year also dented comps by about 3 percentage points.However, comps for the month under review fared far better than the prior-year period, when the metric declined 5%. Moreover, net sales rose 4% to $751.6 million during the month under review.   While, comps fell 2% at Victoria’s Secret, the same at Bath & Body Works improved 6%. Moreover, Victoria’s Secret merchandise margin rate fell significantly in April, primarily due to higher promotional activities to boost traffic. However, in case of Bath & Body Works, merchandise margin rate was flat compared with last year.Apart from April comps, L Brands reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 sales results. Net sales jumped 8% year over year to $2.626 billion, while comps improved 3% — reflecting an increase of 1% and 8% at Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works brands, respectively.Management now envisions first-quarter earnings to come in at the lower end of its previously provided guidance range of 15-20 cents a share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 17 cents.3 Things You Ought to KnowStock Has Plummeted 34% in Six MonthsShares of L Brands came under pressure after the company provided soft first-quarter and fiscal 2018 view following fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Notably, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have declined 34.4% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 13.2%. The stock has also underperformed the Retail-Wholesale and the S&P 500 index that advanced 13.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Further, the stock is hovering close to its 52-week low of $30.70.Lower Earnings Beat ProbabilityL Brands is slated to come out with first-quarter results on May 23. Our proven model does not conclusively show that L Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1121,KSS,"During the time of market volatility, investors often rely on value investing rather than other options like growth or momentum. As soon as other investors start selling their stocks at a cheaper rate, value investors take this as an opportunity to pick good stocks at a discounted price.However, this apparently simple value investment technique has some drawbacks and not understanding the strategy properly may often lead to “value traps”. In such a situation, these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once drove the share price down, turn out to be persistent. There are many value investment yardsticks such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, which are simple and can single out whether a stock is trading at a discount.However, for investors looking to escape such value traps, it is also vital to determine where the stock is headed in the next 12 to 24 months. Warren Buffett advises these investors to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock. This is where lies the importance of a not-so-popular value investing metric, the PEG ratio.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/ Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five out of the 26 stocks that qualified the screening:Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report): The company develops and distributes anti-aging personal care products and nutritional supplements under the Nu Skin and Pharmanex category brands worldwide.  The stock can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #2 and Value Score of B. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, the stock also has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 8.8%.Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report): The company is a prominent name in the field of omnichannel retail with more than 1,100 stores in 49 states. Apart from a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A, the company also has an impressive growth rate of 13.7% for the next fiscal.Olin Corporation (OLN  -  Free Report): This global manufacturer and distributor of chemical products operates through three segments - Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls; Epoxy and Winchester.

1122,KSS,"With retailers reporting sturdiest holiday sales growth since the end of the Great Recession, Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) also came out with solid sales numbers and provided optimistic view for fiscal 2017. However, despite reporting robust holiday sales the stock gained only 1.3% as the company stated that it will take time to bring the previous negative comparable store sales trend back on track.The jewelry retailer posted better-than-expected sales results for the November-December holiday period. Net sales came in at $1.05 billion, up 8% from the prior-year period. Moreover, comparable-store sales (comps) increased 5%. In constant currencies, net sales rose 6%, while comps gained 3%.Management stated that robust holiday sales were driven by improved performances both instore and online. The company witnessed growth in sales of fashion jewelry, fine jewelry, watches as well as new home and accessories collection.Meanwhile, Tiffany’s competitor Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG  -  Free Report) witnessed dismal holiday season results. Signet’s total sales for the nine-week period ended Dec 30, 2017, decreased 3.1% to $1,881.7 million from $1,940.9 million in the prior year, while same store sales fell 5.3%. On a constant currency basis, total sales dropped 3.9%.Net Sales by RegionsSales in the Americas rose 7% to $516 million, while comps also increased by 6%. Higher spending by local customers and growth across the United States, Canada as well as Latin America drove the region sales.Sales in the Asia-Pacific region jumped 16% to $232 million, while comps were up 7% primarily driven by fresh store opening and rise in wholesale sales. Rise in retail sales were owing to surge in spending mainly in mainland China, Hong Kong and Korea.Sales in Japan inched up 1% to $145 million, while comps remained flat.Sales in Europe came in at $136 million, up 14%, while comps gained 2%.On constant currency, sales rose 5% but comps declined 7%.Other sales came in at $18 million, down 10% but comps increased 14%. The company stated that increase in comps was overshadowed by fall diamond wholesale sales.OutlookFollowing, robust holiday sales the company raised its fiscal 2017 view. The company now expects sales on a reported and constant-exchange-rate basis to increase by nearly 4%, compared with prior guidance of increase by a low-single-digit percentage.Management now anticipates fiscal 2017 earnings per share to increase by a double-digit percentage from fiscal 2016 earnings of $3.55, compared with the earlier estimate of rise by high-single-digit percentage. Moreover, it expects earnings to jump by at least a high-single digit percentage over adjusted earnings of $3.75 per share reported in fiscal 2016, up from the prior estimate of rise by mid-single digit percentage.Nonetheless, management stated that the updated guidance doesn’t include any impact from the latest tax reforms.The company also provided preliminary view for fiscal 2018. It anticipates sales to increase by mid-single digit percentage. However, expects earnings for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of flat to down marginally from the estimated fiscal 2017 earnings.Bottom LineWe still believe Tiffany’s omni-channel platform, store expansion programs, tapping of new markets and venturing into new revenue generating avenues is likely to help improve performance.

1123,KSS,"Williams-Sonoma, Inc.’s (WSM  -  Free Report) consistent enhancement of e-commerce channel, optimization of supply chain and the transformation of retail fleet through investment in new and remodeled stores have been the principle growth drivers.Recently, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%. The figure increased 8.4% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Net revenues came ahead of the consensus mark and improved 6.2% year over year. Comparable brand revenues rose 5.4% in the quarter, better than 3.3% increase in the preceding quarter and 0.9% decline in the year-ago quarter. The figure marks the highest fourth-quarter comps registered by the company in several years, driven by broad-based strength in all its brands.Revenues in the e-commerce segment were up 8.4%, while the Retail segment improved 3.9% from the prior-year quarter.Key Growth DriversE-commerce channel has driven substantial growth for Williams-Sonoma.  The segment generates around 53% of revenues and has been consistently posting impressive results. The company saw a 5.5% growth in its e-commerce channel in 2017. Williams-Sonoma is expected to generate more revenues from e-commerce, as it focuses on re-platforming its mobile sites to progressive web app technology, streamlining checkout process and implementing the next-generation of machine learning, on-site search as well as personalization experience.In addition to focused investment in the e-commerce segment, Williams-Sonoma consistently innovates to keep pace with the changing preferences of consumers. The company collaborates with celebrated brands and designers to offer exclusive designs on home furnishings products. The company believes that collaborations with designers and brands attract new customers as well as introduce new trends in home furnishing.The company is focused on enhancing customer experience through improved and innovative marketing techniques. In order to drive brand awareness, it shifted advertising spend toward social media campaigns and in cross-brand initiatives to increase customer engagement and cross-selling opportunities across its brands. Such initiatives drove total customer growth by 5%, the highest increase since 2014.In 2017, the acquisition of Outward, Inc, a leading 3D imaging and augmented reality platform, is expected to improve product visualization and design capabilities. This will elevate customer experience, increase conversion and reduce returns for William-Sonoma.ConcernsThe specialty e-commerce and retail businesses are highly competitive. Williams-Sonoma competes with other retailers that market similar merchandise. The substantial sales growth in the e-commerce industry in the last decade has encouraged the entry of competitors and introduced new business models. Increased competition might dent Williams-Sonoma’s sales and operating results.Moreover, although Williams-Sonoma derives substantial revenues from efficient catalog circulation and digital marketing, it is affected by costs associated with continued investments in e-commerce. Further, supply chain investments are denting the company’s operating margins. In 2017, the company’s operating margin was down 70 basis points (bps) year over year. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWilliams-Sonoma carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector are Dillard's, Inc.

1124,KSS,"Retail is no more constrained to its brick-&-mortar existence. Instead it is rapidly accepting the concepts of an increasingly digitized world as advancing technology and digital transformation are playing key roles in evolving consumer shopping patterns. Retailers are now focusing more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. Although Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) is not fully immune to retail headwinds, this department store retailer is leaving no stone unturned to be on growth trajectory.This is well reflected by this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock’s bullish run in the past three months in a market that fell victim to escalating trade war between the United States and China. In the said period, shares of this seller of apparel and accessories, cosmetics, home furnishings and other consumer goods surged 23.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 18.1%.Macy’s Get its Act TogetherMacy’s has announced a slew of measures revolving around store closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omni-channel capabilities to enhance sales, profitability and cash flows. Additionally, management is developing e-commerce business, Macy’s Backstage off-price business along with expanding Bluemercury and online order fulfillment centers.Moreover, the company had introduced various innovative services including Apple Pay, Same Day Delivery, Enhanced Shopping Apps, Innovation in Stores Selling Technology, Macy’s Image Search and Macy’s Wallet/Bloomingdale’s Wallet. The company’s “Buy Online Pickup in Store” initiative is also gaining traction. The company has added a new feature to its mobile app called Mobile Checkout, which allows customers to scan bar codes of items and pay via smartphones.Management is realigning operations and focusing on curtailing costs. The company has closed 81 Macy’s stores, as part of its planned closure of about 100 stores announced in August 2016, and plans to shutter about 19 more stores. Further, the company will streamline some of the non-functional stores.These efforts will result in annual cost saving of $300 million beginning 2018 and would allow the company to invest the same in enhancing digital business and store-related growth initiatives. Macy’s had earlier announced the restructuring of its merchandising operations that includes combining of merchandising, planning and private brands divisions into one segment.Wrapping UpAmid a competitive retail scenario, Macy’s has taken several strategic initiatives to adapt to the ongoing changes in the industry. These initiatives have aided the company to post earnings beat for the third straight quarter, when it reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The big take away from the quarter was rise in comparable sales after witnessing a decline the past few quarters. Further, management hinted that strategic investments across stores, technology and merchandising are likely to increase comparable sales in fiscal 2018.Interested in the Retail Space, Check TheseUrban Outfitters, Inc.

1125,KSS,"Shares of Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG  -  Free Report) lost sheen in the index and declined roughly 6.9% yesterday, following lackluster performance this holiday season and soft fiscal 2018 guidance. The company’s dismal holiday sales results were primarily due to negative effect of the credit outsourcing transition and weakness at UK Jewelry division. Further, challenging retail landscape, aggressive promotional strategies and waning mall traffic were the other reasons behind lower-than-expected results.Signet’s total sales for the nine-week period ended Dec 30, 2017, decreased 3.1% to $1,881.7 million from $1,940.9 million in the prior year, while same store sales fell 5.3%. On a constant currency basis, total sales dropped 3.9%. However, e-commerce sales in the holiday season surged 47.7% to $210.5 million from the year-ago period. Sharp increase in e-commerce sales were primarily driven by R2Net buyout. During the holiday season, the company raised digital marketing expenditure by 35%, compared with prior year spending of 29%.Same store sales across Sterling Jewelers division and UK Jewelry division fell 8.5% and 10.3%, respectively. However, same store sales at Zale division rose 4%.This holiday season performance was more or less similar to that of 2016, where total sales decreased 5.1% and same store sales declined 4.6% in the nine-week period ended Dec 31, 2016.The dismal results compelled management to adopt a more conservative view. Signet now expects fiscal 2018 earnings (excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform) in the range of $6.17-$6.22, compared with the prior guidance of $6.10-$6.50. Moreover, earnings (including the impact of U.S. tax reform) are estimated to be in range of $6.45-$6.50. Meanwhile, the company continues to expect same store sales to decline by mid-single digits.Apart from Signet, other retailers such as Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) registered sales growth of 3.6% and 6.9%, respectively, during the November-December period, while both J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) recorded comparable store sales growth of 3.4%.Bottom LineSignet’s dull holiday season and subsequent tightening of guidance has hurt investor sentiment and it would not be a surprise if shares slide further in the coming days.

1126,KSS,"Bargain hunters are back on the streets buying furniture and appliances, and dining out, as U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in the month of March, thus ending the streak of three straight declines. With strengthening labor market, tax reform and rising incomes Americans look much more confident now. Moreover, annual tax refunds are also likely to increase their propensity to consume. Clearly, consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy — is likely to remain strong in the months ahead.Retail Sales Bounce BackThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in March advanced 0.6% to $494.6 billion — following a decline of 0.1% and 0.2% registered in February and January, respectively. Analysts cited that slump in retail sales in the first two months of the year was a temporary hitch after a sturdy holiday season. Although unfavorable weather played spoilsport, Easter holiday lifted consumers’ shopping spirit.Notably, retail sales improved 4.5% from March 2017. The report suggests that sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers increased 2%, while sales at electronics & appliance stores rose 0.5%. Meanwhile, sales at food & beverage stores and receipts at restaurants witnessed growth of 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 0.8% and increased 9.7% from the prior-year period.However, receipts at gasoline stations and sales at building material dealers fell 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Sales at sporting goods, hobby, book & music stores dipped 1.8%, while at clothing shops the same fell 0.8%.This Means a Lot to RetailersPick up in retail sales is welcome news for retailers, whose fortunes depend upon consumers’ willingness to spend. A robust job market, massive tax cuts and sound economic fundamentals are likely to boost consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending. Certainly, favorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector.For obvious reasons, retailers are the end gainers. With digital transformation in shopping, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. Moreover, National Retail Federation’s projection of an uptick in U.S. retail sales of 3.8-4.4% this year raises optimism. Additionally, the recent cut in corporate tax rate will allow retailers to channelize the surplus money toward best possible alternatives.Notably, the Retail-Wholesale sector has advanced roughly 10% in the past six months and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 5%. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness year-over-year bottom-line growth of 12%, per the Earnings Preview. This fares much better than the previous quarter, where earnings climbed 3%. The top line is also projected to increase 7.6% compared with 9.7% growth registered in the preceding quarter.Wrapping UpWith earnings season all set to gather momentum it will be prudent to hold on to some retail stocks that are likely to beat estimates.

1128,KSS,"This holiday season Americans were in the mood to spend. Improved economic scenario with a low unemployment rate resulted in sturdiest holiday sales growth since the end of the Great Recession. Cash registers at stores jingled as much as online channels, letting the retailers rejoice. Per National Retail Federation, retail sales during the November/December period increased 5.5% to $691.9 billion. Moreover, online shopping sales this holiday season increased 14.7% to $108.2 billion, per Adobe Analytics.Our today’s article revolves around three department store stocks — Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) and Macy’s, Inc.’s (M  -  Free Report),— as to how the holiday season has unfolded for them. Promising holiday sales numbers have not only helped the industry to rally 10.9% in a month but also outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 3.2%. We noted that the industry occupies a space in the top 7% of the Zacks Classified industries (19 out of the 265). Further, the broader Retail And Wholesale sector of which they are part of, is also placed at top 13% of the Zacks Classified sectors (2 out of 16).From the above mentioned scenario, it is quite evident that the near-term outlook for the industry is robust, and it is likely to continue the upward movement. Let’s take a closer look at department store stocks performance.Kohl's Posts Solid Holiday CompsKohl's Corporation holiday sales numbers were most impressive among the departmental stores retailers. Both comps and total sales advanced 6.9% year over year, for the combined November and December period. Notably, this marks significant improvement from 2.1% and 2.7% drop in comps and total sales, respectively, witnessed in the 2016 holiday season. We believe that sustained focus on technology improvements and omni-channel expansion is likely to fuel growth at Kohl’s. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s better-than-expected holiday performance and optimistic vision for January encouraged management to raise fiscal 2017 earnings outlook from $3.72-$3.92 per share to $4.10-$4.20.Nonetheless, management stated that the updated guidance doesn’t include any impact from the latest tax reforms, which is likely to have a favorable impact on the company’s effective tax rate. Moreover, amendments in the federal tax legislation are expected to generate a non-cash tax benefit associated with 2017 deferred tax balances.JC Penney Holiday Comps RiseJ. C. Penney Company reported positive comps this festive season, unlike the prior year. It delivered comps growth of 3.4% for the combined nine weeks period, ending on Dec 30, 2017. Robust comps performance was driven by solid sales at home, beauty and fine jewelry. It was also propelled by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s sturdy e-commerce business that recorded double-digit sales increase year over year.E-commerce growth was primarily driven by sought-after gifting categories like home decor, luggage, fine jewelry, toys, boots and athletic footwear. Apparel categories, mainly women’s and kids, continued positive momentum as well.Macy’s Witness Modest Growth in CompsDespite taking a slew of measures to improve performance Macy’s holiday sales numbers improved modestly. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis increased 1.1% during November and December period combined, while on an owned basis, the same inched up 1%. Following the modest increase in holiday sales, the company narrowed sales guidance. The company now anticipates sales for fiscal 2017 on an owned basis to decline between 2.4% and 2.7%, compared with the prior guided range of decrease by 2.2-3.3%.Macy’s informed that digital business remained robust and also witnessed improvement in sales trend at stores. Further, holiday sales displayed strength at Macy’s, Macy’s Backstage, Bloomingdale’s, Bloomingdale’s The Outlet and Bluemercury.

1129,KSS,"The reflection of GameStop Corp.’s (GME  -  Free Report) robust holiday sales results was not visible in the stock performances. Shares of this Grapevine, TX-based plunged more than 11% on Jan 12. Market experts pointed that the company’s updated fiscal 2017 earnings view came below analyst expectations giving investors cold feet.The dismal run in the bourses led the stock to decline 4.8% in a month, against the industry’s growth of 7.7%.Let’s Take a Close LookThe company generated total global sales of $2.77 billion for the nine-week holiday period ended December 30, 2017, up 10.6% year over year. Comps increased 11.8%, reflecting a gain of 13.7% in the United States as well as 7.9% internationally.

New video game software sales rose 7.3% primarily due to Activision’s Call of Duty: WWII and Nintendo Switch titles. Pre-owned sales fell 8.1%, while video games accessories sales advanced 33.7%.Now let’s take a look at non-physical gaming business performance during the holiday period. Collectibles sales surged 19.1% to $211.3 million on account of robust performances across apparel and toys. However, Technology Brands revenues declined 18.6% due to shortage of iPhone 10 supply and AT&T changes to compensation structure in 2017. However, digital sales and non-GAAP digital receipts surged 36.7% and 6.7%, respectively.OutlookManagement stated that given the product category sales mix during the festive season, it now anticipates adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 near the middle of its earlier provided guidance range of $3.10-$3.40.

1130,KSS,"Shares of Genesco Inc. (GCO  -  Free Report) gained 5.4% since the company reported encouraging fourth quarter-to-date fiscal 2018 comparable sales (comps) results on Jan 8.Genesco’s fourth-quarter period mainly covers the holiday season, which turned out to be the best one in the last few years. According to MasterCard SpendingPulse, sales (excluding automobiles) from Nov 1 to Dec 24, 2017 jumped 4.9%, compared with 3.7% rise in the prior-year period. This marked the biggest year-over-year increase in holiday spending since 2011.Also, retailers like American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) have witnessed a blissful holiday season, which is evident from comps growth of 8%, 6.9% and 3.4%, respectively.A Brief IntrospectionGenesco reported comps growth of 1%, including both stores and direct sales, for the fourth-quarter-to-date period that ended on Jan 4, 2018. Comps at e-commerce business rose 17% year over year. However, excluding e-commerce, comps dipped 2%.Segment-wise, comps (including stores and direct) improved 10%, 5% and 1%, respectively, at Journeys Group, Johnston & Murphy Group and Schuh Group while comps plunged 14% at Lids Sports Group.Management stated that the company was successful in creating momentum for its Journeys division this holiday season after a robust back-to-school season. On the contrary, the company’s Lids Sports segment witnessed a tough time this holiday season. Furthermore, the Schuh Group witnessed a solid holiday period in the United Kingdom backed by increased promotions.Consequently, Genesco continues to project comps for the fiscal fourth quarter in the range of flat to up 1%. However, the company expects soft gross margin to achieve these sales, hence ending the fiscal with optimal inventory.Driven by the current trends and fourth-quarter-to-date performance, management envisions adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 to come toward the lower end of $3.05-$3.35 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year is currently pegged at $3.13.Genesco is slated to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 15, 2018.Stock’s PerformanceA look upon the company’s share price shows that it gained 10.9% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 18.6%. This underperformance can be primarily attributable to the company’s unimpressive surprise history.Evidently, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three consecutive quarters, delivering a trailing four-quarter average miss of 33.1%. Further, its sales missed the consensus mark in six out of seven straight quarters.Let’s see whether the decent holiday comps will lead to a turnaround in the company’s performance, pushing the stock higher.

The firm is also currently trading at a respectable 19.23x earnings, which marks a major discount compared to the “Computer - Software” industry average.On top of that, SS&C’s cash flow growth rate of 42.54% crushes its industry’s average and could help facilitate moves such as the company’s current DST acquisition talks. Looking ahead, the company’s full-year 2017 earnings are projected to jump 17.68% and hit $1.93 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.2.       Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

1132,KSS,"Holiday season and retail are synonymous, and with festive season almost over, it’s time to analyze the retailers’ performance. Notably, retailers stay on their toes during this busiest part of the year, flooding the market with offers and promotions. They sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases. Since the season accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits, retailers grab every opportunity to drive footfall.Best Holiday Sales Since 2011The holiday season was the best in few years, as cash registers at stores jingled as much as online channels, letting the retailers rejoice. According to MasterCard SpendingPulse, sales (excluding automobiles) during the November/December period jumped 4.9% compared with 3.7% rise in the prior-year period. This marks the biggest year-over-year increase in holiday spending since 2011.Per report, sales of electronics and appliances, jewelry, and home furnishings rose 7.5%, 5.9% and 5.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, specialty apparel as well as department stores witnessed “moderate” sales increase. The data by MasterCard SpendingPulse fared better than the National Retail Federation (“NRF”) projection of 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) and eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales.Retailers’ ScorecardDiscount Retailers — Target & CostcoThe two major discount retailers Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) impressed investors with stellar comparable sales performance. Target reported comparable sales growth of 3.4% for the November and December period driven by robust traffic growth and unrelenting strength in digital sales. Following, robust comps performance this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company raised fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings guidance. The company now expects fourth-quarter earnings per share in the band of $1.30 to $1.40, up from the prior guided range of $1.05 to $1.25. For the full year, Target anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.64 to $4.74, compared with the prior estimate of $4.40 to $4.60.Meanwhile, Costco continued with its solid comparable-store sales (comps) trend in the month of December as well. Comps for five-week ended Dec 31, 2017 increased 11.5%, following an increase of 10.8% in November. We believe that the hike in annual membership fees and higher penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program are benefiting the company. We are also encouraged by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s expansion strategy, as it remains committed to opening new clubs and expanding e-commerce capabilities.Departmental Store Retailers — Kohl’s, Macy’s, JC PenneyKohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) holiday sales numbers were most impressive among the departmental stores retailers. Both comps and total sales advanced 6.9% year over year, for the combined November and December period. Notably, this marks a significant improvement from a 2.1% and 2.7% respective drop in comps and total sales witnessed in the 2016 holiday season. We believe that sustained focus on technology improvements and omni-channel expansion is likely to fuel further growth at Kohl’s. In fact, this Zacks Rank #3 company’s better-than-expected holiday performance and optimistic vision for January encouraged management to raise fiscal 2017 earnings outlook from $3.72-$3.92 to $4.10 to $4.20 per share.Meanwhile, J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) reported positive comps this festive season, unlike the prior year. It delivered comps growth of 3.4% for the combined nine weeks period, ending on Dec 30, 2017. Robust comps performance was driven by solid sales at home, beauty and fine jewelry. It was also fueled by this Zacks Rank #3 company’s sturdy e-commerce business that recorded double-digit sales increase year over year.Meanwhile, despite taking a slew of measures to improve performance Macy’s, Inc.’s (M  -  Free Report) holiday sales numbers improved modestly. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis increased 1.1% during November and December period combined, while on an owned basis, the same inched up 1%. Following modest increase in holiday sales, this Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy) company narrowed its sales guidance. The company now expects sales for fiscal 2017 on an owned basis to decline between 2.4% and 2.7%, compared with the prior guided range of decrease by 2.2-3.3%.Apparel Retailers – Lululemon Athletica & Urban OutfittersLululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) was also among the retailers that emerged strong this holiday season driven by accelerating trends witnessed across all parts of its businesses. This prompted management to lift its fiscal 2017 guidance. This Zacks Rank #2 company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of $1.25-$1.27, up from the earlier guided range of $1.19-$1.22.Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) disclosed holiday sales numbers, wherein comparable retail segment net sales, including the comparable direct-to-consumer channel, gained 2%. For the month of November and December comparable retail segment net sales rose 1% at Urban Outfitters, 5% at Free People and 2% at the Anthropologie Group. Gain in comparable retail sales were driven by double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel. Despite reporting year-over-year increase in holiday sales, the stock came under pressure primarily due to lower-than-expected comps. In early December, the company in a filing stated that “Thus far during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, comparable Retail segment net sales are mid-single-digit positive”. However, comps for the November and December increased by low-single digit, which gives an indication that the company failed to carry its initial momentum in the latter part of holiday season.However, we believe new store openings, increase in direct penetration, growing wholesale operations and merchandising improvements bode well for the long term. Management is also making all possible efforts to enhance the performance of brands through store refurbishment and by bringing in more compelling assortments. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Wrapping UpFrom the above discussion it is clear that quite a few retailers had a wonderful holiday season. Based on the performance we are quite optimistic about retailers’ fourth-quarter results. Per the Earnings Trends, the total earnings for Retail/Wholesale sector are likely to witness a growth of 3.9% in the fourth quarter, while revenues are estimated to rise 8.4%.Retail/Wholesale, which currently occupies top 19% (3 out of 16) position among the Zacks Classified sectors has surged 34.5% in a year, outperforming the S&P 500 growth of 23.9%. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1133,KSS,"Ascena Retail Group, Inc. (ASNA  -  Free Report) declined nearly 2.4% since it came out with holiday sales results on Jan 8. The company failed to put up a stellar show this holiday season, which has, however, been a marvelous one for retailers like American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report).Ascena’s consolidated comparable sales (comps) dipped 3% for the holiday period extending from Nov 18, 2017 through Jan 1, 2018.  A Brief IntrospectionAscena’s dismal comps performance stemmed from the negative comps witnessed at the company’s Plus Fashion, Premium Fashion, Value Fashion segments, somewhat offset by comps growth at the Kids Fashion (Justice) division.Segment-wise, comps declined 2% at Plus Fashion, 3% at Premium Fashion and 9% at Value Fashion. On the contrary, the same increased 4% at Kids Fashion. Under the Plus Fashion division, Catherines brand reported comps decline of 7% while Lane Bryant delivered flat comps. At Premium Fashion segment, comps for LOFT and Ann Taylor brands fell 1% and 6%, respectively. Likewise, comps for Value Fashion’s maurices and dressbarn brands plunged 6% and 13%, respectively.Moreover, enterprise comps dropped 3% so far in the quarter. Management stated that it is witnessing serious merchandising issues at the dressbarn brand, though it expects trend to improve with the advent of the spring season.Furthermore, management reiterated its second-quarter fiscal 2018 loss per share guidance of 7-12 cents, excluding the possible effects of recent tax reform. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same quarter is currently pegged at a loss of 9 cents per share.Stock’s Dismal Run on the BoursesA look upon this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s share price performance in a year shows that it has plummeted 63%, significantly wider than the industry’s fall of 1.8%. This downtrend can be mainly attributable to the company’s dismal comps performance in the past few quarters, owing to fall in average selling price and sluggish store traffic.Apparently, the company’s total comps dropped 5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Also, it declined 4%, 8%, 4% and 5% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Ascena reported in-line earnings with lower-than-expected sales.

1134,KSS,"It has been just seven trading sessions so far in the year, and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is off to a solid start. Of late, this general merchandise retailer has been one of the most talked about stocks in the Wall Street thanks to Gene Munster’s prediction of it featuring in the Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) buyout list and strong holiday sales amid ultra-competitive retail environment.This Minneapolis, MN-based company has displayed a strong run in the bourses rising roughly 5% in the chart as against the S&P 500’s growth of approximately 2% so far in the year. Meanwhile, SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) has just gained a meager 0.3%.A Brief IntrospectionTarget has been hogging the limelight following Munster forecast. The famous tech analyst highlighted that given “shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count” Target remains a perfect choice for Amazon. Munster added that if the acquisition takes place, Amazon may have to shell out $41 billion. Well this was enough to shake the retail industry, which has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns.Nevertheless, Target emerged strong this holiday season joining the bandwagon of retailers — Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Zumiez  — who witnessed strong sales. Comparable sales rose 3.4% in the combined November/December period buoyed by healthy store comps, robust traffic and sturdy digital sales. The solid holiday numbers allowed management to lift the view. (Read: Target Joins Bandwagon, Posts Solid Holiday Sales, Ups View)But can Target offer investors better upside in the days ahead? Here is a short analysis.Sound FundamentalsTarget has taken steps that have improved prospects in a big way. The company’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well. These are going to play a major role in 2018.It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge.

1135,KSS,"The United States and its allies have launched target missiles on Syria, dragging the benchmarks down in the final hours of trading on Apr 13. Such escalating tensions, however, shouldn’t dampen investors’ spirits for long.After all, mounting military tensions, historically, has had no effect on markets but on humans. In fact, markets in crisis have usually recovered quickly. Keeping this in mind, investing in solid growth stocks doesn’t seem to be a bad proposition.Syria Air StrikesWestern powers had carried out missile attacks at the heart of Syria’s chemical weapons facilities. The United States, France and Britain launched 105 cruise missiles on three chemical weapon facilities, including a development center in Damascus’ Barzeh region and two installations near Homs. The strike was carried out after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had sanctioned a chemical weapon attack on civilians in Damascus.This retaliation was the biggest by any Western force against Assad and his superpower ally Russia. However, the Western countries did mention that the strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapon facilities and not aimed at Assad. Nevertheless, such targeted military strikes against the Syrian government have dented investors’ sentiment of late.Investors Shouldn’t PanicInvestors should not fear a missile strike on Syria as such attacks have limited impact on the stock market, especially over the long run. Jeffrey Kleintop, the chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co, said that immediately after a military strike, markets tend to lose around 0.3%, but there is nothing earth-shattering about it. Such movements happen during every normal trading session almost.In fact, post-crisis lows open up good buying opportunities, per an analysis conducted by Ned Davis Research. After major geopolitical crisis in the past century, they have found that the market rebound has been so solid that within six months it stands higher than where it was before the catastrophe.Ned Davis Research analyzed that the Dow Jones Industrial Average on average fell 3.2% after any crisis, yet by six months, the blue-chip index manages to recover from the lows. In fact, it scales higher in 12 months’ time. If the Sep 11, 2011 attack is to be considered, the index tanked 17.5% five trading sessions later. But, it bounced back in less than two months and was higher than where it had been on Sep 10.Trump has tweeted that attacks on Syria were “mission accomplished.” This also suggests that the President won’t be carrying out attacks that may raise risks of a broader conflict, involving Russia.Time for Traders to Cheer UpThe American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), in the meantime, showed that bearish sentiments in the market jumped 6.1 percentage points to 42.8%. The Syrian crisis and China’s trade surplus with the U.S. improving, thereby, adding fuel to the ongoing trade conflict added to the bearish sentiments.However, the AAII survey is always used as a contrarian indicator, boosting traders’ confidence when the readings get scary. And why not? As investor sentiments are now decidedly bearish, the market has neared a bottom, which means it has only one way to go, that’s upward.5 Top WinnersWith the markets expected to scale north after a crisis, investing in sound growth stocks seems judicious.

1136,KSS,"Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) has been struggling with weak sales volumes, especially in its North American and Mexico operations for a while. Unfortunately, this trend lingered in fourth-quarter 2017, as evident from the company’s recently reported preliminary volume points data.Preliminary Volume ResultsHerbalife’s preliminary regional volume metrics reveal declines of 7.3%, 8.4% and 6.6% across North American, Mexico and South & Central American regions, respectively. Preliminary results for the upcoming quarter indicate sales volume point growth of 0.2%, 9.6% and 4.5% in its Asia Pacific, China and the EMEA regions respectively. However, the upsides were inadequate to offset the declines in the aforementioned regions. As a result, the company’s overall sales volume points went down 1.8%.Persistent Volume Declines Dent Price PerformanceNotably, Herbalife has been battling soft volumes due to stringent FTC regulations in the United States, which has been marring sales in the North American region. Further, volumes have been weak in the Mexico region, stemming from the impact of earthquakes in 2017. In fact, adverse environment conditions hurt Mexican volumes by 200 bps during the third quarter. Due to such headwinds the company’s top line registered a decline of 3.3% while sales volume slid 5.6% during the third quarter. The quarter marked the fourth consecutive period of year-over-year top-line decline.Further, management expects adverse conditions to persist in the aforementioned markets and drag overall top-line performance. Per management’s earlier view for full-year 2017, sales are anticipated to decline in the range of 1.9-0.6%, while on a currency adjusted basis the same is expected to fall 2.1% to 0.8%. Additionally, volumes in 2017 are expected to witness a drop of 4.2-2.9%.         The dismal outlook for 2017 combined with soft sales volumes trends across several key markets, have also affected investors’ optimism in the stock. Evidently, Herbalife’s shares have lost 9.1% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rally of 4.1%. Can Strategies Help the Stock to Revive?Herbalife continues to focus on implementing new technologies; shifting distributors’ inclination toward learning latest business methods, undertaking innovations and launching products. Additionally, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been on track with its expense management efforts.The company is progressing well with its strategic plans to induce growth and expects to witness improved trends in 2018.Do Retail Stocks Grab Your Attention?

1137,KSS,"The Wall Street is juggling with various macro and micro issues at the moment, including U.S.-China trade dispute, Facebook data breach, apprehensions about three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year and latest being the airstrike on Syria. All these events have kept the market on tenterhooks with investors scurrying for safe havens. A clear reflection of these factors were visible in the recent outcome of the Consumer Sentiment data that declined from its 14-year high.Per the preliminary report released by the University of Michigan, Consumer Sentiment index dropped to 97.8 in April from March’s reading of 101.4, and also came below analysts’ expectations of 100.5. Economists blamed negative news that popped up time and again for the nervousness in the market.Do Retailers Need to Worry?Apparently, consumers’ expectations about the economy have somewhat retreated. A fall in consumer sentiment may impact consumers’ spending pattern, which accounts for over two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity. Undoubtedly, reluctance on the part of consumers to spend more is the last thing retailers want.Nevertheless, experts are of the opinion that consumer sentiment still remains at a decent level. Notably, the index inched up 0.8% this month from a year earlier. Published on The Wall Street Journal, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, Ian Shepherdson, said “the current conditions index spiked in March, presumably as people saw the tax cuts coming through, so a correction in April was always a decent bet.”Definitely, the retailers have nothing to fear as of now. A robust job market, massive tax cuts and sound economic fundamentals are likely to trigger consumer spending. Notably, a strengthening labor market may lead to gradual wage acceleration, and in turn boost consumer confidence. All these sound constructive for retailers.Notably, the Retail-Wholesale sector has advanced roughly 10% in the past six months and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 4%. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness year-over-year bottom-line growth of 12%, per the Earnings Preview. This fares much better than the previous quarter, where earnings climbed 3%. Top-line is also projected to increase 7.6% compared with 9.7% growth registered in the preceding quarter.Wrapping UpWith earnings season all set to gather momentum it will be prudent to hold on to some retail stocks that are likely to beat estimates. These are stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

1138,KSS,"With a wide array of retail partnerships, Iconix Brand Group, Inc.’s (ICON  -  Free Report) international segment continues to expand steadily. However, dismal results in the company’s men’s and home segments have been posing concerns for a while. Also, such headwinds have weighed upon the company’s stock that declined 21.2% in the past three months against the industry’s rise of 3.3%.Weak Segments Hurt RevenuesIncreased competition seems to have taken a toll on the company’s men’s and home segments. During fourth-quarter 2017, sales at the Men’s category declined 30% while revenues from the home segment dipped 6%. Consequently, net licensing revenues went down 11% year on year. Moreover, due to such dismal segment performances, Iconix’s top line fell 7%, 10% and 13% year on year, during the third, second and first quarters of 2017, respectively. Persistent declines in top-line performance compelled management to provide dismal view for 2018.  Management expects revenues in the range of $190-220 million, depicting a considerable fall from $225.8 million in 2017. Can International Business Offer Respite?Iconix’s international business has been growing at a steady pace, owing to well-chalked initiatives. Evidently, the company has undertaken several efforts to bolster its business in Canada, since its products are quite underpenetrated in the region. In 2017, Iconix purchased the remaining 50% interest in Iconix Canada. Also, the company’s 51% interest in the Buffalo brand (acquired in 2013) will solidify its position for organic growth in Canada and the United States.Prior to this, in 2015 and 2014, the company acquired the remaining 50% stake in Iconix China and Latin America, respectively. It also established a joint venture in the Middle East and North America in December 2014. In January 2014, the company acquired 1% interest in Iconix Europe, thereby increasing its ownership to 51%. Apart from these, the company has international joint ventures in Australia, Israel and India. Courtesy of such efforts, revenues in the international segment grew 10%, 4% and 3% in the fourth, third and second quarters of 2017, respectivelyFurther, the company is expected to continue expanding its international footprint. Moreover, with more than 50 direct to retail partnerships and 400 licensees worldwide with several retail giants like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Iconix is expected to continue the expansion and fortification of its global position. We hope that such dedicated endeavors will aid this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in combating the weaknesses across its men’s and home categories and uplift shareholders’ confidence in the stock.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1141,KSS,"The holiday season has started off on a solid note this year. With retailers offering hefty discounts, online sales during Thanksgiving and Black Friday hit all-time highs.Per GBH Insights, the retailer Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) dominated online sales during Black Friday and accounted for 45-50% sales. The company raked in more than $1 billion sales in just 24 hours. Amazon stated that on Thanksgiving day, orders via mobiles increased more than 50% than the year-ago period.A Look at the Sales FiguresAccording to Adobe Analytics, U.S. retailers garnered $7.9 billion from Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales, up 17.9% year over year. While Thanksgiving sales increased 18.3% year over year to $2.9 billion, Black Friday sales increased 16.9% to $5 billion.Further, Adobe expects Cyber Monday to be the biggest ever U.S. online shopping day with roughly $6.6 billion of sales.

Lower-priced goods, free shipping and product availability are the primary factors driving online shopping this season.Strong economic indicators like record job data and declining unemployment rate are encouraging shoppers to spend more online. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the domestic economy generated 261,000 new jobs in October, the highest so far in 2017. Also, the unemployment rate of 4.1% in the month is the lowest this year.Impressive third-quarter results and record quarterly GDP numbers reflect the economy’s financial strength.

On top of that, the company said that it is still looking for another $200 million in financing.

1143,KSS,"The holiday season has kicked off with Thanksgiving Day and now it’s time for Black Friday — one of the busiest shopping days of the year.

Of them, 70% (115 million) are planning to shop on Black Friday. An improving economy, acceleration in the job market, increasing consumer confidence and high spending power will make Black Friday a huge success  (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).Though e-commerce or online shopping has been a key source of sales in recent times, queuing up and camping out for Black Friday has become as much of an American tradition as the feast itself.  What’s Hot?Black Friday sales bonanza both online and in stores is already in full swing as a number of retailers have offered their deals early. We have highlighted some of the best deals from retailers.Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is ahead of all retailers offering attractive deals across 30 product categories from Thanksgiving Day to Cyber Monday.

1144,KSS,"Thanksgiving is just round the corner, marking the start of a busy period for retail stocks. While Thanksgiving is the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season, Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest shopping days of the year.According to a survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics last week, about 164 million people or 69% of Americans plan to shop over the weekend which includes Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Sunday as well as Cyber Monday. Both online and brick-and-mortar stores provide competitive offers and discounts during this period to attract customers.Black Friday is expected to be the busiest day this weekend with about 115 million people planning to shop this day. While 71 million people plan to shop on Saturday, Cyber Monday is expected to see about 78 million shoppers. With just 2% of consumers having completed their holiday shopping, Black Friday will be a very important day for e-commerce stocks and retailers with many companies reporting their highest profits on this day. The holiday season gives retailers the opportunity to improve traffic and bring in the numbers through promotions, early-store openings, heavy discounts, as well as free shipping on online purchases. People queuing up outside stores from the wee hours to take advantage of attractive deals and offers including early bird discounts is not an uncommon sight during this period.Retailers are gearing up for the holiday season with companies like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) announcing the hiring of additional team members for the peak holiday season. Target has introduced Weekend Deals this year featuring marquee prices on new items every weekend based on what customers are looking for at different times throughout the season. The company also said it would be offering some of its lowest prices of the year during big events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Companies like Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Amazon have also announced their Black Friday deals.Low household debt burdens, growing consumer confidence, lower personal savings and higher income generation bode well for the upcoming holiday season. In fact, spending in U.S. households ramped up in October with retail sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurants) growing 0.1% over September and 4.3% from the year-ago period (NRF data).Stock PicksWith the holiday season round the corner, here is a look at four retail stocks that boast of a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B.

1145,KSS,"If you haven’t completed your holiday shopping yet, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) surely has some good news for you. This supermarket giant, which is leaving no stone unturned to evolve with the changing consumer trends and combat competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), came up with plans to ease eleventh-hour shopping.Wal-Mart’s Plans for This Holiday SeasonWell, there were rounds last week that this holiday season, Wal-Mart plans to significantly increase its Walmart.com offerings available for same-day pickup in stores. Notably, this big-box retailer has grown its offerings on Walmart.com by roughly three times over a year. As the company expects demand for same-day deliveries to double in the last two weeks of the holiday season, it plans to strengthen its online assortment more than it had ever done before.Further, per a CNBC report, customers can shop on Walmart.com for items noted ""Free Pickup Today"" until 4 p.m. on Dec 23, and can pick up those products from the company’s stores until 6 pm on Christmas Eve. Also, the big-box retailer came up with another enticing plan, of filling some online order cases with unloaded gift cards. These cards will allow customers to make another gift purchase by adding funds to it.We believe that this last-minute online shopping and pick up in store option is likely to be a bliss for customers. In fact, this step also strengthens Wal-Mart’s competitive position against e-commerce king Amazon. Clearly, these moves reflect Wal-Mart’s aggressive efforts to resonate with the changing trends and make the most of the holiday season.Well, this is not Wal-Mart’s first attempt to make most of the opportunity. This is evident from the company’s recent strategy of keeping its online prices almost on par to that of Amazon this Cyber Monday. Sources revealed that Walmart’s prices were just 0.3% higher than Amazon’s, reflecting the company’s efforts to gain a good share this holiday season.What Other Retailers Are Doing?Notably, the U.S. holiday season is the most important time for retailers who garner a significant chunk of revenues during this period. Consequently, retailers go all out during the season, with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies and free shipping on online purchases. This is visible from the holiday season strategies undertaken by many industry players, other than Wal-Mart.Evidently, Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) announced weekend deals and discounts on select categories (which don’t usually appear for sale in the company’s stores and online) in the beginning of this holiday season. The departmental biggie further stated that it will have weekend offers throughout the season. We also commend Target’s efforts to enhance online shopping during the busy selling period, with its free holiday shipping, Ship from Store, myCheckout, Order Pickup and Target Restock programs, among others.Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) is also taking initiatives to boost up sales this holiday season as evident from its “20 Days of Doorbusters” event. With lucrative offers, free shipping, price match guarantee and enticing gift ideas, this consumer electronics retailer is set to make most of this holiday season. Apart from this, Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and GameStop (GME  -  Free Report) are also luring shoppers with impressive deals and the online shopping and pickup at store facility.Incidentally, the National Retail Federation projects November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to rise 3.6-4% year over year to $678.75-$682 billion, which also fares better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.All said, we believe that in an Amazon-dominated world, these retailers’ superb game plans should help them win over customers this holiday season. While Target, Best Buy, Kohl’s and GameStop carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, Wal-Mart boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) thanks to its fantastic past performance and successful endeavors to resort to the dot.com bandwagon. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1146,KSS,"Retail sector is hogging all the attention, and this time for good reasons. For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers. Stocks once bogged down by tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts.The first and foremost reason for the same is the latest tax reform that is likely to come into shape, following the approval of the Senate. The tax code once implemented is likely to lower the burden of retailers, who now topped the list with a corporate tax rate of as much as 35%. President Trump has been recommending a tax rate of as much as 20% and pushing hard to pass on the benefits to companies who generate all or most part of revenues in the United States.The news was enough to drive the retail stocks. As a result, shares of Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) gained 6.7%, 6.6%, 5.1%, 4.4% and 3.7%, respectively, yesterday.Certainly, the “Trump Factor” is ruling the U.S. stock market but it is also the attractive holiday season deals that are exciting consumers. The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday to Cyber Monday, marked an auspicious start to the holiday-shopping season. Retailers are cashing in on customers preferring to shop from the comfort of their homes, mostly online or through their mobile phones.A Stellar Start to the SeasonOnline sales on Thanksgiving Day surged 18.3% to $2.87 billion, per Adobe Analytics. Bargain hunters bought $5.03 billion worth of products online on Black Friday, an increase of 16.9% from last year. The euphoria did not end here, as the shopping frenzy was palpable on Cyber Monday when online sales soared 16.8% to $6.59 billion.A blockbuster Thanksgiving weekend and buoyant Cyber Monday indicate that the season is turning out to be a bonanza for retailers. Per National Retail Federation (“NRF”), approximately 174 million customers shopped in stores and online during this weekend. The trade group estimates that an American spent about an average of $335.47 during the five-day period.Further, shopping through mobile devices was the most prominent trend that developed during this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period, as nearly 63% of customers used their smart phones to make buying decisions, while 29% used it to actually buy goods.This indeed points to a blissful shopping season for retailers. With Christmas falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day compared with last year and an extended weekend to do last minute purchasing.Wrapping UpImproving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in retailers about a robust holiday season. From Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year. With digital transformation in shopping they are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores.Overall, NRF projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail sector but what about investing in the space right now? Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Amazon, Target, Macy’s, Best Buy, Kohl's and Gap carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1147,KSS,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) became the latest to join the bandwagon of retailers — Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Zumiez  — who witnessed strong holiday season sales. Comparable sales for this general merchandise retailer rose 3.4% in the combined November/December period buoyed by healthy store comps, robust traffic and sturdy digital sales. The solid holiday numbers allowed management to lift the view.Comparable sales across core merchandise categories — Home, Apparel, Food & Beverage, Hardlines and Essentials — were positive. Target now expects digital sales to increase more than 25% for the fourth straight year in fiscal 2017.Upbeat OutlookThis Minneapolis, MN-based company now projects fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $1.30-$1.40 compared with the prior range of $1.05-$1.25. For the fiscal year, management now forecasts adjusted earnings between $4.64 and $4.74 per share, up from the previous guidance of $4.40-$4.60.Further, Target now envisions comparable sales to increase approximately 3.4% during the fourth quarter with full year expected to be just over 1%.

We noted that the stock has surged 37.2% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s growth of 29.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Endeavors UndertakenNo wonder Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem, which is more inclined toward digitalization. The company’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well.It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction.To tap digital sales this holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.Wrapping UpRetail bellwethers left no stone unturned to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers went the extra mile. No wonder improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer confidence also played vital roles in lifting retailers’ spirit.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1148,KSS,"With the Thanksgiving holiday weekend over, Black Friday shoppers might have finally been able to get back to their regular duties if it weren’t for Cyber Monday. But today, the online shopping extravaganza is bigger and more profitable than ever.Retailers from Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) to Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) count on Black Friday sales to help both fuel and kick off their holiday season sales. Yet, in the changing retail environment, the rise of “Cyber Monday” might merit more attention (also read: A Complete History of 'Black Friday').A Brief History The National Retail Federation, which is one of the world's largest retail trade associations and tracks retail consumer spending, began to notice a massive uptick in online consumer spending the Monday following Thanksgiving. Back then, many consumers did not have the best high-speed internet access at home, and therefore often waited until they got to work on Monday to start searching for holiday gifts and deals online.The NRF officially coined the phrase in November 2005, via a Shop.org press release entitled “‘Cyber Monday’ Quickly Becoming One of the Biggest Online Shopping Days of the Year.”In fact, according to a Fast Company article, the origin of the phrase can be attributed to Ellen Davis, who is now the SVP of Research and Strategic Initiatives at the NRF. “It’s surreal to think that I’m associated with a term that has taken off like this,” Davis told the publication in 2015.The release noted, “77 percent of online retailers said that their sales increased substantially on the Monday after Thanksgiving, a trend that is driving serious online discounts and promotions on Cyber Monday this year [2005].”Cyber Monday caught on relatively quickly, as The New York Times and Wall Street Journal referenced the catchphrase in association with the online shopping sales day as early as December 2005.Soon after, retail giants, online shopping powers, and media outlets co-opted the phrase that is now one of the biggest online shopping days of the year.2017 Iteration This year’s Cyber Monday is reportedly shaping up to be the biggest and most successful day of online deals in the decade-plus of its existence. Total online spending on Cyber Monday is set to topple $6.5 billion in 2017, according to Adobe Insights—which tracks online spending at America's 100 largest retail websites.#CyberMonday is well on track to become the biggest online shopping day ever. Growth is at 16.9% and revenue by 10AM EST is at .84 billion. Follow the latest online shopping data here: https://t.co/Hx1kTnvKLg pic.twitter.com/aGdveMNmXR— Adobe Insights (@AdobeInsights) November 27, 2017If that $6.5 billion figure is reached—which would mark a 16% year-over-year increase—Cyber Monday 2017 would become the biggest digital shopping day in U.S. history.Preliminary Thanksgiving and Black Friday SalesOnline Black Friday sales reportedly jumped almost 17% this year to hit $5 billion. Paired with online sales from Thanksgiving Day, which now features a plethora of deals as well, the first two major days of the U.S. holiday shopping season brought in $7.9 billion in digital sales alone.This should help retailers reach the total of roughly $678.75 billion to $682 billion that the NRF projects consumers will spend both in stores and online this year, which would mark a roughly 4% increase from 2016’s November through December holiday shopping season (also read: A Guide to 2017's Black Friday and Holiday Shopping Trends).Stocks Shares of Macy’s, Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) all rose on Monday. Shares of fellow retailer players Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report) and JC Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) surged 4.70% and 3.40%, respectively.Retail sector ETFs also experienced gains. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) and the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) both experienced gains. Online selling powerhouse Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) saw its stock price climb nearly 1%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1150,KSS,"The Retail-Wholesale sector is hogging all the attention, and this time for good reasons. For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been bearing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers. Stocks once bogged down by tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts.The first and foremost reason for the same is that retailers are efficiently allocating a large chunk of capital toward multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, and developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers. Further, the retailers are renovating stores, developing fulfillment centers and implementing an enterprise-wide inventory management system.Another reason for the same is the latest tax reform that has resulted in lowering the corporate tax rate to as much as 21%, and retailers will be the beneficiary of the same. Analysts believe that a lower tax burden is likely to allow them to channelize the surplus money to best possible options. They may go for a dividend hike, or reduce debt load, or create a corpus to fund acquisitions, or invest in enhancing omni-channel capabilities, new product launches and any other innovations.The last factor that has also played a major role in grabbing investors’ attention to the sector is the blissful holiday season. Per MasterCard SpendingPulse report, retail sales during the holiday period jumped 4.9%, marking the biggest year-over-year uptick in holiday spending since 2011. Retailers such as Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) registered sales growth of 3.6% and 6.9%, respectively, during the November-December period, while both J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) recorded comparable store sales growth of 3.4%.How Is the Sector Placed?The sector, which currently occupies the top 19% (3 out of 16) position in the list of 16 Zacks categorized sectors, has advanced 33% in a year and comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s gain of 21.5%. We believe that given the favorable economic indicators the sector holds promise for 2018.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, fall in the unemployment rate to 17-year low, and improving housing and manufacturing sectors signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers. Steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration boost consumer confidence. Although consumer confidence dipped to 122.1 in December from November’s revised reading of 128.6, analysts believe that consumers remain optimistic about the economy.Consequently, adding a few stocks from the space would be a prudent decision at the current juncture. Here we have highlighted four Retail-Wholesale stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have been given a Strong Buy/Buy rating by 70% or more brokers.4 Prominent PicksWe suggest investing in Conn's, Inc.

1151,KSS,"Markets finished mostly higher on Monday even as safe haven stocks such as utilities and real estate gained traction. Further, the optimism from a strong market rally that began with 2018 continued to push the benchmarks higher. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted record closes. However, the Dow declined due to a fall in bank shares and snapped its winning run.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased almost 0.1% to close at 25,283. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to close at 2,747.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,157.39, gaining 0.3%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased almost 2% to close at 9.40. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.46 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.S&P 500 and Nasdaq Post Record ClosesThe S&P 500 gained almost 5 points to finish at a record. The broader index also hit an intraday record of 2,748.51. Majority of the gains came from industrial and energy stocks.

The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) and Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) gained 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively.Meanwhile, Nasdaq gathered 20.8 points to also finish at record level. Gains for the tech-laden index were buoyed by a surge in the shares of some major tech stocks. Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) gained 0.8%, 1.4%, 0.4% and 1%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Nasdaq also hit an intraday record of 7,161.35 but a decline in biotech shares pared some gains for the index. The NASDAQ Biotechnology (^NBI) declined 1.4% on Monday, nearly its biggest decline since the mid of December. Such losses were led by a decline in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) and Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), shares of which tanked 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.Dow Declines to End an Impressive RunDow defied the trend of the day to lose almost 13 points and ended in the red. This marked an end to its four-day winning streak of gains. However, the blue-chip index hit an intraday record of 25,311.99 earlier in the session but suffered broad based losses to finish in the negative territory.Further, shares of major banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) declined 1.5% and about 0.4%, respectively and weighed on the Dow. Bank shares declined after analysts estimated that there would be one-time charges to the fourth quarter earnings that the banks would suffer due to the implementation of tax reforms.Fed Presidents Speak on Rate HikesAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic commented on Monday that the Fed should continue raising the interest rates albeit at a slower pace compared to the last year.Further, the San Francisco Fed President John Williams commented that the central bank should consider holding the rates lower for a longer period as that would allow the inflation to grow over the coming years.Stocks That Made HeadlinesKohl's Rallies on Solid Holiday Sales: More Upside in Store?In a landscape where many retailers are still struggling with consumers’ changing shopping patterns and soft traffic, Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) surprised investors with impressive holiday sales data.  (Read More)Lululemon Lifts Q4 Outlook on Successful Holiday FeatLululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) was among the retailers that emerged strong this holiday season, which has lifted the overall outlook for the retail sector.

1153,KSS,"Struggles seem to be over for department stores (at least for some time) given Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report)’s better-than-expected same-store sales performances. Consumers’ tendency to shift to online shopping or ‘Amazonization’ has long been a cause for concern for brick-and-mortar retailing. But efficient cost and inventory management brought this overlooked space into the limelight lately.investors should note that J.C. Penney Co. came up with its third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 10. Its adjusted loss per share of 33 cents was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 43 cents. Revenues of $2.81 billion also came ahead of the estimate of $2.76 billion. Comparable sales rose 1.7% in the quarter, compared with a decline of 0.8% recorded in the prior-year quarter.Management noted that during the third quarter, steadfast actions were taken to “clear slow-moving inventory, primarily allowing for an improved apparel assortment heading into the holiday season.” Management believes these measures will better position the company in the all-important holiday season.Such optimistic comments led shares of J.C. Penney to add more than 15% on Nov 10, which in turn acted as a cornerstone for the whole space. Macy's Inc. (M  -  Free Report) added 2.5% and Kohl's gained about 4.5% on Nov 10.How About Online Retailing? On the other hand, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) lost about 0.3% on that day. Clear indications of a turnaround in department stores may mar the lure of online retailing in the near term. This is especially true given that online retail stocks have attained several heights in the recent past, calling for certain overvaluation and making this a too-late-to-enter space.As per Moody’s, Amazon.com Inc. is doing great in terms of sales growth but not profitability. Amazon's Prime Membership is apparently exaggerated by some analysts (read: 6 Reasons to Dump Amazon & Related ETF Strategies).If we look beyond J.C. Penney, Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) is also proving its mettle. According to Jim Cramer, Wal-Mart has proved the ""theoretically impossible"" point with a host of growth initiatives and posed itself as one of the close competitors of Amazon (read: E-Commerce Face-Off: Wal-Mart Vs. Amazon ETFs).Investors should note that traditional retailers are capitalizing on Amazon’s popularity lately. For example, Kohl’s has formed a partnership with Amazon under which the former will start selling Amazon devices, like Echo and Fire tablets, at 10 stores in Los Angeles and Chicago from October. Prior to this, in July, Sears  entered into a deal to sell its Kenmore home appliances on Amazon.Moreover, Amazon belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank is in the bottom 32%, at the time of writing while JCP is in the top 45%.Recent Performances Thanks probably to the above reasons, Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report) lost about 1.2% in the last 10 days (as of Nov 10, 2017) while VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) added about 2.1% and 0.1%, respectively.  If no severe downfall in the department stores data and outlook hits the market, we expect the recent winning trend of department stores to continue.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

1154,KSS,"While many retailers are grappling with receding store sales, amid increasing preference for online shopping, Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has been gaining from improved store traffic since the first half of 2017. The upside is mainly driven by the company’s dedicated omnichannel efforts combined with efficient brand management. Additionally, the company is on track with innovation and inventory management efforts. Given such positive notes, let’s see how Kohl’s is placed for 2018.Strategies Aiding Comps & E-Commerce GrowthKohl’s comps have improved lately, driven by partnership with online giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). Incidentally, the company has started accepting returns from Amazon’s customers on select products. This move followed Kohl's decision to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices across 10 of its selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. Kohl’s will also provide free packing and shipping services for the merchandise sent to Amazon’s fulfillment centers. Per the company, this store-within-store concept will boost traffic, thereby benefiting from Amazon’s diverse electronics options.Growth in comps also indicates that the company’s strategic initiative — Greatness Agenda — has started yielding positive results. The initiative, which commenced in first quarter of 2014, was designed to drive transactions per store and sales.Additionally, the company’s store sales are gaining from enhanced focus on prominent brands such as Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Addidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report). Kohl’s is regularly introducing new brands to keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to stores and website. Popular launches include Fit Bed under active and wellness business and the Jumping Beans collection featuring Disney character, amongst many others.Further, Kohl’s has been expanding e-commerce fulfillment centers, and opened its fifth facility in August, 2017. We expect that the company’s sustained focus on technology improvements and omnichannel expansion will have significant positive impacts on online sales and boost overall performance in 2018.Moreover, investors are impressed with Kohl’s regular endeavors to drive the top-line performance. As a result, shares of the company have gained 8.6% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 17.3%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineWe note that Kohl’s has been struggling against increased shipping expenses stemming from the growth in online business and higher reserves. Further, cautious consumer spending has been marring the company’s accessories and women’s businesses.Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is expected to overcome such hurdles and witness sturdy growth in the forthcoming periods, backed by top-line boosting initiatives, especially in the omnichannel realm.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

Despite reporting year-over-year increase in holiday sales, its shares declined 6% in after-hour trading session yesterday, primarily due to lower-than-expected comps.

Notably, this marks a significant improvement from a 2.1% and 2.7% respective drop in comps and total sales witnessed in the 2016 holiday season.Moreover, Kohl’s performed better than retailers like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and J.C. Penney, as the former reported a 1.1% rise in comps (owned plus licensed basis) and the latter recorded a 3.4% comps growth for the 2017 holiday period. Moreover, we note that Kohl’s performance remained steadily sturdy throughout both November and December, backed by positive comps across all businesses and regions. This, in turn was fueled by Kohl’s robust strategies, which helped it attract strong traffic and record solid digital sales during the season.Among its various efforts, alliance with online giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) seems to be yielding considerable results for Kohl’s. Incidentally, the company has started accepting returns from Amazon’s customers on select products. This move followed Kohl's decision to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices across 10 of its selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. Additionally, the company is gaining from enhanced focus on prominent brands such as Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas. Kohl’s has been regularly introducing new brands to keep inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to stores and website.Further Upside in Store?We believe that sustained focus on technology improvements and omni-channel expansion is likely to fuel further growth at Kohl’s. In fact, the department store retailer’s better-than-expected holiday performance and optimistic anticipations for January stimulated management to raise its fiscal 2017 earnings outlook from $3.72-$3.92 to $4.10 to $4.20 per share.Excluding certain tax-related settlements, earnings per share are envisioned in a band of $3.98 to $4.08, in comparison with $3.60 to $3.80 forecasted earlier. Also, the company continues to expect gross margin for fiscal 2017 to be greater than the year-ago period, whereas SG&A expenses (including 53rd week) are estimated to escalate at the higher end of the company’s previously forecasted range of 0.5-2.0%.Nonetheless, management stated that the updated guidance doesn’t include any impact from the latest tax reforms, which is likely to have a favorable effect on the company’s effective tax rate. Also, amendments in the federal tax legislation are expected to generate a non-cash tax benefit associated with 2017 deferred tax balances.We expect all aforementioned factors to keep Kohl’s firmly positioned on growth trajectory and help it sustain its spectacular momentum.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off.

Currently, Kohl'sis a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in  Retail - Regional Department Stores  industry that ranks in the Bottom 12% of our Zacks Industry Rank.

The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 70 cents per share to 72 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Kohl'sright now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1161,KSS,"Fossil Group Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein the top and bottom line plummeted year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s performance was negatively impacted by sluggish traditional watch business and persistent weakness in the leather and jewelry categories. Further, management slashed guidance for 2017 in response to the weak results, consequently impacting investor sentiment.Evidently, shares of Fossil Group declined 10.4% during after-hours trading on Nov 7. We note that Fossil Group has been delivering sluggish results for quite some time, which is reflected in its share price history. The company’s shares have plunged 74.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 28.5%.Q3 Earnings Adjusted earnings were 4 cents per share in the quarter which compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. However, the bottom line declined significantly from 48 cents reported in the year-ago period. The slump can be attributed to lower sales and margins.On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of 11 cents. We note that during the quarter, Fossil Group gained 2 cents from favorable foreign currency movements.Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fossil Group, Inc. QuoteQuarter in Detail Net sales of $688.7 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $653.2 million. Though connected watches boosted sales, overall net sales declined 6.7% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to sluggishness in the company's traditional watch portfolio. On a constant-currency basis, sales declined 8% during the quarter. Underlying weakness in the company’s leather and jewelry businesses also marred the top-line performance during the quarter. Global retail comps, including e-commerce, dropped 6% year over year, with softness across all categories and geographies.Gross profit tumbled 16.9% to $319.9 million. Gross margin contracted 580 basis points (bps) to 46.4% due to lower margins from connected products and increased product valuation charges. Lower retail margins stemming from greater promotional activity, unfavorable currency impacts and increased off-price sales also dragged the gross margin. These downsides were partly compensated by margin improvement owing to the New World Fossil initiative.For the third quarter, the company’s operating loss amounted to $0.5 million, as against the operating income of $31.2 million in the prior-year quarter. This can be attributed to lower sales and gross profit, despite lower operating expenses.Performance Based on Business Categories Category-wise, sales in the watches segment declined 2.7% (down 4% on constant-currency basis) to $551.9 million in the quarter. Fossil Group has been struggling with its watch category for quite some time now. Management noted that higher demand for tech-enabled watches has been denting traditional watch sales. Though the company has been expanding its smartwatches and wearable portfolio, these efforts are yet to revive results.Sales at Jewelry and leather businesses also went down 20.8% (down 23% on constant-currency basis) to $47.7 million and 18.9% (down 20% on constant-currency basis) to $75.7 million, respectively. Notably the sales of leather products have been unimpressive on account of unfavorable consumer response.Region-Wise Performance Region-wise, sales slumped 14.7% (down 15% on a constant currency basis) in Americas to $308.1 million owing to sales decline in the United States and sluggish performance of traditional watches. This was marginally offset by sales growth in connected watches. The region also witnessed weakness in the leather and jewelry businesses.Sales increased 1.6% in Europe (down 2% on a constant-currency basis) to $247.2 million. Sales in the region benefitted from fourth-quarter early deliveries. However, sales growth in the U.K was countered by decline in the Middle East.Net sales from Asia declined 0.1% (flat on a constant-currency basis) to $133.4 million. Sales growth was mainly witnessed in India and China, countered by dismal performance from all other regions.               Other UpdatesAt the end of the quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $166.9 million, long-term debt of $444.3 million and shareholders’ equity of $653 million.Since the prior-year quarter, the company has undertaken several store closures. At the end of the third quarter of 2017, the company’s total store count was 556 compared with 610 stores in the year-ago period.OutlookFor 2017, Fossil Group expects net sales to decline in the range of 8.5-10.5%, comparatively wider than the previously estimated decline of 4.5-8.5%. The company expects adjusted operating margin growth in the range of flat to up 1.3%. Further, it projects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of a loss of 45 cents to earnings of 10 cents. The revised guidance is considerably lower than the prior earnings estimation of 35 cents to $1.15.For fourth-quarter 2017, the company expects net sales to decrease in the range of 11-3.5%. Adjusted operating margin growth is anticipated in the range of 1.8-5.5%. Consequently, Fossil Group expects adjusted earnings in the range of 10-65 cents per share.Fossil Group continues to expect a challenging retail environment for its traditional watch category. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company anticipates considerable growth opportunities in the connected wearables business and plans to continue investing in the same. It also remains on track with New World Fossil initiative which has been aiding cost reduction and inducing efficiency in its operations.Stocks to Consider Investors may consider other stocks from the same sector such as Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report), Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report) and Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1162,KSS,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has been gaining from efforts to drive sales along with omnichannel initiatives, which boosted comps in the last reported quarter.  Further, the company’s inventory and expense management efforts have also been yielding positive results. Owing to such upsides, shares of the company have gained 36.1% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s rally of 14.2%.Comps Growth Initiatives Bode WellThe company’s comps witnessed year-over-year growth for the first time during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Comps growth was primarily driven by the company’s partnership with Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). Incidentally, Kohl’s has started accepting returns for Amazon’s customers on select products. This move followed Kohl's decision to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. Per the company, the store-within-store concept will boost stores traffic, owing to the availability of Amazon’s diverse electronics options. Kohl’s will also provide free packing and shipping services for the merchandise sent to Amazon’s fulfillment centers.Like Kohl’s, other major retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are striving to boost their omnichannel capabilities and maintain their competitive position amid consumers’ shift toward digital and convenient shopping options.  Further, growth in comps further signifies that the company’s strategic initiative — Greatness Agenda — has started yielding positive results. The initiative, which commenced in first quarter of 2014, was designed to drive transactions per store and sales.The company’s store sales are benefitting from enhanced focus on prominent brands such as Nike and Adidas. These efforts helped Kohl’s gain significant market share in active apparel and footwear up until the third quarter. The company expects this trend to continue, on the back of assortment improvements.  Other Factors Aiding PerformanceKohl’s regularly introduces brands to keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to its stores and website. Popular launches include Fit Bed under active and wellness business and the Jumping Beans collection featuring Disney characters, amongst others. Further, Kohl’s has been undertaking several initiatives to reduce inventory levels. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017 inventory per store declined 2%, while units per store fell 4%, in line with the expectations for a low to mid-single-digit decrease for the year. Management continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.Factors Limiting the Company’s Performance  However, increased shipping expenses stemming from the growth in online business and increased reserves, having been posing concerns for the company. Incidentally, the company’s gross margin declined 30 basis points year over year in the third quarter, thanks to higher shipping costs.Further, Kohl’s has been struggling with accessories and women’s business, due to a cautious consumer spending environment. Kohl’s competitive position has been low due to lack of exposure to markets outside the United States.Bottom-LineNevertheless, we commend Kohl’s efforts to improve comp, which is expected to positively impact sales in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock carries a VGM Score of A and has a long-term growth rate of 6.7%, indicating its inherent strength.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1163,KSS,"The Q3 earnings season has reached the tail end for all sectors save retail, which has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are up 2.3% from the same period last year on 10.1% revenue growth with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates.While earnings growth is well below the last reporting cycle and the four-quarter average, revenue growth has been accelerating compared with the other recent periods. Additionally, the quarter so far has witnessed an above-average proportion of positive surprises, implying that the momentum has been carried forward. Further, the estimates revision trend for the fourth quarter has been favorable, with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods (read: Amazon ETFs to Buy on Q3 Blowout Results).This is especially true given the impressive stock market performance of department store operators like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and others following their quarterly releases. Nordstrom and J.C. Penney posted better-than-expected results. Meanwhile, Kohl's beat on revenues but missed on earnings, while Macy's beat on earnings and missed on revenues.The strength in these stocks led to smooth trading in the broad retail sector. In fact, retail ETFs — SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) — added 0.7%, 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past five trading days.Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of big-box retailers that are likely to report this week. These also have the potential to push related ETFs upward or downward (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).A Peek into Earnings SurprisesReports from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) will be crucial for the sector this week.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Home Depot is slated to report earnings before the bell on Nov 14. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates. The company saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.77%. The stock has a VGM Style Score of A.Target has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -1.60%, indicating less chances of beating estimates. The stock has seen solid earnings estimate revision of seven cents for the to-be-reported quarter over the past three months and delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.11% in the last four quarters. It has a top VGM Style Score of A. The company is expected to report before the opening bell on Nov 15 (read: Profit from Retailers' Defaults With These ETFs).Wal-Mart is scheduled to report on Nov 16 before market open. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.96%, indicating a reasonable chance of beat. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.99% in the last four quarters but witnessed negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter. It has a VGM Style Score of B.Foot Locker, which will likely report earnings on Nov 17 before the opening bell, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.48%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates. The stock has seen negative earnings estimate revision of 41 cents over the past 90 days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter and delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 6.55% in the last four quarters. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Style Score of B.  ConclusionWith notable earnings surprises in the cards and a favorable stock rank for big-box retailers, the ETF space will continue to see good trading in the days ahead even though the sector has an ugly Zacks Rank in the bottom 0%. Further, the ETFs mentioned above have favorable ranks. Notably, RTH and ZRT have a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 while PMR has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1164,KSS,"Market futures are down this morning following 8 and a half weeks of higher markets and new record closing highs in each of the 3 major indices. Profit-taking is a likely culprit, especially now that most of Q3 earnings season is behind us, with the Retail sector largely remaining to report. Retail is again expected to lag growth and positive earnings surprises we’ve seen in Tech, Energy and elsewhere this reporting term.Some concerns from market participants regarding the viability of recent tax reform proposals and their likelihood of passage through Congress may also be weighing on trading sentiment this morning. Aside from a CBO analysis report released yesterday that the House tax reform bill, in its current form, would cost $1.7 trillion over the next year, or $200 billion more than what would be needed for Republicans to pass the bill without Democratic party assistance, according to current procedural rules in Congress.Later today, we expect the release of the Senate’s version of the tax bill, which is already rumored to veer from the House version in that it would not fully repeal the estate tax (aka ‘death tax’). Unknown at this time is if any further changes have been made to state and local tax write-offs (SALT) or carried interest provisions. Hopefully today’s reveal will shed helpful light on these matters. But until it does, there is a sense that tax reform may go the way of other failed reform measures in Congress so far in 2017, specifically on immigration and healthcare.Jobless Claims Remain HealthyDespite continually working through distortions in the labor market related to Hurricanes Henry and Irma earlier this season, Initial Jobless Claims rose 10K last week to a still-healthy 239K from the previous week. Continuing claims, which had been dropping lower toward 1.8 million lately, went back up to 1.9 million last week, which is the exact 4-week moving average. The 4-week moving average of initial claims is a tad above 231K as of a week ago.We’ll see hurricane distortions continue to wear off on both weekly jobless claims and monthly non-farm payroll numbers, and even still these figures currently illustrate an historically robust U.S. labor market — the strongest since the 1970s, when the workforce was much smaller. Keep in mind that baby boomers are beginning to retire at a faster rate, meaning new jobs will need to increase pace to keep up with this generational reality. So far, so good on this tack.Q3 Reports for Retail BeginDepartment store giant Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) posted mixed results for its Q3 report, topping estimates on earnings — 23 cents per share versus 19 cents expected, and also better than the 17 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter — on revenues of $5.28 billion that fell short of the $5.31 billion the Zacks consensus was looking for, and down 6% year over year.Full-year 2017 earnings guidance at Macy’s was reiterated, and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock before this latest earnings report is trading up 2% in today’s pre-market. Shares had fallen 50% year-to-date previously.However, Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) disappointed investors with a 2-cent miss in profits for its most recent quarter on sales that actually surpassed the Zacks consensus estimate: $4.33 billion ahead of the $4.30 billion we had expected. The company narrowed its full-year guidance range without raising the upside of $3.80 per share.But Kohl’s shares are selling off in today’s overall bearish pre-market, down 8% already as the company has missed earnings estimates fore the first time in the last 4 quarters.

1165,KSS,"It is almost time to bid adieu to the third-quarter earnings season. As we near the end, we have results on the board from a large chunk of S&P 500 members with only about 15% (or 94) of Index members left to their quarterly numbers. While most sectors are nearly through with the quarter’s reporting cycle, the Retail-Wholesale still has a considerable chunk of reports to come. Incidentally, our focus in the article will also be upon Retail stocks that are slated to report earnings on Nov 9.Q3 Earnings ScorecardPer the Earnings Preview dated Nov 3, about 406 of the S&P 500 members have reported results so far, representing 85.4% of the Index’s total market capitalization. Of the 406 S&P 500 members that reported their quarterly numbers, approximately 73.9% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 66.7% beat top-line expectations. Total earnings for these companies were up 7.5%, on 6.3% revenue growth.Key takeaways from the results so far point to clear revenue momentum as top-line growth has been accelerating compared with other recent periods. Further, the quarter has seen an above-average proportion of positive surprises, reflecting the carry forward of momentum from the preceding quarter. Thirdly, we have seen a favorable trend of estimate revisions for the December quarter, which is different from the pattern witnessed in the last few periods where estimates for the following quarter generally start to decline as the current quarter progresses.Coming to expectations, S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings growth of 6.5% year over year, with a 5.6% jump in revenues. Thus, the overall picture looks favorable for this reporting cycle.A Look at Retail SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors. While results for the Finance sector have been below average, this earnings season is turning out to be a good one for the Industrial Products, Technology, Construction and Medical sectors.As stated earlier, we are yet to see a sizable chunk of earnings to be released from retailers. Per the latest report, earnings for the Retail-Wholesale sector on the whole are expected to improve 0.1%, with revenue growth of 6.2%. The Retail-Wholesale Staples sector is currently ranked among the bottom of the 16 Zacks sectors. A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to bear the brunt of the current challenging retail environment. This can be accountable to sluggish mall traffic, volatile consumer spending and increased competition from online players. Further, these retailers are heavily investing in e-commerce and omni-channel functionalities, which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term.However, we note that the Retail-Wholesale sector has grown 22.9% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 market’s jump of 16.1%.What Awaits JWN, M, KSS in Q3?Well our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.So, let’s see what awaits the following Retail stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Nov 9.We are not confident of an earnings beat for the Seattle, WA-based Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) in the third quarter fiscal 2017. This is because the company currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.00% with both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at 63 cents per share, alongside a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nordstrom’s shares have lost 18.3% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 2.2%. The downturn was owing to the temporary call off of the Nordstrom family's plans to take the company private.However, we laud Nordstrom’s positive earnings surprise trend and remain optimistic on the company’s cost saving initiatives, store expansion efforts and progress on 2020 strategy. Though the company’s growth strategy bodes well, investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are likely to weigh upon its near-term cost and margins performance. Evidently, its merchandise performance was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the previous quarter. Moreover, for fiscal 2017, management anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off-price growth.Further, the company’s projections for SG&A expenses incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses related to its growth initiatives, offset by progress in productivity improvements. Given the margin pressures, it is unlikely to predict the outcome of the upcoming quarter results. (Read more: Will Higher Expenses Mar Nordstrom's Q3 Earnings?)Moving to Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), we are not very optimistic about this department store chain retailer that has delivered an average trailing four-quarter negative surprise of 19.9%. Macy's has an Earnings ESP of -32.09% as the Most Accurate Estimate of 13 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Moreover, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Additionally, Macy’s shares have declined 23.9% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s 15.9% downside.Macy’s has announced a slew of measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy as well as investment in omni-channel capabilities to enhance sales, profitability and cash flows. Additionally, the company is developing e-commerce business and has recently announced the restructuring of merchandising operations. These seem inevitable given the challenging retail landscape, aggressive pricing strategy, waning mall traffic and increased online competition that have been weighing on Macy’s performance. The company’s dwindling top and bottom-line results is the reflection of the same. Further, the company expects comps on an owned plus licensed basis to decline approximately 2.5% in the third quarter. Given this background, we remain skeptical of Macy’s performance in the third quarter. (Read more: Will Macy's Succeed in Reporting Higher Q3 Earnings?)Finally, let’s assess the earnings beat criteria for Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), a U.S. based department store chain that operates specialty department stores and an e-commerce site (www.Kohls.com) in the United States. While the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, our earnings beat criteria was let down by its Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2017 are currently pegged at 71 cents per share.We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 18%. However, Kohl’s has been struggling with weak comps and a difficult retail sales scenario for the last few quarters. This indicates that the company’s “Greatness Agenda”, which was designed to increase transactions per store, has been failing to deliver adequate results. The consensus mark for the third quarter projects flat comps compared with the prior-year quarter.Nevertheless, Kohl's has been undertaking initiatives to boost store performance. Since October, the company has started offering more outside famous brands, while cutting down sales of in-house clothing brands. Kohl's stores have begun accepting returns from Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) customers on select products in 82 of its U.S. store locations. Additionally, we expect Kohl's third-quarter performance to benefit from surging e-commerce business.Notably, these endeavors have helped Kohl’s shares gain 2.2% in the past six months, as against the industry’s decline of 21.7%. Let’s see if such efforts will enable Kohl’s to overcome these hurdles in the third quarter.

1167,KSS,"Thursday, November 9, 2017Market futures are down this morning following 8 and a half weeks of higher markets and new record closing highs in each of the 3 major indices. Profit-taking is a likely culprit, especially now that most of Q3 earnings season is behind us, with the Retail sector largely remaining to report. Retail is again expected to lag growth and positive earnings surprises we’ve seen in Tech, Energy and elsewhere this reporting term.Some concerns from market participants regarding the viability of recent tax reform proposals and their likelihood of passage through Congress may also be weighing on trading sentiment this morning. Aside from a CBO analysis report released yesterday that the House tax reform bill, in its current form, would cost $1.7 trillion over the next year, or $200 billion more than what would be needed for Republicans to pass the bill without Democratic party assistance, according to current procedural rules in Congress.Later today, we expect the release of the Senate’s version of the tax bill, which is already rumored to veer from the House version in that it would not fully repeal the estate tax (aka ‘death tax’). Unknown at this time is if any further changes have been made to state and local tax write-offs (SALT) or carried interest provisions. Hopefully today’s reveal will shed helpful light on these matters. But until it does, there is a sense that tax reform may go the way of other failed reform measures in Congress so far in 2017, specifically on immigration and healthcare.Jobless Claims Remain HealthyDespite continually working through distortions in the labor market related to Hurricanes Henry and Irma earlier this season, Initial Jobless Claims rose 10K last week to a still-healthy 239K from the previous week. Continuing claims, which had been dropping lower toward 1.8 million lately, went back up to 1.9 million last week, which is the exact 4-week moving average. The 4-week moving average of initial claims is a tad above 231K as of a week ago.We’ll see hurricane distortions continue to wear off on both weekly jobless claims and monthly non-farm payroll numbers, and even still these figures currently illustrate an historically robust U.S. labor market — the strongest since the 1970s, when the workforce was much smaller. Keep in mind that baby boomers are beginning to retire at a faster rate, meaning new jobs will need to increase pace to keep up with this generational reality. So far, so good on this tack.Q3 Reports for Retail BeginDepartment store giant Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) posted mixed results for its Q3 report, topping estimates on earnings — 23 cents per share versus 19 cents expected, and also better than the 17 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter — on revenues of $5.28 billion that fell short of the $5.31 billion the Zacks consensus was looking for, and down 6% year over year. Full-year 2017 earnings guidance at Macy’s was reiterated, and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock before this latest earnings report is trading up 2% in today’s pre-market. Shares had fallen 50% year-to-date previously. For more info on M earnings, click here.However, Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) disappointed investors with a 2-cent miss in profits for its most recent quarter on sales that actually surpassed the Zacks consensus estimate: $4.33 billion ahead of the $4.30 billion we had expected. The company narrowed its full-year guidance range without raising the upside of $3.80 per share. But Kohl’s shares are selling off in today’s overall bearish pre-market, down 8% already as the company has missed earnings estimates fore the first time in the last 4 quarters.

1168,KSS,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein adjusted earnings per share of 70 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. Earnings slumped 12.5% from the prior-year quarter, due to lower gross margin stemming from higher cost of sales and a moderate rise in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses.The disappointing bottom-line performance came after five successive quarters of positive earnings surprises. Consequently, shares of the company declined approximately 8% during the pre-market trading hours on Nov 9. We note that, Kohl’s shares have returned 3.3% in the last three months as against the industry’s decline of 10.9%.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteSales and MarginsNet sales were $4,332 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,296 million and improved 0.1% from the prior-year quarter. The top line mainly gained from increased comps and improved performance during the back-to-school season. The positives were offset by soft sales trends owing to unfavorable weather conditions during the middle of the third quarter.We note that the company’s store traffic continued to rise since the first half of 2017.  Encouragingly, the 0.1% rise in comps during the quarter under review compared favorably with the year-ago decline of 1.7%. This signifies that the company’s strategic initiative — Greatness Agenda — has started yielding results. The initiative, which commenced in first-quarter 2014, was designed to drive transactions per store and sales.Gross margin declined 30 basis points to 36.8% in the reported quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.4% to $1,095 million in the quarter. Other Financial DetailsAs of Oct 28, Kohl’s had $736 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2,796 million of long-term debt and $5,029 million of shareholders’ equity. Cash flow from operations amounted to $869 million.On Nov 8, Kohl's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 55 cents per share, which will be paid on Dec 20, to shareholders of record as of Dec 6.Kohl’s ended the quarter with 1,156 stores, 12 FILA Outlet stores and four Off/Aisle clearance centers in 49 states.Updated Guidance Kohl’s expects adjusted earnings for fiscal 2017 in the range of $3.60-$3.80 per share, compared with the previous range of $3.50-$3.80. We note that despite the weak bottom-line results, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company raised the low end of the fiscal 2017 earnings view on a gradual improvement in comps.Stocks to Consider Investors may consider other stocks from the same sector such as Burlington Stores, Inc (BURL  -  Free Report), Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores Inc (ROST  -  Free Report).

1169,KSS,"Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) is set to report the third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 9.Despite continuous efforts to boost store traffic, the company has been struggling with bleak comparable store sales (comps). This trend is likely to continue in the third quarter, which may affect Kohl’s performance.Let’s look into some of the aspects that are anticipated to have an impact on the company’s third-quarter results.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable at 71 cents over the past 30 days, which depicts a decline of 11.3% from the year-ago earnings of 80 cents.We note that the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 18%. In fact, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven out of past eight quarters.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteFurther, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,301 million for the third quarter, down 0.6% from the prior-year period.Factors Impacting the Quarter Kohl’s has been witnessing dismal comps for some time, thanks to heightened competition and cautious consumer spending on apparel items and accessories. This can be attributed to a difficult sales environment stemming from evolving consumer patterns, which has significantly affected store traffic. Evidently, comps witnessed a year-over-year drop of 2.2% during fourth-quarter fiscal 2016, while it declined 2.7% and 0.4% during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. In fact, comps have declined consecutively in the last six quarters. This indicates that the company’s “Greatness Agenda”, which was designed to increase transactions per store, has been failing to deliver adequate results. The consensus mark for the third quarter projects flat comps with the prior-year quarter.Nevertheless, Kohl's has been undertaking initiatives to boost its store performance. Since October the company has started offering more outside famous brands, while cutting down sales of in-house clothing brands. Kohl's stores have begun accepting returns from Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) customers on select products in 82 of its U.S. store locations. Kohl's has also started selling Amazon’s devices, accessories and smart home products in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago.Additionally, we expect Kohl's third-quarter performance to benefit from surging e-commerce business. The company has been opening online fulfillment centers and upgrading e-commerce offerings to better serve customers.  Also, the company’s inventory-reducing initiatives are expected to continue delivering positive results.Notably, these endeavors have helped Kohl’s shares gain 7% in the past six months, as against the industry’s decline of 21%. Let’s see if such efforts will enable Kohl’s to overcome these hurdles in the third quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kohl's is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kohl's currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.Zumiez Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ross Stores Inc (ROST  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank #2.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1170,KSS,"Are you apprehensive that a bubble formed by an overvalued stock market can burst anytime? Or are you scared of rising rate concerns with both the Fed and ECB giving hawkish signals?Well, fear before Halloween is understandable. But unlike the real event, its effect on the market is not at all scary. In fact, instead of tricking investors, the Halloween Effect is usually a treat.Halloween Effect is a historically observed increase in stock prices from the month of November through the end of April. It is exactly opposite the popular adage ""sell in May and then walk away” which refers to the six months between May 1 and Oct 31.Among overall buoyancy, retail sales deserve a special mention this time around. Vacations, holiday season buying (both Christmas and spring season) and seasonal optimism may play a huge role in this surge.The National Retail Federation expects retail sales to grow between 3.6% and 4%, totaling $678.75 billion to $682 billion in the November-December period. Also, the International Council of Shopping Centers sees a 3.8% uptick in retail sales. Deloitte sees this figure going higher to 4% to 4.5% (without considering cars and gasoline). Forrester Research estimates that online sales will jump 12% this holiday season, to $129 billion (read: 3 ETFs to Tap Upbeat Electronics Sales Forecast).In fact, the likely rosy trend starts with Halloween itself as the event greets the fall season. And “conventional wisdom is that strong Halloween spending is an indicator of strong Christmas season spending” as per an analyst. So, let’s take a look at the Halloween sales projection.Spending to Touch All-Time High This HalloweenHalloween spending jumped three times in the last 12 Years. National Retail Federation estimated that Americans will likely spend a staggering $9.1 billion this Halloween, up about 8% year over year. Consumers are expected to expend $86.13 on average, up from last year’s $82.93. Sentiments are pretty upbeat with 12.9% thinking about economic conditions before spending, down from 14.1% in 2016.Costumes will account for the largest share of spending, in billions, though just 69% of consumers will likely go for them. On the other hand, 95% will likely shell out around $2.7 billion on candies. As much as 72% of consumers will spend about $2.7 billion on decorations and 37% will pay nearly $410 million for greeting cards.In fact, a new idea has emerged lately. People are celebrating with Halloween trees like they do in Christmas. Sales of Halloween trees at the -commerce home goods company Wayfair, leapt about 20% year over year. This upbeat numbers came despite Toys R Us’ bankruptcy and store closures by Sears and Macy’s (read: Profit from Retailers' Defaults With These ETFs).Needless to say, retail sales will be on a roll in the upcoming days and put the following ETFs and stocks in focus.ETF PicksGlobal X Social Media ETF (SOCL  -  Free Report)About 64.6% of population under the survey search for shopping ideas from social media, including Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube and Twitteralong with traditional ways.Two years ago, only 44% used to follow these online tools. Plus, 35% of consumers will purchase costume online.  So, online ETF SOCL is highly in focus now (read: Twitter Surges on Q3 Results: Log in to These ETFs).Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report)The afore-mentioned arguments make it necessary to look at the $107-million fund that has 39 stocks in its portfolio. After all, 22% shopping will likely be done online.First Trust Nasdaq Retail ETF (FTXD  -  Free Report)As much as 47.1% Halloween shopping will be done at discount stores. So, discount retailer stock-heavy funds are in the spotlight now. Kohls Corp (KSS  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) have considerable weight in the fund (read: Netflix at Record High: ETFs to Play).VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report)Several discount retailers like Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Ross (ROST  -  Free Report), Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and WMT have solid exposure to this fund.Stock PicksRoss Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report)Ross Stores runs a chain of off-price retail apparel and home accessories stores. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a VGM Score of B, at the time of writing. Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28%.Tucows Inc. The company provides personalized information agents and websites. TCX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with a VGM Score of C.

1171,KSS,"On this week’s episode of Shopping for Stocks, host and Zacks Editor Maddy Johnson dives into one of the scariest aspects of the retail industry: department stores.Yesterday, Citi Research downgraded Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and JCPenney (JCP  -  Free Report) to “Sell” from “Neutral,” alluding to a less-than-positive holiday season for retailers in the struggling department store space.Analyst Paul Lejuez said that Macy’s in particular “no longer makes much money as a retailer,” and “has [not] found the right tools” to evade a steady decline. JCPenney’s rating was cut on the heels of weak updated guidance, while the company blamed heavy discounting ahead of the holiday shopping period.As a result, a domino effect occurred, sending shares of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), and Dillard’s  downwards. Even retail sector ETFs like the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) and the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) were down.But this impact is nothing new, and it’s time these department stores break this vicious cycle.How can companies like Macy’s stand out from its peers? What can it do differently? And most importantly, how can it make shopping an event again?With Nordstrom and even Sears implementing innovative strategies, stores like Macy’s and JCPenney must try something to stay in the game.As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

1172,KSS,"The stock market runs on sentiment and any unforeseen event in a particular sector has a ripple effect on others with a clear reflection on major indices that bear the brunt. The case is more or less the same for specific sectors that often observe good or bad performance by one player influencing the performance of others.While major indices — Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended the Friday’s trading session on a positive note, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) fell 1.5%. We believe J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) disappointing forecast may have been one of the reasons behind the SPDR S&P Retail ETF’s decline.Dismal ForecastShares of J. C. Penney tanked 14.8% on Oct 27 after the company trimmed full-year guidance. In fact, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has tumbled 41.7% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 15.5%. The company stated that in an effort to clear “slow-moving” goods mostly in women’s apparel department it increased markdowns in September and October.Chairman and chief executive officer of the company, Marvin R. Ellison said, “With a sharper and more disciplined focus on inventory management, we are taking a comprehensive approach to assessing the effectiveness of our inventory positions to make swift, informed decisions that promote faster inventory turn and higher productivity levels.”Management also stated that following the liquidation of slow moving inventory, the company’s fund has increased. This will help to invest in fresh as well as trending merchandise categories.For third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company expects comparable sales to grow between 0.6% and 0.8 %. However, cost of goods (excluding depreciation and amortization) to rise 300-320 basis points (bps) year over year.In the third quarter, the company expects adjusted loss to be in the range of 45-40 cents per share. In third-quarter fiscal 2016, the company has reported loss per share of 21 cents.For fiscal 2017, the comps is projected to be in the range of down 1% to flat, compared with the earlier estimate of down 1% to up 1%. Cost of goods sold is now forecasted to increase by 100-120 bps year over year, while free cash flow is anticipated to be in the range of $200-$300 million. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of 2- 8 cents, sharply below the earlier estimate of 40-65 cents.Domino EffectFollowing the news, investors pressed the panic button that took a toll on other retail stocks.Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) stock declined 4.6% following the news. The company has reported positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 18%. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 71 cents, down nearly 11% year over year. Kohl's currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Dillard's, Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report), which operates as fashion apparel, cosmetics, and home furnishing retailer, declined 3.4%. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s consensus estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2017 is pegged at 23 cents per share, down nearly 66% year over year. Further, the company’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 2.6%, well below the industry’s growth rate of 5.6%.Shares of Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) decreased 7.7%. After witnessing negative earnings surprise in first-quarter fiscal 2017, the company posted earnings beat of 6.7% in the second quarter.

1173,KSS,"Shares of several major U.S. department store chains plummeted on Monday after a Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) analyst downgraded Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), and JC Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) lowered its third-quarter earnings guidance.Macy’sCitigroup downgraded Macy’s stock from “Neutral” to “Sell” on Monday morning, citing poor performance from the company’s retail business as the primary reason. Citi analyst Paul Lejuez noted that Macy's ""as seen significant pressure on sales/margins for several years, they no longer make much money as a retailer.""The analyst went on to say that Macy's ""core business is weak and (we believe) is getting weaker."" The analyst pointed to an overall decrease in foot traffic and a decline in brick-and-mortar overall as other reasons for the downgrade.On top of that, Citi cited JC Penney’s recent poor performance as yet another factor for downgrading Macy’s to sell.On the back of the Citi downgrade, shares of Macy’s slumped over 3% to touch a new 52-week low of $18.94 per share.JC Penney Guidance Retail industry investors are also spooked the day before Halloween because JC Penney provided new, weaker updated third-quarter and full-year 2017 guidance on Friday.The department store chain now expects comparable store sales will fall as much as 1% for the full year, with flat growth presented as the best-case-scenario in this vital retail category. JC Penney also projects the cost of goods sold will jump as much as 120 basis points. What’s more,JC Penney now expects to post an adjusted third-quarter EPS loss in the range of $0.40 to $0.65.JC Penney noted that its inventory liquidation “favorably impacted sales during the months of September and October.” However, the company has been forced to make other larger strategic changes to its business that has some investors nervous.“Although these actions will create a short-term negative impact to cost of goods sold and earnings, long term, we firmly believe it was the right decision for the Company as we transition into the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018,” CEO Marvin R. Ellison said in a statement.“In addition, based on the way our business is growing, including continued comp sales growth penetration in major appliances and omnichannel in the third quarter, we are taking a renewed approach to aligning our expense structure to match the mix of our growth initiatives.”Shares of JC Penney sunk over 8.3% on Monday to hover just above their 52-week low in response to the company’s poor full-year and quarterly projections.Other Department Stores As is often the case, big movement from Macy’s and JC Penney—based on negative industry trends—has helped push much of the rest of the retail industry down.Shares of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Dillard's (DDS  -  Free Report) dipped around 2%, while Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) saw its stock price fall marginally.Retail sector ETFs also fell on Monday.

1174,KSS,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its strong portfolio of brands, growth in e-commerce business and continued innovation. Strong inventory and expense management have also been positively impacting the company’s bottom line.In addition, we also believe that the extended tie-up between Kohl’s and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) have enhanced investor’s confidence in the stock. Shares of Kohl’s have surged 8.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 15.8%.Let’s delve into the factors that have been impacting Kohl’s performance lately.Surging e-commerce Kohl’s e-commerce sales have almost doubled since 2011 at a compound annual growth rate of almost 40% over the last five years. In the recently reported second quarter of 2017, digital conversion improved at a double-digit rate on the back of better customer experience on smartphone and smartphone app. In fact, technology improvements in both application and the device along with omni-channel efforts are expected to bear positive impact on customer experience.Similarly, retailers like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are also focused on boosting omni-channel retailing and e-commerce.Initiatives to Enhance Margins Kohl’s has undertaken several initiatives to reduce inventory, in order to boost profits. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company made additional progress on its initiatives. As a result, inventory per store decreased 2%, while units per store were 3% lower, which was consistent with expectations for a low to mid-single-digit decrease for the year. The company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.Strong Portfolio of Brands Kohl’s prides on having a diverse product portfolio which includes apparel, shoes, accessories, beauty and home products. The company has established a strong brand portfolio with national brands such as Dockers, Levi’s, Columbia Sportswear, Reebok, Champion, Oshkosh, Pfatzgraff and KitchenAid. The company has also been keen on innovation and regularly introduces new brands in order to keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to its stores and website. Popular launches include Fit Bed under its active and wellness business and Jumping Beans collection, amongst many more. Efforts to Improve Store Traffic Kohl’s has been struggling with lower comps for quite some time now. The company’s comps started declining from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and plummeted consecutively for the next six quarters. This signifies that the company’s strategic initiative, Greatness Agenda, is failing to deliver results. The initiative, which commenced in first-quarter 2014, was designed to increase transactions per store and sales.In an effort to drive store sales, Kohl’s has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands it sells. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other accessories in March was a great success and was well received among customers. The company’s focus on large private-label brands such as, SONOMA, Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9 has also been aiding store traffic expansion.Tie-Up with AmazonKohl’s recent initiatives to strengthen its tie-up with Amazon are also expected to enhance store traffic. The company recently announced its initiative to accept returns for Amazon customers on selected products in 82 of its U.S. store locations from October 2017. Additionally, the retailer will provide free service of packing and shipping the merchandises to Amazon’s fulfillment centers. Through such a partnership, Kohl’s is expected to expand its omni-channel capabilities and make use of Amazons’ wide consumer base.In recent times, Kohl’s had also announced to sell Amazon’s devices, accessories and smart home products in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. Kohl’s believes that this store-within-store concept will boost traffic. Like Kohl’s, retailers such as Best Buy Co. Inc (BBY  -  Free Report) have also teamed up with the online giant ahead of the holiday season.Bottom Line Kohl’s dedicated efforts to improve comps are quite noteworthy and is expected to positively impact sales in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock carries a VGM Score of A and has a long-term growth rate of 5.7%, indicating its inherent strength. Further estimates for the forthcoming third-quarter results and for fiscal 2017 have also remained stable at 71 cents and $3.72 respectively, over the past 30 days.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1175,KSS,"On Tuesday, the market woke up to the news of Wal-Mart Stores' (WMT  -  Free Report) stock repurchase program of a staggering $20 billion, to be carried out in the next two years. Wal-Mart regularly returns value through higher dividends and share buybacks.In fiscal 2017, the company returned a total of $14.5 billion to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. It bought back shares worth $8.3 billion. Wal-Mart has increased dividend for 44 consecutive years including the hike of 2% for fiscal 2018.Further, the company reaffirmed its fiscal 2018 earnings guidance and continues to expect the same in the range of $4.30–$4.40. The company enticed investors by providing a positive outlook for fiscal 2019, wherein it expects earnings to grow 5%, thereby translating to adjusted earnings in the range of $4.52–$4.62. Driven by the sustained growth in comps and e-commerce, the company envisions sales to rise approximately 3% during fiscal 2019.Consequently, shares of Wal-Mart rallied more than 4% on Oct 10, 2017, while finally closing at $84.13. Undoubtedly, this retail behemoth is leaving no stone unturned to continue boosting shareholder returns, along with the ramping up of e-commerce and delivery services.Continuous Endeavors to Expand Online PresenceWal-Mart has been relentlessly focusing on expanding its online business. Most recently, the company introduced easy and hassle free returns process for items purchased online. It has also announced free two-day shipping and in-store pick ups in close to 4,700 stores for online shoppers. The company plans to further add 1000 online grocery locations. It remains on track to improve delivery services for its e-commerce business and has recently acquired Parcel, Inc. In addition to expanding online grocery locations domestically, Wal-Mart is also focusing on expanding such services in key emerging markets and plans to add 255 units in China and Mexico.Through its online arm Jet.com, Wal-Mart has announced plans to launch its own private-label brand, Uniquely J, targeting young urban adults. Since Jet.com’s acquisition in September 2016, the company has acquired four e-commerce businesses — Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth.  The company also plans to invest in online cosmetics startup Birchbox. Wal-Mart has also teamed up with Google’s Alphabet Inc to enter the budding voice-shopping market, following the footsteps of Amazon.Backed by the solid progress of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business the company expects Wal-Mart US online sales revenue to account for 40% of net sales in fiscal 2019. It also anticipates capital expenditures of $11 billion each during fiscal 2018 and 2019 in connection with its online business expansion.These efforts indicate Wal-Mart’s enthusiasm toward exploring and augmenting itself in the digital space and thereby offer a formidable fight to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for capturing retail market share. Similarly retailers like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) are also focused on boosting omni-channel retailing and e-commerce. Expansion of Wal-Mart’s online business also compensates for the receding performance of brick-and-mortar stores. As a result, Wal-Mart plans to restrict store openings in the United States to lower than 15 Supercenters and 10 neighborhood markets, during fiscal 2019.  This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has constantly been an important pick for investors because of constant endeavors to expand its offering, while catering to the evolving needs of consumers. This is well reflected in the company’s share price performance that surged 24.7% in the past 12 months, compared with the industry’s increase of 12.5%. Further, the stock has a VGM Score of A, and a long-term growth rate of 5.9% indicating its inherent strength.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1176,KSS,"Shares of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) tanked on Monday after a report surfaced that suggested the department store chain’s attempt to finance a private equity buyout could fall through.Nordstrom sank over 6.50% after the New York Post reported on Sunday that talks to take the retailer private have started to fade. The Seattle-based chain has been in buyout talks with private equity firms for months, in an effort to reach a deal that is estimated to be worth as much as $10 billion.The Nordstrom family and private equity firms—including KKR (KKR  -  Free Report), Apollo (APO  -  Free Report), and Leonard Green—have reportedly found it hard to lock in solid interest rates from lenders in order to completely finance the deal. Banks have begun to seek high interest rates, pointing to negative downward trends in the retail industry as a whole.The New York Post report cited declining foot traffic in malls and Toys ‘R’ Us’ recent bankruptcy filing as massive, potentially detrimental signs that the retail world is in serious long-term trouble.“The financing has not worked out. I hear that the Nordstrom financing is not done and no one knows if it can be done,” a retail industry expert with knowledge of the situation told the New York Post. “Toys R Us isn’t good for anyone.”Nordstrom first announced it would consider taking the company private in June. Nordstrom’s initial statement noted that the family was looking into the possibility of acquiring 100% of JWN’s outstanding shares of common stock.The retail giant has seen its stock price fluctuate since the beginning of the year as it tries to navigate the changing retail waters. The family seemingly wanted to go private in order to make changes and investments that help the company adapt without having to worry about shareholder reactions.Last month, renewed energy to go private came just two days after the company announced it would debut a new concept store in California. Branded “Nordstrom Local,” the company won’t stock clothes at the new store, opting instead to focus on personal styling and consultations.Other Department Stores The news that Nordstrom might not be able to find financing for a buyout based on alarming retail trends has sent shares of fellow U.S. retailers tumbling on Monday as well.Shares of Nordstrom’s biggest retail peers, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report) sank 6.28% and 5.80%, respectively. Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) stock price dipped by nearly 3.50%, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) saw its price fall 0.45%. Shares of the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 2x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) dropped by over 2.10%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1177,KSS,"The retail industry has been witnessing rapid changes of late due to intense competition and increasing online activity. We note that traditional retailers have been experiencing increasing sales pressure and are finding it hard to keep up its market share amid highly promotional environment. With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers preferring to buy online, store and mall traffic has been impacted adversely. As a result, many retailers are shutting stores and focusing on their online models to compete with e-commerce channels. These firms are also trying to find innovative ways to attract traffic to stores. One such stock is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report). The Bentonville, AR-based company enjoys strong growth potential along with compelling fundamentals and has been making efforts to understand the evolving needs of customers and drive traffic in both at stores and online.Let’s now look into some of the factors that have been aiding the company’s performance and few of the challenges it has been dealing with.Initiatives to Understand Customer Needs and Boost Sales: The company is striving to understand the evolving needs of customers to regain their confidence, and boost sales. The company’s recent move to consolidate its U.S. operations will simplify its business structure and facilitate communication as well as improve execution. The move will also help the company to reduce its sky-high expenses, which have resulted from higher e-commerce activities and wage hikes. This will further help in increasing  efficiency at stores.Walmart’s international business has also shown improvement in the recently concluded second-quarter fiscal 2018, which has been declining since first-quarter fiscal 2016. Results were driven by improved performance at Walmex and in U.K. In fact, nine out of 11 international markets posted positive comp sales, including in the U.K., and five of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. Walmart continues to believe that its future revenue growth is expected to come from international markets.Improving Comps Sales Growth at Walmart U.S.: Walmart is seeing positive comps at Walmart U.S. for the last 12 quarters. Traffic has also improved for eleven consecutive quarters, thanks to the company’s efforts to modernize its stores to boost traffic. Traffic also increased due to moderate improvement in consumer spending. Walmart’s efforts to change its stores as per consumers’ demand helped the retailer attract shoppers. In fact, the company continues to expect positive comps year over year at Walmart U.S. in fiscal 2018.Higher Investment in E-Commerce Category: Walmart is putting a lot of effort and focusing on expanding its online business in order to gain larger market share than Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), the leader in the online business. Just like Walmart, retailers like Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are also focusing on its omni-channel retailing and e-commerce activity.In this regard, the company continues to make huge investments in e-commerce initiatives, including acquisitions. The company’s acquisition of four e-commerce businesses (Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth) since the Jet.com acquisition (in September 2016) is in line with the Walmart’s quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio to take on Amazon. Recently, the company announced palns to invest in online cosmetics startup Birchbox. If the deal materializes, it will become the fifth e-commerce acquisition, since the buyout of Jet.com. Meanwhile, the company is increasing investment in Mexico and China, where Amazon has a substantial share. Wal-Mart has also launched its own mobile payment system called Walmart Pay that will allow shoppers to pay through its smartphone app.Walmart is also aggressively trying to get a share of the pie in the online grocery shopping and delivery, which is a booming industry worth $12 billion in the United States. Walmart now operates online grocery delivery service in six markets. The giant retailer also enables customers to order groceries online and collect them from 900 locations. The retail giant has partnered with the ride hailing service provider Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Walmart has recently unveiled a program wherein it will allow food stamp receivers to order food and groceries online and pick up from any of the five specific stores in the United States. Also, with Easy Reorder on walmart.com, customers can repurchase items by looking into their previous in-store and online purchases records. The company also has a dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com which enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than 1 million classrooms across the country.The company’s free two-day shipping to U.S. shoppers on a minimum order of $35 and that too without a membership fee has also proved to be a success. In April, Walmart introduced a program wherein it offered discounts on online items, only if shoppers pick up their orders from a nearby store. The discount given had an added feature to Walmart’s already existing delivery service called Walmart Pickup, which enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. Pickup is currently available at more than 4,600 stores.In fact, the company expects to continue to invest aggressively in e-commerce initiatives in fiscal 2018.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

1178,KSS,"The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. This transition in shopping pattern is compelling retailers to rapidly adapt to the changes in the ecosystem. Retailers are left with no option but to keep pace with the changing retail scenario or get eliminated. They are now focusing more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. Although Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) is not fully immune to retail headwinds, this department store retailer is leaving no stone unturned to be back on growth trajectory.What’s Giving Macy’s a Tough Time?Waning Top & Bottom-LinesMacy’s waning top and bottom-line performance has been a major concern. A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2016 unveils that net sales declined 7.4%, 3.9%, 4.2% and 4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, while earnings per share plunged 28.6%, 15.6%, 69.6% and 3.3% during the respective quarters. During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017 the scenario was no different, as net sales declined 7.5% and 5.4%, while earnings per share fell 40% and 11.1%, respectively.Soft Comps & Earnings ProjectionMacy’s continues to project total sales to decline in the band of 3.2-4.3% and expects comps on an owned plus licensed basis to decrease in the range of 2-3% during fiscal 2017. The company also maintains adjusted earnings forecast of $2.90-$3.15 per share compared with $3.11 posted in fiscal 2016.Management had warned investors that margins may continue to feel the pinch of tough retail scenario on account of stiff competition from other department store retailers such as Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), Dillard's, Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report). Macy’s cautioned investors that its fiscal 2017 gross margin may contract 50-70 basis points.Macy’s Action PlanMacy’s has announced a slew of measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omni-channel capabilities to enhance sales, profitability and cash flows. Additionally, management is developing e-commerce business, Macy’s Backstage off-price business along with expanding Bluemercury and online order fulfillment centers.Management is realigning operations and focusing on curtailing costs. It informed that these measures are likely to result in annual savings of about $550 million, and would allow the company to invest an additional $250 million in enhancing digital business, store-related growth initiatives, Bluemercury, Macy’s Backstage and China.Macy’s recently announced the restructuring of its merchandising operations that includes combining of merchandising, planning and private brands divisions into one segment. As part of the restructuring, the company would incur one-time costs of approximately $20-$25 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. However, management expects to save about $30 million on an annual basis. The company anticipates saving about $5 million or approximately 1 cent a share in the final quarter.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1179,KSS,"Shares of Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) moved up to eventually close the day 1.1% higher after it announced to extend its partnership with online giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). The retailer has decided to start accepting returns for Amazon customers on selected products in 82 of its U.S. store locations from October 2017. Additionally, the retailer will provide free service of packing and shipping the merchandises to Amazon’s fulfillment centers.The latest move comes after Kohl's decided to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago earlier this month. Kohl’s believes this store-within-store concept will boost stores traffic.The partnership is poised to benefit both companies. Kohl’s will make use of its stores and omni-channel capabilities, while Amazon will now be serving a widened customer base. Leveraging the benefits of the two, we believe Kohl’s is expected to generate more store traffic, curtesy of the availability of Amazon’s varied electronics options and the return facility. Amazon, on the other hand, will be able to lower set-up costs and get more visibility through Kohl’s stores.Like Kohl’s, retailers such as Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) and Sears Holdings Corporation  have also teamed up with the online giant ahead of the holiday season. While Best Buy is creating in-store Amazon concepts, Sears plans to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon. Apart from Amazon, the company has also teamed up with Apple Inc. last year to develop small shops within its stores.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteOther Initiatives to Boost Traffic and Drive SalesKohl’s of late, has been taking a number of initiatives to attract shoppers and improve sales. The company has added Under Armour workout tights and sneakers in its portfolio and is focusing on sales growth with both Nike and Adidas. Kohl’s plans to sell Clarks shoes to capture the back-to-school shopping season and is also contemplating to add other brands to store aisles.The company gained significant market share in active apparel and footwear segment in the first half of the year and expects the momentum to continue in the latter half, based on assortment improvements. The company also intends to focus on three largest private-label brands such as SONOMA, Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9 to propel traffic, thanks to the improving sales in the past, driven by an impact of speed initiative in the supply chain. In order to drive comps, the company has also taken an initiative of Greatness Agenda during the first quarter of 2014 to increase transactions per store and sales.Inventory Reduction InitiativesKohl’s has also undertaken several steps to reduce inventory to raise profits. Lower stock levels have led to improvement in merchandise margins, thus leading to gross margin growth. The company continues to expect supply to be down at low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.Growing e-commerce BusinessThe company is also striving to boost its e-commerce business over the last few years. As a result, digital conversion improved at a double-digit rate in the recently reported second quarter of fiscal 2017 on the back of better customer experiences on smartphone and smartphone app. In fact, technological advancement in terms of online applications, order placement on phone handsets and omni-channel efforts are expected to have a substantial impact on customer experience.Regular InnovationsKohl’s has been introducing new brands regularly to keep the inventory assortment fresh and the flow of customer traffic to both company’s stores and website stable. Popular launches like Fit Bed under the active and wellness business, the Jumping Beans collection featuring Disney characters, IZOD branded menswear and the Juicy Couture brand for women and girls, Gaiam Yoga product, Stride Rite branded kids’ footwear collection and many more further provide stimulus to the company’s robust product portfolio. Kohl’s also partnered with designer Reed Krakoff to unveil an exclusive, limited-edition collection called REED, exclusively at Kohl’s retail outlets and on Kohls.com in April 2016.We believe these efforts are well-reflected in the share prices of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here. Over the last three months, the stock has rallied more than 25% in comparison to the industry and the broader Retail and Wholesale sector.

(AAPL  -  Free Report) laid out at its much-hyped Keynote event held last week at the brand-new Steve Jobs Theater.Before the company unveiled the slew of new devices we’ll all likely be putting on out holiday wish lists, senior vice president of retail and online stores, Angela Ahrendts, came out to discuss Apple’s vision for a new kind of retail store.And boy, is it different. Because Apple views its retail stores as its “largest product,” the company’s redesigned locations are now town squares, a public space were customers can get tech support for their Apple device but also hang out with friends afterwards.While it is a risky concept, Apple town squares aren’t all that different from what traditional retailers are trying to implement. Companies like Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) are creating and experimenting with different kinds of store concepts that focus on an experience rather than just buying a product.Apple’s notion of what retail can be is definitely different and certainly risky, but it’s also a reflection of where the broader retail industry is headed.As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

1181,KSS,"The final weeks of the back-to-school are keeping retailers on the edge with initiatives to push up sales. Representing the second-busiest shopping season after Christmas holidays, back-to-college spending is expected to hit an all-time high this year while back-to-school spending is expected to see its second-highest spending level on record.As per the National Retail Federation (NRF), the combined spending on back to school and college supplies is expected to reach $83.6 billion this year, up 10% from $75.8 billion last year (read: Retail Sales Off to a Great Start to Q3: ETFs to Buy).Families with children in elementary through high school are expected to spend $687.72 per child on clothing, electronics such as computers or calculators, apparels and other school supplies such as notebooks, folders, pencils, backpacks and lunchboxes, for a total of $29.5 billion, up 8% year over year.While more than one-fourth of the families are being perceived to shop two months before the beginning of school, 46.7% are expected to shop three weeks to one month before school starts and 21% to wait until the last week or two. This suggests that budget-constrained parents are looking to shop last minute to get extra discounts from retailers, which will come mostly at the end of summer or the Labor Day weekend.Departmental stores and discount stores are definitely attractive shopping destinations but online sales will remain a hot spot for shopping with 45.5% expected from back-to-school and 44.1% from back-to-college customers. As per eMarketer, online sales for back-to-school will grow 14.8% this year.What’s Hot?In the final days of the ongoing shopping season, retailers continued to lure customers with more promotional offers such as cash back, coupon discounts and free shipping.E-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is offering up to 80% off on essentials such as school supplies, kids' apparel, and electronics. Meanwhile, the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), introduced a rollback sale in addition to a higher number of back-to-school and back-to-college items through both its Online Grocery Pickup and Pickup Today services, offering tens of thousands more items than in the past. In fact, Wal-Mart is still selling more than 300 items under $1.00 (read: Why You Should Buy the Dip in Amazon Shares with ETFs).Tech giant Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is offering a free pair of $300 Beats Solo3 Wireless headphones with the purchase of a new Mac computer or iPad Pro. Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) is not behind, offering a series of student-exclusive deals including $100 off on select MacBook and iMac models, $125 off on select computers and 10% off on select Surface devices.For school supplies, Target (TGT  -  Free Report) could be an exciting bet as character backpacks with a lunch bag and pencil pouch could be found starting at $14 while school supplies are for less than $1, $3, $5 and $10.

1182,KSS,"Last week, retail majors Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) reported their quarterly results wherein both delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Despite delivering upbeat results, both companies’ shares tanked, as they are still struggling with industry specific headwinds.Let’s delve into the details.Better-Than-Expected Quarterly ResultsOn Aug 10, both Kohl’s Corp. and Macy’s posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Kohl’s reported adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2% and prior-year quarter earnings by 2% owing to improved sales in all lines of business, strong inventory and expense management. Net sales of $4.144 billion marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.138 billion. However, it dipped 0.9% from the prior-year quarter due to a challenging sales environment and lower comparable store sales (comps).On the other hand, Macy’s posted adjusted earnings of 48 cents a share that topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents but declined substantially from 54 cents reported in the year-ago period. Total sales of this Cincinnati, OH-based company also came ahead of the estimate after missing the same in the preceding two quarters. However, the company’s top and bottom lines continued to decline year over year.Comps on an owned-plus-licensed basis dipped 2.5%, while on an owned basis comps fell 2.8%. Gross profit in the quarter declined 6.6% year over year, whereas gross margin contracted 60 basis points to 40.3%. Operating income plunged 18%, while adjusted operating margin shriveled 90 basis points to 5.5% in the quarter.Improved CompsWe note that these companies have delivered lower comps in the second quarter, but the decline was narrower than expected. While Kohl’s posted comps decline of 0.4%, it was narrower than management’s expectation of 1.5% fall, backed by increased traffic momentum and improvement in transactions in the month of July. Macy’s comps declined 2.5%, narrower than the 3.2% fall.Initiatives Which Boosted Sales Both Kohl’s and Macy’s are making efforts to strengthen their position in the retail space, amid competitive pressure from both brick-and-mortar discount stores and online retailers, such as Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).In an attempt to augment sales, profitability and cash flows, Macy’s has been taking steps such as cost cutting, integration of operations as well as developing its e-Commerce business and Macy’s Backstage off-price business, along with the expansion of Bluemercury and online order fulfillment centers. Moreover, as a part of store rationalization program, the company plans to shut down underperforming stores.Kohl’s has also been making continuous efforts to improve its base business. Lately, the company has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands it sells. Kohl’s has started selling Under Armour products, as well as Clarks shoes and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles. The company also plans to continue selling the best-selling of its private-label brands, such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9, in order to drive traffic. Kohl’s has also undertaken several initiatives to reduce its inventory to boost profits.Despite the efforts, shares of both the stocks have been declining over the last few quarters. If we look into the share price performance of these stocks over the last one year, we note that while Kohl’s fell 17.3%, while Macy’s plummeted 50.2%, in comparison to the industry, which declined 40.9%. We believe waning mall traffic and increased online competition has grappled the overall industry and is hurting these stocks.Both Kohl’s and Macy’s currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Other than Kohl’s and Macy’s, retailers like J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) and Dillard’s Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) also failed to impress investors with their quarterly numbers, pulling down the shares.Challenges GaloreWe note that the retail sector has been witnessing rapid changes of late. Customers now prefer online shopping than buying goods from stores. Thus the e-Commerce business is improving and is acquiring substantial market share of brick-and-mortar stores. This in turn has adversely impacted the store traffic. Retailers are focusing on improving their e-Commerce businesses to tap in on the growing popularity of online shopping. However, by no means are they able to compete with Amazon.com, which dominates the e-Commerce market space.The retail industry is also facing major challenges from a still-strong U.S. dollar, volatile commodity costs and uncertain economic environment. A strong dollar has resulted in lower spending from foreign tourists and is impacting retailers’ overseas operations. Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores. A highly promotional environment is also forcing retailers to slash prices thus impacting margins negatively.Bottom LineThough the companies have reported better-than-expected results, we remain skeptical about the stocks, as the retail chains still have a number of deterrents to overcome. While we are encouraged with the initiatives taken by the companies to grow their sales and market shares, we would still prefer to wait and watch these stocks as retailers will still have to compete against the back-to-school and holiday sales.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1183,KSS,"Benchmarks ended mixed on Tuesday despite better than expected retail data and a de-escalation in tensions with North Korea. Weaker than expected earnings from Home Depot weighed on the Dow and pared gains for the blue-chip index. However, the Dow ended in the green following gains from American Express and Apple. The S&P 500 ended in the red overall losses in the market because of the slump in the retail sector. The Nasdaq also ended in the negative territory due to broad based losses for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,998.99, advancing 5.28 points or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 1.23 points to close at 2,464.61. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,333.01, increasing 7.22 points or 0.1%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,799 to 946. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1,671 to 1,016.Retail Sales Notch Up a Seven Month HighSales at U.S. retailers recorded their biggest increase in seven months in July. Retail sales advanced 0.6% last month, the best performance since a gain of 0.9% last December, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales jumped 4.2% in the past twelve months, which is near the five-year average. Excluding auto and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.5% in July. In fact, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales went up 0.6% last month. June’s retails sales were also revised to show a 0.3% gain, in contrast to the previously reported 0.2% decline. May’s retail sales were revised up to show no change instead of the earlier report of a 0.1% dip.The lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Amazon Fells the Traditional Retail SectorWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation KSS and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.The Dow closed higher for the third day on Tuesday. The blue-chip index notched 45 points earlier in the day. These gains were offset by weak earnings from the retail sector. The biggest drag on the Dow was falling shares of Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report). The home-improvement company cut about 30 points from the Dow. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker. (Read More: Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) Beats on Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates August 15, 2017)Telecom, Consumer Discretionary Stocks Drag S&P 500 LowerThe S&P 500 declined on Tuesday as the telecom and consumer-discretionary sectors disappointed. Five of the eleven primary sectors ended in the red, led by consumer discretionary. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) was down 0.9%. Moreover, Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) reported a 16.8% decline in adjusted earnings to $1.58 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 15, 2017) from $1.90 earned in the prior-year quarter. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65. Adjusted net income declined to $117 million from $141 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

1184,KSS,"The largest increase in retail sales in seven months failed to lift consumer sentiment substantially on Tuesday. Moreover, a selloff in traditional retail stocks followed, raising concerns over the sector’s long-term prospects. Industry watchers may hold differing views on this issue, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to profit from the country's rising purchasing power using traditional retail stocks.At the same time, it is difficult to ignore that a resilient labor market, accompanied by a slow and steady rise in wages, has made U.S. consumers increasingly confident. Traditional retail stocks may have lost their luster, but there are still several other avenues to profit from rising discretionary spending. Investing in consumer discretionary stocks from domains other than retail makes for a smart move at this point.“Amazonification” EffectThe lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category.

(WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.But of particular concern was a 2.7% decline in shares of The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), even after it reported stellar second-quarter results and raised its guidance for the second time for the year. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker.Our ChoicesConsumer’s growing tendency to switch from offline to online alternatives has been apparent even in the recent past. But this is possible the first spurt in retail trade which is being partially attributed to sales derived only from Amazon.com. Clearly, the days of retail are increasingly numbered.However, this doesn’t mean that you should ignore the higher discretionary spending power of the American consumer. Several profitable alternatives from domains other than retail continue to exist. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

1185,KSS,"On Tuesday, shares of department store Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) popped, up over 4.5% at one point (though the stock is currently trading up about 1.3% in late-morning trading), after the retailer said it will begin to accept returns on select merchandise from Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).The return program is set to start in October in 82 Kohl’s locations throughout Los Angeles and Chicago, the same cities that the company is implementing its “store-in-store” concept called Amazon Smart Home Experience (read more: Kohl’s Rallies on New Store-In-Store Partnership with Amazon).These mini shops will sell Amazon’s popular Alexa-enabled devices like the Echo smart speaker, and customers will be able to try and test out the e-commerce giant’s growing tech lineup.This returns-focused program, however, will likely be a solid traffic driver for Kohl’s. Customers will be able to bring their Amazon products into a Kohl’s store, and the company will package and transport the items to Amazon’s return centers for free.""This is a great example of how Kohl's and Amazon are leveraging each other's strengths – the power of Kohl's store portfolio and omnichannel capabilities combined with the power of Amazon's reach and loyal customer base,"" said Richard Schepp, Kohl's chief administrative officer.And, Kohl’s said that customers will be able to use “designated parking spots” close to store entrances if visiting a Kohl’s location for an Amazon return.Other retailers are teaming up with Amazon, a smart move ahead of the upcoming holiday season. Sears , for instance, signed a deal to sell its Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com, while Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) has also created in-store Amazon concepts.This is also not Amazon’s first time utilizing a brick-and-mortar retailer for its return services. After it completed its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, the company allowed shoppers to both pickup and return orders made on Amazon.com at one of the organic grocer’s over 400 stores.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

1186,KSS,"The changing retail landscape has had a bitter impact on most retailers. Evolving spending patterns of consumers and inclination toward online shopping have dented traffic and in turn brick-and-mortar sales. This digital transformation in shopping forced most retailers including big-box ones to trim their store count and focus more on their e-commerce model. One such retailer hit hard by the tough retail environment is Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report).Headwinds Plaguing the CompanyKohl’s has been grappling with numerous challenges since the past many quarters due to difficult sales environment and cautious consumer spending. The company witnessed a decline in demand for clothes and accessories like watches and handbags as consumers prefer to loosen the purse strings more on home renovations and cars.This has affected the store traffic significantly. In fact, in 2016, the company closed 19 underperforming stores due to tough retail conditions and heightened competition from discount retailers like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) as well as other physical shops such as Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report). Kohl’s comps have also been decreasing over the last six quarters due to industry wide concerns.In such a bleak scenario, Kohl’s has come up with innovative ways to market its products well and has undertaken initiatives to drive the sales and market share.Measures Adopted to Boost Traffic and Drive SalesKohl’s has been trying hard to attract more shoppers and improve sales. Recently, the company has partnered with e-commerce giant Amazon to provide a new Amazon smart home experience to customers in 10 selected Kohl’s stores across Los Angeles and Chicago, beginning this October. Apart from Amazon, the company had teamed up with Apple Inc. last year to develop small shops within its stores. Kohl’s believes this store-within-store concept will increase buyers’ footfall and boost stores traffic.The company has also started offering more famous external brands, curtailing the number of in-house clothing labels it sells. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other gear in March earlier was a great success and very well-accepted among the customers. The company is also focusing on sales growth with both Nike and Adidas. Kohl’s plans to start selling Clarks shoes to capture the back-to-school shopping season and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles. The company has gained significant a market share in active apparel and footwear segment in the first half of the year and expects the momentum to continue in the latter half, based on assortment improvements.The company also intends to focus on three largest private-label brands such as SONOMA, Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9 in order to propel traffic, thanks to the sales improvement trend posted in the past, driven by an impact of speed initiative in the supply chain.In order to drive comps, the company has also taken an initiative of Greatness Agenda during the first quarter of 2014 to increase transactions per store and sales. Though the plan is currently losing fizz, the company remains optimistic on its strategy to push sales over the long term. As part of this scheme, the company focuses on providing the right merchandise mix with tailoring products for every customer across channels. To execute this, the company expects to put more emphasis on five pillars namely, amazing product, easy experience, personalized connections, incredible savings and winning teams.We believe these efforts are well-reflected in the share prices of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.In the last three months, the stock has rallied nearly 25% in comparison to the industry and the broader Retail and Wholesale sector. While the industry has increased 9.2%, the sector has grown just 4.8%.Kohl’s also boasts a VGM Score of A, which makes it a favorable investing option.Inventory Reduction InitiativesKohl’s has also undertaken several steps to reduce inventory with a view to raise profits. Lower stock levels have led to improvement in merchandise margins, thus leading to gross margin growth. The company continues to expect supply to be down at low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.Growing e-Commerce BusinessThe company is also striving to flourish its e-commerce business since the last few years. As a result, digital conversion improved at a double-digit rate in the recently reported second-fiscal 2017 on the back of better customer experiences on smartphone and smartphone app. In fact, technological advancement in terms of online applications, order placement on phone handsets and omnichannel efforts are expected to leave a substantial impact on customer experience.In order to facilitate online sales via virtual platforms, Kohl’s has been opening on-line fulfillment centers and has also introduced Kohl’s Pay — a payment option allowing customers to pay for their in-store purchases with the Kohl’s credit card via their mobile phones. The company hopes to significantly grow its e-commerce business through these efforts in the near term.Regular InnovationKohl’s also routinely introduces new brands to keep the inventory assortment fresh and the flow of customer traffic to company’s stores and website stable. Popular launches like Fit Bed under the company’s active and wellness business, the Jumping Beans collection featuring Disney characters, IZOD branded menswear and the Juicy Couture brand for women and girls, Gaiam Yoga product, Stride Rite branded kids’ footwear collection and many more further add stimulus to the company’s robust product-portfolio. Kohl’s has also partnered with designer Reed Krakoff to unveil an exclusive, limited-edition collection called REED, exclusively at Kohl’s retail outlets and on Kohls.com in April 2016.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation Quote4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

1187,KSS,"Holiday season and retail are synonymous, and with the upcoming festive season, the spotlight is back on the sector. Notably, the retailers have started unveiling their plans for the busiest part of the year. Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) will hire nearly 80,000 seasonal workers to handle the rush, per media report. Notably, during prior-year holiday season the company hired 83,000 workers.The overall decline in seasonal hiring is due the shutting down of stores. However with increase in online shopping, the company will hire 18,000 holiday workers to support online orders, up nearly 20% from the last year holiday season. Improved staffing will aid the company cater to customers in a better way during the hectic holidays.Notably, during the holiday season retailers stay on their toes, flooding the market with offers and promotions. They sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases. Since the season accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits, retailers grab every opportunity to drive footfall.Per media report, other retailers have also announced their hiring plans. Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) intends to employ 100,000 associates. Meanwhile, The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) has begun inviting applications for seasonal associate positions at all stores including Gap, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic, Banana Republic Factory and Old Navy across the United States and Canada. Gap’s hiring events will be organized at all concerned stores on Sep 23, 2017. Other retailers like Kohl's Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) and GameStop Corp. (GME  -  Free Report) are yet to announce seasonal hiring plan.Macy’s Stock PerformanceMacy's shares are riding high of late, driven by previously announced measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omni-channel capabilities to improve performance. In a month, the stock has gained 9.3% but still below the industry’s gain of 12.8% primarily due to investors ongoing concerns about dwindling top and bottom-line results.Now it is to be seen whether the company’s initiatives like integration of operations as well as developing e-commerce business and online order fulfillment centers can drive the top line during all important holiday season.Macy’s currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1188,KSS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Kohl’s Corp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Kohl’s Corp’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 33.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Kohl’s Corp has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.6, so it is fair to say that the stock price might slightly appreciate in future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Kohl’s Corp has a P/S ratio of about 0.4. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, KSS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Kohl’s Corp currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Kohl’s Corp a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Kohl’s Corp might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B. This gives KSS a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimate revisions have been pretty favorable. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight up and no down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 10.8% in the past two months and the full year estimate has gone up by 4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Kohl's Corporation Price and Consensus Kohl's Corporation Price and Consensus | Kohl's Corporation QuoteDespite having a bullish trend, KSS sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This indicates that analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future. Thus, we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineKohl’s Corp is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 39% out of more than 250 industries) further strengthens its growth potential. In fact, over the past three months, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, despite a Zacks Rank #3, we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump Policies  If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1189,KSS,"On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that upscale department store chain Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) is readying a new concept that is much different than its other retail ventures: a store that doesn’t even sell clothes.Called Nordstrom Local, which opens October 3 in West Hollywood, California, this new store concept will focus on personal styling and consultations, and prospective customers will be able to make appointments ""online, over the phone or in-person,"" said Nordstrom in a statement.When customers enter Nordstrom Local, they’ll likely notice it’s much smaller than a typical Nordstrom location. The concept is only 3,000 square feet, measuring just a fraction of the size of the company’s mall-anchored flagships. But that’s the point: Local was designed in mind to be convenient, a time-saving option for shoppers on the go.“As the retail landscape continues to transform at an unprecedented pace, the one thing we know that remains constant is that customers continue to value great service, speed and convenience,” said Shea Jensen, Nordstrom senior vice president of customer experience.“We know there are more and more demands on a customer's time and we wanted to offer our best services in a convenient location to meet their shopping needs. Finding new ways to engage with customers on their terms is more important to us now than ever,” Jensen continued.Another deviation from a typical Nordstrom department store, and your regular retailer, is that Nordstrom Local won’t have any clothes in stock. Instead, there will be eight dressing rooms where customers can try on certain items of clothing, and if you find something that works, the personal stylists will then “retrieve goods from nine Nordstrom locations in Los Angeles, or through its website,” writes the WSJ.Additionally, any orders placed on Nordstrom.com by 2 p.m. can be picked up at Nordstrom Local, and the store will also be able to accept returns of items bought online of from other Nordstrom locations.More than anything, Nordstrom Local is service-oriented, and in addition to styling services, customers have access to the retailer’s other amenities like Trunk Club styling, Buy Online, Pick-Up In-Store, onsite alterations and tailoring, same-day delivery, and curbside delivery. Local will also offer manicures and a bar that offers coffee, pressed juices, and wine or beer.Nordstrom isn’t the only retailer experimenting with smaller format stores. Target (TGT  -  Free Report), in particular, has been notably expanding this kind of concept in urban areas, while fellow department stores Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and Sears  have been shrinking a good number of its existing locations.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

(JCP  -  Free Report) is now accepting Apple Pay at all its stores in the U.S. The company’s credit card will also be available on Apple Pay, allowing customers to earn reward points through its loyalty program.Further, the company stated that Apple Pay will function with iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE and Apple Watch in its stores. J. C. Penney chief information officer, Therace Risch said “With Apple Pay at JCPenney, we`re able to offer a faster, more seamless check out process by allowing our customers to pay for their purchases by simply holding their iPhone or Apple Watch near a point-of-sale terminal, rather than inserting a chip card.”Moreover, recently J.

Penney customers any leftover points will rollover from one month to next month instead of expiring. Meanwhile, J. C. Penney credit cardmembers will get one point for each dollar spent.In an era of challenging retail landscape, most of the retailers are using loyalty program as a tool to attract and retain existing customers. Retailers such as Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report)    and Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) have 24.5 million and 30 million, active customers under their own loyalty program, respectively. Ulta’s 24.5 million active customers garner above 80% of the company’s sales. We believe J. C. Penney’s enhanced loyalty program will help attract more customers.Stock PerformanceJ. C.

1191,KSS,"“Change is the only constant” – this one liner summarizes the state of all consumer-driven industries at the moment, as consumers’ accelerated shift toward online shopping has hit several industries, like apparel/shoe, departmental stores, and the food industry among others. A major player in the food industry, Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is also striving to keep up with these evolving trends, in order to serve consumers better and tap greater sales.Moving on these lines, this convenience foods products behemoth provided details on its four key strategies at its annual investor day yesterday, alongside reiterating its fiscal 2017 and long-term forecasts.Can Latest Plans Save CPB Stock?Campbell’s four strategies include plans to win consumers’ confidence via real food and raised transparency; speedy e-Commerce and digital marketing endeavors; maintaining focus on portfolio diversification; and strengthening its footprint in the growing snacking space. Shares of the company grew 3.1% in yesterday’s trading session.However, Campbell has slumped 17% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified industry that lost 10.8%. This could be largely accountable to Campbell’s waning top line which hasn’t witnessed a single year-over-year improvement for quite some time now. So let’s delve deeper into the plans outlined at the investor day, and see if they can save the day for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Four Core Strategies in DetailFocus on Real Food Philosophy & TransparencyCampbell remains focused on its real food philosophy, as part of which it plans to invest nearly $50 million to develop products as per the changing consumer preferences. Also, the company inked a deal with The Sage Project to reveal its ingredients online by leveraging Sage’s food data platform. Sage is engaged in offering online food labels, providing information on several attributes associated with food like ingredients, nutritional value and calories. Thus, partnership with Sage will enhance Campbell’s food transparency to its customers. Notably, Campbell is also on track to bring its real food philosophy to its soups category, and achieve significant results by the end of this year. In fact, it’s Well Yes! Soup will mark the company’s first product on Sage’s platform.Robust Digital Endeavors Bode WellAmazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) takeover of Whole Foods Market, Inc.  is testimony to the fact that e-Commerce has gained significant ground in the food industry. That said, Campbell is on track to strengthen its digital operations. Incidentally, the company announced plans to build an e-Commerce unit in North America, which will represent Campbell’s all three segments. Management appointed Shakeel Farooque to lead this e-Commerce team and anticipates delivering online sales of roughly $300 million in the next five years. Farooque’s past experience with behemoths like Amazon, eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) is likely to benefit Campbell, given his combined knowledge of consumers and technology. Well, Campbell’s focus on e-Commerce is also evident from its recently announced $10 million investment in online meal kit firm, Chef’d.Adding Organic Foods to Portfolio Should Lure ConsumersThe organic food space that surged at a compound annual growth rate of 15.3% in the last four years has become an over $11 billion category in the country. This is mainly due to consumers’ evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Thus, Campbell has been undertaking several steps to diversify its portfolio and expand in the fast-growing organic space. In this regard, the company recently announced plans to acquire leading organic broth and soup producer, Pacific Foods. This marked the company’s fifth buyout in the last five years. Other buyouts in this connection include Bolthouse Farms, Plums Organics and Garden Fresh Gourmet. Thanks to these buyouts, the company’s organic kitty currently ranks among the top 10 in the industry. Also, annual fresh products sales have reached approximately $1 billion, reflecting prospects of this category.Concentration on Growing Snacks UnitWith the growing demand for snacks, Campbell plans to undertake significant expansion at its Global Biscuits and Snacks’ segment, in fiscal 2018. The company plans to solidify this segment’s footprint geographically, and also go beyond its existing biscuits and bakes snack items. The company plans to prepare snacks using real food ingredients, which is also in sync with its first strategy. Also, the company plans to introduce soups, small meals and fresh snacks, which are expected to augment overall sales by about $200 million in the next five years.We believe that these strategies reflect Campbell’s commitment toward establishing a differentiated and significant position with the consumers’ community and in the food industry. In addition to elaborating on its strategic imperatives, management reaffirmed its fiscal 2017 and long-term goals, while it provided an update on its cost savings and cash flow targets for the fiscal.Fiscal 2017 & Long-Term OutlookManagement anticipates sales growth for fiscal 2017 to range from negative 1% to flat. Adjusted EBIT is expected to rise 2–4% year over year, while gross margin is anticipated to be 38%. Adjusted earnings for the fiscal are envisioned to grow in the range of 3–5% to $3.04–$3.09 per share. Coming to cash flows from operations, Campbell expects generating roughly $1.25 billion this fiscal. Also, the company plans to achieve cost savings worth $310 million by the end of fiscal 2017.Moving to the long term, management still projects organic sales growth in a range of 1–3%. Further, adjusted EBIT growth is envisioned in a band of 4– 6% and adjusted EPS is expected to grow 5–7% over the long term (both on a constant currency basis). Finally, the company continues to project cost savings from its ongoing initiatives to be around $450 million (roughly 6% of sales) by the end of fiscal 2020. Management plans to issue its fiscal 2018 outlook, along with its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results that are scheduled for Aug 31.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

1192,KSS,"On Monday, shares of department store Sears Holdings Corp.  are gaining, up around 7.3% in midday trading after it was revealed that the company has received a new line of credit.According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the credit line is from CEO Eddie Lampert’s hedge fund ESL Partners, and is valued at $200 million. Sears said it has entered into a “short-term line of credit loans” with ESL; the loans have a maturity of 151 days and a fixed interest rate if 9.75% per year.“This facility is intended to provide the Company with the flexibility to generate additional liquidity on an as-needed basis,"" Sears CFO Rob Riecker said in a statement. “This adjustment to our capital structure demonstrates that Sears Holdings will continue to take actions to generate liquidity and manage our business while meeting all of our financial obligations.”Sears has taken many concentrated steps over the past year or so to improve business at both Sears and Kmart stores. Earlier this month, the retailer said it was continuing its “transformation” and focus on “returning to profitability” by closing another 43 locations.Sears, however, has been one of the hardest hit department stores lately, with bankruptcy fears dogging the company at every turn—especially as the retail industry deals with the rise of online shopping and changing customer attitudes. Other department store peers like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), and JCPenney (JCP  -  Free Report) have struggled as well, with investors wondering if they’ll be able to survive as e-commerce players like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) continue to expand.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1194,KSS,"The Q1 earnings season has reached the tail end for all sectors save retail, which has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are down 1.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% revenue growth with 73.9% beating EPS estimates and 78.3% beating revenue estimates.While the growth pace is well below the four-quarter average, revenue and earnings surprises are much better than recent quarters. This is especially true as woes for departmental stores continued given the shift toward digital shopping.  Though departmental stores - Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) - topped our revenue and earnings estimate, they reported a drop in same-store sales, sparking off concerns on the prospect of their turnaround before the crucial holiday season. As a result, Macy’s dropped 10.2% following the earnings announcement on August 10, marking their biggest daily loss since January 5 while Kohl's shares had its worst day since January 8 falling 5.8%. Another department store chain Dillard's (DDS  -  Free Report) also tanked 15.9% on August 10 after it missed on both fronts (read: 3 ETFs & Stocks to Buy Post June Retail Sales).J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) shed as much as nearly 17% at the close on August 11 to reach an all-time low of $3.77 following dismal second-quarter results.All these results continued to weigh on the broad retail sector, suggesting more pain ahead for the retailers. In fact, retail ETFs - SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) – shed 3.5%, 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively, over the past five trading days.Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of big-box retailers that are likely to report this week. These also have the potential to push the related ETFs upward or downward (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).A Peek into Earnings SurprisesReports from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Staples , Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) will be crucial for the sector this week.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP has chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +0.45%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates this quarter.

The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.98% in the last four quarters and witnessed positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter. It has a top VGM Style Score of A.Foot Locker, which will likely report earnings on August 18 before the opening bell, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -3.30%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates.

1195,KSS,"Bricks-and-mortar retailers have been under pressure for long as these have been facing constant threats from digitalization. The surge in web-based shopping is wreaking havoc on departmental stores with lackluster sales, store closures and filings of bankruptcy (read: Forget Broader Retail; Bet on Online Retail ETFs).As of now, online retail sales make up about one tenth of total retail and about 5% of annual e-commerce revenue in the U.S. The space is developing fast with the increased usage of smartphones and other mobile Internet devices.As per statista, in 2013, 41.3% of global internet users had purchased products online; the figure is expected to grow to 46.4% by 2017. More than the U.S., the real growth opportunities lay in the under-penetrated emerging markets.Notably, shares of Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Kohl’s corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) and Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report) dropped recently after their earnings releases thanks to same-store sales declines (read: 3 ETFs & Stocks to Buy Post June Retail Sales).The U.S. retailers are closing down stores at the quickest clip in over a decade. Bankruptcies are being filed at a dreadful pace. SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) lost about 3.4% in the last 10 days.Short sellers and options traders now expect more upheaval in the U.S. retail sector, as per the source. So far this year, XRT has seen inflows of only $81.1 million in assets and since the start of April, the fund shed about $172.9 million in assets, as per etf.com.Investors are shorting the companies more aggressively than other stocks within the S&P 500 index, according to data from research firm IHS Markit. Going by the Wall Street Journal article, the number of bearish put options outstanding has risen 25% since the beginning of April, while the number of bullish options has tumbled 26%, as per Trade Alert.What About Upcoming Retail Sales Event?There are several events when retail sales see a surge. One such event is back-to-school/ college season which continues from mid-July through early/mid-September. NRF’s annual survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics showed that total collective spending is expected to touch $83.6 billion – its second-highest level on record. The figure is up over 10% from the year-ago period. However, about 45.5% of these shopping is likely to be done online.As per Earning Trends issued on August 9, 2017, retail earnings are likely to drop 0.9% in Q2 on 4.1% revenue growth. For the upcoming third quarter, earnings are likely to decline 1.2% on 4.8% revenue growth.A Technical Look at the Retail ETF - XRTIf we take a look at XRT – a popular retail ETF on the market – the downtrend is clearly visible. The fund was down over 10% this year (as of August 11, 2017).The Relative Strength Index for XRT is presently 41.57 suggesting that the fund is approaching an oversold territory. The short-term moving average (9-day) for XRT is below the long-term average (200-day) suggesting bearishness for this ETF. The current price of XRT is trading below the parabolic SAR (PSAR) indicating a bearish trend for the product.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

1196,KSS,"Wall Street witnessed the worst weekly performance in months given escalating tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. Notably, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial posted their second-worst week of the year, shedding 1.4% and 1.1%, respectively, while the Nasdaq logged its third-worst week plunging 1.5%. Meanwhile, the small cap index - Russell 2000 – also lost 2.7% last week, representing its biggest one-week decline since February 2016.The war of words between Donald Trump and North Korean officials has deepened last week that shook complacency in the broad stock market, prompting risk-off trade. Trump has warned that North Korea would face ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" if it continues to threaten the U.S. and the North Korea retaliated by threatening to launch a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, which is home to a large U.S. military base.Further, Trump doubled down on his aggressive stance on North Korea by saying that his threat to unleash “fire and fury” on the country was not “tough enough and tweeted that ""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely” (read: ETFs to Profit from US-North Korea Tensions).Coupled with rising North Korea tensions, disappointing earnings results from some of the large retailers like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), social media network Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report) and the meal-kit maker Blue Apron Holdings (APRN  -  Free Report) weighed on the market.Given higher volatility, inverse or leveraged inverse ETFs gained immense popularity last week as investors embraced these products for big gains in a short span though these involve a great deal of risk when compared to traditional products. These products create either a leveraged long/short position, an inverse long/short position or a leveraged inverse long/short position in the underlying index by employing various investment strategies such as swaps, options, future contracts and other financial instruments. Due to their compounding effect, investors can enjoy higher returns in a very short period of time provided the trend remains a friend.Below, we have highlighted six such ETFs that crushed the market last week and should continue to do so at least for the near term as long as North Korea tensions perturb the stock market.ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY  -  Free Report)This product provides two times (2x) leveraged exposure to the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index, which measures the returns of a portfolio of monthly VIX futures contracts with a weighted average of one month to expiration. It has amassed $343.9 million in its asset base and trades in heavy volume of 10.3 million shares a day on average. The ETF charges 95 bps in fees per year and gained 45% last week (read: Volatility Spikes on Geopolitics: 4 ETF Tactics to Shield).Direxion Daily Regional Banks Bear 3x Shares (WDRW  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to deliver thrice (3x) the inverse return of the S&P Regional Banks Select Industry Index, charging 95 bps in fees per year. WDRW has accumulated $4.8 million in its asset base and trades in a paltry volume of around 2,000 shares a day on average. The fund was up 14.8% last week.Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3x Shares (JNUG  -  Free Report)This product provides 3x exposure to the daily performance of the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index. It charges 95 bps in annual fees and has accumulated nearly $775.8 million in its asset base. Volume is heavy, exchanging more than 16 million in shares per day on average. JNUG gained 11.1% in the last week (read: Will Gold ETFs Shine in August?).  Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3x Shares (LABD  -  Free Report)This product seeks to deliver 3x the inverse daily performance of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index. The fund has amassed $96.1 million in its asset base and trades in average daily volume of around 4.9 million shares. It charges investors 95 bps in annual fees and expenses. The ETF delivered returns of 8.8% last week.Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3x Shares ETF (ERY  -  Free Report)This product provides 3x inverse exposure to the Energy Select Sector Index. It is extremely popular and trades in heavy volume nearly 1.2 million shares. The ETF charges annual fee of 95 bps and has AUM of $46.9 million. It has gained 8.3% last week.Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3x Shares (TZA  -  Free Report)This product provides 3x inverse play to the Russell 2000 Index, charging 95 bps in fees and expenses. It has been able to manage $733.8 million in its asset base with heavy average daily volume of 9.8 million shares. TZA was down 8.3% last week. Bottom LineWhile the strategy is highly beneficial for short-term traders, it could lead to huge losses compared with traditional funds in fluctuating or seesaw markets. Further, their performances could vary significantly from the actual performance of their underlying index over a longer period when compared to the shorter period (such as, weeks or months) due to their compounding effect (see: all Leveraged Equity ETFs here).Still, for ETF investors who are bearish on equities for the near term, either of the above products could make an interesting choice. Clearly, this could be intriguing for those with high-risk tolerance should the trend continue in this specific corner of the investing world.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1197,KSS,"The retail sector received a much-needed boost on July 13 as stocks logged their best single-day return of this year. SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) was up over 2.3% on the day while its year-to-date return is still in the red. With Thursday’s stellar returns, the fund is now down about 9.4% in the year-to-date frame (as of July 13, 2017).Credit Goes to Target Corp.Target Corp. (TGT) guides sales to grow for the first time in five quarters, backed by higher traffic and improving sales trends. Target raised its expectations for comparable store sales to a modest increment for the current quarter from the previous forecast of negative comps. Earnings are now projected above the high end of Target’s forecast of $0.95–$1.15 per share. TGT was up about 4.8% on July 13.The news acted as a cornerstone for the entire space. Hint of improvement in traffic to a brick-and-mortar retailer spurred hopes of a trend reversal in the overall retail space.Inside Brick-and Mortar’s Constant Pain The sector as a whole has so far been under pressure. After witnessing decent growth in January, U.S. retail sales recorded a decline in February, a moderation in March, a lukewarm improvement in April, and a slight drop in May (read: 5 ETFs & Stocks: Silver Lining in Soft May Retail Sales).Disappointing earnings results were noticed from several traditional brick-and-mortar operators lately while web-based shopping surged. As of now, online retail sales make up one tenth of total retail and about 5% of annual e-commerce revenue in the U.S. The space is developing fast with the increased usage of smartphones and other mobile internet devices. Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report) is up over 33% so far this year.Notably, the online e-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) just saw a record third annual Prime Day. This was the biggest shopping day in the company’s history, surpassing Black Friday and Cyber Monday (read: Amazon Prime Day Hits Record: 5 Best ETF Deals).Other Retail Stock Winners Post Target-Induced BoostOn July 13, several retail stocks were on a tear. J. C. Penney Company (JCP  -  Free Report) (up 7.8%), Macy's (M  -  Free Report) (up 4.1%), The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) (up 5.6%), American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) (up 4.6%), Sears Holdings Corporation  (up 7.2%), Dillard's, Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) (up 6.3%), Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) (up 4.8%) are some of the winners.Why These ETFs to Play Investors should note that the Zacks Industry Rank for discount retailers is in top 38%. The Zacks Industry Rank for catalog shopping is in top 1%. Agreed, there are a lot of corners in the retail space that are in the bottom section, but if Target’s indication proves right for the whole space, investors can play the below-mentioned ETFs.XRT in FocusThis product tracks the S&P Retail Select Industry Index, holding about 100 securities in its basket with none accounting for more than 1.49% of assets. Apparel retail takes the top spot at 21.6% share while internet & direct marketing retail, specialty stores, and automotive retail round off the next three spots with a double-digit allocation each. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) (read: Amazon's Foray Into Grocery to Hurt/Help These Stocks & ETFs).VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms by tracking the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index. It is highly concentrated on the top firm – Amazon – at 19.8% while other firms hold less than 5.33% share. The fund is a mix of consumer discretionary and staples stocks with the former accounting for about 60% of the fund and staples taking about 30% share. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy).PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio (PMR  -  Free Report)This fund follows the Dynamic Retail Intellidex Index. In total, the product holds 30 securities with each holding less than 5.34% of assets. In terms of industrial exposure, specialty retail takes the top spot. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

1198,KSS,"After scaling to new highs this year, the equity market is showing some cracks. The exchange of bitter words between U.S. and North Korea has kept many traders on their toes, while brick-and-mortar retailers are facing declining foot traffic, drop in comparable store sales and increased store closures. Also, wider losses for Snapchat and Walt Disney Co’s (DIS  -  Free Report) plans to pull its movies off Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) have dented investors’ sentiments.In fact, historically, August has been a bearish month for most of the major indices. This calls for investing in some rock-solid stocks for steady gains.Wall Street’s Fear Gauge Springs Back to LifeThe bears are back in control. Even though the Wall Street’s “fear-gauge”, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), has soared more than 70% since the all-time low hit on Jul 26. In fact, last week it witnessed the highest weekly rise since December 2015. CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index also flipped back into the ”fear” territory last week.Wall Street crawled back into the green on Aug 11, recovering from a sharp decline in the previous session. However, it registered a weekly loss on lingering geopolitical concerns. Last week, the Dow saw its worst week since March, the S&P 500 recorded its steepest one-week drop since November and the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst weekly decline since June.Trump’s North Korea Nuclear RhetoricLast week was plagued by escalating tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. President Trump’s vow to unleash “fire and fury” in response to North Korea’s warning to strike the U.S. territory of Guam, finally indicated that the doom-and-gloom crowd on Wall Street is returning.Trump has issued an ultimatum to Pyongyang saying that “they be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before”. His harsh words came in after U.S. intelligence analysts said that North Korea has developed a miniaturized nuclear warhead. Following Trump’s comments, North Korea said that it was “examining the operational plan” to strike sensitive areas like the Anderson Air Force base.Such talks of “fire and fury” turned investors’ attention to the risk of a nuclear conflict with North Korea, instead of focusing on upbeat corporate earnings in the second quarter (read more: Q2 Earnings Season Brings All Around Strength).Consumers Continue to Shun Department StoresThings aren’t going well in the domestic front either. Retail apocalypse continues at department stores, with Macy's Inc (M  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Dillard's, Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) reporting a drop in same-store sales in their latest earnings reports. Shares of such companies tanked as same-store sales indicated the health of the retailers by showing how well store locations performed in the last one year.Needless to say, the rise of e-commerce players like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has also taken a toll on many brick-and-mortar retailers. According to the Forrester’s new Online Retail Forecast, as cited by Digital Commerce 360, online sales in the U.S. are expected to grow 13% year over year in 2017, five times faster than the projected offline sales growth (read more: Department Stores Disappoint Again).Snapchat a Disappointment, Disney to Pull Movies Off NetflixFor the second quarter, Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report) reported loss per share of 36 cents, much wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents. Revenues of $181.7 million also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $186.9 million. Such a poor show raised doubts that the messaging platform is struggling to grow into a mainstream service and is facing fierce competition from Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) in the process (read more: Snap Q2 Loss Widens, Revenues Miss, Stock Plunges).Disney is, in the meanwhile, parting ways with Netflix. It will launch its own streaming service and plans to buy stake in BAMTech, a mega streaming and marketing service. Disney’s cable networks like ESPN have fallen in recent years as viewers have changed the way they watch entertainment.August Traditionally a Bearish Month: 4 Ultra-Safe Stocks to BuyThanks to the aforesaid factors, the past few days have been marked with significant turbulence after an unusual long period of quiet on Wall Street.  August is also widely believed to be a bearish month for the stock market. The Dow had endured major gyrations this month since the bull market began after the 2008-09 financial crisis, while the S&P 500 gained, on an average, a meagre 0.08% over the past 50 years this month (read more: 5 Winning Stocks to Fight August Woes).As stocks may face major turmoil, investors should build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1. These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corp (WMC  -  Free Report) is a real estate investment trust. The company has a beta of 0.72 and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is currently trading at 7.65x forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate, which compares with a 1-year industry trading range of 8.97x to 9.78x, implying that the stock is quite a bargain and is fundamentally sound. The company’s projected growth rate for the current year is 316.4%, in contrast to the industry’s estimated decline of 4.1%.Saratoga Investment Corp (SAR  -  Free Report) is a specialty finance company. The company has a beta of 0.5 and a Zacks Rank #2. Saratoga Investment is currently trading at 9.79x forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate, which compares with a 1-year industry trading range of 9.88x to 11.2x. The company’s projected growth rate for the current year is 26.8%, in contrast to the industry’s projected decline of 7.4%.Zagg Inc (ZAGG  -  Free Report) designs, produces and distributes professional product solutions for mobile devices. The company has a beta of 0.93 and a Zacks Rank #1. Zagg is currently trading at 10.18x forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate, which compares with a 1-year industry trading range of 16.62x to 19.46x. The company’s projected growth rate for the current year is 175.8%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 19.6%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) is a retail feed store. It is a producer and seller of chicken with operations mostly in the U.S. The company has a beta of 0.19 and a Zacks Rank #1. Pilgrim's Pride is currently trading at 11.65x forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate, which compares with a 1-year industry trading range of 13.63x to 17.37x. The company’s projected growth rate for the current year is 38.7%, more than the industry’s projected growth of 22.2%.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump Policies                                                                                                            If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

1199,KSS,"Shares of Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) moved up 4.7%, following the news of a partnership with e-Commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). Per the deal, both the companies will provide a new Amazon smart home experience for customers in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. The “store-in-store” concept will initiate in October. Customers will now be able to purchase Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices like the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Fire tablet directly from Amazon smart home spaces in Kohl’s stores.Like Kohl’s, retailers such as Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) and Sears Holdings Corporation  have also teamed up with the online giant. Best Buy is creating in-store Amazon concepts, while Sears plans to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com. Apart from Amazon, the company has also teamed up with Apple Inc. last year to develop small shops within its stores.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteBenefits of This PartnershipWe note that Kohl’s has been grappling with numerous headwinds since the past many quarters due to difficult sales environment and cautious consumer spending. Evolving spending patterns of consumers are also hurting sales. Demand for clothes and accessories like watches and handbags have declined as consumers prefer to spend more on home renovations and cars. This has affected the store traffic significantly. In fact, in 2016, the company closed 19 underperforming stores due to tough retail conditions and heightened competition from discount retailers as well as other brick-and-mortar stores.Kohl’s comps have also been declining over the last six quarters due to industry wide headwinds. The company began its turnaround initiative named “Greatness Agenda” in the first quarter of 2014 to increase transactions per store and sales. However, it did not bear fruits. Nevertheless, it has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015. However, the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually which remained a concern. Moreover, comps have declined consecutively in the last six quarters, including the recently reported the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This is raising concerns over the near term.The partnership therefore seems to be beneficial for both companies. Kohl’s believes its stores traffic will increase, thanks to the availability of Amazon’s varied electronics options. Amazon, on the other hand, will save huge set-up costs and will get more visibility through Kohl’s stores.Other Initiatives to Revive SalesThe company has been undertaking a number of initiatives to attract more shoppers to stores and improve sales. Lately, the company has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other gear in March was a great success and was very well-accepted among customers.The company is also focusing on sales growth with both Nike and Adidas. Kohl's plans to start selling Clarks shoes for the back-to-school shopping season and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles. The company has gained significant market share in active apparel and footwear in the first half of the year and expects the trend to continue in the back half, based on assortment improvements.During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company witnessed improvement in sales trend compared to the prior quarter, driven by the impact of the speed initiative in the supply chain and continued focus on three largest private-label brands such as SONOMA, Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9. Two of its largest exclusive brands, Simply Vera Vera Wang and Lauren Conrad, posted double-digit sales increases in the quarter. The company plans to continue selling the best-selling of its private-label brands, such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9, in order to drive traffic.We believe these efforts are well reflected in the share prices of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Notably, in the last three months, the stock has moved up nearly 20% in comparison to the industry and the broader Retail and Wholesale sector. While the industry improved 8.7% in the last three months, the sector declined 0.1% in the said time frame.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.This proven stock-picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing.

The relationship between North Korea and the United States appears to be at a breaking point, and investors took a healthy pause this week because of the recent developments.Of course, there were several other headlines to cover as well. Earnings season is wrapping up, but investors did see fresh reports from two of this year’s biggest IPOs: Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report) and Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report). It was a disappointing first-ever earnings report for Blue Apron, and Snap didn’t fare very well in its second-ever report. As a result, these struggling new stocks look poised to keep on struggling.Read more here: Snap Stock Plummets on Q2 Earnings and Revenue Miss& Investors React to Blue Apron's Abysmal First Earnings ReportOn the topic of disappointment, that’s exactly what investors were dealt by several major retail earnings reports this week. Once again, department store giants like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), and Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report) plummeted after the markets were quick to punish the brand’s for continued same-store sales declines. Despite what some may see as small improvements in certain areas of retail, investors weren’t buying it this week.Get the full scoop: Retail Earnings Roundup: Macy's, Kohl's, Dillard's PlummetFinally, the hosts turned their attention to investor-favorite Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) earnings results.

1202,KSS,"The investing world may go gaga over the rapid emergence and acceptance of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and be enamored by its 94% share price gains in two years against 10.5% decline in SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report),butthere is a section that still doubts this monumental success. Moody’s Investors Service falls in this category. Let’s delve a little deeper”:Still Low Online Penetration in the United StatesAs per Moody’s, Amazon.com Inc. is far from ruling the U.S. retail market: “Online sales still account for only about 10% of overall U.S. retail sales, with a much lower percentage in the grocery segment, leaving the big brick and mortar retailers, led by Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), still really formidable competitors in the industry,"" as noted by Moody’s. This makes the e-commerce behemoth’s foray into the grocery segment with the Whole Foods acquisition appear not as profitable as many thought it will be (read: Tough Time Ahead for Grocery Stocks and ETFs?).Amazon’s Top Line Promising, Bottom Line a Drag Moody’s went on to explain that Amazon is doing great on sales growth but not on profitability. The company reported earnings per share of 40 cents, way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 and down 77% year over year. Revenues climbed 25% year over year to $37.95 billion and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion.In comparison, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart beat our earnings and revenue estimates on both lines. Nordstrom raised the lower end of its earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 too. Investors’ unloved bet Kohl's Corporation KSS also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line by a nickel while revenues came in slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $6 million (read: Solid Q2 Revenue Beat Fails to Boost Retail ETFs).Amazon's Prime Membership Exaggerated by Analysts?Some market watchers estimate Amazon's Prime membership base as high as 85 million. But Moody's calculations show Prime membership somewhere around 50 million against Costco's paid membership of 47.6 million and total membership of 86.7 million as of the fiscal year ended August 2016, as per the source.Wal-Mart Not Amazon Has Upper Hand in Food Market Last but not the least, Moody’s noted that U.S. food sales total about $800 billion a year, of which Walmart takes about 25%. Kroger is responsible for about $130 billion while Albertson's accounts for about $60 billion and Costco about $50 billion. Moody’s agreed that Whole Foods provided Amazon with an important crucial brick-and-mortar presence, which should prove beneficial for the latter.  Moody’s sees that “even with Whole Foods in its basket, [Amazon’s] food sales still amount to less than $20 billion annually.""However, Moddy’s is bullish on Amazon Web Services or AWS, which constitutes a significant portion of the company's operating income. Amazon's cash cushion and excellent liquidity profile are also well liked by Moody’s.Traditional Retailers Cashing on Amazon Success Investors should note that traditional retailers are capitalizing on Amazon’s popularity lately. For example,Kohl’shas formed a partnership with Amazon under which the former will start selling Amazon devices, like Echo and Fire tablets, at 10 stores in Los Angeles and Chicago from October. Prior to this, in July, Sears SHLD entered into a deal to sell its Kenmore home appliances on Amazon.Inside the Stock’s Unimpressive ScoresAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a Value and Momentum Score of F. Only a Growth Score of A looks promising. The company’s Zacks Industry Rank is in the bottom 41%, at the time of writing.ETF Strategies Investors may be cautious on ETFs heavy on Amazon given the above-mentioned analysis. VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY  -  Free Report) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (FDIS  -  Free Report). AMZN holds the top spot in these funds with a double-digit exposure each.On the other hand, ETFs like First Trust Nasdaq Retail ETF (FTXD  -  Free Report), XRT, PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report) can be considered for gains. FTXD is low on Amazon while PMR, XLP and XRT do not have it in their top-10 holdings.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1203,KSS,"On Wednesday, shares of department store Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) are rallying, up about 4.7% in afternoon trading after the company announced a new partnership with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).Kohl’s will open 1,000-square feet Amazon areas in 10 of its stores, offering popular devices like the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Fire tablet. Called the Amazon Smart Home Experience, the new “store-in-store” concept will start appearing in Kohl’s locations in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas next month.Kohl’s joins fellow retailers Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) and Sears  who have chosen to collaborate with the online behemoth, in addition to tech company Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report). Best Buy is similarly creating in-store Amazon concepts, and Sears recently said it will sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa are collaborating in a new voice assistant alliance.“We are thrilled to offer a unique new way for customers to try out our lineup of Alexa-enabled Amazon devices, learn more about our smart home services from Amazon experts and then buy those items directly from Amazon — all within Kohl’s stores,” said Dave Zimmer, vice president of sales and marketing for Amazon Devices, in a statement.While this is clearly a smart move on Kohl’s part, especially if this turns into a broader rollout to the company’s roughly 1,160 stores, but it also benefits Amazon. Amazon has been opening a number of its own brick-and-mortar stores, mainly bookstores, but this partnership is way to sidestep those huge building costs; the company also completed its acquisition of Whole Foods last week, another retail space in which Amazon can sell its Echo devices.Amazon isn’t the first tech company Kohl’s has struck a deal with. Last year, it teamed with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) to create small shops within its stores. Kohl’s has suffered through six straight quarters of sales declines, but its focus on electronics—and surprisingly, activewear; earlier this year, the company began selling Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) product)—has helped the retailer stand out.Kohl’s sits at a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, and has lost almost 19% year-to-date.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector.

1204,KSS,"Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has been grappling with increasing competition and a general slowdown in consumer spending since the past quarters. Amid such a scenario, the company’s efforts to boost sales through e-Commerce development and its focus on outside brands proved to be a boon to investors and were well reflected in the impressive second quarter of fiscal 2017 results.We note that shares of the company have been gaining momentum since the past three months. Kohl's shares have increased 12.2% compared with the industry’s gain of 3.5%.Let’s now delve deeper into the factors that have been impacting the company’s performance.Initiatives to Improve Store Sales & Growing e-Commerce In an effort to boost store sales Kohl's has been focusing on offering more outside famous brands, which are popular, and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other gears in March 2017 was a great success and well received by customers. The company is also focusing on sales growth with both Nike and Adidas. In respect to its own private-label brands, it plans to continue with its best sellers such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9.Additionally, the company also remained on track with its store expansion. It plans to launch four small format stores in October 2017, adding to its existing fleet of eight small format stores that were opened in 2016. Kohl's e-Commerce platform witnessed sturdy growth over the last few years. Its e-Commerce sales have almost doubled since 2011 at a compound annual growth rate of almost 40% in the last five years. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, digital conversion improved at a double-digit rate on the back of better customer experiences on smartphone and smartphone applications. In fact, technology improvements in both the application as well as device and the omnichannel efforts are expected to have a significant positive impact on the customer experience. In order to better support online growth, the company has also been opening fulfillment centers.Strong Inventory Management & Innovation The company’s inventory reduction initiatives have been positively impacting merchandise margins and thereby its gross profit levels. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, inventory per store decreased 2%. Kohl's continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.Kohl's store development plans also incorporate optimizing and rightsizing store space to better serve customers and operate efficiently. The company has plans to lessen operations in half of its stores by the end of 2017. This would require the stores to balance its inventory and adjust fixtures.Kohl’s regularly introduces new brands in order to keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to its stores and website. Popular launches like Fit Bed under its active and wellness business, the Jumping Beans collection featuring Disney characters, IZOD branded menswear and the Juicy Couture brand for women and girls have been well received by consumers. Such efforts have also aided in strengthening the company’s brand portfolio.Headwinds Lurking in the Industry Although Kohl’s is focusing on improving its e-Commerce businesses to tap in the growing popularity of online shopping, its online business share is much lower than Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), which dominates the e-Commerce market space. The growing online business has also dented company’s store traffic as well as comps.In fact, the company’s comps have been declining since past few quarters. Lower consumer spending on apparel and accessories and competition from discount retailers has also impacted comps negatively. This signals that its turnaround initiative named “Greatness Agenda” is failing to deliver results.Greatness Agenda, which began in the first quarter of 2014, was designed to increase transactions per store and sales. Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015, the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually, thus posing a concern. Moreover, comps have declined consecutively in the last six quarters, including the second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Bottom Line Despite such industry headwinds, we expect that Kohl’s store expansion strategies, in-store inventory management initiatives and e-Commerce development efforts would continue yielding results.Kohl’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More?

1205,KSS,"The recent struggles of the retail industry have been well-documented. While several major indices continue to flirt with new highs, traditional retail stocks have been hammered by changing consumer trends and a worldwide shift to online shopping.The popularity of e-commerce is nothing new, but it feels like 2017 has been the year that the floor has finally fallen out from under those companies who have not transitioned. And with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) deal to buy Whole Foods  getting approved this week, the online shopping king has entered a whole new market.Of course, some retailers are faring better than others. Big-box behemoths like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) saw the writing on the wall years ago and invested heavily in their own digital platforms. Others, like Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Tiffany & Co (TIF  -  Free Report), have proven to operate more “Amazon-proof” businesses.However, plenty of the world’s great retail brands have been hammered by digital competition. The once-iconic Sears  is hanging on by a thread, and department stores like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) have also tanked.But who has had it the worst? Take a look at three of the ugliest stocks in the retail industry below!1.       Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report)Just last week, Dick’s posted second-quarter earnings of 96 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00. Management also significantly lowered its full-year outlook, guiding for earnings in the range of $2.80 - $3.00 per share—down from the previously announced $3.65 - $3.75 range.The report was the latest chapter in what has been an awful year for Dick’s. The stock tumbled to a 52-week low and is now down nearly 50% year-to-date. On top of this, we’ve now seen a whopping 13 negative revisions to its full-year and next-year earnings estimates, which have dragged the stock down to a Zacks Rank #5 (Sell). Dick’s will be further challenged by Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) decision to begin selling its products on Amazon—a move that only adds to the company’s competition. Looking ahead, profits are expected to slump by over 45% this quarter and 6% this fiscal year, and that regression is expected to continue into the next fiscal year as well. 2.       Ingles Markets (IMKTA  -  Free Report)In today’s retail landscape, it should come as no surprise that a regional supermarket chain like Ingles is struggling. As the staples of the grocery store become increasingly available online, it’s been tough enough for the industry’s giants to compete—let alone a company that doesn’t have the advantage of scale.Shares of Ingles have fallen more than 46% year-to-date, and the stock currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Earnings are expected to slump more than 12.3% this fiscal year, and the company’s cash flow has retracted nearly 1% already.On top of its questionable financial position right now, Ingles is the type of store that could be threatened the most by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods. The suburban supermarket can keep up with trendy organic grocers because it can traditionally offer lower prices, but that might change soon. 3.       Vitamin Shoppe (VSI  -  Free Report)Vitamin Shoppe shares have been steadily dropping for years now, but 2017 has been a particular rough period for the company. The nutrition supplements retailer just missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by over 40% in the latest quarter, extending its earnings-miss streak to three.The stock has now tumbled more than 75% year-to-date. Earnings are expected to slump more 66% this fiscal year, and sales are projected to tumble nearly 7%. That regression will continue next year, with earnings and sales expected to retract another 4% and 1%, respectively.   4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

1206,KSS,"Shares of several major U.S. department store chains plummeted on Thursday after Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), which often acts as the sector’s barometer, reported second-quarter earnings that showed further year-over-year declines.Other retailers reported their second-quarter results and have since seen their stock prices fall. Although Kohl’s KSS and Dillard’s DDS beat some Wall Street estimates, weak sales figures continued, which prompted investors to run in fear on Thursday morning.Macy'sMacy’s (M  -  Free Report) reported earnings $0.48 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45 a share. The company posted revenue of $5.55 billion, beating our Zacks estimate of $5.5 billion. Still, the revenue figure marked a 5.4% decline year-over-year.The nation's largest department store chain reported a 2.8% drop off in established store sales in the second quarter. The Cincinnati-based company now projects full-year earnings of $2.90 to $3.15 a share, and Macy’s expects sales will fall between 3.2% and 4.3%.”I’m encouraged by the second quarter and we’re on track for the year,” Macy’s CEO Jeffrey Gennette said on a conference call. “But I also know that we operate in an environment of intense and destructive competition, and that our customer has more shopping options than ever.”Macy’s stock was up slightly premarket. However, the initial positivity based on earnings and revenue beats has been countered with extreme pessimism in the once-powerful retail giant. Shares of Macy’s fell 9.18% in morning trading to reach a new 52-week intraday trading low of $20.85 per share.Kohl’sKohl’s (KSS) reported earnings of $1.24 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 and up 49% from the year-ago period. The company posted revenues of $4.14 billion, which just beat our Zacks estimate. Kohl’s revenues fell by 0.9% year-over-year.The department store chain’s comparable store sales were down 0.4%, which is up from the 2.7% decline the company experienced in the first quarter.”The improvement in our sales trend was driven entirely by an improvement in traffic,” Kohl’s CEO Kevin Mansell said on a conference call.Still, despite some signs of improvement, shares of Kohl’s fell 6.42% on Thursday. The stock has already traded hands over 12 million times, well above its 4.6 million average volume.Dillard's Dillard’s (DDS) reported a quarterly loss of $0.58 cents per share, which management attributed to markdowns. The company reported earnings of $0.35 a share in the year-ago period.The company posted $1.46 billion in revenue, which marked a 1.7% decline year-over-year, even though it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion.Dillard's merchandise sales dropped by 1% to roughly $1.39 billion. Comparable-store merchandise sales were also down 1% from the year-ago period.Shares of Dillard’s sank 14.64% on Thursday on the back of its less-than impressive second-quarter results.Other Department Stores Macy’s often has the power to swing the whole retail sector when it reports, as it showed last quarter. Now, on the back of the department and retail giant’s second-quarter earnings, other retail chains have felt the hit.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) stock plummeted 7.37% to hit a new 52-week intraday low of $33.49 per share.Shares of American Eagle (AEO  -  Free Report) dropped by 5.4% on Thursday, while Target (TGT  -  Free Report) fell 3.96%. Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) stock both dipped by roughly 2%. Shares of Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) sunk just under 1%.Retail sector EFTs also fell on Thursday. Shares of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) fell 2.39%, while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) dropped 5.49%.The Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), and PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) all fell marginally as well.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1207,KSS,"A big day for retail earnings reports today kicks off with department store major Macy’s ((M  -  Free Report)) ahead of the bell, as well as economic metrics hitting the tape at the Fed will be looking closely, specifically Initial Jobless Claims and July’s Producer Price Index (PPI). Let us begin.On the headline, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Macy’s beat earnings estimates by 2 cents to 48 cents per share. However, strip away debt repurchases, non-cash settlements and stock-based compensation and this result reduces to 38 cents per share. Revenues clearly came in ahead of expectations to $5.55 billion from $5.50 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate.Macy’s shares are up 2.5% following the earnings report, as the company has also reaffirmed full-year 2017 guidance for both sales and earnings, and plan no additional enhancements before the end of the year. Remember the retailing giant is in the processing of shuttering some stores nationwide, which is helping keep down costs as online retail continues its seep into brick-and-mortar institutions.Another department-store retailer, Kohl’s ((KSS  -  Free Report)), beat estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning: $1.24 per share beat the $1.19 we were looking for, and revenues of $4.144 billion topped the $4.138 billion expected. Year-over-year comps were down in the quarter 0.4%, though compare this to the -2.7% in Q1, and Kohl’s business looks to be picking up a bit sequentially.And Zacks Rank #3-rated Dillard’s ((DDS  -  Free Report)) posted a surprise loss in the quarter, swinging to -58 cents per share as opposed to the +19 cents expected. Sales came in slightly under expectations to $1.427 billion from the Zacks consensus estimate of $1.435 billion. Shares are tumbling more than 13% following the earnings release.Continuing the retail earnings narrative after today's close, we await results from Zacks Rank #2-rated Nordstrom ((JWN  -  Free Report)).Thursday Econ DataAs we see every Thursday morning, Initial Jobless Claims hit the tape ahead of the opening bell. Again we see sub-250K new claims: 244K last week is up from the slightly upwardly revised 241K the previous week. Continuing claims continued to dwindle further south of 2 million to 1.951 million; the prior week posted 1.967 million.And July PPI showed much weaker-than-expected results, swinging to a loss in the month to -0.1% — analysts had been looking for +0.2%. Ex-food & energy is still -0.1%. Year over year, PPI is 1.9% (1.8% ex-food & energy). These figures are all well off expectations; we had been looking for year-over-year PPI growth definitely over 2%. Trade was down 0.5%, Transportation -0.8%, Energy -0.3. All of this amounts to lower-than-expected inflation building on the enterprise side. Tomorrow brings the Consumer Price Index (CPI) results, so we’ll see how these numbers line up.These numbers, of course, help prognosticators understand when the next Fed rate hike will take place. Currently, chances of a September hike are extremely low compared to earlier this year, and numbers like today’s PPI will not change this. Even December — considered by many economists to be the most likely time for a rate hike in the medium-term, has also slipped to just under a 34% chance. Meaning we may see interest rates stay pat for the remainder of 2017; as long as inflation metrics continue to look weak, this is what we most likely will see.

1209,KSS,"Retailer Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) posted impressive second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Shares of the retailer moved up more than 2.5% in the pre-market trading.Kohl’s reported adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 by 4.2%. Earnings also grew 2% from the prior-year quarter owing to improved sales trend in all lines of business, strong inventory and expense management.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteSales and MarginsNet sales of $4.144 billion marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.138 billion. However, it dipped 0.9% from the prior-year quarter due to a challenging sales environment and lower comparable store sales (comps). This signals that the company’s strategic initiative Greatness Agenda is failing to deliver results. The initiative, which commenced in first-quarter 2014, was designed to increase transactions per store and sales. Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015, the quarterly growth rates were declining, thus posing a concern. Further, comps started declining since first-quarter fiscal 2016 and plummeted consecutively for the next six quarters, including the current one.Encouragingly, the 0.4% drop in comps in the second quarter was narrower than the preceding quarter’s decline of 2.7% and prior-year quarter’s decline of 1.8%, owing to increased traffic momentum witnessed in the second quarter. Though transactions for the quarter were lower than last year, they increased in the month of July, which also benefited the quarter.Gross margin declined only 6 basis points to 39.4% in the reported quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 0.3% to $983 million in the quarter.Other Financial DetailsAs of Jul 29, Kohl’s had $552 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.79 billion of long-term debt and $5.03 billion of shareholders’ equity. Cash flow from operations were $376 million, while capital expenditure were $399 million.On Aug 8, the Kohl's board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 55 cents per share, which will be paid on Sep 20, to shareholders of record as of Sep 6.Kohl’s ended the year with 1,154 Kohl's stores, 12 FILA Outlet stores, and four Off/Aisle clearance centers in 49 states.Our TakeWe note that Kohl’s has been struggling for the last few quarters to boost its sluggish top line. Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores. Kohl's and its competitors have struggling in an intensely competitive market from online retailers.Nevertheless, Kohl’s has been making continuous efforts to improve its base business. Lately, the company has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands it sells. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other gear in March was a great success and well-accepted among customers. It also helped to boost sales of the entire active apparel department in the first quarter despite decline in women's, children's and accessories units. Kohl's plans to start selling Clarks shoes for the back-to-school shopping season and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles. The company also plans to continue selling the best-selling of its private-label brands, such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9, in order to drive traffic.Kohl’s has also undertaken several initiatives to reduce its inventory to boost profits. During first-quarter fiscal 2017, the company made additional progress on its initiatives and as a result, inventory per store decreased 1%, while units per store were 5% lower. Lower inventory levels thus boosted earnings. The company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for the fiscal year 2017.We believe these efforts are well reflected in the share prices of the company. Notably, in the last three months, the stock has moved up 12.8% in comparison to the industry and the broader Retail and Wholesale sector. While the industry grew 6.0% in the last three months, the sector increased 2.9% in the said time frame.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksKohl’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the apparel industry include J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report). While J.C. Penny sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), other two stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1  Rank stocks here.While J.C.

1210,KSS,"The Q2 earnings picture for the retail sector is among the weakest this reporting cycle with results tracking below past quarters and leading to 0.5% negative price performance for the broad sector.Total earnings from 90.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are down 0.8% on 4.8% higher revenues with 77.4% of the companies beating on earnings and 80.6% exceeding top-line estimates. While earnings growth rate is unimpressive, the proportion of retailers beating revenue estimates is the third highest of all 16 Zacks sectors, behind only the conglomerates (83.3%) and technology (85.2%).Positive earnings reports from Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) offset some negativity of weak results from department stores like J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s KSS.Let’s dig into the details of the earnings releases:Earnings Sending Stocks HigherBig-box retailer, Target, emerged as the real champion in the Q2 earnings season as the stock surged as much as 4.9% following robust second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on August 18. The company topped our estimates by three cents for earnings and by $147 million for revenues. It expects earnings per share in the range of 75-95 for the ongoing quarter and raised its outlook to $4.34-$4.54 from $3.80-$4.20 for the fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was 78 cents for the third quarter and $4.42 for fiscal 2017 (read: Will Big-Box Retailers Push Up Retail ETFs in Q2 Earnings?).Specialty retailer, Nordstrom, rose as much as 2.5% following second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by three cents and for revenues by $61 million. The company raised its lower end of its earnings per share guidance to $2.52-$3.00 from $2.75-$3.00 for fiscal 2017.The DampenersOne of the leading department store retailers, J.C. Penney, dampened investors’ mood as its share price plunged 19.9% following the earnings announcement on August 11. The company posted loss per share of 9 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents. However, revenue came in higher than our estimate by $92 million. For fiscal 2017, the company continued to expect earnings per share in the range of 40-65 cents (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).The second-largest department store retailer, Macy’s tanked 10.8% following the earnings announcement on August 10, marking the biggest daily loss since January 5. Though the retailer beat our estimates for earnings by three cents and for revenues by $51 million, it reported drop in same-store sales, sparking concerns on the prospect of its turnaround before the crucial holiday season. For fiscal 2017, it continues to project sales decline of 3.2-4.3% and earnings per share in the range of $2.90-$3.15.One of the leading departmental stores Kohl’s also had its worst day since January 8, falling 5.8% posting a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales on August 10. Earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel and revenues came in slightly higher than our estimate by $6 million.Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, beat on second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings by three cents and on revenues by $267 million. For fiscal 2017, Home Depot raised the earnings per share guidance to $7.29 from $7.15, which represents 13% increase year over year.

1212,KSS,"The second-quarter earnings season is nearing its end. With results from a large chunk of S&P 500 members already on the board, we have only 16% of members that are yet to come up with results for the quarter. At this time, the sector that generally steals the show is Retail-Wholesale, with a considerable chuck of reports yet to come out. Incidentally, our focus in the article will also be upon Retail stocks that are slated to report earnings on Aug 10.Q2 Earnings ScorecardPer the Earnings Preview dated Aug 4, about 84% of the S&P 500 members have reported results so far, together representing 86.7% of the Index’s total market capitalization. Of the 420 S&P 500 members that reported their quarterly numbers, approximately 74.3% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 68.3% beat top-line expectations. Total earnings for these companies were up 11.6%, on 5.6% revenue growth.The results so far reflect that the proportion of companies beating earnings and revenue estimates is above the historical periods. While growth pace of revenue and earnings is lower than what we had seen in the first quarter, it exhibits an improvement from other periods.Coming to expectations, S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings growth of 10% year over year, with a 5.1% jump in revenues. Thus, the overall picture looks favorable for this reporting cycle.A Look at Retail SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which 13 are estimated to witness year-over-year earnings growth in the second quarter. As stated earlier, we are yet to see a sizable chunk of earnings to be released from retailers. Per the latest report, about 41.5% of the S&P 500 companies in the Retail-Wholesale sector have reported their results, wherein 64.7% companies delivered an earnings beat, while 70.6% surpassed revenue estimates. Though earnings of these companies dipped 2.3%, revenues improved 8%.The Retail-Wholesale Staples sector is currently ranked among the Bottom 13% (14 of 16) of all Zacks sectors. A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to bear the brunt of the current challenging retail environment due to sluggish mall traffic, volatile consumer spending and increased competition from online players. Further, these retailers are heavily investing in eCommerce and omni-channel functionalities, which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term.However, we note that the Retail-Wholesale sector has grown 17% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 market’s jump of 10.6%.Well our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.What Awaits JWN, M, KSS in Q2?So, let’s see what awaits the following Retail stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Aug 10.Seattle, WA-based Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.28% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.This indicates that the leading fashion specialty retailer offering high-quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for men, women and kids is likely to deliver a beat in second-quarter fiscal 2017. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate of 63 cents a share is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents.Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteMoreover, the company registered an average positive earnings surprise of 41% in the trailing four quarters, and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6%. Nordstrom’s solid past performance reflects its robust brand image, cost-savings initiatives and impressive omni-channel efforts. The company is undertaking several initiatives to keep pace with customers’ shift to online shopping. Evidently, Nordstrom’s online sales formed nearly 24% of the company’s business in first-quarter fiscal 2017. Further, the company is on track to deliver upon its long-term sales target of $20 billion by 2020.  Thus, it seems like the company is set to maintain its splendid earnings surprise trend this time as well.

1214,KSS,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) is set to report the second quarter of fiscal 2017 results on Aug 10 before the market opens. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether the departmental store will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported quarter. We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 21.3%. In fact, earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of past 10 quarters.Kohl’s forms part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, we note that the above mentioned sector’s earnings growth looks disappointing. Out of the 41.5% S&P 500 companies that have reported in the sector as of Aug 4, we see that total earnings of these companies have declined 2.3% on a year-over-year basis (64.7% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue increased 8.0% (70.6% beat top-line expectations).Let’s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has increased 1.7% over the last seven days and is currently pegged at $1.17 per share, down 4.4% from $1.22 per share delivered in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4.1 billion, down 1.7% from the prior-year period.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kohl’s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kohl’s has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.17 per share. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Factors Influencing the QuarterKohl’s has been struggling with weak comps and a difficult retail sales scenario for the last few quarters. The company’s strategic initiative, ‘Greatness Agenda’, which was designed to increase transactions per store and sales, is also failing to deliver positive results. Though the plan, which commenced in the first quarter of 2014, has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015, the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually but then started declining since the first quarter of fiscal 2016, posing a concern. We note that comps plummeted consecutively in the last five quarters. The company is also witnessing lower spending on apparel and accessories, dwindling store traffic, margin pressure and competition from discount retailers, which are hurting sales at department stores.Nevertheless, Kohl’s has been making continuous efforts to improve its base business. Lately, the company has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands it sells. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other gear in March was a great success and was very well-accepted among customers. It also helped to boost sales of the entire active apparel department in the first quarter despite decline in women's, children's and accessories units. Kohl's plans to start selling Clarks shoes for the back-to-school shopping season and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles. The company also plans to continue selling the best-selling of its private-label brands, such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9, in order to drive traffic.Kohl’s has also undertaken several initiatives to reduce its inventory to boost profits. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the company made additional progress on its initiatives and as a result, inventory per store decreased 1%, while units per store were 5% lower. Lower inventory levels thus boost its earnings. The company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for the fiscal year 2017.We believe these efforts are well reflected in the share prices of the company. Notably, in the last three months, the stock has moved up 7.3% in comparison to the industry and the broader sector. While the industry declined 4.7% in the last three months, the sector increased 3.0% in the said time frame.Stocks with Favorable CombinationStocks in the broader retail sector carrying both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank, and therefore worth considering include:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (SBH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.13% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Whole Foods Market Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.35% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.  Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1215,KSS,"Shares of some of the world’s biggest retail companies—including Macy’s, Walmart, and Target—jumped on Tuesday, marking a rare day of positive trading for this struggling sector.Indeed, the retail space was up nearly across the board on Tuesday. Shares of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) were up 2.44%, while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) skyrocketed 7.41%.The Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), and PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) were all up marginally.Tuesday’s retail ETF gains can be attributed to gains from some retail giants, most of which have seen their shares dip in the last year amid a shifting shopping climate.Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s KSS all jumped over 2% on Tuesday. Nordstrom (JWN) rose 2.96%, and Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) climbed 3.72%. The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), up 4.01%, was one of Tuesday’s biggest retail movers.Also among the day’s top movers was Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report), a department store chain which gained more than 7% on Tuesday after a report surfaced that suggested the stock appears to be heading for an “infinity squeeze” similar to Volkswagen’s now-legendary 2008 short squeeze (read more: Dillard's Stock Soars on Report of Imminent ""Infinity Squeeze"").Still, despite today’s upward movement, talk of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) apparent takeover of the entire retail world aren’t likely to stop just yet.It is true that the industry has been shaken and most likely altered forever by Jeff Bezos’ behemoth. The online retail giant dove headfirst into almost every sector imaginable, and has transformed retail into a more on-demand style world, where everything from books to snacks can be delivered to users in a few hours.But one retail player’s upward movement on Tuesday could be a sign of hope for the sector that many have all but written off. Barnes & Noble  posted a monster day, up over 15%, on the back of news that activist investors are set to push for a sale.At first glance that might seem like another sign that retail is struggling, but the firm is convinced that brick-and-mortar still has a place in the retail world. Barnes & Noble’s activist investors have faith that brick-and-mortar isn’t dead—it just needs to be revamped.And today’s retail movement might signal that some share this glimmer of hope.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017  From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

1216,KSS,"Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has recently announced plans to expand the capabilities of its e-Commerce network and also invest in store base by opening four new small format stores. The company is also focused on optimizing and rightsizing store space across a number of Kohl's outlets.Store and Facility Development Plans Kohl's plans to commence shipping operations of it’s recently opened fifth e-Commerce fulfillment center in Plainfield, IN by the end of this month. The centre would mainly cater to filing, processing and shipping of orders from its website, Kohls.com. The 937,000 square feet facility is well equipped with advanced technology for maximizing throughput and productivity.Additionally, the company plans to launch four small format stores in October 2017, adding to its existing fleet of eight small format stores that were opened in 2016. The new stores would be located at North Smithfield, RI; Blue Ash, OH; East Windsor, NJ and Montebello, CA. The new stores would be close to 35,000 square feet in size.Owing to their small size, these stores will be flexible and can easily be adapted for localized merchandise. Moreover, these stores will have kiosks for online shopping from Kohl's website and would also serve as pick up locations for online purchases.Kohl's store development plans also incorporate optimizing and rightsizing store space to better serve customers and also operate in a more efficient manner. The company has plans to lessen operations in half of its stores by the end of 2017. This would require the stores to balance its inventory and adjust fixtures.In this respect, the company has already optimized store space in close to 300 stores to include new layouts, making them operationally smaller. Rightsizing initiatives also include opening a single-level 55,000 square feet store in Greenfield, WI, relocating the same from its existing two-level 85,000 square feet store located nearby at Southridge Mall.Initiatives to Improve Sales Kohl's has also been undertaking a number of initiatives to attract more shoppers to its stores and improve sales. Lately, the company has started offering famous brands from outside the United States and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands it sells. Kohl’s has started selling Under Armour products, as well as Clarks shoes and is looking for other brands to add to its store aisles.The company also plans to continue its best-selling private-label brands such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9 that had delivered strong sales in the recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Kohl’s has also been undertaking several initiatives to reduce its inventory and improve merchandise margins that benefited the company’s second-quarter earnings.Lower Comps Posing Concern Despite such efforts to boost sales and store traffic, the company’s comps have been declining over the past few quarters. Lower spending on apparel and accessories, competition from discount retailers and cautious consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores. This signals that its turnaround initiative named “Greatness Agenda,” which began in 2014, is failing to deliver results.The initiative was designed to increase transactions per store and sales. Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015, the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually, thus posing a concern. Moreover, comps have now declined consecutively in the last six quarters, including the recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.These headwinds are well reflected in the company’s share price performance. The stock has declined 15.1% in the past year, in comparison to the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, which grew 10.6%.Given the industry-wide challenges impacting Kohl's comps growth, investors need to wait and see whether its ongoing store expansion and rightsizing efforts prove to be effective.Kohl's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Do Retail Stocks Interest You?

1217,KSS,"Shares of women’s fashion boutique Francesca's FRAN plummeted to a new 52-week low on Monday after the struggling company announced the departure of a top executive.The boutique chain announced that its chief merchandising officer and executive vice president, Laurie Hummel, who previously held leadership positions at Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Macy's (M  -  Free Report), is set to leave the company after less than two years at Francesca's.It is unclear at this point if Hummel was relieved of her duties or if she stepped away, but Francesca's now finds itself in flux during a tumultuous time for retail.“We have a lot of talent in our merchandising team and are confident in their ability to execute our strategy as we search for a new Chief Merchant,” Francesca's President and CEO Steve Lawrence said in a statement. “During this period, the team will report directly to me. We wish Laurie well in her future endeavors.” Francesca's also released some preliminary results for the company’s upcoming second-quarter earnings report. The Houston-based retailer expects its quarterly comparable store sales to fall by 3% from the year-ago period. Francesca's also projects to report second-quarter earnings of $0.20 per share, which surpassed the company’s previous expectations.“That said, we note that back-to-school has been off to a very challenging start and our comparable sales have further decelerated from July,” Lawrence continued. “We will provide additional detail on our second quarter performance, as well as discuss our third quarter and full year outlook, on our upcoming earnings call.”Shares of Francesca's plummeted by over 10% on Monday morning to touch a new 52-week low of $6.71 a share. The stock now hovers down around 7% through mid-afternoon trading.Francesca's is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but scored an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system, giving it an overall VGM grade of an “A.” The fashion retail company is set to report its second-quarter results on September 6.Retail Sector Francesca's is a small company with a market cap of roughly $275 million, so even though its shares have traded hands over four times above its average volume on Monday, it isn’t likely to drag the whole retail sector down with it. But the fact that the company cited poor back to school sales as a reason for its projected revenue decline might frighten some retail investors.Shares of fellow fashion-focused retailers, such as American Eagle (AEO  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), and The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) all fell on Monday. American Eagle took the biggest hit, as its shares dipped by 3.83%, also touching a new 52-week low.Shares of retail sector ETFs also fell on Monday. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), the Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), and the PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) all dropped marginally.
