24,LNC,"Though the Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate steady last month, it's widely expected to start unwinding its balance sheet in September.XWhen the Fed stops buying Treasuries and mortgage backed securities, the increased supply could send prices down and drive yields up, leading to higher interest rates.That means investors will again focus on which sectors of the stock market are most likely to outperform as rates climb. For instance, banks and other financials, industrials and consumer discretionary are areas that tend to benefit from higher rates.A couple of new (or fairly new) kids on the exchange traded fund block aim to offer outperformance with stocks in a rising rate environment. One of the newest is ProShares Equities for Rising Rates (EQRR), which launched July 25.""EQRR is for investors who expect rising interest rates and want to outperform traditional large-cap indexes as rates go up,"" Michael Sapir, co-founder and CEO of ProShare Advisors, said in a statement. ""EQRR takes those sectors most positively correlated with interest rates, then within those sectors invests in the companies that have tended to outperform during periods of rising rates.""The fund, which tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Large Cap Equities for Rising Rates Index, has attracted $14.3 million in assets. The biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 21 were financials at 30%, energy 24%, materials 18% and industrials 16%. Information technology accounted for 12% of assets.Its top holdings included E-Trade Financial (ETFC), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Lincoln National (LNC) and Bank of America (BAC). The top 10 stocks, which account for about 30% of assets, are all banks or insurers.EQRR carries a 0.35% expense ratio.Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR), set to mark its anniversary Sept. 12, has gathered $152.5 million.The fund, which tracks the Fidelity Dividend Index for Rising Rates, invests in large and midcap companies that are expected to keep paying and growing their dividends. The stocks must also have a positive correlation of returns to rising 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Boston-based Geode Capital Management serves as subadvisor for the fund.Technology led FDRR's sector weights at nearly 22%, followed by a 14% weighting in health care, 11.5% consumer cyclical and 10% in financial services as of Aug. 18, according to Morningstar Inc. It had modest exposure to sectors such as real estate and utilities, which pay big dividends, but can be highly sensitive to increasing interest rates.Six of the fund's top 10 holdings as of Aug. 21 were Dow Jones industrial average components: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Merck (MRK) and Exxon Mobil (XOM). The top 10 comprised nearly a quarter of total assets.The ETF has slightly underperformed the broader market this year with a 7.4% return vs. the S&P 500's 10% gain through Aug. 21. FDRR's expense ratio is 0.29%.Keep in mind that with FDRR still under a year old and EQRR about to mark its first month, there isn't a proven yet track record available.The next Fed monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Sept. 19 and 20. The odds of a rate hike in December are at 40%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.RELATED:Miss Thursday's Breakouts? 2 Fresh Ideas As Market Hits HighsNext-Gen ETFs For Rising Rates Offer High Yields And Low Volatility

26,LNC,"Financial stocks have gotten a lift since President Trump on Feb. 3 ordered a delay of the Labor Department's fiduciary rule. Banks, asset managers and insurance providers have been concerned about the rule, which requires financial advisors to recommend retirement products best suited to clients. The rule is likely to add extra costs, they say, which may make it harder…
"
27,LNC,"Now that President Trump has ordered a delay of the Labor Department's controversial new fiduciary rule, which industry groups potentially stand to gain the most?The rule, which is slated to take effect April 10, requires financial advisors and brokers to recommend investments in the best interests of clients instead of those merely suitable. That would force advisors and brokers to put clients' interest ahead of their own profit.Financial firms have been deeply concerned about the potential effects of the new rule since it was approved last year. They fear it will hike advisory costs, making it less affordable for lower-income clients. That's why the delay has sharply boosted major banks and investment brokers.As of Thursday, 10 financial-related industry groups made the top 20 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD. Life insurance, investment bankers and brokers, and money center banks have seen big recent gains.The life insurance group includes highly rated stocks such as Primerica (PRI), which bears a 98 Composite Rating but is extended from a 73.15 flat-base buy point. The Duluth, Ga.-based insurer is a Leaderboard member. Lincoln National (LNC), with a 91 Composite, is near the top of its buy range from a 69.69 flat-base entry. New issue Athene Holdings (ATH) (95) is extended from a 48.82 buy point of a flat base. Shares have rallied nearly 30% from a 40 offering price at the Dec. 9 debut.The investment bank group includes asset managers such as Raymond James Financial (RJF), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Piper Jaffray (PJC). Raymond James is trading near all-time highs as shares ride the 50-day moving average higher. The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based company shares the top Composite Rating, 99, in the 30-stock group.The money center banks group, which includes Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS),  jumped 3% Feb. 3 on the news of the delay. The group remains near highs, following a 24% rally from its close on Nov. 8, election day, to its Jan. 13 peak.All the above stocks (except Athene) have posted 28% or better gains since Trump was elected Nov. 8, amid views that he would loosen regulation in the financial market.IBD'S TAKE: Primerica and Lincoln National are among financial and insurance stocks enjoying a ""Trump Bump."" Find out who some others are in this recent Sector Leaders article.Morgan Stanley owns the top Composite, 98, in the group. Shares are far extended from a 32.47 cup-with-handle buy point first cleared in October. The stock triggered the 20% to 25% profit-taking rule in November and has been making new highs. Bank of America's 95 Composite is second best in the group. Shares of the Charlotte, N.C.-based banking giant have bounced off the 50-day line after consolidating sideways the past two months. They tripped the profit-taking rule in late November.Goldman Sachs (also 95), which entered the profit-taking zone in mid-November, also has found support at its 50-day moving average. It's now extended from a bounce off the line near 232.Proponents of Trump's delay action include the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade organization. ""ICI supports a delay in implementation of the current DOL fiduciary rule,"" ICI President and CEO Paul Schott Stevens said in a statement. ""The Administration should use this time to address flaws in the rule and pursue a harmonized standard across the retail and retirement marketplace, coordinating with the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure investors' best interests are paramount.""The Financial Planning Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, issued a statement saying it ""strongly opposes"" Trump's delay: ""By issuing this memorandum, the President is directing the Department of Labor to produce an outcome that will likely lead to either a complete gutting of this thoroughly vetted consumer protection or lead to its outright demise. Either one is a bad outcome for American retirement savers.""RELATED:Trump Orders Delay Of Labor Department Fiduciary RuleJPMorgan, Charles Schwab, Goldman Jump On Trump's Regulatory Rollback

Power, said, “Schwab has developed an overall client experience that is closely aligned with the evolving priorities of today’s full-service investor.” The next most popular firms, in order, were Edward Jones, Fidelity Investments and UBS (UBS) Financial Services.At the bottom of the list are LPL Financial (LPLA), PNC (PNC) Wealth Management, Lincoln (LNC) Financial Network and, lowest of all, Voya Financial (VOYA).The financial services industry as a whole ranks below most other industries in “From Trust to Loyalty: A Global Survey of What Investors Want in 2016.” The survey comes from the CFA Institute, which calls itself “a global association of investment professionals.”The technology world ranks at the top; 77% of the survey’s respondents (3,312 retail investors from 10 countries and 502 institutional investors from six countries) say that they trust the tech industry “to do what is right.” In second place (68%) comes the food and beverage industry, followed by brewing and spirits (65%), pharmaceuticals (64%), banks (63%) and telecommunications, energy and consumer packaged goods (62% each).Financial services ranked under all of those industries: 61% of retail investors and 57% of institutional investors said that they trusted the industry.The survey’s other industries were automotive (60%), entertainment (55%) and, coming in dead last, media (47%).The level of trust varied from country to country, the CFA Institute reported. In India, 90% of the survey respondents said that they trust the financial services industry. Just below India was China (89%). From there, the level of trust fell hard: only 64% in Canada and Hong Kong, 63% in Singapore, 55% in France, 54% in the United States, 50% in Australia, 44% in the U.K. and 40% in Germany.

33,LNC,"A favorable operating environment has set the stage for insurers to perform well through the second half of 2018. Though macro factors like interest rate hike, trade tariffs, rise in oil prices and inflation rate should continue to render volatility in markets and sectors, the insurance industry is expected to push limits, banking on inherent strength cushioned by a beneficial operating environment.Driving ForcesStrengthening of the U.S. economy has propelled the Federal Reserve raise rate from its near-zero level. In its June meeting, Federal funds rate was projected at 2.4% for 2018. Though insurers have lowered their exposure to rate sensitive instrument, yet given the accelerated pace of rate hikes, they stand to benefit.Employment statistics instill optimism as a solid labor market reflecting lower unemployment level and higher wages increases the disposable income, thus widening scope for more policy writings. Fed officials anticipate a 3.8% unemployment rate while GDP is expected to grow 2.7% in 2018.Also, increased frequency of catastrophe events has impelled an increase in coverage policies.The tax rate overhaul, amounting to $1.5-trillion lower tax burden, slashed the rate to 21% from 35%. A lower tax incidence broadens chances of effective capital deployment as well as margin expansion. Insures have already started to see benefits of this lower tax incidence.  The first half of 2018 escaped the brutal blows of nature but given the unprecedented nature of catastrophes, none is sure what lies ahead. The second half of 2017 witnessed the merciless wrath of nature turning the year into the costliest phase in terms of catastrophe loss. While Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc in August, Irma and Maria devastated parts of the United States in September. And further adding to the woes, were two consecutive earthquakes in Mexico in September. Also, there were California wildfires during October affecting many.Catastrophic occurrences weigh on insurers’ underwriting profitability. Nonetheless, price hikes by the industry players following a series of cat events, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and taking reinsurance covers should help insurers withstand the deficits.While greater demand for insurance (particularly with the emergence of new insurable risks including cyber threats) will keep the business of P&C insurers afloat, their willingness to negotiate on policy terms and ample capital strength will intensify the competition for grabbing a sizeable market share in the quarters ahead.Given an all-time high capital level, mergers and acquisitions are arresting attention of late. While these should help curb competition, consolidations should enhance insurers’ portfolio.Robust reserves, all-time high capital level, focus to boost the top line while improving the bottom line should help insurers emerge winners going ahead.Stocks Trading CheapYear to date, the insurance industry has declined 6.9% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 2.6%.However, given a favorable operating backdrop and solid fundamentals of the industry, it seems apt to add insurance stocks to investors’ portfolio now as the valuation looks cheap now. Price-to-book ratio (P/BV), the most appropriate multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, is 2.15, lower than the S&P 500 index’s 3.85 as well as the Finance sector’s reading of 2.47.Stocks to Add to PortfolioWith the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we shortlisted an array of insurance stocks with a bullish Zacks Rank supported by upward estimate revisions over the last 60 days and an impressive Value Score of A or B. Value Score helps identify companies that are undervalued. This deviation from their fair value is what creates an exceptional upside opportunity.

34,LNC,"Lincoln National Corp.’s (LNC  -  Free Report) favorable operating performance for the past many quarters is backed by its powerful retail franchise, which brings together a comprehensive and expanding product portfolio with distribution breadth.Though the stock has lost 9% in a year’s time compared with the industry’s decline of 6%, we expect progress on its fundamentals to help it bounce back.Here are some of the reasons to own the stock:Expanding Annuities Business: Annuities, which constitute nearly 30% of the company’s revenues, are generating strong sales driven by its strategy of expanding the product portfolio and leveraging distribution strength. Moreover, the improved regulatory environment should also help the business going forward.Strong Life Insurance Business: Life Insurance business generated nearly 46% of the company’s revenues in 2017. Revenues from this business have been growing consistently since 2009 (only declining 2015). However, the segment’s bottom line has been volatile.To improve its profitability and shield from long-term claims variability, the company has been making changes in its sales mix to emphasize the sale of Life products without long-term guarantees. This has improved the risk profile of the business.In Life Insurance, new business returns are strong and upcoming product enhancements will further boost its sales diversification and profitable growth. This segment is thus expected to grow in the coming quarters.Resurging Group Insurance Business: The company’s Group Protection segment, which was challenged earlier, has been recovering with an improvement in sales in 2016 and 2017. The company recently acquired Liberty Group’s business. This acquisition would position the company as a Group Benefits market leader by enhancing Large Case presence and Disability expertise, complementing current markets with limited sales overlap. Going forward, the company expects this transaction to accelerate the already-strong positive momentum in the Group business.Axing of Less Profitable Businesses: Alongside investing in profitable businesses, the company has exited non-core and less profitable ones (including asset management, media businesses and those in the U.K.). These strategic initiatives have helped the company to evolve as a much stronger entity over the years.Attractive Valuation: Moreover, this Zacks Ranked #2 (Buy) stock is significantly undervalued and is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 7, which compares with the industry P/E ratio of 9.6. Given that the stock is trading at low valuation levels, it provides an attractive investment opportunity. Also, the stock carries an impressive Value Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther stocks from the insurance industry are GWG Holdings, Inc. (GWGH  -  Free Report) American Equity Investment Life Holding Co. (AEL  -  Free Report) and Athene Holdings Ltd. (ATH  -  Free Report). While GWG Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), the other two stocks sport the same Zacks Rank as Lincoln National.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.GWG Holdings purchases life insurance policies in the secondary market in the United States.

37,LNC,"Lincoln National Corp. (LNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 31, after market close.We expect to see an increase in total annuity sales, driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace. The company has gained market share in 2017, benefiting from products that provide more investment choices and flexibility, along with fee-based compensation options. New product launches (Max 6 Select, a living benefit rider, introduced late in the second quarter, has led to increased sales and is continuing to gain traction) and upgrades to their existing ones, will further aid annuity sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from operation for the segment is $264 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 9.1%.Other Developments in Q4  Increased Top Line From Life Insurance Unit: Lincoln National’s life insurance business is expected to see top-line growth from a broad product portfolio and an industry-leading distribution network. The company has changed in its sales mix to fight the low interest rate environment. Its strategic focus is to decrease the portion of sales from products with long-term guarantees and increase the share of earnings coming from the mortality and morbidity business lines.Higher Contribution in Group Protection Unit: The company’s Group Protection segment that was challenged in the recent past is now recovering. Sales in 2016 were up nearly 18% and 14% in the first nine months of 2017. This strong sales growth indicates the resilience of its distribution channel.The company’s pricing remains disciplined and its outlook for sales growth is aligned with its long-term target of mid single-digit increases. We expect sales growth and improving persistency to contribute to fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from operation for the segment is $26 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 62.5%.Strong Performance in Retirement Plan Service: This segment is expected to show growth in deposits, net flows and earnings. This will be driven by higher sales growth from digital innovations and product enhancements, that are focused on simple and transparent pricing, improved customer service and strong retention.Increased Expenses: The company has undertaken digital initiatives to improve the customer experience. These efforts will result in significant cost savings over time as well as potential revenue enhancements, but will cause the company to incur digitization expense of roughly $10 million a quarter in 2017.Balance Sheet Strength and Capital Management: Its disciplined capital management by way of share buyback will drive the bottom line. Lincoln National’s balance sheet strength and solid capital generation, which enables it to buy back shares, will provide an extra support to the bottom line.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of trailing four quarters with an average beat of 9.83%.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lincoln National is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Lincoln National has an Earning ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lincoln National carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. The company’s 0.00% ESP thus leaves the case inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or #5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Worth ConsideringHere are some companies worth considering as our model shows that these possess the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:  Amerisafe Inc.

Let’s put Lincoln National Corporation (LNC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Lincoln National has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.2, as you can see below:This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 21.5. If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock, the current level puts Lincoln National’s current PE among its highs over the past five years. This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels. Further, the stock’s PE compares vastly favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 12.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Lincoln National has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 10.1 – which is faintly lower than the current level. So it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Lincoln National stock in the near term too.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Lincoln National has a P/S ratio of about 1.3. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now.LNC is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Lincoln National currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Lincoln National a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Lincoln National is just 1.2, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.7. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, LNC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles. What About the Stock Overall?Though Lincoln National might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of B. This gives LNC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately. The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the next year estimate has seen four upward revisions and none downward revision in the same time period.As a result, the current year consensus estimate has inched up 2.9% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has increased 1.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Lincoln National Corporation Price and Consensus Lincoln National Corporation Price and Consensus | Lincoln National Corporation QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineLincoln National is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. With a formidable industry rank (among the Top 21% out of more than 250 industries) and strong Zacks Rank, Lincoln National looks like a strong value contender. In fact, over the past one year, its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

40,LNC,"With 2017 at its threshold, investors have many reasons to cheer for. The economic backdrop has improved with GDP rising, improving employment scenario and major indices gaining year to date. While the S&P 500 has rallied 20.3%, Nasdaq has gained 12.3%.Gross domestic product (GDP) rose 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017, a nice pick up from 3.1% in the second quarter. The Fed now estimates GDP to grow at 2.5% in both 2017 and 2018, reflecting an increase of 2.4% for 2017 and 2.1% for 2018, projected earlier. The Fed officials expect the unemployment rate to grow at 4.1% for 2017 while the same is likely to decline to 3.9% in 2018 and 2019.The Fed has kept its promise of three rate hikes this year, reflecting President Donald Trump’s bias for higher interest rates and the Fed’s confidence in the progressing U.S. economy. The interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50% after hikes in March, June and December. The outgoing Fed chairperson Janet Yellen reiterated the expectation to raise rates thrice in 2018 and twice in 2019.Insurers are major beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. Life insurers are sensitive to interest rates. They have suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. To withstand the unfavorable environment, they have gradually shifted to riskier asset like equities only to fetch in more returns from the policyholders’ claims and even lowered exposure to interest-sensitive product lines. Life insurers have redesigned and re-priced products, which should help them write higher premiums.Stronger corporate bonds and bettering real estate market might aid to curtail the credit-related investment losses. Also, the improving economy and higher inflation induced bonds look to yield good returns. In fact, a progressing economy indicates more disposable income with people opting for more insurance coverages.The Life Insurance industry is currently ranked at #54 (out of 265 Zacks Industry), representing the top 20% of the Zacks Industry Rank. The industry has outperformed the S&P 500 in a year by registering a 24.5% rally so far this year, thereby outperforming the elite index.Assured Value PicksWe have zeroed in on five undervalued stocks that investors might add to their portfolio with the help of our Zacks Stock Screener. Value investing is for those looking to buy stocks with the value lower than the intrinsic one. Hence, these investors target stocks with a low price-to-book (P/B) ratio or with high dividend yields. P/B ratio is the best multiple for valuing insurers owing to their unpredictable financial results.We thus refine our search using the Value Score of A or B and a bullish Zacks Rank. Buy-rated stocks with a Value Score of A or B are best investment bets. These have also witnessed upward estimate revisions over the last 60 days supporting the favorable Zacks Rank.Radnor, PA-based Lincoln National Corp.

41,LNC,"Thanks to Trump’s pro-growth economic policies aimed at accelerating economic improvement, reducing regulation, increasing spending, slashing taxes, and boosting jobs and corporate profits, the U.S. stock market is in the midst of the second largest bull run this year. In fact, the major indices hit a series of fresh highs early this week on optimism surrounding the biggest tax overhaul in decades with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones gaining about 0.6% and 2%, respectively, so far this month.Santa to Bring a Bag Full of Tax Benefits The tax reform cuts corporate tax rates to 21% from 35%, lowers individual tax rates and allows companies to bring offshore cash back home at reduced rates. A massive $1.4-trillion tax cut will create an economic surge, boosting job growth and reflation trade. It will further accelerate earnings, leading to increased dividend and buyback activities and paving the way for increased mergers and acquisitions (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks Set to Explode Higher on Tax Cuts).After gaining approval from the Congress, the tax bill is now on its way to the White House for President Donald Trump’s signature, which is expected this week. It would be the key catalyst to stocks higher going forward. This coupled with the Santa Claus rally have turned the market super bullish for the last six trading days left this year.A Santa Claus rally refers to the increase in stock prices in the final week of the calendar year (i.e. between Christmas and New Year’s Day) that extends into the first two days of the New Year. According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Santa Claus rally has yielded average cumulative returns of 1.4% in 34 of the past 45 holiday seasons over the seven-day period since 1969.This is especially true as year-end seasonal factors such as holiday optimism, tax-related affairs, investment of Christmas bonuses, mutual fund manager window dressing, and the “January effect” will push stocks higher. This makes December the best-performing month for the stocks.Further, strong corporate earnings and accelerating economic growth continued to fuel growth. Earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be up 11.7% in 2018, with the growth pace expected to double due to the tax legislation. Meanwhile, the economy expanded at the fastest clip in three years in best back-to-back quarters with at least 3% GDP growth and unemployment at the lowest level of 4.1% since December 2000. Americans are highly optimistic about the economy with consumer confidence climbing to the highest level in 17 years (read: Top-Ranked Growth ETFs at New Highs to Tap for 2018).While most of the ETFs and stocks will see a nice boost, we have highlighted those that are expected to outperform in the seven-day period and are intriguing choices for a short spell. Notably, high beta and high momentum products are expected to lead the market in the weeks ahead. This is because high beta funds experience larger gains than the broader market counterparts in a bullish market.

44,LNC,"The first-quarter earnings season has crossed halfway mark with already 267 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, the beat ratio is impressive with 76.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and a 73.8%, outperforming on the top-line front, thereby bearing evidence to a solid start. Combining the reported results with estimates for the yet-to-release companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are anticipated to be up 22.6% from the same period last year, driven by 8.4% growth in revenues.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to rise 26.4% on 5.7% higher revenues.An important constituent of the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter on the back of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, a favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.A progressing interest rate environment is likely to have driven solid net investment income, a chief component of an insurer’s top line. Though the metric is far from achieving a historical high, it nonetheless shows an upward trend. Notably, the Fed has hiked interest rate five times since December 2015 on the back of a flourishing economy and has expressed intention to raise the same twice more this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.Although insurers have curbed their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to withstand the low rate environment, they look to take advantage of the increasing rates as investment yield betters.The first quarter is likely to gain an edge from the tax cut.  Per the new tax law effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been decreased to 21% from 35%. This lowering of the rate has added an impetus to insurers’ bottom line.Although the to-be-reported quarter stumbled upon a California mudslide as well as the northeast winter storms, the company’s underwriting profitability might still be left unscathed despite the cat events. Insurers having already suffered the hazards of weather-related loss in 2017, should have managed to make up for the underperformances in the first quarter of 2018. A Morgan Stanley analyst projects global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion. Underwriting profitability also seems slightly burdened.However, improved pricing, intelligent underwriting practices, portfolio restructuring as well as taking recourse to reinsurance covers might have shielded insurers to overcome the deficits.A varied product portfolio, global growth and tactical M&A activity are expected to have boosted insurers’ operations in the impending quarterly release.About 900 companies (142 S&P 500 members) are set to report quarterly results this week. Let’s see how things shape up for a few good insurers below before their earnings announcement on May 2.American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is expected to witness flat to a slight decline in revenues due to its ongoing efforts in managing the overall business portfolio via reinsurance and divestitures. Low tax rate and share buyback should boost bottom line. Premiums and deposits at Life Insurance business are expected to increase led by strong growth in both term and universal life insurance sales. However, in General Insurance business, premiums are expected to decline due to the company’s remediation of underperforming lines and divestitures.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter highlights an 8.8% year-over-year fall. AIG carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Although its Earnings ESP of +1.78% makes us confident about an earnings surprise, the stock’s bearish Zacks Rank leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.

We expect an increase in total Life Insurance sales in the first quarter from higher Executive Benefit sales and gains in Variable Universal Life and term products combined with a consistently high demand for MoneyGuard. Tax reform will likely expand Lincoln National’s margin. Its balance sheet strength and a sturdy capital inflow are also part of the estimate.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.94 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, inching up 1% year over year. Though Lincoln has a favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

As a big investor in the U.S. fixed income market, MetLife should have benefited from economic growth, leading to higher interest rates. However, earnings in Retirement and Income Solutions should be pressured by the flatter yield curve.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 per share for the last completed quarter translates into a 19.9% year-over-year decline. MetLife carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Nonetheless, its Earnings ESP of -0.06% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive as the company also needs a positive ESP to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. (Read more: MetLife Q1 Earnings to Buoy on Revenue Growth)MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | MetLife, Inc. Quote Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) is expected to have witnessed bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter owing to recurring premium sales, expanded product offerings, broader distribution capabilities and share buybacks. Core performance of its businesses is mainly fueled by higher fees in its Annuities and Investment Management segments as well as sustained business growth in International Insurance.

47,LNC,"The second-quarter earnings season is in top gear with 57.2% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of 286 index members (accounting for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization), having already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicates that total earnings have increased 11.3% on 6.1% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 74.5% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 69.2%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 70.5% companies on the S&P 500 Index that have reported quarterly results, shows 7.6% earnings growth on 5.1% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 79.1% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 68.7% for the top line is lower than the same of S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which are likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is $53 billion in the first half of 2017. A few insurers are anticipated to have incurred losses due to natural calamities in the second quarter, stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events, occurred during April and May in the U.S.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against capital reserve erosion, piled up on a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting confidence in the developing economic conditions. In fact, the Fed has raised interest rates thrice in three quarters. A better rate environment not only increased net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continuous low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Notably, an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment. This in turn might have also supported more policy writings, driving the premiums higher to generate a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line. Besides, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have probably boosted the insurers.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been ironing out the creases of pricing pressure. Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing soft pricing.Let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Aug 2.American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is engaged in a range of global insurance and insurance-related activities through its subsidiaries. Last quarter, AIG substantially beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.52%.

Individual Retirement business too has remained low due to uncertainty stemming from the Department Of Labor’s fiduciary rule and lower fixed annuity sales limiting the sales improvement.

Its strategic focus is to decrease the portion of sales from products with long-term guarantees and to increase the share of earnings coming from the mortality and morbidity business lines.The company’s wide and expansive independent brokers, agents and financial advisors’ network may expand the distribution reach of its products and add to the top line.We also expect to see an increase in total annuity sales driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace.

51,LNC,"It’s the tail end of 2017 and we are just a few days away from ringing in the New Year. This year has been a mixed bag of sorts for the insurance industry. While economic improvement and consecutive rate hikes triggered some good news, a number of catastrophe events jeopardized the underwriting profitability for insurers.Pinning hopes that the catastrophe environment will remain benign next year, the insurance industry will stand to benefit from the favorable macro backdrop leveraging its core strengths. Also, strategic initiatives to have a diversified portfolio, to expand globally and add capabilities plus mergers and consolidation to accelerate growth position insurers well for a healthy performance.Silver Lining in the CloudA slew of natural calamities inducing cat loss dented the underwriting profitability of insurers this year. Per the data released by Munich Reinsurance company, catastrophe loss in the first half amounted to $41 billion while Swiss Re estimated a catastrophe loss of $95 million in the third quarter. The fourth quarter is likely to suffer, partly due to the California wildfires. Per Swiss Re, the total economic loss from natural and man-made disasters in 2017, are projected at $306 billion.However, due to such a massive loss, insures have braved the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. In order to retain business and survive competition, insurers were earlier jittery about the price rise. But now with higher prices, not only insurers might enjoy higher premiums going forward but be also well-equipped to settle claims with less adverse impact on profitability.   Improving Rate EnvironmentAfter remaining at a near-zero level for about eight years, the Federal Reserve started to gradually raise the interest rate, reflecting the economic strength to gain traction and the US President Donald Trump’s bias for rate hikes.  The Fed has kept its promise of three rate hikes in 2017 and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Retaining this optimism, the outgoing Fed chairperson Janet Yellen reiterated expectations for three rate increases in 2018.Insurers are major beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. With the progressing rate environment, investment income is also set to grow. Investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line. Life insurers having suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates will also benefit from higher rates.Economic Data Instills HopeAn improving employment situation, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and a momentum in oil prices are parameters highlighting a better economic scenario. All these together fuel the approval for rate hikes.The economic scenario remains encouraging. While the Fed officials expect unemployment to decline to 3.9% in 2018, the GDP is predicted to grow at 2.5%, reflecting an increase from 2.1%, projected earlier. Inflation rate is estimated at 1.9% in 2018.A reviving housing market is anticipated to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written. Stronger corporate bonds and an improving real estate market might help curtail the credit-related investment losses.Also, Trump’s tax reform policy, an overhaul to tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden.

52,LNC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Lincoln National Corporation (LNC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Lincoln National has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.93. This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.50.If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock, the current level puts Lincoln National’s current PE among its highs over the past five years. This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels. Further, the stock’s PE compares vastly favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance – Life Insurance industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.65. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Lincoln National has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 9.72 – which is faintly lower than the current level. So it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Lincoln National stock in the near term too.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Lincoln National has a P/S ratio of about 1.19. This is lower than the Zacks categorized Insurance – Life Insurance industry average, which comes in at 1.42 right now.LNC is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important, it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well. One can easily do that with the PEG ratio (ratio of the P/E to the expected future earnings growth rate).The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P/E ratio.Lincoln National’s PEG ratio stands at 1.00, compared with the Zacks Insurance – Life Insurance industry average of 1.59. This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Lincoln National currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Lincoln National a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/B ratio (used to compare a stock's market value to its book value) stands at 1.07, lower than the industry average of 1.13. Clearly, LNC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Lincoln National might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘F’ and a Momentum score of ‘A’. This gives LNC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘C’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen three upward revisions and one downward revision in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up 0.6% in the past month, while the full year estimate has increased 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Lincoln National Corporation Price and Consensus Lincoln National Corporation Price and Consensus | Lincoln National Corporation QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineLincoln National is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. With a formidable industry rank (among the Top 18% out of more than 250 industries) and strong Zacks Rank, Lincoln National looks like a strong value contender. In fact, over the past one year, the Zacks Insurance – Life Insurance industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Meanwhile, Lincoln National is well positioned for long-term growth, given its focus on reducing exposure to businesses with long-term guarantee. Its strong capital position is another positive. The company is prudent in managing its capital which has led to an improvement in book value.So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.   Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

53,LNC,"Manulife Financial Corporation (MFC  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 core earnings of $0.9 billion (C$1.1 billion), up 9% year over year.The quarter witnessed double-digit core earnings and new business value growth in Asia and emerges as the 31st straight quarter of positive net flows in global Wealth and Asset Management business.Manulife Financial Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Manulife Financial Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Manulife Financial Corp QuotePremiums and deposits were $30.5 million (C$38.2 million), up about 2.4% year over year.New business value in the quarter was $273.6 million (C$343 million), up 22% year over year. Strong growth in Asia drove this improvement.Manulife’s total insurance sales were $0.9 billion (C$1.1 billion) during the period under review, up 10% year over year. This is because sales in Asia increased 15%, the U.S. life insurance sales increased 5% and Canadian sales improved slightly all on a year-over-year basis.Wealth sales remained flat year over year at $1.5 billion (CS1.9 billion). Improved wealth sales in Asia were offset by lower business from the bank channel in Japan. In Canada too, sales declined 8% year over year.Manulife Minimum Continuing Capital and Surplus Requirements ratio was 234% as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 230% as of Jun 30, 2017. This sequential decline may be attributed to growth in retained earnings and net capital issuance. However, a moderate increase in required capital was partially offset.As of Sep 30, 2017, Manulife’s financial leverage ratio deteriorated 30 basis points (bps) to 29.5% from Jun 30, 2017, driven by an issue of $350 million of subordinated debt and lower earnings.As of Sep 30, 2017, assets under management were $802.7 billion (C$1000 billion), up 8% year over year.Core return on equity, measuring the company’s profitability, expanded 80 bps year over year to 10.6%.Segmental PerformanceAsia division core earnings came in at $342 million, up 13.2% year over year, banking on growth in new business volumes and a continued rise of in-force business. However, a small charge related to policyholder experience in third-quarter 2017 compared with a small gain in the prior year, partially offset this upside. Annualized premium equivalents sales climbed 15% year over year to $734 million in the quarter.Manulife’s Canadian division core earnings of $372 million (C$466 million) increased 32% year over year, driven by higher fee income in wealth and asset management businesses and a release of provisions for uncertain tax positions of prior years.Insurance sales increased 2.8% year over year to $148 million (C$186 million) on the back of higher sales in the small and mid-market group benefits segments.The U.S. division reported core earnings of $355 million, up 1.2% year over year. This upside was fueled by higher wealth and asset management earnings, primarily from higher average assets, lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs on in-force variable annuity business and higher tax benefits. Life insurance sales shot up 5% year over year owing to strong growth in Accumulation Universal Life, Index UL and term sales.Dividend UpdateThe company’s board of directors approved a dividend of 20.5 cents per share to shareholders of record as of Nov 21, 2017.

However, higher premiums in SLF U.S. and group benefits in SLF Canada limited this downside.Segment ResultsSLF Canada’s underlying net income decreased 5% year over year to $183 million (C$232 million) due to release of a litigation provision that shored up the underlying net income, a year ago .

58,LNC,"The rate environment has been favoring life insurers since the Fed started tightening its monetary policy a couple of years back, given the high sensitivity of their business models to interest rates. But neither the pace nor the magnitude of rate hikes has been enough for a measurable benefit so far.However, the Fed’s rate hike last week and three more likely increases in 2018 might change the fate of life insurers by steadily boosting their investment income.Actually, for any gain, the rate-hike-driven improvement in investment income will have to more than offset the decline in yield on assets invested in. And the rate hikes so far have not been enough to fetch any significant benefit.However, the likely change in the frequency of rate hikes should position carriers better in terms of generating investment income and maintaining minimum surplus requirement.While the rate environment has not been too effective so far, investors have reacted positively to the industry’s progress. This is clearly evident from the Zacks Life Insurance Industry’s 22.7% gain since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500’s 20.2% rally.In addition to a likely escalation in investment income based on an improved rate scenario, there are reasons to be optimistic about the industry’s growth.Key Drivers Beyond Rate HikesHigh hedging costs, which have been marring profitability, are likely to decline with rising interest rates. This will, in turn, alleviate the pressure on investment yields.Moreover, better control over underwriting expenses and continued increase in premiums should help life insurers enhance their income in the quarters ahead. The individual life insurance premiums, which showed decent growth since the last recession, will likely continue the trend with rising demand driven by a strong job market and the aging population (for retirement savings).In the low-rate era, life insurers managed to stay afloat by going beyond their conservative approach and through capital flexibility. In order to keep their commitments to policyholders, they increasingly resorted to riskier asset classes — such as equities. While increased dependence on this strategy has made them vulnerable to faltering on claim payments as there is no guarantee of steady returns from riskier assets, no major setback is likely in the near term. In fact, this arrangement should make variable annuity portfolios and other fee-driven businesses contribute a little more to profits, as the equity market is expected to remain favorable.What made life insurers resort to racier asset classes is ultra-low bond yields due to global growth concerns. However, bond yields have improved since Donald Trump became President on expectations of better economic growth and higher inflation based on an expansive fiscal policy. If this trend continues, life insurers will likely see better days.Also, as the U.S. corporate bond market remains healthy and the real estate market is unlikely to disappoint with strength is job market, life insurers’ credit-related investment losses should be below average.Above all, increasing disposable income on the back of continued growth in the economy and declining unemployment should perk up demand for life insurance and annuity products.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Upside Potential This 14-company group currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #56, which places it in the top 22% of the 250-plus Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Business Restructuring to Work in FavorLife insurers did not shy away under difficulties that the low-rate environment had created for them. Taking them in stride, they had chosen to capitalize on the rapidly changing sector dynamics. As part of this effort, life insurers had reduced the sensitivity of their product lines to interest rates to some extent and invested in less-liquid assets. While this rationalization is curbing the benefits from the rising rate environment, it should make the growth path steady.The changing economic and demographic conditions are making risk calculation difficult, but life insurers are adopting more predictive techniques with the help of analytics.Most importantly, life insurers have managed to improve net income in the last few quarters by trimming underwriting expenses and modestly increasing premium rates. In fact, some life insurers are quietly hiking rates on some universal life policies in order to offset losses emanating from a tough industry backdrop. This action is actually narrowing the gap between what they receive as premium and what they promised to pay policyholders.Life insurers have also been resorting to product modification and re-pricing, which should enhance their liability profiles and profitability. While re-pricing of traditional products with attractive additional features will help them earn more, product modification will lessen liabilities on insurers’ part by shifting risks related to equity and hedging to policyholders.     Moreover, a beefed-up capital market should strengthen the industry’s liquidity profile in the upcoming quarters and help its participants confront any unforeseen challenge.How to Play Life Insurance StocksLife insurers’ near-term prospects are looking up on a number of positive factors. So, it would be prudent to pick a few stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank.Here are a few top-ranked stocks that you may want to consider:American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (AEL  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 41% year to date versus the S&P 500’s 20.2% rally.

59,LNC,"Post review of investment strategies of its legacy businesses, Manulife Financial Corporation (MFC  -  Free Report) recently announced to lower allocation to alternative long duration assets over the next 12-18 months. This step will help the life insurer boost return on capital and free up the same for redeployment in growth initiatives.Although the company is estimated to incur a $1-billion charge or 50 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 for reducing the allocation, the same will free up a hefty sum of capital worth $2 billion.

68,LNC,"Fourth-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Jan 26, 26% S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers and 24% of them are slated to release this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% topping revenue estimates. About 65.4% of the companies have surpassed both EPS and revenue estimates.Industry TrendsInsurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector, will witness soft performance in the to-be-reported quarter which will drag the sector’s fourth-quarter results. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings of the Finance sector will improve 8.4% with revenues increasing 2.4% year over year.A slew of natural calamities inducing cat loss dented the underwriting profitability of insurers this year. The fourth quarter is likely to suffer due to the California wildfires. As a result, insurers have hiked prices that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. With higher prices, insurers not only will enjoy higher premiums going forward but also be well-equipped to settle claims without hurting profitability.In addition, since December 2016, four rate hikes have been made and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Also, the Fed has reiterated the expectation to raise rates thrice in 2018 and twice in 2019. Owing to a gradually improving rate environment, investment results have improved moderately from the historical lows.Moreover, the tax reform policy, enacted in December 2017, that lowers the corporate tax burden to 20% from 35%, is likely act as an impetus, aiding margin expansion. However, due to reduction in tax rates, insurers are writing down deferred tax assets that in turn will adversely impact their risk-based capitalization levels and also reduce net income for some players in the fourth quarter.Stocks to ConsiderFirst, Aflac Inc.’s (AFL  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results are expected to benefit from increased revenues from its U.S. segment that has been performing strongly as evident from rise in revenues since 2010.Also, we expect sales increase to continue in the fourth quarter given the number of growth initiatives such as the adoption of Everwell for increased penetration, delivery of value-added services and increased client retention; product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access; and investment in administrative capabilities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is $1.6 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 6.7%.Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan. The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in Japan. Premium growth continues to be pressured by first-sector savings product, WAYS, and a portion of block reaching paid-up status.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Aflac is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Aflac has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.49%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from operation for the Annuity segment is $264 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 9.1%.Lincoln National’s life insurance business is expected to see top-line growth from a broad product portfolio and an industry-leading distribution network. The company’s Group Protection segment that was challenged in the recent past is now recovering. The fourth quarter is likely to be aided by this segment’s performance as well.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lincoln National is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

Let’s see what it has in store for this yet-to-be reported quarter.Unum Group is expected to have witnessed improved operating income at Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments, driven by higher premiums and favorable risk results. Sales at both the segments likely have improved, thus fueling the company’s total premiums.The company’s voluntary benefits business likely has performed better.Continued share buybacks should have boosted the bottom line.The Unum U.K. is expected to have remained soft at the backdrop of challenging economic environment.The Zacks Consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.04 on $2.8 billion revenues.

70,LNC,"The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after market close.Last quarter, Allstate beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 53.3% and grew 122.6% year over year on higher revenues. The upside was driven by premium growth as well as an increase in net investment income. The customer base rose to 75 million policies in force.The company has an impressive surprise history. It surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 36.9%. This is depicted in the graph below:Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q3 FlashbackAllstate’s earnings have been exposed to catastrophe losses. The first half of 2017 bore the brunt of cat losses and the same is expected in the third quarter, which was shaken by massive catastrophes – Harvey, Irma, Maria.The company has provided preliminary estimates of cat loss of $774 million on a pre-tax basis, owing to weather-related destruction in July and August.In the first quarter, the company closed the acquisition of SquareTrade, a protection plan provider for consumer electronics and connected devices. Allstate previously said that the deal would dilute earnings for three years.Therefore, the effect of the same will be felt in third-quarter results. During the second quarter, Allstate Insurance Company executed a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement with SquareTrade’s largest third-party insurer, which should result in higher underwriting and investment income.The company’s customer-focused strategy and a wide variety of products and services sold through an extensive distribution network will likely result in higher policies issued, thus driving top-line growth.We also expect to see improved auto insurance margins, reflecting broad-based profit improvement plans initiated by the company over two years ago.A large component of the company’s operating income results from investment income so despite the continuation of historically low interest rates, the company has managed well on this front. The portfolio is proactively managed and is primarily a high-quality fixed income portfolio, which generates predictable earnings with modest growth.In the second quarter, the company reported an increase in net investment income and we expect superior performance in the third quarter.Allstate’s capital strength and financial flexibility enables it to manage shareholder capital. The company returned $903 million to its shareholders in the first six months of 2017, which reduced outstanding debt at the beginning of the year by 2.1%. Continuing this trend, shares bought back during the third quarter will push up the company’s bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allstate is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Allstate has an Earning ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.09 per share is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

71,LNC,"Third-quarter earnings season has seen 164 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported quarterly results so far. Let’s see how the quarter is turning up for the life and non-life or property and casualty (P&C) insurance space.No doubt, the third quarter is characterized by a barrage of catastrophe events that wreaked havoc. While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in the regions across the Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered costliest in a decade. Incidentally, Maria hit Puerto Rico and Virginia Island with two Mexican tremors further adding to the woes.Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. Moody’s Analytics earlier estimated economic losses from Irma to come in the $58-$83 billion band while that from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion.Underwriting profitability, a measure of P&C insurers’ performance, has been severely hampered in the third quarter. While most P&C insurers’ profits declined compared with the year-ago results, some have incurred losses in the quarter. Combined ratios have deteriorated badly and pricing remained soft.However, capital accumulation from a not-so-active catastrophe environment in the previous quarters, prudent underwriting standards as well as cost control measures will cushion insurers.Amid bad news, a silver lining in the cloud is the gradual improvement in the interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve has made three hikes since December 2016. The third quarter continues to enjoy the positive impact of a favorable rate environment, driving the insurer’s investment results and performance of life insurers.Improving interest rates came in as a sign of relief for the life insurers that suffered a spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Investment yield is also likely to have improved. Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates. Life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Also, a progressing economy means more disposable income and a better-consumer sentiment. This, in turn, is likely to have supported more policy writings, thus driving premiums higher. Premiums contribute a lion’s share to an insurer’s top line.With strong positives guarding the results, investors can bet on the stocks, poised to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming reports.  Ways to Pick the Right Insurance StocksChoosing the right stock for one’s portfolio from too many participants is a daunting task for investors. But an easy way to trim the list is by looking at the stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) that are likely to surpass estimates.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks with the best chances of delivering an earnings surprise in their next announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Please check our Earnings ESP Filter that enables you to find stocks with the potential to come up with an earnings beat.Our research shows that for the stocks with an ideal combination of two key ingredients, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.For investors seeking to apply this strategy to their portfolios, we have highlighted four insurance stocks that might stand out with earnings beats in their upcoming releases.  Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report)Newark, NJ-based Prudential offers an array of financial products and services including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds, investment management and real estate services.With a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.07%, Prudential looks well-poised for a positive surprise.

72,LNC,"Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.25%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect the company’s Market Services segment, a major contributor to Nasdaq’s total revenues, to not only boost top-line growth but also improve the company’s overall performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Higher revenues from the buyout of International Securities Exchange (ISE) and European cash equities are expected to lead to an improvement in Market Services’ revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Market Services revenues is currently pegged at $147 million, an increase of 7.3% from the year-ago quarter.The aforementioned segment is likely to have delivered positive organic growth, primarily driven by a solid market share performance across its largest trading categories — U.S. options, U.S. equities and European equities, together with continued positive organic growth in Trade Management Services.Even though the company has been displaying weak equity trading performance over a considerable period of time, Nasdaq’s organic growth has seen a consistent rise. Therefore, the company has likely delivered noticeable organic growth in the quarter to be reported, driven by its strategy of expediting the non-transaction revenue base that includes market technology, listing and information revenues.However, the company is likely to have incurred higher expenses in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to development and diversification of its business. This in turn has likely restricted operating margin expansion.Additionally, the company might witness lower cash equity trading revenues, owing to decrease in revenue per contract and a weak trading activity in the industry, along with regulatory changes and adverse forex impact may lead to lower cash equity trading revenues. To that end, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net cash equity trading revenues is currently pegged at $60 million, reflecting a slip of 1.6% from the prior-year quarter. Decreased cash equity trading revenues can weigh on the bottom-line of the company.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Nasdaq has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Nasdaq has an Earnings ESP of +0.49%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.03 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. The positive ESP is indicative of a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Nasdaq, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Nasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 along with a positive Earnings ESP, have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this quarter are as follows:Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov 1 with an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #2.

73,LNC,"CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Oct 26 before the market opens. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last two quarters. Let’s see what it has in store for this yet-to-be reported quarter.CME Group’s top line has likely improved owing to higher clearing and transaction fees. The company’s efforts to ramp up organic market data growth will add to the top line. The Zacks Consensus estimate for market data and information services are pegged at $96 million.CME Group’s average daily volume (ADV) for the third quarter stood at 15.7 million contracts, up 10% year over year. Five of its six product lines delivered growth in ADV in the third quarter.About 74% of CME Group’s metal options currently trade electronically. Metals’ ADV in the third quarter increased 42%, the highest across its six product lines.However, license fees likely have increased on the back of transfer of the Russell products in July and aggregate changes in licenses.The tax rate likely has increased in the third quarter, given an increase in the Illinois state income tax.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $1.16 per share on $889.9 million revenues. The bottom line reflects a 10.6% rise, while the top line translates to an increase of 5.7%, both on a year-over-year basis.What our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that CME Group is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

74,LNC,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.98%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterArthur J. Gallagher is likely to witness a noticeable rise in expenses, primarily due to higher compensation and operating expenses. The increase in expenses can restrict operating margin expansion, thereby hurting the company’s overall performance.Also, with the insurance broker’s string of strategic buyouts, the company has incurred 1 cent per share in integration costs in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Nonetheless, Arthur J. Gallagher is likely to report bottom-line growth in the third quarter, mainly owing to a strong performance by its Brokerage and Risk Management businesses as well as higher revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is 78 cents that represents an increase of 1.9% from the prior-year quarter.The company expects adjusted margin at Brokerage segment to be in line with year-ago figure.Employee benefit consulting operations are likely to have registered organic growth owing to new business opportunities.Top-line growth likely has been fueled by organic sales as well as strategic mergers and acquisitions. To that end, the Zacks Consensus Estimate with respect to revenues for the third quarter of 2017 is $1.6 billion that represents an increase of 5.1% from the prior-year quarter.    Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Arthur J.

75,LNC,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.40%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterChubb’s third quarter underwriting results will be affected by strings of cat events. Chubb has projected catastrophe losses from Hurricane Harvey is estimated to be nearly $520 million after-tax, whereas from Irma, it is expected to range between $640 million and $760 million after-tax. Such losses are attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio is currently pegged at 101%, a deterioration of 980 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Premiums earned likely have reduced in the soon-to-be-reported quarter due to the company’s inability to generate enough underwriting returns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is currently pegged at $7.2 billion, reflecting a decline of 2.8% on a year-over year basis.Additionally, the company might have incurred higher expenses, mainly due to higher loss and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, administrative expenses and policy benefits. This in turn will weigh on the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  However, higher net investment income and continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is currently pegged at a loss of 26 cents, compared to the earnings of $2.88 in the year-ago quarter. Also, the company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $830 and $840.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Chubb is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

77,LNC,"The year 2017 is turning out to be quite tumultuous for the insurance industry as a whole. Blame it on catastrophic events threatening to hurt the economy, albeit on a short-term basis, along with ambiguities reflected in the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave the interest rates persistently unchanged for the time being.If we focus on the life insurance industry, the aforementioned challenges apart, the life insurers have been experiencing continued disruptions in the form of evolving customer demands as well as economic and regulatory changes.Rising Interest Rates’ Effect on the Life Insurance IndustryThe life insurance industry’s heavy dependence on investment income will benefit most companies from the rising interest rate environment. Profitability in this particular industry is deeply connected to the changes in interest rates as well as any increase in bond yields that promises to provide a required relief to insurers struggling to maintain margins. Therefore, life insurers suffering spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates will breathe a sigh of relief.Although the Federal Reserve has left the interest rates unchanged (following the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on Sep 20, 2017), ranging between 1% and 1.25%, the life insurers are still looking forward to another interest rate hike this year, as indicated by policymakers at the meeting. Interestingly, the Fed committee also expects to raise interest rates thrice in 2018. Hence, the life insurance industry remains optimistic about the investment income growth in the near term, which might help strengthen its market position.A progressing rate environment will lessen the burden on life insurers’ investment income, thus boosting their earnings. This in turn will also accelerate the insurance companies’ overall growth in the future.Certain Other Factors Impacting the Life Insurance IndustryStronger corporate bonds and improving real estate market might help curtail the credit-related investment losses. Also, bettering economy and higher inflation induced bonds look to yield good returns to investors. Life insurers are expected to gain from this favorable trend if it continues in the long run. In fact, succeeding economy indicates more disposable income with people opting for more insurance coverage.Interestingly, life insurers are increasingly moving toward redesigned and re-priced products with potential to help them write higher premiums in the upcoming quarter.Further, the demand for life insurance is estimated to improve and strengthen on the back of customers’ need for greater safety in a volatile financial environment. Per a recent report by the worldwide insurance association, Life Insurance Management Research Association (LIMRA), minimum 34% of Americans are likely to buy life insurance in 2017. This will in fact encourage the demand for life insurance with the industry reaping benefits derived from such an upside.It is important to note here that the Zacks Life Insurance industry has outperformed the broader market during the third quarter of 2017. The industry’s shares have gained nearly 4% compared with the S&P 500 index’s 3.8% increase. Notably, the life insurance industry ranks among the top 6% of the Zacks industries.Stocks Poised for a Beat in Q3With growing interest rates and a developing economy, the life insurers are capable of garnering profits through underlying strength and business modification.We have specifically zeroed in on five life insurers, poised for an earnings beat when they report third-quarter 2017 results. This seems possible as our proven model shows that these stocks have the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, which are a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

78,LNC,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 39.13%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterWith the occurrence of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria during the third quarter as well as the Mexico earthquakes, Cincinnati Financial’s underwriting results will be significantly impacted in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The massive catastrophe losses will not only affect underwriting profitability but also render volatility to the company’s earnings. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is 53 cents that represents a noticeable decline of 38.4% from the prior-year quarter.Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer’s unit, The Cincinnati Insurance Companies’ property casualty group, has projected third-quarter 2017 pre-tax catastrophe losses to range between $102 million and $114 million, approximately. This will leave an impact on the third-quarter combined ratio of about 860-960 basis points on the basis of estimated property casualty earned premiums.Additionally, the company projects its third-quarter property casualty combined ratio to range between 98.5% and 101.5%, including the effect of catastrophe losses.Further, the company has possibly recorded an increase in total benefits and expenses, mainly driven by higher insurance losses and contract holders’ benefits, underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses as well as other operating costs. This in turn might restrict the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  However, Cincinnati Financial is likely to report top-line growth in the third quarter, fueled by higher premiums earned. To that end, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is $1.4 billion that represents an increase of 3.5% from the prior-year quarter.Also, investment results likely have improved backed by an increase in both interest and dividend income.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cincinnati Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

79,LNC,"XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.87%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterWith the occurrence of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria during the third quarter as well as the Mexico earthquakes, XL Group’s underwriting profitability will be largely hampered in the soon-to-be- reported quarter. Notably, the company has estimated catastrophe losses for the third quarter to be about $1.35 billion. This in turn might lead to a noticeable deterioration in the combined ratio as well.Also, the company is expecting a fall in net investment income, owing to the still low-interest rate environment. In addition, improvement in investment income is closely associated with the credit markets and volatility in such markets can render instability in investment earnings.Further, the company might experience a decline in gross written premiums in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. This is mainly due to a large international casualty quota share treaty in the previous year, which did not get renewed, as well as a cancelled business that did not meet the company’s expectations.Nonetheless, lower operating expenses and continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. In fact, the company expects to complete not less than $700 million in buyback in 2017. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that XL Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

80,LNC,"Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. But the question here is why? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t stand the test of time. Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.) You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history.)% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (Companies that witnessed year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal.)% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,818 stocks to only 23. Among them, we have selected five large-cap stocks. Such stocks have long-term performance history and are more stable than what mid-caps or small caps offer. Companies with market capitalization of more than $10 billion are generally considered large cap.Here are the top five stocks:Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) is focused on building products that enable people to connect and share through mobile devices, personal computers and other surfaces. The company’s products include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus. Facebook has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

81,LNC,"MetLife Inc (MET  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries have received rating action from A.M. Best. The rating giant has affirmed Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a-” of MetLife along with its Long- and Short-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR; Short-Term IR).Moreover, A.M Best has reiterated the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICR of “aa-” of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, General American Life Insurance Company and Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company.This apart, the rating giant has further affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of “a+” of MetLife’s Auto & Home affiliates group. The group includes Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, seven fully reinsured subsidiaries and a separately rated subsidiary — Metropolitan Group Property and Casualty Insurance Company. The outlook of these Credit Ratings remained stable.This rating actions acknowledges MetLife’s leading position in the group insurance market along with its vast geographic presence. The rating giant expects MetLife to gain steam from its focused business strategies like the spin-off of Brighthouse Financial. The divestment helped MetLife in lowering its exposure to softening interest rates and equity market sensitivity. Post the divestiture, MetLife generates almost half of its operating earnings from international business.Notably, despite the sustained soft interest rate environment, MetLife managed to generate strong revenues, stable operating earnings and cash flows, indicating its operational efficiency. The rating giant believes that this will contribute to the company’s organic earnings growth along with improving expense management. MetLife has also been able to maintain its financial leverage and interest coverage ratios within A.M. Best's expectations.However, these positives are partially offset by the high level of risks in its investment portfolio. A.M. Best believes that the risks stem from its securities lending and funding agreement-backed securities programs.  Although operating leverage remains within A.M. Best’s guidelines for its current rating on a consolidated basis, the rating giant expects MetLife to successfully manage its leverage going forward.MetLife is exposed to the possibility of earnings decline related to its run-off of MetLife Holdings segment and the Brighthouse spin-off in the short term.  The present volatility within some existing business lines and stiff competition within group benefits and the emerging markets in which MetLife operates also remain headwinds. Well reflective of these negatives, its shares have gained 11% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 20%. Coming to the subsidiaries of MetLife, the ratings reflect their strong capitalization and solid operating performance. The affiliates’ multiple-channel distribution network also adds to the extensive market expertise. National geographic diversification and marketing advantage derived from MetLife's established brand name recognition also helped these subsidiaries maintain their competitive edge. These ratings perfectly recognize the financial strength and support provided by MetLife to its units.Nevertheless, the rating giant is concerned that these tailwinds are partially negated by MetLife Auto & Home's considerable amount of underwriting leverage, its exposure to catastrophic events and a dividend policy hindering surplus growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMetLife presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Investors interested in the insurance space can consider better-ranked stocks like CNO Financial Group, Inc (CNO  -  Free Report), Unum Group.

Also, per AIR Worldwide, the projected insured losses for Maria will vary between $40 billion and $85 billion.Further, AIR Worldwide has provided an insurance industry loss estimate following the huge impact of the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico in early September. The figure enormously ranges between $0.8 billion and $1.1 billion. Per the same global catastrophe risk modeler, the industry loss estimate is expected up to $2.1 billion, following another tremor that rocked Mexico on Sep 19, 2017.However, the insurance industry can still find some hope and fall back on such disasters to induce substantial price rise that has been flat owing to a not-so-active catastrophe environment.  Despite the mounting losses, which are sure to have a negative impact on the insurers’ overall results, such tropical storms can be touted as a blessing in disguise as in catastrophic events are a necessary evil to the insurance industry for improving their pricing to eventually minimize competition.We wait and see if such catastrophe losses and weather-oriented events have the capacity to reduce the already large capital reserve and bring a change to the insurance pricing cycle in the near term.  Interest Rate Environment  — Impact on the Insurance IndustryIt did not come as a surprise when the Federal Reserve kept the interest rates unchanged, ranging between 1% and 1.25% at its meeting on Sep 20, 2017.  However, investors are still looking forward to another interest rate hike this year, as indicated by the policymakers at the meeting. Interestingly, the Fed committee also expects to raise interest rates three times in 2018. Hence, the market is pinning hopes on the next rate hike, which is likely boost the insurance industry’s prospects and help insurers strengthen their market position.A progressing rate environment will lessen the pressure on the insurers’ investment income, thus boosting their earnings. This in turn will accelerate the insurance companies’ overall growth in the future.Certain Other Factors Influencing the Insurance IndustryApart from colossal catastrophe losses, there are factors to impact the industry performance in the near term as well.Low inflation, for which the Federal Reserve could not deliver any proper explanation, is expected to remain at 1.6% — falling shy of the 2% target that is considered good for the economy.Hence, low inflation, rapidly changing climatic conditions and the short-term push to the gasoline prices, render uncertainty to the Federal Reserve’s decision as when to increase interest rates in the immediate term.On the brighter side, a reviving housing market is anticipated to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written. But we wait and see if this momentum continues in the short term as well. Additionally, an improving employment scenario and a positive consumer sentiment buoy optimism.Outperformers in SeptemberDespite widespread catastrophic losses and challenging market conditions, improved interest rates and an improving economy have lent a silver lining to the cloud of calamities for insurers. These are capable of reaping profits through underlying strength and business modification.We zeroed in on five insurers that have outperformed in September despite all odds based on price performance and a favorable Zacks Rank backed by positive estimate revisions.Stamford, CT-based The Navigators Group, Inc.
