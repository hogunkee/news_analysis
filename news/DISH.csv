0,DISH,"Verizon Communications (VZ) won an upgrade ahead of its earnings report while Dish Network (DISH) got both a Morgan Stanley price-target cut and the attention of another analyst who thinks it could be a merger target for Verizon.Barclays upgraded Verizon, which reports first-quarter earnings early Tuesday, to overweight. Amir Rozwadowski, a Barclays analyst, says the company may lose postpaid phone subscribers in the quarter. But he expects the telecom firm's wireless service revenue ""trajectory"" to show improvement year-over-year, excluding new accounting rules.Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on Dish to 45 from 55. Dish's core satellite TV business is deteriorating and it's been unable to partner with a wireless service provider to utilize radio spectrum it has amassed.Verizon climbed 1.6% to close at 48.66 on the stock market today. Dish was nearly flat, up 5 cents to 37.28. Verizon, a high dividend-paying stock, has dropped nearly 10% in 2018 amid rising interest rates. Dish has plunged 19% in 2018 and 41% from Aug. 1.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWith Dish's valuation lower, Verizon could be more interested in buying the company for its spectrum holdings, speculates Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a blog published on Monday. He says one concern for Dish is that federal regulators plan on auctioning more airwaves. As spectrum supply grows, there would be less reason to buy Dish, he said.""Dish has every incentive in the world to finally drop their asking price to a level low enough that Verizon might come to the table,"" Moffett said. ""Again, that's not to say that Verizon is necessarily ready to buy even at a bargain price.

1,DISH,"As new financial planners set up shop, they crave advice. And seasoned advisors are eager to give it.Ask experienced advisors to share success tips and many will dish out eternal truths: Treat clients with respect, deliver superior service and listen more than you speak.Older advisors also urge new entrants to the field to document client meetings with care and never stop learning. Also: Don't pretend to know more than you do. By adopting disciplined work habits and understanding how emotions drive financial decisions, young advisors can gain an edge.Perhaps the most crucial factor in determining whether a new planner will prosper centers on motivation. The more passion you bring to each day, the better.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""There are three levels to how you approach your work,"" said Rick Kahler, a certified financial planner in Rapid City, S.D. ""It can be a job, a career or a calling. Your probability of success goes way up if it's a calling.""People treat a job as a grind and a career as a series of milestones to check off. But if they derive deep gratification from helping clients — and they're compelled to excel — then they possess the fortitude to persevere and build a thriving practice.Kahler, 62, also emphasizes the importance of lifelong education. He tells young associates to attend professional conferences, read industry publications and take webinars.""Continuing education isn't a nuisance; it's a way to keep learning,"" he said. ""Even now, I spend over 100 hours a year on continuing ed. You can't just go with bare-bones CE requirements; that's a low bar. Be the best fiduciary you can be. ""Advisors who polish their people skills work more effectively with colleagues. But young planners can graduate college feeling cocky and project a know-it-all attitude.""It's great working with new associates who are savvy and really smart,"" said Marianela Collado, a certified financial planner in Plantation, Fla. ""But if they don't agree with what they hear, there's a difference between saying 'You're wrong' and 'Please help me understand how you arrived at that.' ""She counsels newcomers to demonstrate humility and disagree in a diplomatic, respectful tone. Posing questions works better than insisting you know more than a co-worker.""This goes a long way to make people want to work with you and appreciate having you on their team,"" Collado said. ""It's the same when working with attorneys and CPAs. Don't put them on the defensive by saying, 'Here's what you missed.' Instead, ask 'What do you think of this other approach?' ""Another way that new associates gain acceptance at their firm is to learn the unglamorous side of the business. In addition to amassing technical knowledge to help clients, they can show interest in less visible but vital aspects of the practice.""Often, young advisors don't spend much time on back-office operations — things like rebalancing software, compliance updates, financial reporting,"" said Sammy Grant, a certified financial planner in Sandy Springs, Ga. ""But you'll be more valuable to your firm's partners if you understand that stuff, and that knowledge will also serve you well if you launch your own practice.""Empathy differentiates top advisors. By communicating with prospects and clients in a sensitive manner, they're more apt to build rapport and earn their trust.""Step out of your shoes into the client's shoes,"" Grant said. ""It's something you can't learn in school. You need to respond to what clients do and say by understanding them, not judging them.""For newcomers who launch their own firm, the isolation of a solo practice can prove challenging. Longtime advisors recommend that you join a network of other planners.""We're social creatures, not lone wolves, so it's important to have peers to bounce ideas off,"" said Kenneth Robinson, a certified financial planner in Cleveland, Ohio. ""Don't go it alone. You'll learn more than you think you'll learn from your peers.""Advisors can create their own informal peer groups and meet regularly to share their experiences. Or they can join membership organizations such as the Alliance of Comprehensive Planners, XY Planning Network and Garrett Planning Network.Robinson also advises new planners to carve out a niche and specialize in serving that universe of clients. He suggests an exercise to envision the type of individual you want to attract.""Figure out your ideal client,"" he said. ""Then you can play to your strengths.""For example, Robinson works with independent professional women. But he's also a fan of index funds, so a professional woman seeking a stock picker for an advisor wouldn't be a good fit.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Before Aging Clients Show Signs Of Dementia, Advisors Take ActionAdvisors Track Economic Reports To Stay One Step Ahead Of MarketsAdvisors Promote Health And Wellness To Help Clients Live Better

3,DISH,"Cell-tower operator Crown Castle International (CCI) has bid for broadband-service provider Lightower Fiber Networks in a $7 billion deal that would help Crown Castle provide 5G wireless infrastructure to customers such as Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T), reports said Monday.XPrivately held Lightower's fiber-optic network would mesh with Crown Castle's plans to build out ""small-cell"" radio antennas for 5G services in urban areas. The small-cell antennas — hung on utility poles or building rooftops — will require fiber-optic connections to local hubs, which in turn link to cloud-computing infrastructure as well as long-distance networks.Some analysts, though, view the $7 billion price tag, which includes debt, as pricey.""Crown Castle has not been shy about its desire to acquire more of the right type of fiber assets to bolster its small-cell business. Should reported valuation levels prove true ($7 billion), an equity component to financing a deal is likely,"" Barclays analyst Amir Rozwadowski said in a note to clients.Shares in Crown Castle closed down 4.2% at 96.81 in the stock market today.

6,DISH,"Blue Apron (APRN) is serving up a dish that big-money investors have turned away, causing the company to lower the price of its initial public offering by about 34%.Blue Apron cut the estimated price of shares to a range of $10 to $11, down from $15 to $17, lowering its fully diluted market value to $2 billion from $3 billion. Blue Apron planned to raise $480 million, now cut to $315 million. The IPO is scheduled to reach a final price tonight and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday under the ticker APRN.Founded in 2012, New York-based Blue Apron provides recipes and pre-measured ingredients that are boxed and delivered to customers for a home meal, designed for two or four people. It also has a monthly wine-delivery option.Investors embraced the cut in share price, which research firm IPO Boutique says is now ""multiple times oversubscribed.""IPO Boutique said its sources had indicated that the roadshow designed to promote the offering to institutional investors ""has continued to be challenging for management as they attempt to diffuse the highly likely fact that extensive losses in the future could and likely will create problems.""Blue Apron revenue rose by a blistering 133% to $795.4 million in 2016 from the previous year.

8,DISH,"Amid speculation e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) and Dish Network (DISH) could partner in 5G wireless services, a Citigroup report says a strategic deal could focus on the Internet of Things.""The idea of Amazon partnering with Dish may seem unusual, but their aspirations may be intersecting around connected devices and the Internet of Things,"" the report said.IoT encompasses web-connected cars, advanced robotics, telemedicine, automated factories, smart cities and the development of massive sensor networks in such fields as agriculture. Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) are also targeting the IoT as a growth market.Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins says Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing arm of Amazon, could use a wireless network as part of its IoT strategy. With Amazon as an ""anchor customer"" and possibly making an investment, Dish is more likely to build out a wireless network, the Citigroup analyst says.""AWS offers an IoT software platform that can be paired with analytics and other services,"" Rollins said. ""Together, (Dish and Amazon) could bundle cloud (Anything as a Service) with connectivity (Spectrum as a Service) to lower cost and accelerate the development of IoT services.""Dish founder and CEO Charles Ergen is slated to speak late Tuesday at a JPMorgan technology conference in Boston. Braxton Carter, chief financial officer of T-Mobile US (TMUS), commented on the Dish-Amazon rumors at the same conference on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon stock is extended from an 843.94 buy point and an 860.96 alternate entry. Amazon is listed on the IBD Leaderboard, along with Dell Technologies, Workday and Alibaba Group. IBD's Leaderboard follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, up to the point where they start topping. Dish has cobbled together nearly 95 MHz of radio spectrum. Dish could still pursue a 5G mobile video strategy apart from an IoT deal with Amazon, the report says. Rollins says Dish would likely retain full control and ownership of the network and spectrum assets as part of any Amazon deal.Verizon has been viewed as a possible buyer of Dish and its spectrum. Dish stock could take a hit, depending on the terms of a deal with Amazon, Rollins said.""Investors in Dish have been hoping for a sale of spectrum or the whole company for some time, and could be disappointed by this (Amazon) development,"" Rollins said. ""If the details of the arrangement are not known, especially any terms around control of the spectrum long-term, this is likely to create confusion for the asset value story. This could lead to a shareholder rotation, with more speculative owners exiting should a near-term sale appear less likely. An injection of funding, however, could mitigate the bearish opinion that Dish cannot fund the construction of a network and would face material cash burn over time.""Dish stock rose 0.1% to 63.86 in the stock market today.

11,DISH,"If meal delivery service companies could package the aromas their recipes create, and somehow relay those to first-time users, I'm convinced sales of meal kits would be even hotter than they are now.Meal kits — recipes and ingredients packaged in precise quantities, usually shipped to your home by companies like Blue Apron (APRN), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) — already have a curiosity appeal, despite plenty of reasons not to like them. They take considerable work. The prices aren't exactly alluring. And like any new industry, several bugs remain in the system.Yet many people try them. And once you get a whiff of your first precisely concocted meal, it's all over. I've made meals from cookbooks as well as from scratch, and they've never smelled this good — even when I followed the recipe to a T. With meal kits, the appealing scent was always there — without fail. I began to wonder if they were manufactured.These aromas put a rose-colored tint on most everything I did when it came to meal kits, even when I botched my end of it. They make the meals taste better. They create the illusion you're a good cook. And for many Americans, they help make the time and money seem worthwhile.It's clear meal delivery service companies have found a niche. How big is this business? Statistics portal Statista says meal kits generated $1 billion in revenue worldwide in 2015 and will hit $10 billion by 2020. Packaged Facts put meal kit revenue at $5 billion last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseData analytics company Nielsen released data in March that showed 9% of U.S. consumers, or 10.5 million households, bought a meal kit in the prior six months. Another 25% of consumers, or 30.1 million households, said they would consider trying one in the next six months.I am now one of the 9%. In all, I tried six different meal kit companies over the past few months, and made 26 individual meals. I spent $287.51 of my company's money, or $11.06 per plate. I came away thinking this is a good idea — particularly since everyone I told about this story was curious about it.Still, there were questions. Can meal delivery service companies compete as retail giants enter the market? Walmart and Amazon.com are both selling meal kits, suggesting future price pressures. How long can smaller players like Blue Apron hold up? Shares of Blue Apron jumped nearly 6% Monday, but the stock remained at 3.21 a share. Walmart, meanwhile, is around 83 a share while Amazon is at an other-worldly 1,723.79.With a market basket full of competitors — and not a lot to distinguish one from the other — the business will only get more cutthroat as they jockey for position. Who can survive the shakeout?Meal-kit deliveries are somewhere on the cost spectrum between buying the ingredients yourself at a grocery store and going to a restaurant. In fact, some say meal kits are meant to be the bridge between the two, though market forces are moving it closer to the grocery store.A Chef'd chicken Marsala meal, shipped by Amazon, goes for $12.45 a plate. That's 31% cheaper than the $17.99 I'd pay for the same dish at the fairly nice Italian eatery in my neighborhood.But a meal delivery service is considerably more expensive than buying only the ingredients I needed at my local supermarket. The market price would've only come to $8.33 a head — that is, if you could buy only the amounts you need. On Planet Earth, they won't let you do that. So you'd need to make the dish two or three times — replenishing some ingredients along the way — to get that price. In addition to meal kits from Blue Apron, Amazon and Walmart, consumers can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of companies, including Home Chef, HelloFresh, Freshly, Sun Basket, Plated, Green Chef, Terra's Kitchen and PeachDish.Lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart is behind Martha & Marley Spoon. Even New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady is jumping in the game by partnering with a veggie-oriented service called Purple Carrot.Meal-kit discounts are getting more plentiful, so the margins are bound to get tighter for them all. You wonder why any company would make the effort, particularly if the cost curve is getting steeper.So far, only one pure-play meal kit provider in the U.S. has gone public, Blue Apron, and its stock is trading near 3, down 72% from its 11 IPO price in June 2017. Blue Apron has yet to turn a profit, and its sales have declined in the past two quarters.HelloFresh is traded on public markets, but only on its home court in Germany. After some ups and downs, the stock has a 2018 gain of 9%. Sales growth is strong, but like Blue Apron, the company is not yet profitable.At first blush, shelling out money for the privilege of slaving over a hot stove seemed unappealing when I could pay just a little more for someone else to do that for me at a restaurant. Not only do they place a meal before me, they do so while I'm sipping a cocktail.I also don't do that much cooking at my house. I do a lot of eating, as evidenced by my formidable girth. And don't get me wrong, I can cook. I grew up in a family that did a lot of work in restaurants. I just don't cook much anymore. It's one of many reasons my wife should be considered for sainthood.Third, my local grocery store — Ralphs, a California chain owned by Kroger (KR) — is less than one block away from my house. Ordering something online and having it delivered seems supremely lazy given my geographical situation, and waistline. But should I get even cheaper and lazier, my local store says it may soon be among the Ralphs stores offering prepackaged meal kits from Home Chef. And I hear the prices may be more inviting.That said, there's plenty to like about meal kits. It's not just the smells. The tastes were quite good, too. There wasn't a bad meal, even though I fumbled the cooking chores a couple of times.The aim of meal kits is to make cooking simple. If you can read, you can cook using this method. You just have to follow directions, which shouldn't be that hard.One plus is you're introduced to cuisine you normally wouldn't cook. Instead of Tuesday's rubber chicken, you can have the elegant-sounding Steak Moutarde with roasted sweet potato wedges. Still insist on poultry? They can dress that up, too. There's the aforementioned chicken Marsala with Linguine and roasted broccoli with goat cheese on the side. No rubber included.You also might encounter a wealth of new ingredients and tastes you never knew existed. Ever heard of Gochujang red pepper sauce? How about shredded Chihuahua cheese? I discovered those, plus Tumari sauce, Fregola Sarda Pasta and a cooking wine known as Verjus Blanc. What's great is if you find you don't like any of these, you're only allotted what you need for that meal. No waste.Further, you get a certain satisfaction from cooking the meal yourself. People who never thought they could cook probably will discover they can.Guys can fool their girlfriends into thinking they're debonair, at least for an evening.

13,DISH,"Comcast (CMCSA) launched a takeover bid for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) on Wednesday, offering $65 billion in cash for Rupert Murdoch's entertainment company and at a 19% premium over Walt Disney's (DIS) offer.Comcast's takeover bid had been expected in the wake of AT&T's (T) court victory late Tuesday that cleared its purchase of Time Warner (TWX). The nation's largest cable TV firm has been waiting for a ruling on the AT&T-Time Warner merger before announcing a formal bid for Fox.Comcast, which also owns NBCUniversal, has already bid $31 billion for satellite TV broadcaster Sky, in which Fox holds a 39% stake.Disney, however, in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in broadcaster Sky — for $54.4 billion in an all-stock deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

A much smaller Comcast tried to buy Disney in 2004 but was rebuffed.Meanwhile, AT&T fell 6% to 32.22, despite its court victory. One analyst said AT&T's fall may be tied to arbitrage over the Time Warner transaction.

16,DISH,"The rally in cellphone tower stocks could lose steam, says brokerage Raymond James, which on Monday downgraded American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) on valuation and merger speculation.Ric Prentiss, a Raymond James analyst, downgraded American Tower and SBA Communications to outperform from ""strong buy"" and Crown Castle to market-perform from outperform.""The prospects of an improving U.S. tower leasing environment and lower interest rates have paved the way for an impressive start for tower stocks in 2017 with year-to-date total returns of 19%, 24% and 30% for Crown Castle, American Tower and SBA Communications,"" Prentiss said in a report.Prentiss added that he's ""taking some chips off the table,"" with valuation multiples expanded ""to the upper range of their historical levels.""American Tower lost 0.8% to 129.18, Crown Castle was up marginally to 102.21 and SBA slid 1.4% to 132.42 on the stock market today.Wireless phone companies such as AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) rent tower space to house radio antennas. Most towers house radio antennas from multiple carriers.Prentiss notes speculation that Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) could agree to merge. If approved, a Sprint merger with T-Mobile would eliminate one customer of the tower companies.IBD'S TAKE: Both Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pay dividends. REIT stocks perform well when interest rates are low. IBD's Finance-Property REIT group ranks just No. 80 out of 197 industry groups amid worries that interest rates could rise. Learn about other dividend-paying alternatives at IBD's Income Investor. ""The prospect of such a deal receiving regulatory approval are far from certain but tower stocks have historically traded down on carrier consolidation deal announcements,"" Prentiss added.One long-term wild card for tower stocks is the deployment of 5G wireless services. Verizon has stated that it plans to be a leader in next-generation 5G wireless services, which will require ""small-cell"" technology in urban areas.RELATED:Amazon, Dish Wireless Deal Would Target Internet Of Things: CitiT-Mobile: 'Capital Structure' Would Be Key In Sprint Merger

Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN)-Dish Network (DISH) rumors swirled again.Stock futures initially fell Thursday evening after initial exit polls predicted that Conservatives would fall short. But futures gradually firmed somewhat.Futures for the Dow industrials rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed nearly 0.2% while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.1% above fair value.Conservatives ended up with roughly 318 seats, down modestly from 330 before the election and less than the 326 seats needed for an outright majority. Labour should get 261 seats, a big rise, as most third parties lost ground.That would create a hung Parliament. However, Northern Ireland unionists, with 10 seats under the DUP, are set to provide enough support to give Conservatives control via a minority government.When May called the early election this spring, the Conservatives started with a huge lead, with most analysts betting that the ruling party would amass a sweeping majority and a freer hand in Brexit negotiations with the European Union.Now political uncertainty is heightened just before Brexit negotiations are supposed to get underway. Even though Conservatives likely will retain control of Parliament, May not be able to hang on as PM for long. But she apparently will fight to stay on for now.It's also unclear what direction Brexit will take if a handful of anti-EU hardliners or those who favor a ""soft""  Brexit hold the process hostage.The DUP itself supports a ""comprehensive free trade and customs agreement"" with the EU, suggesting it wants a deal that retains as much access to the single market as possible.

20,DISH,"Many advisors favor a holistic approach to financial planning. But some take holistic to a whole new level.If they see an opening to help clients enhance their health and wellness, some advisors jump at the chance. They may define their role in expansive terms — as enabling individuals to lead better, richer lives.Coaching clients to improve their well-being may seem to fall outside an advisor's purview. But one's financial and physical health can go hand-in-hand.""As an advisor, you have to walk a fine line between providing wellness coaching and therapy,"" said Chuck Markham, an investment advisor in Vernon, N.J. ""You need to recommend a medical professional"" if a client presents more serious physical or psychological maladies.Given his background as a licensed professional counselor (LPC), Markham is attuned to mental health issues that beset others. If he senses that a client can benefit from a therapist or other medical provider, he may offer a referral.In most cases, however, polite questioning can in itself forge a bond. If clients mention their weight problem, for example, Markham might ask, ""Is there anything you can't do because of your weight?""If they express disappointment that they can no longer enjoy hiking or travel, he might propose action steps.""I'll coach them to choose among diet plans and see their doctor,"" he said. ""But that's only if they bring it up. If they don't, we won't introduce it as a problem.""As a general rule, Markham avoids giving unsolicited lectures to clients about the need to improve their health and wellness. He does not want to raise sensitive matters that distract from financial planning.Yet his LPC training helps him pose gentle questions that can lead to breakthroughs. If a spouse arrives for an appointment and says, ""Sorry, but my husband is late again. He's always late,"" Markham might reply, ""Oh, why is he always late?""""She might talk about his poor health or some other problem,"" he said. ""If she does, I might ask, 'Is this something you'd feel comfortable having me follow up about?' They may not expect their financial person to do all this other stuff, so I'll ask their permission"" to get more involved.For advisors who want to dish out wellness tips, positioning themselves as role models and preaching about their healthy lifestyle rarely proves persuasive. And berating clients for their poor stress management or self-destructive habits may drive them away for good.Savvy advisors find creative, nonthreatening ways to raise health issues with clients. Technology platforms can prove a good starting point.Danielle Howard, a certified financial planner in Basalt, Colo., asks clients to complete a ""financial satisfaction survey"" by Money Quotient, a nonprofit that provides financial life planning tools. If their answers reveal anxiety about finances, she might ask, ""What kind of exercise are you getting to combat stress?""If they admit they need to exercise more, Howard might suggest daily walks, yoga or other activities. For client meetings, she sometimes says, ""Instead of sitting here in our conference room, do you want to walk and talk?""""We're in the middle of the Rocky Mountains with lots of parks around here, so it's easy to walk outside,"" she added.To reinforce the importance of health and well-being, Howard sponsors luncheons that feature guest speakers such as physicians and wellness experts. Geared for women, the sessions are open to the public. But she also invites clients to attend.""When I introduce the speaker, I try to tie their topic to financial wellness,"" Howard said. ""It's all part of creating holistic life wellness.""Some advisors go further to link their discussions about wellness directly to a client's financial future. Emphasizing that a healthier lifestyle can cut health care costs, they may prod clients to rethink their daily routine.Niv Persaud, an Atlanta-based certified financial planner, asks clients questions such as, ""Do you belong to a fitness center?"", ""Do you have a personal trainer?"" and ""Do you dine out often?""""It might be framed in terms of helping the client address the cost of long-term care,"" she said. ""Unhealthy living catches up with you, and in-home care can be expensive.""Persaud finds that clients respond forthrightly, even when they admit unhealthy habits. Radiating a positive attitude, she may refer them to a professional wellness instructor or other resource.""My clients are not sheepish in answering my questions,"" she said. ""They know it is part of a larger framework.""RELATED:Advisors Fight Off Burnout By Finding Ways To Break From Routine

Keysight stock has a technical buy point of 39.46 after forming a cup chart pattern. The Electronics-Scientific Manufacturing group ranks No. 7 out of 197 industry groups.

22,DISH,"Ahead of its earnings report, Walt Disney's (DIS) quarterly story remains something of a split personality, as its studio segment boasts more hits but its media networks unit — notably ESPN — encounters obstacles.Questions over its recent talent bloodletting at the sports cable network will now likely add to by-now-routine scrutiny over its subscriber figures when the media conglomerate reports after the close Tuesday.For Disney's fiscal second quarter, Street analysts are looking for profit and revenue growth of 4% to $1.41 a share and $13.45 billion, respectively.Late last month, ESPN laid off about 100 of its on-air talent, as network chief John Skipper said that the network navigates ""changes in technology and fan behavior."" Subscriber loss concerns continue to dog the network.A shift in viewership habits and the proliferation of online platforms have, over the years, hit media companies where it hurts: paid subscriptions and advertising revenue.Last week, HBO and Warner Bros. parent Time Warner (TWX) reported a decline in advertising revenue at its Turner network, while Viacom (VIAB) shares dove, despite a beat, amid concerns that its flagships channels were losing ground in distribution.Notably, ""three of four biggest weekly sell-offs in media in the last decade have happened in the last three years, which shows the degree of uncertainty that has crept into the sector,"" wrote Barclays media analyst Kannan Venkateshwar.Additionally: Hulu, of which Disney is a joint owner, launched on Wednesday a live-TV beta service that promises around 50 channels for $39.99 a month, adding to the fray of over-the-top ""skinny"" bundle providers that includes Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue.21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and Time Warner also have stakes in Hulu.Disney shares fell 0.5% to 111.42 on Monday, still below a 112.09 buy point after undercutting that level last week. Viacom slipped 1.1% after diving 13.5% last week. Fox dropped 2.5% Monday, on top of its 4.6% weekly loss.IBD's TAKE: It's not all doom and gloom for media companies in the subscriber wars. There's one — perhaps surprising — media company that is still adding accounts while others bleed subscriptions.Disney's media networks unit makes up the bulk of total revenue — over 42% in the December-ended quarter — which is why ESPN alone receives so much attention. And the strength of the legacy sports news brand may not carry as much weight in the future.""In every evolution of OTT, the number of clicks needs to get to a program guide or a network viewing option is actually increasing,"" said Venkateshwar in his broad note on U.S. media. ""Given the importance of consumer inertia in usage patterns, this is not a trivial shift.""The interface of streaming platforms also means that coverage is divvied up by content and not by network, he added.""Instead, the default interface is organized by sport and/or teams... . As a result, it is tough to see the brands of individual networks retaining any value in the coming years,"" wrote Venkateshwar.But Disney still has some tricks up its sleeve.ESPN and BAMTech are slated to launch a direct-to-consumer sports streaming service ""probably"" this calendar year, said CEO Bob Iger in the company's most recent earnings call, though it is designed to be a supplement — and not a replacement — to the main ESPN network. Disney has a one-third stake in streaming technology firm BAMTech.And massive hits for Disney's studio segment as well as optimistic projections for its movie pipeline, which is packed with ""Star Wars,"" Marvel and Pixar films, have some analysts staying bullish.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has so far earned over $427.6 million globally, debuting domestically this past weekend with a $145 million haul, according to Box Office Mojo. And Disney's March release of ""Beauty and the Beast"" remains the U.S. box office leader in 2017 with $487.6 million domestically, for a total of $1.19 billion worldwide.""We continue to be buyers of Disney as we believe the robust film slate will continue to broaden the company's moat and drive significant value across key segments,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers on Sunday. He has an overweight rating on the stock.RELATED:Viacom Tries To Calm Fears Its Channels Are Losing DistributionBig Media Stocks Unfazed Even As Hollywood Came To Brink Of StoppageIf You Think Netflix, Amazon Disrupted Hollywood, You'll Love Snap, FacebookESPN On-Air-Talent Layoffs Double What Was Expected

23,DISH,"X Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), CBS (CBS), Viacom (VIAB), Comcast (CMCSA) and other big companies sold off on cable advertising concerns. Meanwhile, Hulu, the streaming platform jointly backed by four major media conglomerates, has officially entered the live-television fray with a more-than-50-channel bundle, priced at $39.99 a month.Time Warner (TWX) said Wednesday that advertising revenue fell 2% in the first quarter vs. a year earlier, with declines continuing the quarter. Comcast said last week that its NBCUniversal ad revenue fell in Q1. Pay-TV operators suffered big subscriber losses in Q1 as well.CBS tumbled 3.35% on the stock market today. Disney lost 2.4%, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Viacom reversed sharply to sink 7.5%, below its 200-day line. Fox sold off 5.1%. Comcast sank 2%, closing just below a buy point cleared after reporting earnings. Dish Network (DISH) fell 4.4% and Charter Communications (CHTR) 3.9%, both undercutting their 50-day lines. Time Warner, which is being acquired by AT&T (T), dipped 0.3%. AT&T slid 1.4% to a five-month low.Meanwhile, Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins announced the live-TV service's beta launch at its annual upfronts presentation Wednesday, calling it a ""natural extension of our business.""Disney, Fox, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Time Warner all have a stake in Hulu, which explains its fairly comprehensive channel offerings, such as ABC, NBC, Fox, E!, Bravo, USA, TBS, CNN and CNBC. The service also includes access to the platform's streaming library.Live sports stations are also part of the basket. The live service includes NBC Sports, CBS Sports Network, Fox Sports channels, TNT and a number of different ESPN stations.Like rival products from Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue and Dish Network's Sling TV, Hulu's package isn't all-encompassing, although it does include CBS (CBS), which has been building out its own over-the-top streaming presence through CBS All Access.As Vulture points out, the Hulu bundle lacks AMC Networks (AMCX) channels and Viacom-owned MTV, Comedy Central and VH1.For comparison, Vue's comparably priced $39.99-a-month Access tier, the most basic of four levels, offers around 45 channels. (Its high-end $74.99-a-month Ultra level includes 90 channels, including HBO and Showtime.) Sling's $25 monthly Blue-level subscription includes 45 channels but no CBS or ESPN.Hulu's service includes 50 hours of recorded storage, but 200 more hours in ""enhanced cloud DVR"" will run subscribers an extra $14.99 a month. Vue offers unlimited cloud DVR storage for 28 days. YouTube TV, from Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, has launched a $35-a-month service in several major cities with no cloud storage limits either.Both CBS and Viacom report quarterly results Thursday.

24,DISH,"Drugmakers and financial services firms look like attractive investments after years of being beaten down, said Charles Pohl, a manager of the Dodge & Cox Balanced Fund (DODBX), during a panel session Thursday at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago.Financial services are the $15.8 billion mutual fund's largest sector, with 29% of shareholder money as of March 31.That mutual fund is exposed to foreign financials, including ADRs of Netherlands-based Aegon (AEG), which provides insurance, pension and asset management. It also hold bonds from the U.K.'s Barclays (BCS), which provides banking and other financial services, as well as France's BNP Paribas.Still, the fund's financial services exposure is mainly U.S. based, though those holdings do business globally. The fund's top four holdings are U.S. stocks Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Capital One Financial (COF).In the panel discussion occurring on the conference's first full day, Pohl said rising rates in the U.S. are a tailwind. So are gradually easing regulatory burdens abroad.Noriko Chen, a manager of $63.3 billion American Funds New Perspective (ANWPX), agreed, pointing out that political pressures beating down on financials globally have created buying opportunities.Swiss-based insurer Chubb (CB) is a top-25 holding. So is Hong Kong-based AIA Group, which provides life insurance and other financial services.An aging population is a key factor in making pharmaceutical companies attractive.Among pharmaceuticals, ADRs of France's Sanofi (SNY) and Switzerland's Novartis (NVS) are in the top 10 of Pohl's fund. Britain and Sweden's AstraZeneca (AZN) is also a holding.Chen said she also likes certain state-owned enterprises (SOEs) whose home-country governments mandate that the firms pay relatively hefty dividends. Some of those dividend yields in China and Brazil are 25% or higher, she said.Forty-two percent of her fund's assets are foreign stocks. Fourteen percent are domiciled in the Asia/Pacific region.Panelist Amit Wadhwaney of Moerus Capital Management, another value-oriented investor, said he likes British-based Coats Group, the world's largest manufacturer of thread. He likes its pricing power and elastic demand. Shares have climbed 113% the past 12 months vs. 14% for the S&P 500.His firm's taste for stocks with strength and staying power is reflected in its name, the first word of which is a Latin reference to a city's defensive walls. He manages the young and tiny $21.4 million Moerus Worldwide Value Fund (MOWIX).RELATED:What's Going On At The Morningstar Conference

25,DISH,"X President Trump's political woes sent the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite tumbling, but not for long. But Alibaba (BABA) and other China internet stocks rallied on generally upbeat reports. Dow retailers Wal-Mart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) had strong results, but many other retailers are struggling. Dow tech giant Cisco Systems (CSCO) sold off on its weak guidance.An ongoing stream of damaging media reports took their toll on President Trump, raising concerns that he'll be too distracted or too weak to push tax cuts through this year, if at all. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 fell 1.8% on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.6%. But stocks slashed losses on Thursday and Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 off 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.6%. Credit Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and the other FANG+ stocks, along with Alibaba (BABA) and other Chinese internets.Alibaba's Q1 EPS rose 37% to 63 cents, but missed the consensus by 3 cents as tax expenses and spending on its entertainment and cloud computing businesses ramped up. Revenue jumped 60% to $5.61 billion, beating views. The Chinese e-commerce giant also OK'd a $6 billion buyback. Shares rose 0.5% Thursday after falling 5% early, then rose to a record high on Friday. On Wednesday, archrival Tencent (TCEHY) reported EPS surged 57% in local currency to 22 cents, beating by a penny, as revenue popped 55% $7.18 billion.

Shares dived 12% on Wednesday, but were up 8.6% for the week.Target (TGT) earnings fell 6% while sales dipped 1% to $16.02 billion, but those were not as bad as feared. Comps skidded 1.3% but better than the expected 3.7% tumble. Shares rose Wednesday but finished the week up just 0.4%, still close to five-year lows. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Q1 profit unexpectedly ticked up 2% to $1 a share, surprising Street estimates for a 2% dip, though 1.4% sales growth to $117.54 billion just missed. Still, U.S. same-store sales rose, unlike Target and many other retailers. The megastore credited organic growth at Walmart.com for its 63% boost in U.S. online sales, although it also acquired two e-commerce properties, Moosejaw and ModCloth, during the quarter. Wal-Mart shares rose 4.1% to a two-year best.Cisco Systems (CSCO) adjusted fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 5% to 60 cents, beating views by 2 cents. Revenue fell 1% to $11.94 billion, above estimates but the sixth straight year-over-year decline as the networking giant transitions from sluggish switch and router hardware to software and security. Current-quarter revenue guidance was far short of forecasts, in part because of concerns that President Trump's economic and tax agenda has stalled.Cisco shares fell 6.7% for the week.Home Depot (HD) reported first-quarter earnings that beat estimates, making it one of the few retailers that isn't cracking under the weight of e-commerce, discounts, discounters, too many stores and not enough traffic. The home-improvement chain hiked its full-year EPS forecast, which was still below expectations. Home Depot shares hit a record high Tuesday but dipped 0.4% for the week. Rival Lowe's (LOW), which reports next week, lost 0.3%, but in buy range.The semiconductor equipment manufacturer's second-quarter profit rose 132% while sales climbed 45% to $3.55 billion, both better than expected.

The off-price chain said it is introducing a home-fashions concept to the U.S. this year. Ross Stores (ROST) pulled ahead of estimates with 82 cents in per-share profit and $3.3 billion in sales. Comps grew 3%. But Q2 profit guidance missed, and full-year EPS outlook was a little light. Off-price retailers have typically been gems, but both TJX and Ross are trading below their 50-day moving averages amid a greater retail shudder. TJX shares fell 3.9% for the week. Ross rose Friday, paring its week loss to 2%.Computer-aided design software firm Autodesk (ADSK) saw its stock surge 14.7% to record levels Friday after it beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter ended April 30. Autodesk lost 16 cents a share excluding items on revenue of $486 million, when analysts were looking for it to lose 24 cents a share ex items on sales of $470.4 million. The San Rafael, Calif.-based company is taking a revenue hit as it continues its business model transition from licensed software to cloud computing services.

It earned 88 cents a share excluding items, up 9%, on sales of $680 million, up 12%. Wall Street was expecting 86 cents and $672 million. But shares fell nearly 4.65% for the week.Jack in the Box (JACK) earnings beat Q1 forecasts, and the burger chain said it was looking at ""potential alternatives"" with regards to Qdoba, its fast-casual Mexican chain. CEO Lenny Comma said that over the past year it ""has become apparent"" that the company's valuation ""is being impacted by having two different business models.""

The Golden Arches announced the expansion of its delivery service to Los Angeles, Phoenix, Chicago and Columbus, Ohio.Sears Holdings (SHLD) CEO Eddie Lampert said on the corporate blog that speculations on the ailing retailer's potential demise had hurt business. Lampert also said that tool supplier One World, seeking to get out of its contract with Sears, had threatened to sue the retailer and had sought to embarrass them. The CEO said Sears ""has paid and continues to make all payments to One World"" and that it would defend itself against any legal action. Sears shares sank 17.4%.The pharmacy and wireless markets could be the next Amazon (AMZN) next targets. An unconfirmed report that the online giant is seeking to break into the drug-dispensing business weighed on Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), CVS Health (CVS) midweek. But it may not be smooth sailing for the online giant in this competitive space, Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes wrote that the established players have access to discounted drugs that Amazon is unlikely to beat and already offer drug delivery by mail. Plus, the regulatory and infrastructure hurdles to building out a pharmacy business are high. Amazon is also said to be in talks with Dish Network (DISH) over a wireless partnership.

27,DISH,"If T-Mobile US (TMUS) is in the catbird seat — able to take its pick of potential merger partners or walk away from any deal it chooses — that raises the question of how it got there.The answer is simple. It has outsmarted and outperformed the other three national wireless service providers — AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Sprint (S) — over the past four years.""T-Mobile's continued growth in the face of the industry's struggles ensures that T-Mobile will be the belle of the M&A ball,"" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Moffett Nathanson.T-Mobile's success is due largely to its relentless ""Uncarrier""-branded marketing campaign and price discounts. T-Mobile also upgraded its wireless network, closing the performance gap with Verizon, whose advertising for years has touted its top-rated network.In the March 2017 quarter, T-Mobile revenue climbed 11% to $9.6 billion, while wireless revenue at AT&T fell 4.4% to $17.2 billion and Verizon's slid 5% to $20.8 billion. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers — the highest-spending ones in the industry — while Verizon lost 289,000 and AT&T shed 348,000. Sprint has yet to report.It's gotten to the point where Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), which owns T-Mobile, may no longer be interested in exiting the U.S.With a government auction of radio spectrum owned by local TV broadcasters completed, telecom companies are again free to engage in strategic talks. Regulators banned negotiations among bidders during a quiet period that ended April 27.Moffett says that T-Mobile can explore a merger with Sprint, satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) or a cable TV company. More important, it can keep its options open.""They are arguably the only company that can make a credible case that remaining independent is a viable option,"" Moffett said in a report. ""Any negotiator worth their salt will say that the most important success factor in any negotiation is having the option of saying no and walking away. T-Mobile has that.""T-Mobile won the lion's share of airwaves in the spectrum auction, spending $8 billion to capture 31 megahertz of low-band airwaves. Dish was close behind, spending $6.2 billion to buy 18 MHz of spectrum on average nationally.While Dish looms as a strategic or merger partner, T-Mobile now has enough of its own spectrum to stay independent, analysts say. T-Mobile says it can match or better the wireless data speeds of Verizon and AT&T.T-Mobile also has enough spectrum to continue offering unlimited data services to subscribers, analysts say. AT&T and Verizon in the March quarter reintroduced unlimited data plans in the March quarter to combat market-share gains by T-Mobile and Sprint. T-Mobile slashed prices on its unlimited data plans in August.T-Mobile has employed an ""Uncarrier"" advertising campaign, aimed at setting itself apart from the bigger AT&T and Verizon. T-Mobile in 2013 shook up the industry with no-contract, monthly financing plans for mobile phone purchases. It later offered free music and video streaming, free international roaming, and other perks.The payback has been big, analysts say. T-Mobile ended the March 2017 quarter with 55.5 million branded customers, more than double the 26.1 million branded subscribers it had just four years earlier.In 2017, T-Mobile has forecast branded postpaid subscriber additions in the range of 2.8 million to 3.5 million.""T-Mobile's promotions have been highly successful and show no signs of slowing down,"" said Jim Breen, an analyst at William Blair. ""We expect the carrier to continue to gain share from the rest of the industry.""T-Mobile has been expanding its number of U.S. stores, including those of prepaid brand MetroPCS, to outdo AT&T and Verizon on the retail front.In the first quarter, T-Mobile reported positive free cash flow of $185 million vs. a negative $310 million a year earlier. T-Mobile has forecast free-cash-flow growth from $1.4 billion in 2016 to about $4.5 billion in 2019.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile shares broke out of flat base on April 24 and have been rising ever since. The wireless carrier now has the No. 1 ranking among stocks in IBD's Telecom Services-Wireless Group, with a Composite Rating of 97 out of a possible 99. T-Mobile stock hit new all-time highs after it reported first-quarter earnings that topped expectations. And its stock has shot up 750% since mid-2012.Parent Deutsche Telekom almost cashed out in 2011. The German phone company agreed to sell T-Mobile to AT&T for $39 billion, but federal regulators opposed the deal. T-Mobile gained $4 billion in cash and radio spectrum in breakup fees — helping to fund a rebound.Japan-based Softbank in October 2012 bought a controlling stake in struggling Sprint. Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son pursued a Sprint merger with T-Mobile, but the Obama administration made it clear that it wanted a U.S. wireless market with four national players. A Sprint merger with T-Mobile would create a three-player market, including Verizon and AT&T.Softbank and Deutsche Telekom shelved Sprint-T-Mobile merger talks in mid-2014.Shares in Sprint and T-Mobile jumped in November after Republican Donald Trump's election as president on views that a merger could be approved. But some analysts say the Department of Justice could still block a deal, saying consumers are benefiting from an ongoing price war. And the Department of Justice may want to preserve T-Mobile's status as a maverick in the industry.Son in February said that he would be willing to let Deutsche Telekom hold a controlling stake if T-Mobile and debt-laden Sprint combined.Many suitors have been proposed for a T-Mobile marriage. Comcast, the nation's biggest cable TV firm, could afford T-Mobile but maybe not much bigger Verizon, analysts say. Comcast, though, seems leery of pushing into wireless amid an industry price war.""We expect M&A chatter to pick up, and we expect T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom to play a key role — as either a seller or a buyer,"" said Jennifer Fritzsche, a Wells Fargo analyst, in a report.While putting a big deal on hold, there's speculation that T-Mobile could buy a smaller, regional carrier, such as United States Cellular (USM), to expand into rural areas.T-Mobile CEO John Legere, on the company's April 25 earnings call, discussed some of the possibilities.""I think Dish has access to good content and spectrum,"" Legere said. ""I think Sprint has an awful lot of scale and a good customer base and something that would be interesting to take a look at.""He emphasized that T-Mobile is not under pressure to pull off a deal.""The inorganic and organic possibilities for the company are tremendous,"" he added. ""And, it's great to enter this kind of period not from a hostage standpoint. But we are interested in looking at some of the possibilities.""RELATED:Will DirecTV, Bundling Strategy Come To AT&T's Rescue?Could Verizon, Comcast Unite In A Merger Of Equals?Wrong Number: Verizon Earnings Miss Amid Big Subscriber Loss

This guidance corresponds to free cash flow growth from $1.4 billion in 2016 to about $4.5 billion in 2019,"" Breen said in a reportThe cell carrier said it earned 80 cents in adjusted first-quarter earnings, including 32 cents from spectrum gains and tax benefits, vs. a 56-cent profit in the year-ago period.

30,DISH,"Accountability is about expectations, whether you're in business or the military. If you expect something from one of your people for a project, but he or she doesn't deliver on time, it's a problem.""I'll be disappointed, and it spreads negativity,"" Lee Ellis, a retired Air Force pilot who runs a leadership consulting and training firm, told IBD. ""In the military, lives depend on keeping promises and commitments.""Here's how to build that principle into your group's culture:Think team first. Ellis, founder and president of Atlanta-based Leadership Freedom, is advising a company that has an employee who is talented but isn't accountable for delivering projects on time. That causes disruptions to the whole team.""When people are not delivering, it throws a monkey wrench into everything and messes up the team,"" said Ellis, who wrote in ""Engage With Honor"" about building accountability.Spell it out. Be clear about what your firm values, what it expects from people and which behaviors it won't tolerate, says Joe Tye, CEO and head coach at Solon, Iowa-based leadership coaching firm Values Coach. Tye works with Midland Memorial Hospital in Midland, Texas. It specifies 12 core values that it then can hold people accountable to achieve.""That helps people do their jobs better,"" Tye said. ""But it also shows them how to be better people, and that helps them become a better employee.""Make your bed. Naval Adm. William McRaven told University of Texas graduates in his 2014 commencement speech that he learned in SEAL basic training the importance of making your bed right, first thing in the morning. The idea, McRaven said, was to accomplish the first task of the day. That gives a sense of pride and motivates people to polish off other tasks through the day. And it shows that the little things matter.""If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed,"" McRaven said in that speech.Ellis learned plenty of military lessons himself about the importance of accountability and doing the small stuff. The person who packed his parachute had to do it right every time.""If he didn't do his job, I'd be killed,"" Ellis said. ""In the military, the first thing you learn is there are no excuses.""Rely on rituals. Midland Memorial Hospital has a 14-minute ""huddle"" each morning for department leaders and any others who want to join. They recite a pledge to turn each complaint into a blessing and to avoid wasting time on blaming others and complaining.""Every day it's repeated throughout the hospital,"" Tye said. ""It's not just the words, it's the way people embrace them. If you can get people to take pride in their attitude and not being toxic, you wouldn't be seeing some of the negative things you're seeing today.""Do it right. The Veterans Health Administration held people accountable for limiting patient appointment wait times to 14 days. A scandal ensued because employees were falsifying records to make it look like they were meeting those goals. The VHA later said that the 14-day target gave employees incentive to act improperly. Instead, build accountability into the culture so peers push others to act appropriately, Tye says.Check the mirror. Make sure you're doing what you said you'd do, too.""You can't let yourself off the hook and make excuses,"" Ellis said. ""It's being brutally committed.""Dish out consequences. If one of your employees continuously drops the ball on projects and deadlines, meet with the person to figure out the problem, explain the effect on other team members and make it clear that's not acceptable. It might mean helping to set priorities. If the person's performance doesn't change, move him to a different role or get him out.""But you can't let it go,"" Ellis said. ""I learned years ago, when you're not comfortable with a situation, move toward it and make it better.""MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:8 Ideas For Refreshing Your Message To CustomersPower To Persuade Starts With Connecting To Others' AttitudesLeave The Office To Spread Your Message — And Hear What Others Have To Say

""Some might argue that this is a sign that a Verizon deal is unlikely, however, we don't think that can really be concluded since Dish and Verizon haven't been able to hold discussions for more than a year due to the auction's anti-collusion rules.""Brett Feldman, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said: ""(Auction results) will sustain the debate over Dish's strategy for monetizing its licenses, including whether it is more likely to build a network or seek a strategic outcome.

33,DISH,"JPMorgan says a Verizon Communications (VZ) merger with Comcast (CMCSA) is not going to happen, while a deal combining Verizon and No. 2 cable firm Charter Communications (CHTR) looks unlikely, too.But telecom firms Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) are more likely to be in play, says the investment bank.""We believe a combination of Verizon and Charter is feasible but difficult on the financials, but Comcast's overall size and NBC ownership make a deal with Verizon a nonstarter as the regulatory review process would likely be quite difficult,"" JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick wrote Monday in a broad research report on telecom industry M&A scenarios.Comcast, Charter and other cable TV firms hold rights to lease access to Verizon's mobile network on a wholesale basis, under what's called an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement. Comcast plans to start wireless-services trials in mid-2017.Cusick says the cable TV firms and Verizon might try to forge a deeper partnership if an outright merger isn't doable, but he says that relationship likely would fray.IBD'S TAKE: Steel maker Nucor, Burlington Stores and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.""We don't believe that an MVNO structure will allow cable to be successful in wireless over time,"" he said.

But Sprint stock rose 2.8% and T-Mobile 1%. Comcast and Charter are both extended from November breakouts.JPMorgan assigns the highest probability (35%) to Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) proposing a merger, while it estimates a 15% chance that Comcast could bid for T-Mobile or Sprint.Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam recently commented on the ""industrial logic"" of a Verizon-cable industry tie-up. And in his 2017 industry predictions, T-Mobile CEO John Legere said a Verizon-Comcast merger could happen.JPMorgan, though, says Comcast likely has other ideas, especially if a Sprint merger with T-Mobile does not materialize. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), which owns 65% of T-Mobile, could roll its equity into a larger company, says JPMorgan.A Comcast purchase of T-Mobile would be bad news for AT&T (T) and Verizon, says Cusick, because it would ""cement"" an industry structure with four national players, rather than three. ""If the Sprint deal does not work out, a cable transaction becomes the next most likely event for T-Mobile,"" said Cusick in his report.

40,DISH,"AT&T (T) has agreed to acquire Straight Path Communications (STRP) for $1.25 billion, gaining high-frequency airwaves in the 28 GHz and 39 GHz millimeter wave band.The acquisition could be tied to AT&T's plans to provide 5G wireless services, analysts say. In the 39 GHz band, Straight Path owns spectrum in the 40 largest markets across the U.S., including New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta.AT&T agreed to pay 95.63 per share, a near-160% premium over Straight Path's closing price of 36.48 on Friday. Straight Path shot up 151% to 91.64 at the close.AT&T stock edged down 0.5% to 40.38 in the stock market today.Shares in satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), which has cobbled together nearly 80 MHz of mid-band spectrum, climbed Monday following the AT&T-Straight Path deal.Dish has been looking for a wireless partner. Macquarie Securities, in a report on Monday, said T-Mobile US (TMUS) parent Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) could be interested in acquiring Dish Network to boost its mobile video strategy.Including Straight Path liabilities, the deal has a total value of $1.6 billion, the companies said. The companies anticipate a closing within 12 months, subject to Federal Communications Commission review.AT&T is awaiting government approval of its $85 billion acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX).

41,DISH,"As competition mounts with AT&T (T) and others, Dish Network (DISH) is readying a new streaming device for its Sling internet video service that combines web TV with free over-the-air broadcast channels as well as Netflix (NFLX) programming.Dish Network's AirTV Player could debut at the CES trade show in January, analysts say.Analysts expect video-streaming competition to intensify in 2017, with Hulu, Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube and possibly Amazon.com (AMZN) launching new products, some with live TV programming. AT&T launched DirecTV Now, a mobile-first product in late November. Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner (TWX).Dish Network in November said its Sling service would be available on Comcast's X1 digital set-top boxes. Analysts say Sling may appeal to Comcast customers who want more international channels. Comcast's X1 platform also recently added a Netflix app.Dish Network stock edged up 2.1% to 59.58 on the stock market today. That's just above a 59.57 buy point, retaking that key level as it consolidates near that key level in recent days.Netflix rose 1.1% to 126.50, moving toward a buy point in a long base.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is a member of IBD's Leaderboard, with shares up 11% in 2016. Netflix stock has formed a large handle in a cup base going back a year, with a buy point of 129.39. Leaderboard follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping. Dish Network has not disclosed subscriber totals for the Sling service, launched in early 2015. Some analysts estimate Sling is nearing the 1 million mark for paying subscribers.The Sling service starts at $20 per month for about 30 channels, but several broadcast networks are missing from the basic package. Add-on packages cost $10. Netflix's service would also cost extra if consumers buy the AirTV Player device.AT&T's new DirecTV Now service starts at $35 a month. CBS (CBS) is missing from AT&T's broadcaster lineup.Dish Network's satellite TV subscriber base has been slowly shrinking. Dish Network had 13.64 million pay TV subscribers as of Sept. 30, including Sling customers, down from 13.91 million a year earlier. Dish Network has been looking for a wireless partner to launch mobile video services.RELATED:Will The Launch Of AT&T DirecTV Now Herald Net Neutrality's End?Hulu Live Service Gets Fox And Disney, Waiting On CBS, NBCU

42,DISH,"AT&T's (T) promotional pricing for its DirecTV Now mobile video service will end on Monday, but it'll still have a $35-per-month offer on the table for consumers as Hulu revs up its live-TV service, which the company has said will be priced ""under $40.""Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Time Warner (TWX) has a 10% stake in Hulu. AT&T has agreed to buy Time Warner for $85 billion, though President-elect Trump has stated opposition to that merger, fearing too much media strength is being concentrated in too few hands.AT&T launched its video streaming service in late November. While AT&T's ""Go Big"" package of 100-plus channels will cost $60, up from the promotional $35, starting Jan. 9, DirecTV Now will also offer a 60-channel package called ""Live a Little"" for $35.AT&T's ""Live a Little"" package still lacks CBS — which announced a deal with Hulu on Wednesday — and regional sports, but it still could prove a popular offer, says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.IBD'S TAKE: CBS is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Media-Diversified group. CBS stock has shot up since forming a cup-with-handle formation in September. Analysts say CBS content is coveted in video streaming packages. CBS could be a takeover target. Learn more about CBS at IBD Stock Checkup. ""Virtually all of the channels that anyone would really want, save for regional sports networks, are included in the $35 ""Live a Little"" package,"" said Moffett in a research report.""The step-up to $50 for the ""Just Right"" package is arguably a sensible one for a genuine sports fan, but the step-ups from there to the ""Go Big"" and ""Gotta Have It!"" packages, at $60 and $70 per month, respectively, are mostly for a bunch of filler,"" Moffett wrote.AT&T stock fell 2.1% in the stock market today to 41.26. CBS stock, which spiked to a nearly three-year high of 66.88 on Wednesday, fell 1.8% Friday to 64.30.AT&T sells Time Warner's HBO for $5 extra per month, down from its usual $10 to $15 fee. AT&T on Thursday said Time Warner will not need to transfer any of its FCC licenses to AT&T in order to continue to conduct its business operations after the deal closes. If that's the case, analysts say, regulatory approval of the merger could be smoother.It's not clear that Hulu will get all of CBS' programming. CBS, meanwhile, has its own streaming service, CBS All Access, which has over 1.2 million subscribers.Analysts estimate that Dish Networks' (DISH)Sling-branded streaming service, which starts at $20 monthly but with no broadcast channels, has nearly 1 million subscribers.The DirecTV Now streaming service could boost AT&T's wireless business, where growth has stalled amid continuing postpaid subscriber losses. AT&T will not count DirecTV Now streaming toward the monthly data caps of its own wireless subscribers.AT&T's DirecTV Now does not provide a cloud-based DVR service and limits users to two simultaneous video streams.RELATED:CBS, Hulu Officially Ink Deal For New Live-TV ServiceAT&T Taps Apple TV In Launching DirecTV Now Streaming-Video Service

Check out IBD's Income Investor for high-dividend-paying stocks.T-Mobile One unlimited data plans start at $70 for one subscriber; a four-line family plan costs $160 monthly. Taxes and fees will be included under the new T-Mobile One offer, the company said.The company's Uncarrier marketing campaign, launched in March 2013, has enabled T-Mobile to gain subscriber and revenue market share vs. AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Sprint (S). AT&T has been the biggest loser of postpaid phone subscribers.Analysts had estimated that T-Mobile would add 902,000 postpaid phone subscribers in Q4. Postpaid subscribers — those billed monthly — are more lucrative for carriers than prepaid users, who buy minutes as needed.T-Mobile added 1.29 million postpaid subscribers overall in Q4 2015, including tablet users, and 917,000 postpaid phone subscribers. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) controls T-Mobile US.T-Mobile stock fell 2.1% to 57.61 in the stock market today, a day after touching a record high of 59.46. T-Mobile stock jumped 47% in 2016, with most of the gain coming in Q4.Observers speculate Sprint and T-Mobile could renew merger talks during a Trump administration. Comcast (CMCSA) could also bid for T-Mobile, perhaps teaming with Charter Communications (CHTR), analysts say.T-Mobile, though, continues to outperform rivals on its own.T-Mobile in October reported higher-than-expected Q3 profit and raised full-year EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).Jennifer Fritzche, a Wells Fargo analyst, estimates that AT&T lost 220,000 postpaid phone subscribers in Q4, despite unveiling its new DirecTV Now mobile video service in late November. Fritzche estimates Verizon added 57,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the December quarter.While AT&T and Verizon now offer monthly installment payment plans for mobile phones, they have not matched every T-Mobile promotion. T-Mobile has added 4.1 million postpaid subscribers in 2016.Bellevue, Wash.-based T-Mobile in October raised its 2016 postpaid phone subscriber forecast to 3.8 million at the midpoint of its guidance, up from its earlier estimates of 3.4 million and 2.9 million.

44,DISH,"New Year predictions last almost as long as New Year's resolutions. A year ago, the Federal Reserve was forecasting four rate hikes in 2016 and Hillary Clinton was the favorite to win the presidency.The unknowns for 2017 start with the tone set by Washington. Will investors see ""good Trump"" or ""bad Trump""? Will Republicans repeal and replace ObamaCare?On the economic front, will OPEC and allies carry out oil production cuts — and how fast will U.S. shale companies boost output? Tesla (TSLA) is supposed to begin deliveries of its Model 3, but the roads are getting crowded with electric vehicles. Apple (AAPL) hopes the iPhone 8 will wow consumers and revive sales. Snapchat is set to go public; will Uber and other big unicorns follow?This new year may be as unpredictable as any, but here are 10 key issues and challenges to watch that will affect your investments and the economy.Investor's Business Daily's Ed Carson, Jed Graham, Allison Gatlin, Elaine Low, Gillian Rich, Patrick Seitz, Brian Deagon and Bill Peters contributed to this article.Donald Trump promises an ambitious agenda: a 15% corporate tax rate; repealing ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank and other regulations; and a $1 trillion infrastructure program. The U.S. economy has been stuck in second gear for years, with businesses reluctant to invest. The prospect of a Trump administration already has revived ""animal spirits,"" and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index and other business surveys show soaring confidence.But the populist president-elect has a zeal for conducting ad hoc industrial policy in public. He's used Twitter and TV to target United Technologies (UTX), Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as well as drug prices.And his protectionist instincts could have serious consequences, given a president's broad authority on trade. Trump could adopt a few anti-dumping duties on China, expanding on actions by Presidents Bush and Obama. Or he could withdraw from Nafta or trigger a full-blown trade war with China that roils the global economy.So far investors are betting that Trump's pro-growth, low-tax agenda will carry the day. Stocks have rallied strongly since Election Day. But some sectors — banks, steel, mining — have fared better than others.Before the election, the Federal Reserve worried that slow growth had become a chronic condition for the U.S. economy. In 2017 the Fed will shift to the role of traffic cop, trying to keep the economy from blowing past its speed limit.If Trump's fiscal fuel sparks inflationary pressures, the Fed could raise rates by more than the three quarter-point hikes that the central bank is predicting. But a positive scenario could play out if Trump's policies boost productivity, essentially raising the speed limit so the economy can drive faster without an upsurge in inflation.The Fed will likely follow financial markets' lead. In recent years, the Fed has spoken loudly but carried a Wiffle bat. Policymakers' goal of four rate hikes in 2016 was whittled down to one quarter-point move at year-end, in large part due to concerns about global markets.The Fed in 2017 will include two new Trump appointments to fill vacancies. Trump's appointees may be especially open to the idea that his deregulation and corporate tax cuts can help revive productivity growth and increase labor-force participation. And by year-end Trump likely will nominate his choice for Fed chief; Janet Yellen's term ends in February 2018.RELATED:In 2017, Fed Will Play Traffic Cop As Trump Hits Fiscal AcceleratorRepublicans appear intent on kicking off 2017 with a vote to repeal ObamaCare but may delay actually replacing the system for years.The health exchanges have been struggling, with younger and healthier people declining to sign up, even with the individual mandate. Republicans can get rid of the law's sweeping tax and spending provisions. But with only 52 votes in the Senate, GOP leaders couldn't overturn coverage mandates without at least some Democratic support.Republicans could repeal ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, perhaps via block grants that would give states much more flexibility over federal funds.Yet many health policy experts and industry players have warned that a repeal without replacement could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules. Many health insurers such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) are already pulling out of most exchanges, tired of suffering losses.They and their peers may throw in the towel entirely if the law is largely repealed without a long-term replacement. If wide swathes of the country lack an individual market insurer for 2018, what will the government do?RELATED:Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?' ObamaCare MomentAfter a rough 2016 with drug prices under the campaign spotlight, a slew of potential FDA approvals and big trial data, particularly in the cancer arena, could catalyze biotech stocks.The FDA is slated to examine PARP inhibitors from Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) to treat ovarian cancer. The duo will compete in a multibillion-dollar market with already-approved Lynparza from AstraZeneca (AZN). Celgene (CELG) has a multiple myeloma drug under FDA priority review. The FDA will also look at Ariad Pharmaceuticals' (ARIA) brigatinib, which fights non-small-cell lung cancer.Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to seek approval for its refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma drug, an early CAR-T treatment. Seattle Genetics (SGEN) aims to change traditional Hodgkin lymphoma therapy when it unveils phase-three data.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Biogen (BIIB) each have data on Alzheimer's treatments due in 2017. Drugs that significantly slow cognitive decline would be huge blockbusters.Some biomed companies may make announcements about drugs or financials at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January.RELATED:Which Top 5 Biotech Stocks In 2016 Are Slated For Triple-Digit Gains?Seattle Genetics CEO Angles For Hodgkin's Lymphoma EurekaOil stocks have rallied since crude prices bottomed in early 2016, and the industry has reason for cautious optimism. After a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale producers largely failed, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries — along with top non-OPEC producers — agreed to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day starting in January to prop up oil prices. But cartel members have a history of breaking production quotas.Russia already has said that it will only gradually lower production, and analysts expect Iraq to be the first OPEC member to cheat on its output target. Even if OPEC's plan fails, the International Energy Agency sees oil markets balancing in the second half of 2017, helped by rising demand.But will crude prices, which more than doubled from early 2016 lows, continue to climb? That may depend on how quickly U.S. shale production revives. U.S. crude output started to climb as the number of oil rigs in use rose sharply in recent weeks and months. Many shale players have cut their costs and can profit at lower oil price levels.Trump's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, is another bullish sign for U.S. oil companies headed into 2017, given Tillerson's experience with international energy trade deals.A lot rides on Apple's 11th-generation smartphone due out in the fall. Unofficially called the iPhone 8, the 10th anniversary model could sport a radical redesign, with a glass sandwich look, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and wireless charging.Bullish analysts believe the iPhone 8 could create a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity after three generations of similar-looking iPhones. IPhone shipments fell 8% in Apple's fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24 vs. a 4% decrease for the overall premium smartphone market.Many analysts see Apple returning to smartphone sales growth next year, thanks to the iPhone 8. Apple's fast-growing services business — which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and more — is another expected bright spot for 2017.Others are more pessimistic. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz has predicted that ""Apple is about to embark on a decadelong malaise."" Apple's fortunes are over-reliant on the iPhone, and the company ""lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),"" he said.Initial public offerings are expected to rebound in 2017 from a seven-year low. Among the first high-profile new stocks is likely to be Snapchat owner Snap, one of the widely watched tech ""unicorns"" valued above $1 billion. Snap's IPO, expected in the first quarter, could raise $4 billion and value the company at $25 billion.Snapchat is growing rapidly, but the parent company has struggled to turn a profit. And it faces competition from Facebook (FB), whose photo-sharing Instagram site is adopting Snapchat-like features.Other unicorns expected to go public in 2017 are music service provider Spotify, software maker AppDynamics and data analytics company Palantir. Uber, valued at $68 billion, is not expected to IPO in 2017. Neither is Airbnb.Renaissance Capital believes activity will pick up significantly in 2017, ""breaking the long IPO recession"" that started in August 2015.In 2016, 105 IPOs raised $18.8 billion. Both the number and dollar value fell 38% from 2015. The top-performing IPO of 2016 was optical components supplier Acacia Communications (ACIA), which is up 168.5% from its May IPO price of 23. But it has lost more than half its value since early September, ending the year at a five-month low.The overall stock market trend will be critical to IPO activity and success. If the postelection rally continues, more companies will go public and will likely fare well. But if the stock indexes move sideways or correct, unicorns will be rare.RELATED:IPO Outlook For 2017: Amid Mixed Predictions, Focus On The Chart ActionThe electric-car race will intensify when Tesla Motors introduces its long-awaited Model 3 in the second half of 2017. It will be Tesla's most affordable car, with a base-model cost of about $35,000, far less than the more-upscale Model S sedan and Model X crossover SUV.Tesla is on track to deliver about 80,000 vehicles in 2016 and aims to ramp up auto production to 500,000 deliveries a year by 2018.Tesla has a history of missing deadlines and cutting production targets, though CEO Elon Musk will strive to get at least some Model 3 vehicles out the door next year. Musk also will be busy integrating recently acquired SolarCity as well as completing Tesla's battery Gigafactory.Meanwhile, General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) are selling or planning to introduce all-electric vehicles that target many of the same potential buyers as the Model 3. Like the Model 3, they will have self-driving features.Tesla also faces threats from tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Alphabet has spun out its self-driving car efforts into its own unit, Waymo. But the Google parent has backed off plans to create vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals in favor of partnerships with existing carmakers.Apple, which has never acknowledged its Project Titan efforts, reportedly has shifted from making a self-driving electric car to developing operating systems for autonomous vehicles.Mobileye (MBLY) and Delphi (DLPH) will showcase their turnkey autonomous-driving technology at CES 2017 in early January.It's still unclear if electric cars are ready for mass adoption. They are more expensive than gas-powered vehicles — and federal tax credits will soon expire for new Tesla buyers. And charging takes far longer than filling up the tank.Fears of cord-cutting — pay-TV subscribers canceling their cable packages — continue to abound in the media space. But a recent PwC survey, which found that 76% of respondents were pay-TV subscribers in 2016 vs. 79% the year before, suggests that ""cord-cutting may continue at a much slower rate than predicted.""Still, subscriber losses at ESPN, owned by Walt Disney (DIS), raise concerns about the power of live sports programming to discourage viewers from dumping their all-inclusive cable packages.Hulu — owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal and Time Warner (TWX) — plans to roll out a live-streaming service in the new year that will include broadcast and cable networks. Google's YouTube is also said to be working on a streaming TV service that could go live in 2017.The two players would join a crop of over-the-top TV competitors including Sling TV (Dish Network (DISH)), PlayStation Vue (Sony (SNE)) and DirecTV Now (AT&T (T)).After a long slog through years of low rates, weak economic growth and post-crisis regulation, banks appear set for a better 2017. Trump's transition team has said the incoming president will ""dismantle"" Dodd-Frank. His tax-and-spending programs could boost demand but also lift inflation, triggering more Federal Reserve rate hikes. Wider yield spreads should expand banks' net interest margins.All this sent bank stocks soaring along with Treasury yields in late 2016, especially after the presidential election. Bank of America (BAC) is seen as the most U.S.-exposed of the big banks, meaning it is most likely to benefit from any rate hikes from the Fed and faster U.S. economic growth.Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) still has significant international operations that could be hurt if Trump sets U.S. trade deals ablaze.Dozens of smaller banks have hit multiyear highs. Bank investors are pricing in aggressive Fed and Trump moves in 2017 with bond yields continuing to climb. But if those actions do not occur, bank earnings and stocks may disappoint.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

Satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) was close behind, spending $6.2 billion, buying 18 MHz of spectrum on average nationally. The auction results could trigger more speculation over a T-Mobile merger with Dish Network, analysts say.Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) was also among the highest bidders, spending $1.7 billion, but less than estimated. The FCC announced the results on Thursday afternoon.AT&T (T) spent less than $1 billion in the auction while Verizon Communications (VZ) did not buy airwaves. US Cellular (USM) spent $328 million in the auction, according to FCC data.""There are three big surprises here,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""Comcast bought less than expected, Dish Network bought more, and Verizon bought nothing at all.""Bids had topped $19.6 billion, the FCC said in February.Large mergers and acquisitions have been on hold in the telecom industry pending the auction's close. The FCC has imposed a quiet period on bidders, banning any strategic talks during the action, which began in March 2016. Telecom companies will be free to engage in strategic talks by early May. The FCC's mandated quiet period continues to apply until down payments are due, which is not for a couple of weeks.Industry speculation has focused on a possible T-Mobile US merger with Sprint (S), although regulators may still be opposed to the third- and fourth-biggest wireless firms combining. Verizon, Dish Network and Comcast also figure in possible merger talks, analysts say. AT&T is seeking approval of its $85 billion acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX).T-Mobile stock edged up 0.2% to close at 64.04 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock has gained 11% in 2017 and has neared a buy point of 65.51. T-Mobile has had the highest revenue growth among the top four wireless firms for three years.

Comcast, the first cable TV company to make a big move into wireless services, will sell unlimited-data plans that are similar to AT&T and Verizon.Comcast will offer discounts if customers buy wireless services along with its internet or pay TV services. Similar to AT&T, Comcast aims to retain pay TV customers with a product-bundling strategy. AT&T purchased satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV in 2015.Comcast shares edged down to 37.14 at the close.

48,DISH,"XWall Street on Wednesday managed to safely digest Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) after the company's earnings report late Tuesday.Chipotle reported better-than-expected earnings and sales. But the fast-casual chain's payment-processing network got hacked. Then again, it's testing two new desserts this month.So, as the once-trendy eatery tries to regain customers who might have fled following a well-publicized foodborne illness scare in 2015, should you, perhaps, consider buying Chipotle again?Shares sank through 2016 but have trended up this year, breaking out of a base above the 200-day moving average in late March. Shares rose 2.4% to 482.99 in the stock market today, hitting a 13-month high of 497.48 intraday.That comes as several other restaurant stocks have been breaking out of consolidations, including burger chains McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN) and, briefly, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR).CEO Steve Ells said in Chipotle's earnings release that ""2017 is off to a strong start."" And during the company's earnings call he attributed that strength to simpler operations, staff-training efforts, more-aggressive marketing, improvements in digital ordering, and ""a continued focus on serving safe, wholesome and delicious food.""Here's a look at analysts who strongly agree with that sentiment, cautiously agree or are still holding out.Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan has said Chipotle's recovery is a matter of "" 'when,' not 'if,' "" — a position she repeated in a research note following the company's report, adding that the company's marketing efforts should help.But she also cautioned investors to ""remain patient"" about owning its shares, and to look for whether the company could now put together a string of quarterly improvements. She kept her ""overweight"" rating on the stock but upped her price target from $483 to $530.SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett offered a similar sentiment, calling the turnaround ""as real as it gets."" He said the chain's new TV advertising effort, along with the increasing digital orders and an expansion in delivery tests, could also benefit the company.Bartlett also raised his price target to $550 from $500. He has a buy rating on Chipotle and said he believes that any impact from the data breach would be ""insignificant."" Management said an investigation was focusing on ""current transactions in our restaurants that occurred from March 24, 2017, through April 18, 2017.""Bartlett and other analysts noted that Wendy's suffered a credit card breach last year that did minimal financial damage. But RBC analyst David Palmer, in a research note, said the hack might make consumers more wary about placing digital orders.Palmer also said that it was unclear, based on management's comments during the earnings call, how much advertising and digital efforts would help the company. He said further that while margin oversight got better, labor and food costs could creep higher in the quarters to come. He downgraded Chipotle to sector perform from outperform.During the call, management said those costs rose after bringing the preparation of items like lettuce and bell peppers back into restaurants. Incentive-based bonuses for managers who made customer experience better, as well as inflation, could offset sales increases and the company's other efforts to keep labor costs in check, management added. And while food costs as a percentage of sales improved during the quarter, an avocado shortage won't help.BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, who stuck with his neutral rating on Chipotle, said weak sales on the West Coast and in the Northeast were signs that ""recovery remains anemic.""Analysts were also concerned about what appeared to be weaker two-year sales trends. Cowen's Andrew Charles also said its analysis ""suggests underlying sales are challenged so far in April despite an effective 1% price increase.""""We remain cautious on the cadence of the sales turnaround but acknowledge with cost savings experienced in 1Q, CMG could be setting up to beat on margins, leading us to reiterate our Market Perform rating,"" he continued.Some analysts were also cautious on the company's valuation compared to results.""While we expect positive (same-store sales) to continue over the next few quarters given easy laps, we believe the current valuation reflects a high degree of optimism and leaves little room for error,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Lynne Collier, who nonetheless raised her price target on the stock to $440 to $375.Others say that skepticism is unwarranted.""At base, we believe the bears are wrong about the explanation for the slow pace of CMG's recovery, which is being incorrectly attributed to increased competition,"" Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis said. ""Our alternate narrative is that CMG's food safety incident occurred in a world of social media which massively amplified the effect. This has elongated the impact and delayed the recovery.""Analyst sentiment remains much more positive on McDonald's, which was lavished with price hikes after its first-quarter results topped analyst estimates. McDonald's fell 0.6% to 140.84 Wednesday, snapping a seven-day win streak. McDonald's soared 5.6% on Tuesday to a record high on its earnings.But Wall Street isn't as thrilled with Restaurant Brands International, whose shares sank 3.1% to 56.66 after the Burger King and Tim Hortons parent beat on the top and bottom lines but reported a surprise dip in same-store sales. Restaurant Brands fell back below a 58.08 buy point after edging past it on Tuesday. But the stock rebounded from an intraday of 54, rallying back above its 50-day line.Wendy's rose 0.1% to 14.78, still in range from a 14.57 buy point cleared Monday.As for Chipotle's desserts, one of the items being tested is bunuelos — fried tortilla strips with honey, cinnamon and sugar, management said. The dish will be served with an apple caramel butter dipping sauce.RELATED:Is It Time To Talk To Your Barista?

49,DISH,"XT-Mobile US (TMUS) late Monday reported strong subscriber growth and adjusted earnings that easily topped expectations, but revenue was slightly below views.Shares in the wireless firm fell 1.4% to 65.02 in late trading in the stock market today. In Monday's regular session, T-Mobile shares ended trading up 1.9% to 65.93, just above a buy point, in above-average volume.T-Mobile said it earned 48 cents minus items, up 380% vs. a year earlier. Revenue climbed 11% to $9.6 billion vs. consensus estimates of adjusted earnings of 35 cents and $9.62 billion in revenue. T-Mobile reported first-quarter EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a cash flow metric — of $2.67 billion vs. street estimates of $2.57 billion.T-Mobile said it added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000.While T-Mobile's EPS and subscriber additions slowed from the year-earlier period, the company will likely lead the industry again in most growth metrics, including revenue, amid intensified competition with AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and Verizon Communications (VZ). Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) owns about two-thirds of T-Mobile stock.Analysts estimate that AT&T, which reports earnings late Tuesday, will shed 245,000 postpaid subscribers. Verizon on April 20 missed earnings and revenue estimates while losing 289,000 postpaid phone subscribers, or those with service contracts.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock has gained 12% in 2017 while shares in dividend-paying AT&T and Verizon have sagged. Learn more about T-Mobile's chart pattern at IBD Stock Checkup. The company's earnings-call commentary on industry consolidation is one area to watch.T-Mobile bought the most airwaves in a TV spectrum auction conducted by the Federal Communications Commission. T-Mobile bid $8 billion to capture 31 MHz of low-band spectrum, nearly 45% of the available airwaves. Satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) was close behind, spending $6.2 billion, buying 18 MHz of spectrum on average nationally.The FCC has imposed a quiet period on bidders, banning any strategic talks during the action, which began in March 2016. Telecom companies will be free to engage in strategic talks after April 27. That's when companies must make down payments on spectrum they bought.Speculation over a Sprint merger with T-Mobile has eased up. Analysts say that T-Mobile has more options as a stand-alone company, owing to the spectrum acquired in the TV airwaves auction.""T-Mobile's strong subscriber, financial growth and major success in the spectrum auction indicate to us (that) Deutsche Telekom wants to increase its investment in the U.S., partially because European opportunities are lackluster,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan, in a report published on Monday.RELATED:Think Your Wireless Carrier Is Planning A Merger?

50,DISH,"Verizon Communications (VZ) could be a seller rather than a buyer amid speculation over telecom industry mergers, with Comcast (CMCSA) a prime suitor despite hurdles to a deal, analysts say.A Comcast-Verizon ""merger of equals"" would combine the nation's biggest provider of landline broadband services with the biggest wireless phone company, says BTIG Research in a blog.Verizon's slowing growth and debt load make it unlikely it could pull off another large acquisition, such as Dish Network[ticker symb=DISH], says Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.Verizon on April 20 reported earnings and revenue that missed analysts' estimates.""After (last) week's weak first-quarter results, Verizon is cheaper than ever,"" said Moffett in a blog. ""So weak, in fact, that something will have to change.  It is not crazy to imagine that Verizon might be more likely to be a seller of assets than a buyer.""Comcast, controlled by the Roberts family, has a market valuation of $181 billion, slightly below Verizon's $193 billion market cap.""Is it likely that Comcast, to whom Verizon is more and more frequently being linked in the speculative parlor game of who will buy whom, would want to trade its own equity for Verizon's,"" added Moffett.

52,DISH,"Verizon Communications (VZ) will add fewer postpaid phone subscribers in the December quarter than in Q4 2015, despite ramping up promotions vs. T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S) and AT&T (T), says Wells Fargo.Verizon's wireless EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in Q4 will fall because of promotional activity, says Well Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche, who has a buy rating on the stock.Verizon has stepped up marketing for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7, Samsung smartphones, and Alphabet-Google's (GOOGL) Pixel devices. While Verizon is adding subscribers that buy high-end 4G smartphones, it continues to lose subscribers with older devices, says the Wells Fargo research report.""We are lowering our Q4 postpaid net add estimate to 715,000 (from 856,000 previously) and our handset net add estimate to 57,000 (from 180,000),"" Fritzsche wrote. Promotions and higher advertising spending will lower Q4 wireless EBITDA margins to 37.3% from 38.4% in the year-earlier period, she estimated.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon and AT&T have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, but there are other options, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and banks. Check out IBD's Income Investor for high-dividend-paying stocks.Fritzsche had been estimating a 41% EBITDA margin for Q4. Verizon added 1.52 million postpaid subscribers in Q4 2015, including tablet users and 449,000 postpaid phone subscribers.Verizon stock was up a fraction near 54 in midday trading in the stock market today. Verizon stock is up 15% in 2016, though shares dipped in early Q3. Verizon stock has formed a cup base, with a buy point of 57.05.Fritzsche earlier this week lowered subscriber estimates for Sprint. The Wells Fargo analyst expects T-Mobile US to again lead the wireless industry with postpaid phone additions. T-Mobile, which has led in postpaid phone additions for nine straight quarters, has ramped up its unlimited data ""T-Mobile One"" offering.AT&T, which has been losing postpaid subscribers, in late November launched its DirecTV Now video streaming service.

53,DISH,"Rising shares of both AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) have made arbitrage plays related to their proposed merger less attractive, says a Brean Capital analyst, who on Friday downgraded Time Warner stock.AT&T on Oct. 24 agreed to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 per share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock had initially traded far below that level amid uncertain regulatory approval.Time Warner stock has been climbing — though shares slipped 4 cents to 96.42 in the stock market today — amid views that the incoming Trump administration might approve the deal.AT&T stock, meanwhile, has formed a cup pattern, with a buy point of 43.99. AT&T stock is up 24% in 2016 but ended Friday flat, at 42.72.""We are reducing our rating on Time Warner to hold from buy as the arbitrage discount to the AT&T offer has shrunk to 12%, down from the high-teens,"" said Alan Gould, a Brean Capital analyst, in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon and AT&T have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, but there are other options, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and banks. Check out IBD's Income Investor for high-dividend-paying stocks.""AT&T shares are now above the upside of the collar, so the deal is currently worth $109.29 in stock and cash, up from an initial value of $107.50,"" Gould said.The Brean Capital analyst says CBS (CBS) is now an attractive stock among media companies.

54,DISH,"Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is winning analyst praise heading into 2017 on views that its big investments in web infrastructure to deliver streaming video pay off, as well as its security-related acquisitions.Guggenheim Securities on Thursday initiated coverage of Akamai with a buy rating. Oppenheimer and William Blair recently named Akamai as among their top stock picks.Shares closed down 0.7% at 67.37 in the stock market today. Akamai stock is forming a cup base, with a buy point of 71.14 and has risen 28% in 2016, though the company is garnering less revenue from traditional customers such as Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT).Akamai is the biggest provider of content delivery network, or CDN, services, which increase the speed of e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices. Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have been developing their own CDNs.IBD'S TAKE: Akamai's recent jump gave it spot on IBD Swing Trader on Dec. 14, but just at a half position. But it then got a full position on Tuesday. See Swing Trader for the very top prospects for shorter-term gains. AT&T launched a new streaming service branded DirecTV Now in late November. There may be upside for Akamai as AT&T's subscribers grow, analysts say.""AT&T's push into the over-the-top (OTT) video market could accelerate subscriber adoption of OTT services, which would benefit Akamai,"" said Michael Bowen, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, in a research report late Wednesday.Akamai's other video streaming customers are said to include Major League Baseball, Dish Network's (DISH) Sling and Ooyala.One wild card is how much video traffic Akamai might handle for new streaming services with live broadcast content coming from Hulu, Google's (GOOGL) YouTube and Amazon.com (AMZN), analysts say.Jonathan Schildkraut, an analyst at Guggenhiem, initiated coverage with a buy rating and price target of 75.""We expect investor focus to return to AKAM's core value proposition — that its unique, highly distributed, edge-based network architecture is superior not only for distributing content (including live OTT video), but also for the delivery of other services including web performance, security and longer-term cloud applications,"" Schildkraut said in his research report.Akamai on Wednesday made another security-related purchase, acquiring startup Cyberfend.Akamai's global network of computer servers store copies of website content for fast delivery to end users.

55,DISH,"The spotlight shifts to AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and other registered bidders next week in a government spectrum auction, after TV broadcasters again reduced their asking price for prime wireless airwaves, this time to $40.3 billion.In two earlier rounds, TV broadcasters initially sought $86 billion for 100 megahertz of usable radio spectrum, then dropped their asking price to $54.6 billion for 90 MHz. If bidders agree to pay at least $40.3 billion combined, that would open up 80 MHz of airwaves for mobile video and other data services.While there is an overall goal, the bidding process involves blocks of airwaves in local markets, such as New York and Chicago, as well as much smaller ones. The Federal Communications Commission has set price ranges for specific markets.The next stage of the auction might start as soon as Monday. The big question is whether AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Comcast (CMCSA) and other registered bidders will bite at the reduced, $40.3 billion price tag. Broadcasters, meanwhile, could walk away from the auction at any point if disappointed.IBD'S TAKE: A successful auction is important to T-Mobile, which analysts say is most in need of more airwaves. T-Mobile stock is up nearly 40% in 2016. Dish Network stock has been in a trading range since the auction started in March. Learn more about Comcast, another registered bidder, at IBD Stock CheckupIt's not clear if the auction will be affected if FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler resigns in January, when Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office.The shift to a Republican-led FCC ""could leave the spectrum auction inconclusive,"" said Amy Yong, a Macquarie Capital analyst, in a research report.UBS analyst John Hodulik says the auction will likely move into a fourth round in late December, extending into 2017. He says ultimately only 60 MHz or 70 MHz in total could be auctioned, at a lower price point around $30 billion.The FCC has imposed a quiet period on bidders, banning strategic talks among them until the auction is over.""A quicker end to the auction would be positive for T-Mobile and Dish Network (DISH),"" said Hodulik in a report. ""Once the auction ends, the anti-collusion rules no longer apply, likely paving the way for discussions around strategic initiatives and M&A.""Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins also forecasts a spectrum price tag of around $30 billion.""Verizon likely did not place a meaningful deposit and is not a meaningful bidder at this auction,"" said Rollins in a report Friday. ""We believe Verizon's actions and continued stated preference for mid-band spectrum supports our view that Verizon is likely to pursue an acquisition of Dish's spectrum or all of Dish at some point in the future.""Another scenario, analysts say, is that Verizon could deepen its relationship with cable TV firms Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) under a wholesale network leasing agreement.Shares of Dish fell 1.2% to 55.55 while AT&T was off 0.7% to 38.61 on the stock market today. Verizon inched down 6 cents to 49.81 and T-Mobile was up a fraction to 54.44.RELATED:How Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosSpectrum Wild Cards May Add Supply, Impact Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T

56,DISH,"AT&T (T) appears likely to win the federal contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety, analysts say, a development that would have ramifications for Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile US (TMUS), Comcast (CMCSA) and others taking part in a government auction of TV airwaves.As part of the FirstNet contract, AT&T would gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum, giving it less reason to bid aggressively in the TV spectrum auction, says Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research.And while it's unclear if that's what happened, the FCC on Monday, in its latest bidding stage in the auction, said total bids came to only $19.7 billion, where broadcasters had recently lowered the asking price to $40.3 billion. Now, broadcasters will need to decide by mid-December whether to lower their asking price yet again.""With AT&T gaining access to 20 MHz of low-band spectrum via FirstNet, we suspect that (AT&T's) interest in similar low-band spectrum in the 600 MHz (TV) auction will now be diminished,"" Chaplin wrote in a research report.While Chaplin says other registered spectrum bidders — such as Verizon, T-Mobile and Comcast — could step up and bid for more airwaves, another possibility is that TV broadcasters could walk away from the auction if they deem total bids as insufficient.IBD'S TAKE: A successful auction is important to T-Mobile, which analysts say is most in need of more airwaves. T-Mobile stock is up nearly 40 . Dish Network stock has been in a trading range since the auction started in March. Learn more about Comcast, another registered bidder, at IBD Stock CheckupThe National Association of Broadcasters had a cryptic initial response to Monday's event.""The results of the latest round of the TV auction leave us scratching our heads, given the decade-long refrain of a spectrum crunch,"" NAB CEO Gordon Smith said in a statement. ""We look forward to the next round.""As regards FirstNet, AT&T appears to have beat out Rivada Networks, a consortium that includes wireless network makers Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERICY) as well as Intel Security, part of chipmaker Intel (INTC), and Harris (HRS), although Rivada has mounted a legal challenge, says Chaplin.""We now believe that FirstNet will delay the announcement until after the Rivada court case has run its course, likely around March of 2017,"" said Chaplin.Tim Long, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, agrees that AT&T is the FirstNet front-runner.""AT&T has disclosed a number of updates regarding the FirstNet bidding process,"" said Long in a report. ""The company believes it is the only bidder remaining in the 'competitive range' of the process, as rival Rivada was deemed outside this range for the contract.""""After pdvWireless (PDVW) dropped out of the FirstNet bidding process in October 2016, we believed AT&T and Rivada were the two remaining bidders,"" Long wrote. ""As Motorola Solutions (MSI) was not listed in the extensive list of partners to Rivada, we believed Motorola Solutions may be a likely partner to AT&T.""If AT&T wins the FirstNet contract, ""We believe it is unlikely the carrier would participate in the broadcaster auction in a meaningful way,"" said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, in a report Monday. ""As such, we see downside to our initial $30 billion carrier demand estimate, which could also delay the auction timing. We had anticipated around $9 billion in spend from AT&T, implying adjusted demand in the low-$20-billion range ex-AT&T, not far from the current $19.7 billion offered in stage 3.""Whoever wins the FirstNet contract would need to invest in network infrastructure. Congress has set aside 20 MHz of spectrum in the ""D block"" of the 700 MHz frequency band for the public safety network. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services.According to an October Wells Fargo report, ""barring a national emergency, we estimate the spectrum will be less than 1 ted by public safety needs, which provides the (FirstNet) winner with access to that excess capacity.""In the TV airwaves auction, broadcasters just last week again reduced their asking price for prime wireless airwaves, this time to $40.3 billion. In two earlier rounds, TV broadcasters initially sought $86 billion for 100 megahertz of usable radio spectrum, then dropped their asking price to $54.6 billion for 90 MHz. If bidders agree to pay at least $40.3 billion combined, that would open up 80 MHz of airwaves for mobile video and other data services.If the TV spectrum is scuttled, that would be a plus for satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), analysts say. Dish Network has some 77 MHz of airwaves and has been looking for a wireless partner.AT&T stock rose 2 cents in the stock market today to 38.63 and is trading just above the key 50-day moving average support line. Dish Network stock rose 2% to 56.66.

SunTrust initiated Dish Network (DISH) with a hold rating.""We generally prefer cable over wireless right now, as we believe the former has a more supportable growth outlook and greater potential to preserve margins,"" said Greg Miller, a SunTrust analyst in a report.""In comparison to the national wireless market, competition faced by cable is relatively benign, in our view,"" he added.T-Mobile has grabbed subscriber and industry revenue share since 2014 with price cuts and promotional perks for consumers. Miller set a price target of 76 on T-Mobile stock. T-Mobile stock edged up 0.8% to close at 65.13 on the stock market today. Shares in Comcast dipped 0.2% to 37.53.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock has gained 13% in 2017 and has neared a buy point of 65.51. T-Mobile has had the highest revenue growth among the top four wireless firms for three years.

""Continued network improvement and market expansion provide the foundation for further share gains and the company remains an attractive acquisition target.""Both Verizon and AT&T are investing in 5G wireless technologies that could provide more competition to the cable TV industry's dominance in residential broadband services.""We look for the largest wireless carriers to essentially tread water from a growth perspective while they collectively reposition the companies for the future. Although we believe cable companies will likely outperform in the next year, we also believe their last-mile video delivery systems will be increasingly challenged by newer (wireless) technologies,"" Miller said.RELATED:Verizon Q1 Profit Seen Falling But Subscriber Rebound May SurpriseVerizon Makes Big 5G Fiber Deal, But Puts This Option On HoldStraight Path Stock Jumps; Will Verizon Top AT&T's Big Premium?Why The Race To Wireless 5G?

61,DISH,"In any given year, there's no shortage of conferences for advisors. The big question is whether to attend, given the time and expense.Sponsored by professional associations, financial services firms, tech suppliers and other groups, these multiday conferences often feature prominent speakers, training workshops and vendor booths. Advisors may also get continuing education credit for attending certain programs.Advisors rarely take the decision to attend lightly. Because they often need to travel long distances, they miss opportunities to confer with clients and run their operation if they're out of the office.""It costs you money to go, the time off work and the lost momentum of your business,"" said Tom Mosley, an advisor in Anaheim, Calif. ""So you need to make sure you get the most out of it.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMosley estimates that he's attended more than 125 conferences over his 23-year career. A former football coach, he creates what he calls ""a game plan"" before every trip.In the weeks beforehand, he reviews the conference's calendar of events along with the roster of attendees and vendors. Then he drafts a written list of individuals he wants to see and specific questions to ask them.""It takes reflection to decide what you want to accomplish when you're there,"" he said. ""Your day can get so cluttered, so it helps to have an agenda going in.""If he knows a digital marketing firm will have a booth, he will visit with a prepared set of questions. Or if a representative from a particular life insurer will attend, he might seek information on a new product from that carrier.When weighing whether to go to a conference, many advisors assess their likely return on investment. That's especially true if they run their own firm and pay for team members — from junior associates to marketing specialists — to attend as well.For Mosley, the decision involves two steps. He starts by reviewing his annual goals for his firm. If a conference promises to help him advance any of those goals, he's more apt to show up.In 2018, for example, he has three goals revolving around marketing and lead generation, staffing additions and refining internal processes. As he scans conference descriptions, he says he evaluates to what extent he ""can move the ball downfield"" on his three current objectives.When traveling to the East Coast, he arrives a day ahead. This enables him to spring into action the next morning with a full night of sleep, as sessions or breakfast meetings often start early.To retain what he learns throughout the conference, Mosley brings a stack of index cards. When he hears a great idea, he writes it on a card.""I may have 30 index cards with me after a conference, so on the plane home I'll read through them and add notes on how we can implement an idea,"" he said. ""Then I discuss them with my staff and we commit to follow through on what I've learned.""If you want to extract the most knowledge from a conference, stay alert. Drink lots of water and listen with curiosity to presenters. Ask questions and huddle afterward with experts to clarify how you can apply learning points.For many advisors, the highlight of a conference is mingling with peers from around the country. They share best practices, discuss industry trends and compare notes on tech tools.After a long day of meetings and presentations, Mosley gathers with other advisors to socialize. He finds such interaction invaluable.""It's great to listen and learn and work through some of the challenges you face,"" he said.Informal chats with advisors — as well as guest speakers and other attendees — can produce both professional insights and personal friendships.""It can be tempting to go from one speaker to the next and ignore everybody around you,"" said Alvin Carlos, a certified financial planner in Washington, D.C. ""But I like to use the breaks between sessions to talk with the people sitting next to me. And at meals, I'll sit with others and try to have meaningful conversations.""Carlos usually attends one or two conferences a year. While he earns continuing education (CE) credit in some sessions, he chooses topics based on overall relevance to his business.""Don't just focus on CE credit,"" he said. ""I've found sessions very valuable where I don't get CE credit, like focusing on ways to delegate to staff and provide more value to clients.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Building A Successful Financial Advisory Practice?

63,DISH,"After decades of working together, advisors and their longtime clients form tight bonds. These relationships often extend to the next generation. This can be a vital part of building a successful financial advisory practice that lasts.To grow their business, advisors welcome aging clients' adult children to the practice. This can happen naturally as these children mature and need financial expertise.Some advisors adopt a proactive strategy to cultivate the rising generation. But if they push too hard, they can drive away the people they're trying to attract.What's the best way to win over clients' adult children? Start by creating a firm that appeals to all ages.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We tell parents that we want to figure out a way to make it easy for your children to work with us in their style,"" said Mike Searcy, a certified financial planner in Naples, Fla. ""We know that parents are concerned that there's continuity"" for their kids in planning their financial future.In 2010, Searcy launched a subsidiary company to focus on a younger clientele. It has a different name and brand identity geared to up-and-coming professionals.""Unlike the parent company, our subsidiary has no minimum asset requirement,"" Searcy said. ""It's a different tier of service with millennial partners — advisors in their 30s — who can relate to my clients' adult children. My clients encourage their kids to meet with us.""Knowing that younger clients are more tech-savvy, Searcy harnesses technology at the subsidiary firm. Clients must agree to receive communication via email and many opt for videoconferencing, online educational resources and electronic signatures to sign documents.To work with multiple generations of a family, advisors create opportunities — both formal and informal — for clans to share financial goals and strategize about their future. By hosting such events, advisors help families come together over money issues.""When we do an estate plan for the parents, we like to bring in their children so that it's no longer cloaked in mystery,"" Searcy said. ""Even if the kids don't see all the details about Mom and Dad's assets or the value of their business, they get a sense of the master plan.""In addition, his firm offers coaching for clients' adult children or grandchildren who seek financial advice. He finds that giving them practical home- or car-buying tips can double as a trust-building exercise.Such meetings lay the groundwork for a full client relationship as their assets grow. Searcy, 63, hands off the coaching duties to junior associates so that they can build rapport with their peers.Matt Sivertsen, a certified financial planner in Moline, Ill., goes a step further. He offers to host what his firm calls ""first step cash management"" meetings with clients' adult children. In these one-hour sessions, they learn budgeting tools to develop a long-term financial plan.""We'll ask the parents if they'd like to have our 27-year-old junior planner take their children or grandchildren through this cash-flow management process,"" Sivertsen said. ""In offering this education, we may find that in five years they remember what we did for them"" and sign on as clients.To encourage a client's adult children to come aboard, Sivertsen's firm offers them a 10% discount on its monthly or quarterly retainer. But what helps even more is exposing them to comprehensive financial planning in the first place.""When Generation One holds a family meeting, Generation Two comes,"" he said. ""They come away seeing what we've done for their folks, how we focus on being stewards of the balance sheet and the breadth of our analysis, and they understand the full scope of what goes into a financial plan or a retirement plan.""Initiating periodic contact with a client's adult children — with the parents' consent — serves as relationship-building outreach. Advisors involve the next generation by inviting questions and providing information they can use.""We touch base with them one or two times a year with Mom and Dad's permission,"" said Brian Spinelli, a certified financial planner in Long Beach, Calif. ""We not only ask if they have any questions, but we might also get ahead of certain health issues related to their parents such as early signs of dementia or other behavioral issues.""Spinelli has learned that he doesn't need to impress the next generation by discussing investment strategy in depth. Instead, he responds to their queries with jargon-free advice.""We can get too technical with them and go into the weeds,"" he said.

Verizon told analysts that it will announce an OTT (over-the-top) partner in the fall when it expands 5G services to more markets. OTT is industry jargon for live TV or on-demand video delivered via broadband connections to homes.Verizon, which acquired AOL's and Yahoo's internet businesses, also updated analysts on the digital advertising platform being developed by its Oath-branded subsidiary.Oath's digital-ad products compete with Google and Facebook (FB).

65,DISH,"Advisors often find that they don't help clients manage their money as much as their emotions about money. But dealing with emotions requires delicacy.That's especially true when a client's family enters the picture.At some point, every advisor gets embroiled in a family squabble. An aimless son or daughter wants more money from Mom and Dad. Siblings argue over their inheritance. A married couple engages in a save-or-spend feud.Advisors rarely take sides when clashes erupt. Instead, they listen to all viewpoints with an open mind and seek to guide combatants to reach an amicable resolution.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""When emotions run high, it's important not to butt in and put in your two cents,"" said Jose Reynoso, an advisor at Clarfeld in Tarrytown, N.Y. ""You have to be careful in understanding what your role is and what clients understand your role is.""When clients and their families start to argue, Reynoso remains quiet. He lets people express themselves without trying to muzzle them.""I'll wait to be prompted for a response or I'll intuit an opening when I can add value,"" he said. ""Those safe entry points are usually when you know all parties will agree, so you say, 'Can we all agree that …' ""He strives to inject relevant information into the mix rather than give his opinion. Providing objective data redirects the discussion away from emotional outbursts so that everyone can focus on facts and figures.""Citing the law or the rules that apply to the situation places you in the position of honest broker,"" he said. ""It's a lose-lose if you go into the subjective too much.""Some advisors take a proactive stance to keep the peace. Rather than accept periodic skirmishes, preventive tactics can pay off.Reynoso suggests that advisors propose ground rules to ensure productive conversations among family members. For example, they can paraphrase what they just heard — and get confirmation that they correctly summarized what others said — before stating their case.""You need to establish a structure to resolve disputes,"" he said. ""Talk to them about family governance. Bring in experts if that would help. If it's a family business, you can cite rules relating to succession, voting or other existing norms.""Another way to prevent squabbles is to encourage respectful dialogue among all individuals. An advisor who helps a client unclog communication channels within his or her family can contribute to more harmonious relations.""When you have good communication along with formal agreements as part of the client's financial plan, it keeps fighting to a minimum,"" said Reshell Smith, a certified financial planner in Orlando, Fla. ""Getting in writing at what age your kids will get money and how that money will be distributed can really help.""A lack of communication within a family can pave the way for conflict. An advisor who promotes open conversation can enable clients to steer clear of rancor.Smith recalls advising a mother who refused to involve her three adult children in her finances. She set up a trust and chose an executor without informing her kids.""I suggested that she include her children in her thinking so that they understood her wishes,"" Smith said. ""Getting them involved on a limited basis, even if they don't know all the hard numbers, could prevent squabbling later.""When tempers flare among family members, advisors know to stay neutral. But it can be hard to remain calm when everyone around you explodes in anger.Rather than ratchet up your voice volume to match hotheads, maintain a calm demeanor. Mentally sift through what you hear to identify each person's main concern.""Ask open-ended questions so that you bring to the table how they arrived at a certain conclusion,"" said Diane Pearson, a certified financial planner in Pittsburgh. ""Don't put anybody on the spot. You don't want to make them defensive.""Pearson sharpened her listening skills after completing a training program led by Susan Bradley, founder of the Sudden Money Institute. She learned from Bradley that individuals going through transitions benefit from an advisor's nonjudgmental guidance.""You don't want them to feel like you're scolding them in any fashion,"" Pearson said. ""If they feel that way, they won't want to share and open up.""Conflict-averse advisors may seek to skip any topic that might trigger a testy exchange among family members. But avoidance carries risks.""You can't be afraid to confront these issues,"" Pearson said. ""My approach is, 'Let's talk about this.' I'm a moderator who allows everyone to express their opinions. If it's not talked about, you can lose them as clients if they wonder why this wasn't addressed.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Experienced Advisors Dish Out Pearls Of Wisdom To Rookie PlannersAdvisors Extract More Value From Their Time By Working EfficientlyBefore Aging Clients Show Signs Of Dementia, Advisors Take Action

67,DISH,"Dish Network's (DISH) fourth-quarter video subscriber results could look much like AT&T's (T) when it reports early Wednesday, with web streaming customer additions offsetting the loss of satellite TV customers.In both cases, analysts say the rub is that web TV subscribers are less profitable than traditional TV customers that spend more monthly.X Dish's profit and revenue is expected to fall from a year ago when it reports. Dish's earnings will fall 21% to 55 cents a share, with revenue slipping 5% to $3.53 billion, analysts estimate.Dish does not break out financials for its Sling-branded video streaming service. Dish added 28,000 pay-TV subscribers overall in the fourth quarter of 2016. Analysts estimate that Dish will lose 3,000 pay-TV customers in the December 2017 quarter.AT&T, which acquired satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV for $49 billion in 2015, lost 147,000 satellite TV customers in the fourth quarter. A year earlier it added 235,000 satellite TV subscribers.

68,DISH,"Comcast (CMCSA) could join AT&T (T) and Dish Network (DISH) in offering a national video-streaming service, it was reported Friday.But the cable TV firm may not pull the trigger on a launch unless similar ventures, including YouTube TV from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Hulu's upcoming live TV, catch on with consumers, according to a Bloomberg report.Bloomberg said Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, has acquired rights from cable network owners to offer their channels nationwide. Pay-TV providers such as AT&T, which acquired satellite broadcaster DirecTV Group in 2015, and Dish Network have had an easier time obtaining streaming rights than industry outsiders, such as Apple (AAPL).In 2015, Comcast tested the video streaming waters. It launched ""Stream,"" a $15 monthly video-streaming service in Boston, Chicago and a few other markets. Comcast did not disclose subscriber numbers. All the markets were served by Comcast's cable TV network. The company has stated on earnings calls that it's not interested in expanding online video outside its cable service footprint but Google's YouTube TV could apply more pressure to do so.Comcast stock rose 0.4% to 37.38 in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Comcast stock climbed after President Trump's surprise election in November on expectations of lighter broadband regulation.

69,DISH,"Telecom investors waiting for big names in the industry to formally recite their nuptials and merge within the next several months may find themselves woefully disappointed.Expectations have run high among telecom stock holders that spring will bring a new round of negotiations designed to bring wireless, cable TV and phone companies to the bargaining table. Within weeks, a government radio spectrum auction is expected to end, thus freeing up companies to negotiate a deal.Analysts warn, however, that while investors might want to play the proverbial meddling parent, telecom giants can't be prodded into taking vows. Further, an unpredictable Trump administration is creating an uncertain regulatory picture for the sector.""Expectations that a wave of M&A will happen quickly may be misplaced,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.""Just because the deal window will be open again doesn't mean everyone will rush to the altar,"" Moffett said. ""I call it the beer goggles trade. Everyone thinks that every deal that can happen will happen — and soon — so much of this is already priced into the stocks. There's real risk that the M&A wave doesn't happen, or at least not right away.""The radio spectrum auction that's expected to end in April, could set up 2017 to be one of the most dramatic years in terms of reshaping the telecom sector. The FCC's auction mandates that any potential bidders put a freeze on any possible strategic moves until the process concludes.Meanwhile, shares in Sprint (S), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Dish Network (DISH) trade at levels that figure on mergers and acquisitions happening. Speculation that Dow component Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA) or Charter Communications (CHTR) will be potential buyers runs hot.Most of the merger talk revolves around T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY). It has a number of potential suitors, and overall has the most options.""T-Mobile is probably the belle of the ball,"" Moffett said.Federal regulators blocked AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying a market structure with four national players would benefit consumers. Since 2014, T-Mobile has been growing subscribers and is the only carrier with significant service-revenue growth.But even with T-Mobile, great expectations could be dashed. Its business is humming, and so T-Mobile may prefer no deal at all near-term. And, cable companies Comcast and Charter — considered prime T-Mobile suitors — may not be ready to pull the trigger on a wireless acquisition.Roger Entner, head of Recon Analytics, told IBD: ""The problem with U.S. telecom mergers is that there are a lot more sellers than buyers.""Further, the Trump administration looms as a wild card. There are expectations for laissez-faire regulation in the new administration that could fuel mergers, but President Trump has yet to propose tax reform legislation.Some changes, such as a lower corporate tax rate, could boost telecom firms. Analysts say, though, there's a good possibility the Republican-controlled Congress will end or limit interest-expense deductions on corporate debt. In return, businesses would get tax credits that would encourage business investment.IBD'S TAKE: There's another good reason T-Mobile is so desirable; it has the top ranking of all companies in IBD's Telecom Services-Wireless Group. It has a Composite Rating of 88, meaning it outranks 88% of all companies. For more, do a stock checkup on T-Mobile.Ending ""net interest deductibility"" would make debt-financed acquisitions less attractive. If buyers issue new stock to pull off deals, that would dilute the equity of existing shareholders.That means companies may stay on the sidelines until Trump's tax reform is enacted.""The potential for tax reform could pause M&A in the near term,"" said a Goldman Sachs report. Private equity firms would also be affected.A regulatory bellwether could surface this year when the Trump administration decides on AT&T's (T) planned $85 billion purchase of media giant Time Warner (TWX). Potentially one of 2017's game changers, AT&T aims to combine Time Warner's content with its national wireless network and satellite broadcaster DirecTV.While AT&T says its purchase of Time Warner would be good for competition and consumers, the rub for telecom investors is that most deals would not ease a wireless price war.""Among possible combinations, only a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile would reduce competitive pressure,"" said a Moody's Investor Service report in March. That, however, also comes with stumbling blocks.Regulators signaled opposition to a Sprint and T-Mobile merging three years ago, leading SoftBank (SFTBY) and Deutsche Telekom to shelve talks. SoftBank owns 83% of Sprint, while Deutsche Telekom owns two-thirds of T-Mobile.SoftBank founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, who recently formed a $100 billion investment fund, has promised to help create U.S. jobs, aiming to build up relations with President Trump.Son in February also signaled that he would be willing to let Deutsche Telekom hold a controlling stake if T-Mobile and Sprint combined. The reason is that debt-laden SoftBank and Sprint may not be able to afford T-Mobile anymore. Its market valuation has shot up to $50.6 billion.""(Son) has recently suggested any and everything is on the table regarding M&A and that T-Mobile isn't the only option, which some investors may have read as less likelihood of a deal,"" said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co.Market-share gains by T-Mobile and Sprint pressured AT&T and Verizon recently to reintroduce unlimited wireless-data plans, a boost for consumers. Both T-Mobile and Sprint, meanwhile, are doing better financially. So even in a Trump administration, approval of a their merger would not be a slam dunk.""The rank and file of the (Justice Department) feels vindicated in blocking the AT&T/T-Mobile merger and would want to preserve T-Mobile's status as a maverick in the industry,"" said the RBC Capital report in February.A Dish Network merger with T-Mobile, on the other hand, would combine two discount-oriented marketing machines.Dish Network has cobbled together nearly 80 MHz of midband spectrum that T-Mobile could use to boost network quality.That also faces high hurdles, though. A Dish acquisition would need to be structured to deal with Charles Ergen, the satellite TV broadcaster's co-founder and chairman, who controls the company's voting shares. It's unlikely that Ergen wants to cash out, analysts say.Either way, Deutsche Telekom relishes having a kingmaker strategy in U.S. consolidation.""Are we a seller or buyer? It always depends on the quality of the possibilities,"" Deutsche CEO Tim Hoettges said in a news conference on March 2.T-Mobile CEO John Legere has talked up the possibility of cable partners on its earnings calls.Partnerships between cable TV and wireless companies have picked up in Europe, although John Malone-controlled Liberty Global (LBTYA) and U.K.-based Vodafone (VOD) backed away from a full-blown merger.Some analysts speculate that Deutsche Telekom's preference would be selling T-Mobile to Comcast or Charter, or both, while retaining a minority stake.""Comcast and Charter remain the most likely suitors,"" said Oppenheimer's Tim Horan.Charter and Comcast have an agreement, though, to lease access to Verizon's wireless network on a wholesale basis. Comcast plans to launch wireless services in mid-2017.Analysts who follow the cable TV firms say those companies are in no rush to buy a wireless firm outright and could expand the Verizon relationship.""Commentary from Comcast, Charter, and Liberty Broadband point to a strictly organic growth strategy in wireless utilizing Wi-Fi and (wholesale) agreements to achieve scale, at least for the next couple of years,"" said Bryan Kraft, a Deutsche Bank analyst in a report.While telecom investors expect M&A to break out in 2017, ""The timing of acquisitions remains in the hands of the buyers,"" said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG Research, in an email.RELATED: Disney A Cure For Verizon Woes?

70,DISH,"AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ) have more incentive to launch or expand nationwide internet TV services in the wake of Congress's repeal of data privacy rules, says a Pacific Crest Securities analyst.Lawmakers voted March 30 to overturn Federal Communication Commission rules that would have required Internet service providers to get customers permission before collecting data on web-browsing and app usage. A Democratic-led FCC had approved tougher data privacy rules in mid-2016.Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR), AT&T and Verizon are the biggest internet providers. Pacific Crest Securities says internet providers will be better-positioned for targeted advertising, much like internet companies.""The ability to collect data could compel (internet providers), particularly AT&T and Verizon, to more aggressively push their (video streaming) efforts in the hope of capturing more consumer share, which would create more opportunities to sell targeted 30-second video ads,"" Andy Hargreaves, a Pacific Crest analyst, said in a note to clients.Verizon is readying a new video streaming service, Bloomberg reported last week. Comcast has reportedly acquired rights from cable network owners to offer their channels nationwide. AT&T launched its DirecTV Now online streaming service in late November.""We view the repeal of the FCC's pending Internet Privacy Order as positive for wireless ISPs, modestly positive for cable companies and neutral for Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Facebook (FB),"" added Hargreaves. ""The new policy will improve ISPs' ability to target, which should help them monetize content, but will still meaningfully lag the breadth and depth of profiling data captured by Google and Facebook's logged-in experiences.""IBD'S TAKE: Comcast stock shot up after President Trump's surprise election in November on expectations of lighter broadband regulation.

AT&T in October agreed to buy Time Warner (TWX) for $85 billion. That deal needs to be approved by the Trump administration.""Most major ISPs already own significant content assets; however, this (data privacy rules) could compel them to purchase more content, particularly on the digital side, where the improved data is likely to have the most immediately useful value for targeting,"" wrote Hargreaves.RELATED:Google Advertising Plans Key In YouTube TV Launch Vs.

71,DISH,"President Trump has yet to appoint a new head of the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division pending the review of AT&T's (T) proposed acquisition of Time Warner (TWX), and sell-side analysts are starting to wonder about the delay, amid expectations that 2017 could be a big year for telecom industry mergers and acquisitions.Colby Synesael, a Cowen & Co. analyst who recently met with T-Mobile US (TMUS) management, noted in a report Friday that the wireless firm also is watching who the Trump administration names as head of the antitrust division. T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) has the most M&A options, including possible deals with Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) or cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR).There's been speculation that Verizon Communications (VZ) could acquire Dish Network or merge with a cable TV firm.""Our view is that Verizon is likely to move the fastest, as they in our view are in the greatest need, and that depending on what they buy, this could ultimately affect the willingness of other parties to move on T-Mobile,"" added Synesael in the report.M&A discussions have been on hold during a government radio spectrum auction. The auction is expected to end in April.AT&T on Oct. 24 agreed to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 per share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock had initially traded far below that level amid uncertain regulatory approval.Time Warner stock has been climbing as chances for approval seem to improve. European regulators approved the deal on March 14. Time Warner shares edged up a fraction to 98.54 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are hitting 52-week highs? That's easy to find at IBD's New Highs, but that list goes one big step better. That is, it ranks the companies making new highs by Composite Rating. A few other antitrust positions are also open at the DOJ, according to reports.Aside from AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, the DOJ is expected to review Bayer's $66 billion buyout of Monsanto (MON) and the merger between DuPont (DD) and Dow Chemical (DOW).Cigna (CI), meanwhile, is said to be interested in settling the DOJ's legal challenge to its merger with Anthem (ANTM).RELATED: Disney A Cure For Verizon Woes?

72,DISH,"Satellite-TV company Dish Network (DISH), which remains a prime player in the ubiquitous M&A chatter that surrounds the communications services field, early Wednesday posted its first year-over-year revenue decline in four years amid rising competition, but it beat on the bottom line.On Jan. 31, Dish announced an asset swap with sister company EchoStar (SATS) that, among other things, gives Dish full control of internet video service Sling TV. Analysts said the move could facilitate M&A for Dish, and for EchoStar. Dish owns some valuable spectrum but needs a wireless partner to make use of that asset. It has long been linked as a possible acquisition target, or partner, for companies such as Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS).At the time, Macquarie Securities analyst Amy Yong wrote in a research note that the ""move simplifies the corporate structure and, more importantly, facilitates M&A. We see Dish as one of many M&A options for Verizon. Sling TV could be Verizon's DirecTV Now.""Wall Street Q4 and Q1 estimates: For the fourth quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings per share of 66 cents, where Dish said it had a 27-cent per-share loss in Q4 2015. Analysts see revenue slipping less than 1% to $3.76 billion. For Q1, analysts expect EPS to fall 21% to 66 cents, with revenue falling 1.3% to $3.74 billion.Q4 results: Dish said it swung to EPS of 70 cents in Q4. It reported revenue of $3.72 billion, down 1.8%. The company said its net pay-TV subscriber count rose 28,000 in Q4, reversing from a 12,000 loss in Q4 2015. But for the year, it said total pay-TV subscribers fell 1.6% to 13.671 million.Q3 results: Three months ago, Dish reported a 52% jump in EPS to 64 cents, with revenue rising slightly to $3.75 billion from $3.73 billion in Q3 2015. But its trends were mostly bad. While ARPU (average revenue per user, or subscriber) rose to $89.44 from $86.33, the company posted a net loss of 166,000 pay-TV subscribers, up from a 23,000 loss in Q3 2015. Its pay-TV churn, or subscriber turnover, rate rose to 2.11% from 1.86%.Stock: Dish stock finished trading down 0.7% to 62.40 on the stock market today, after slipping a small fraction to 62.82 on Tuesday.

73,DISH,"Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and other cable TV firms are becoming broadband-first companies as they take away internet customers of AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).The top cable companies added 3.3 million broadband subscribers in 2016 — similar to the gains in 2015, and the most net additions in any year since 2007, says Leichtman Research Group. Cable TV firms, meanwhile, lost 278,000 pay-TV video subscribers in 2016, although Comcast added 161,000.Comcast had 24.7 million broadband subscribers vs. 22.5 million video customers at the end of 2016. The broadband gap is wider at Charter, which acquired Time Warner Cable. Charter had 22.59 million broadband subscribers vs. 17.2 million video subscribers as of Dec. 31.The top cable TV firms followed by LRG had 58.4 million broadband subscribers vs. 48.6 million video subscribers at the end of 2016. Top telephone companies — including AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink (CTL) — had 34.5 million broadband subscribers, down 599,000 from a year earlier. In 2015, phone companies lost 185,000 broadband subscribers, says LRG.With more internet video services rolling out in 2017 and next year, pay-TV industry subscribers could fall further, analysts say. As cord-cutting goes on and the traditional video business for cable providers shrinks, their No. 1 product will be broadband and internet access. So even if internet video takes off, they still have broadband dominance.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon and AT&T have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, but there are other options, such as banks, industrials and real estate investment trusts (REITs).

That's an open question.""Without a doubt, it's a transition time in the television industry,"" TVAnswerman.com Publisher Phillip Swann said.While many in the TV industry fear a shakeout, the programming boom continues for now. But eventually the industry will split into winners and losers as consumers comb through their multitude of choices and bundle their programming.Most at risk are companies in the multichannel pay-TV business such as AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA). Some studios might abandon their own streaming TV services and return to supplying content for the remaining services. These players include the likes of CBS (CBS), Viacom (VIA) (VIA.B) and Walt Disney (DIS).The content onslaught started when Netflix, Amazon and others started providing direct-to-consumer video services, with catalog and original material. Hollywood studios rushed their own internet video networks into service for ""fear of missing out"" on the next big thing, Swann says. All the while, those same studios have supported legacy cable channels.Content production in the TV industry and consumption still are rising. In the U.S. last year, the average household paid for 2.04 streaming video services, according to Strategy Analytics. That's up from 1.79 the prior year.Netflix has the most viewers, followed by Amazon Prime Video and Hulu. Parks Associate analyst Brett Sappington counts more than 200 over-the-top video services in the U.S. alone. More than a third of U.S. broadband internet households subscribe to at least two over-the-top plans, he said. Some 15% subscribe to three or more.Major streaming services are expected soon from Disney and Apple (AAPL), crowding the field even more. Industry analysts wonder just how big the appetite is for these offerings.""That's the $64 billion question,"" Strategy Analytics analyst Michael Goodman said.Meanwhile, penetration of multichannel pay-TV services among households with broadband has fallen below 80%, a seven-year low, says Sappington.The average household spent $106 a month on pay-TV service last year, up 3% from 2016, according to Leichtman Research Group. That's a bit more than the 2% inflation rate.Now, in addition to regular cable, satellite and telco TV bundles, consumers can choose ""skinny bundles"" with limited channels like Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and AT&T's DirecTV Now. And they can mix and match subscription video-on-demand services.""Traditional pay-TV is very much in decline,"" nScreenMedia analyst Colin Dixon said.When the dust settles on the transition, consumers likely will pay for two or three ""anchor tenants,"" such as a skinny bundle and Netflix, Dixon says. Plus, they'll have a revolving roster of premium on-demand services that they'll get for limited periods. They'll supplement those services with emerging ad-supported, video-on-demand services such as Roku's (ROKU) Roku Channel, he says.""When it's all said and done, the average Joe will have probably three to four services that they pay for, pretty much month in and month out,"" Dixon said. ""But there will be a whole bunch of other stuff that they will take on when there's something interesting that they want to see, but drop again later. There also will be a whole bunch of advertising-supported services. We're just beginning to see that start now for more casual viewing.""Only a few subscription video-on-demand services with broad appeal are likely to be long-term winners in the new TV industry structure, analysts say. To succeed, they'll need a large selection of programming to keep consumers engaged and subscribing.Netflix is the service that others are chasing in the internet video market. It has been ""smart and strategically savvy"" in developing its service, TVAnswerman's Swann says.Amazon Prime Video is the tortoise to the hare that is Netflix, hoping that slow and steady wins the race, he says. Amazon's TV service has the benefit of being bundled as an extra with its Prime e-commerce service, which provides free, two-day shipping on millions of products.Beyond those two, and possibly Hulu, the outlook is less certain for subscription video-on-demand services.Consider CBS All Access. The CBS-owned service debuted with limited original content and offers mostly a library of sitcom and TV drama reruns. Its subscriber count spiked to more than 2 million after it launched ""Star Trek: Discovery,"" a new weekly series in the popular science-fiction franchise, last September.But when the 15-episode first season ended in February, many fans took to social media to announce they were quitting the service until the second season begins airing sometime in 2019.With internet video services, it is easy for someone to sign up, binge-watch a particular show, and then cancel the service and move on to another.""That's definitely going to be a challenge for these services,"" said Strategy Analytics' Goodman. ""Because the ease of getting in and out of them is there.""Subscriber churn is going to be a problem for many in the TV business, Parks' Sappington says.""With services priced on a monthly basis for the same or less than the cost of a movie ticket, then for a consumer to get in and out of service in a single month shouldn't be that big of a surprise,"" Sappington said.And with the current heightened promotional environment, consumers can bounce from one free trial to the next, Swann says.Besides the mainstream video-on-demand services, a host of smaller, niche services for passionate fans are likely to succeed. This second tier of internet video services now includes such channels as Crunchyroll for Japanese anime, World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) WWE Network and Gaia (GAIA) for yoga, fitness and spirituality programming.""You could go from January through December and watch a lot of great content and not pay a dime, if you're so inclined, just on free trials,"" Swann said.RELATED:Apple Services Called 'Next Paradigm Shift' For Company's StockRoku Stock Rises On Ad-Supported Streaming VideoNetflix Original Programming Fuels Subscriber Gains: Survey

77,DISH,"Eager to boost their visibility, many advisors embrace the media. Radio and television appearances can burnish their image as experts.X But there's a risk to giving live — or taped — broadcast interviews. If you stammer or sound unprepared, you can sink your reputation. And if you let slip a comment that raises concerns from regulators or compliance officials, the consequences can sting.Advisors who undergo media training learn to be themselves — to converse in a natural, engaging manner as if they're chatting with friends. That's good advice, unless you take it too far.""If you're passionate, let people feel your passion and excitement,"" said Ben Lewis, director of public relations at the Financial Planning Association in Denver, Colo.

Start NowIn a fast-moving conversation, you may be tempted to talk over the host and interrupt to make a point. Yet the impulsive urge to jump in can backfire if you say something you regret later.Beware of parroting an interviewer's bombastic or inflammatory language. In an effort to answer questions head-on, you can wind up adopting an unintentionally aggressive or hypercritical tone. It's safer to recast questions with neutral wording.If asked why ""so many of your colleagues are dead wrong about the market,"" for example, don't respond by saying, ""They're dead wrong because … ."" Instead, say, ""My view is … .""Some advisors prepare for a live interview by jotting answers to questions they expect to hear. That's a good start.It's even better if you simulate an actual question-and-answer dialogue. Practicing how you'll respond to inquiries gives you an added advantage than simply writing your preferred answer.Ask a friend to interview you and pose likely questions. Record the give-and-take as you dish out pithy, insightful replies.""You can also do a mock interview yourself,"" Lewis said. ""Turn on the voice recording app on your phone and start with the first logical question you anticipate getting.""Find a way to weave in your core message as it relates to the topic. If the subject involves the fees that advisors charge, for instance, prepare to highlight how you provide value with a transparent pricing model.If you want to promote your new book, blog or white paper, don't overdo it. Repeatedly mentioning the title — or treating every question as a chance to hype what you're selling — can prove off-putting to your audience.Instead, inform the interviewer beforehand of your new offering. Suggest a graphic from the book that the host can use, such as a bulleted list of tips, to guide the conversation.""Position your book as a resource for the reporter,"" Lewis said. ""In the pre-interview, say that you include a three-step process in your book"" or that it includes action steps, warning signs or other take-aways. This makes it easier for the host to plug your book, saving you from having to do it.Because advisors face compliance concerns when making media appearances, minimize mishaps by laying the groundwork with care. Know what you can say — and what not to say.""I encourage all advisors to talk with your public relations, legal or compliance department before you do a media interview,"" Lewis said. ""Understand the protocol"" before you go live.As a rule, Lewis trains advisors never to speculate or use definitive terms such as ""best"" or ""worst."" Replace ""I think the best course of action is ..."" with ""From my experience, it's usually prudent to consider … .""If you're new to the media game, brace for some jitters.

Most are hospital patients.If new antibiotics aren't discovered, then ""procedures we take for granted – including chemotherapy, joint replacement surgery, kidney dialysis, organ transplants"" and even simple surgeries would be ""too risky to undertake,"" Pew Charitable Trusts' Allan Coukell warned Congress.A frightening forecast.  But don't fear  an antibiotic apocalypse yet.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

80,DISH,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowResearchers at Rockefeller University in New York City have just  come upon  a new class of antibiotics and developed a speedier,  less costly way to replenish the antibiotic pipeline in the future.  The blockbuster findings are proving  the prophets of doom wrong.Since penicillin was discovered in a moldy petri dish nearly a century ago,  most antibiotics have been found in soil, then reproduced in labs.  Conventional wisdom says the supply is nearly exhausted. But Sean Brady and his Rockefeller colleagues insist the earth holds many more.""Our idea is, there's this reservoir of antibiotics out in the environment we haven't accessed yet"" just waiting to be tapped.Brady's group set up a project, ""Drugs from Dirt,"" to solicit soil samples, and began poring over them to find new antibiotics.  He used a process — genetic screening — that is far faster and more effective than growing samples in a petri dish.The results?  Malacidin — Latin for killing bad guys — an entirely  new category of antibiotics  sitting in soil from the Southwest. It's already proven to cure MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphyloccus aureus) skin infections on lab rats. That said, it will be at least a few years before the drug makes it to the pharmacy.""The malacidin discovery is very exciting,"" says Paul Auwaerter, a Johns Hopkins scientist, but ""it is a long way to a safe effective drug approved by the FDA.""Same deal  for another new antibiotic, literally unearthed recently — teixobactin.  In addition, these new antibiotics only treat one of the two families of bacteria — called Gram-positive, like Staph.  Other drugs in the pipeline will target the other category of bacteria,  Gram-negatives such as Klebsiella and Acinetobacter.Though they're not  household names, they kill by invading a hospital patient's bloodstream or bodily organs, or causing pneumonia.Because  new cures are years away,  it's essential to protect patients today by stopping these deadly germs from entering their bodies. Hospitals are ""breeding grounds"" for superbugs, explains Fauci.The bacteria lurk  on door knobs, bedrails,  and other unclean surfaces, morphing constantly to become resistant to antibiotics.  Then a patient is admitted, and wham, the bad germs attack, invading a surgical incision, or climbing in through a breathing device or IV to cause a drug-resistant infection.Doctors scramble to find a drug to save the patient.  But once the germ has invaded the body, it's often too late.When the drug-resistant germ Klebsiella struck Israeli hospital patients  in 2006, the country stopped its spread within a year.  How? Testing all patients, isolating those who had it, and even barring nurses treating these patients from having contact with anyone else.  Most U.S. hospitals do none of this.The same germ invaded New York City in 1999. Hospitals kept mum. Public health authorities failed to act.  Now it's in all 50 states.What's to blame? Inadequate cleaning, lax medical procedures, and failure to isolate patients carrying the germ.  Studies show the germ frequently contaminates hospital rooms and is picked up on the gloves worn by doctors and nurses.Thrilling new antibiotics are on the way. Scientific innovation will likely  prove the naysayers wrong.  But tomorrow's cures won't save today's patients.  Hospitals — the front lines in this battle — have to do their part too.

The four-day consumer electronics show ended Friday.""For the smart home, in the past few years, we've acquired a couple of companies – Ecolink and RCS – that bring other products into our suite,"" Bob Maling, senior manager of applications engineering for Universal Electronics, told Investor's Business Daily. ""You'll see thermostats, motion detection, safety and security systems, smoke alarms and other devices from us.""Much of Universal Electronics' business is through pay-TV service providers like Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and Dish Network (DISH). As cable and telco companies sell and support more smart home devices, Universal Electronics wants to be able to offer them products.CES 2018: See The Latest Technology Trends & Top Tech StocksLast May, Universal Electronics purchased RCS Technology, a maker of energy management and control products for the residential, commercial and hospitality markets.In May 2015, it acquired Ecolink Intelligent Technology, a maker of wireless sensor and home security products.Universal Electronics stock has been an underperformer lately.

85,DISH,"Regulation: The internet has 60 days left before it is destroyed by the lack of federal ""net neutrality"" rules. That's the claim, anyway. The truth is, the internet is on the cusp of a vast improvement.The 60-day clock started when the FCC's officially published its net neutrality repeal on Thursday. The repeal takes effect in two months, which means that, since its start in mid-2015, ""net neutrality"" will have been in effect less than three years — probably the shortest-lived federal regulation in history.Nevertheless, its demise is being treated as a devastating blow to everyone who relies on the internet. Fortune declared that net neutrality supporters now have ""60 days to save the web as we know it.""But other developments during the week show why the hue and cry about ""net neutrality"" is so utterly misplaced.The same day the FCC issued its repeal, SpaceX launched test satellites for Starlink, a global broadband network envisioned by SpaceX founder Elon Musk.The day before that, Dish Network (DISH) told the SEC in its 10K filing that it plans to commit $1 billion to build out an ultra-high-speed 5G wireless network over the next three years.The day before that, AT&T (T) announced plans to roll out its 5G network in Dallas, Waco, Texas, and Atlanta this year. By the end of the year, it plans to have 5G in a dozen markets. Verizon also plans to start rolling out its 5G network this year.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersFor those who don't know, 5G wireless is about 50 times faster than the average home broadband network today. And because it's wireless, providers won't have to dig trenches and lay cable to sign up customers.That means there will be more competition for internet access than there is today, and at speeds that make today's broadband look like dial-up.With more competition for customers, ISPs won't ""block, slow down, or charge more for certain content as they see fit"" as net neutrality zealots claim. More likely, they will be in a frantic race to provide the fastest, most comprehensive, and most reliable service around.That is, after all, how the internet worked before net neutrality. Between 2011 and 2014, average internet speeds tripled.What net neutrality advocates won't tell you is that the only companies actually guilty of blocking, slowing down, or charging more for certain content are big net neutrality advocates like Netflix (NFLX) — which charges more if you want streaming HD — and Google (GOOGL) — which charges $10 a month for the better YouTube Red — and social media companies — which have been repeatedly shown to hamstring conservative content.So yes, the internet won't be the same after Obama's net neutrality rules disappear. It will be far better.You might also like …Will Net-Neutrality Zealots Apologize When The Internet Fails To Crash And Burn?Net Neutrality Advocates Are Modern-Day Snake Oil SalesmenNet Neutrality Hypocrisy Runs Amok

86,DISH,"Telecom mergers may be on the back-burner as regulators vow to block the nuptials of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), but talk during recent industry earnings calls are leading Wall Street analysts to believe there still are possible combinations to be had out there.X The prevailing view is that deals are on hold until AT&T either wins or loses in its battle with the Department of Justice, which is seeking to thwart the telecom giant's purchase of Time Warner. A trial is slated to start March 19, with a federal judge expected to rule on the case by late April or May.Referring to AT&T-DOJ court battle, T-Mobile US (TMUS) Chief Executive John Legere, on his company's earnings call Feb. 9, said there's ""a huge pent-up bubble of logical things that need to happen"" in the telecom industry.One wild card in merger speculation is an agreement forged by Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) in May 2017. The two cable TV firms agreed not to make a wireless acquisition for a year unless they obtained each other's approval. That pact expires in the spring.T-Mobile's Legere told analysts that cable TV firms are likely to be involved in a wireless merger at some stage.""It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when,"" he said. T-Mobile and Sprint (S) shelved their merger talks in early November.Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, continue to speculate over potential merger partners.Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar says cable TV firm Charter could target Altice USA (ATUS). Both Charter and Altice operate in the New York City area, he noted in a report. Altice could be a seller rather than a buyer as its Europe-based parent company restructures, analysts say.Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet on Feb. 7 upgraded Dish Network (DISH) to buy on views that the satellite broadcaster could be purchased, though no deal seems imminent.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.Verizon Communications (VZ) CEO Lowell McAdam, on its January earnings call, said ""there is nothing going on right now"" in terms of acquiring a media or other company. Verizon has been viewed as a buyer of Dish or CBS.CBS and Viacom (VIA), meanwhile, have confirmed talks over a possible recombination after splitting up in 2006.While reports resurfaced on Monday that Comcast could rebid for assets of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), the cable TV firm is likely to wait until the outcome of the AT&T-DOJ battle, analysts say. Walt Disney (DIS) in December agreed to buy Fox's film, television and international businesses.If the DOJ successfully blocks AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, that would make other telecom-media mergers less likely, analysts say. In that case, Comcast and Charter could try to merge to gain scale vs. a combined Disney/Fox.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:When To Sell Stocks — Rules That Help You Protect Profits And Avoid LossesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?How To Spot A Major Stock Market Top, The Easy Way2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains

87,DISH,"Leading a team of geniuses can spark big breakthroughs. But what happens when you want people who lack training in innovation to think outside the box?Some individuals may refrain from offering creative input for fear of appearing crazy or stupid — or clashing with a powerful manager's preferred course of action. Others may simply not see themselves as inventive visionaries.To transform non-innovators into innovators:Let them build. To design something new, invite users to roll up their sleeves and build a prototype. That may require some initial training, but it can produce a rich payoff.""We host 'maker' workshops where we take people who are not traditionally innovators, give them some tools and teach them about design,"" said Rory Cooper, founder and director of Human Engineering Research Laboratories in Pittsburgh, Pa. Cooper, who uses a wheelchair, enlists people with disabilities to help develop assistive devices. He also involves caregivers, clinicians and others as partners in the innovative process.Forge a bond. If you're asking people to innovate who aren't accustomed to it, make them feel special. Foster a camaraderie that brings them together.For the past 10 years, Cooper has given participants a T-shirt with the research lab's logo. The shirt has become a coveted perk.""You can't buy them,"" Cooper said. ""You have to earn them"" by contributing ideas.Break down barriers. Treat everyone from part-time workers to customers as potential innovators, even if they don't see themselves as such. Solicit their input on creative challenges you face — and provide multiple ways for them to chime in.""At our design meetings, everybody has a voice,"" Cooper said. ""Everybody is welcome to attend. And that transparency leads them to see how much we value innovation.""Share screw-ups. Insisting that people innovate can backfire if they're unprepared or reluctant to open up. But when leaders volunteer their errors — and what they learned — others might follow suit.Enda King, managing director at What If Innovation, says that his New York City-based consulting firm holds weekly gatherings in which colleagues admit their mistakes and share what they learned. Team leaders go first, which makes underlings more comfortable doing the same.""We look to build that into our culture,"" King said. ""It feels less daunting to enable learning, experimentation and failure than asking people to be innovative and produce large-scale breakthroughs.""Cite examples. To spur great ideas, highlight innovations in other fields that are inspiring or instructive. These examples can serve as a springboard to get individuals to flex their creative muscles.""Often, people are not skilled in the tools to be creative,"" said Greg Leman, an innovation expert and professor of entrepreneurship at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. ""Giving them anecdotes of transformative solutions to issues with a distant tie to the challenge you're facing"" can boost their innovative output.Capture the big picture. Leaders may assume that all staffers perceive the competitive landscape in the same way — and realize the urgency to innovate. But that's not necessarily the case.""It's amazing how disconnected people can be to the big picture,"" Leman said. ""That's why you need to communicate an innovation strategy with what's going on at your company as well as the outside, competitive world — and the path you're following"" to maintain an edge.Give honest feedback. Once you gather input, assess it in a straightforward manner. Don't dish out excessive praise or reward individuals too freely for trying to come up with fresh ideas.""People know if they are honestly valued,"" Leman said. ""It's hard to hide your genuine thoughts,"" so level with others and teach them to sharpen their innovative thinking.

M&A talk involving Verizon continues to swirl.Yahoo stock fell Thursday on speculation Verizon could pull the plug on its purchase of the troubled internet firm, which Wednesday disclosed another massive data breach. Shares of Charter, though, rose on views Verizon is eyeing the John-Malone-controlled cable TV firm.While Verizon on Tuesday shot down speculation that it's interested in CBS (CBS) or Dish Network (DISH) at its analyst meeting, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam commented about a possible Charter acquisition.""McAdam indicated that an acquisition of Charter would make 'industrial sense,'"" said Anil Doradla, a William Blair analyst, in a research report.

95,DISH,"Aiming to make video streaming a big driver of its mobile business, AT&T (T) laid out the nitty-gritty details of its DirecTV Now service, which will start at $35 a month for 100 channels but will go up to $60 after a promotional period ends.AT&T, after the introductory period, also will offer 60 channels for $35 monthly and 80 channels for $50 monthly. While AT&T's promotional price is aggressive, the longer-term pricing for various packages is in line with or above analyst expectations.But users that sign up for the $35 promotion has that rate for as long as they subscribe to the service.If DirecTV Now customers sign up for three months, they qualify for an Apple (AAPL) TV streaming device that normally retails for $150. Customers that commit to one month can get an Amazon.com (AMZN) Fire TV stick that starts at $40.The DirecTV Now streaming service will launch on Wednesday. AT&T did not say when the promotional period will end. AT&T will offer new customers a free, 7-day trial.IBD'S TAKE: AT&T stock, along with Verizon Communications, were top performers in the first half of 2016 owing to their dividends. Apple and Cisco Systems are other companies that are increasing shareholder returns. Learn more at IBD's Income Investor. AT&T stock was flat in after-hours trading Monday, after it revealed the details of its mobile streaming-video service.""The prices are more reasonable than they had hinted at a few weeks ago,"" Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in an email. ""But by definition, that means that demand for the product will be lower as well.""I'm sure they'll get some existing customers to trade down, but it will take some time to find out whether cord cutters are willing to pay that much for an OTT service.""AT&T says it's targeting 20 million homes that do not have a pay-TV subscription currently, but the wireless video offering could attract customers of cable TV firms like Comcast (CMCSA), analysts say. With DirecTV satellite and its U-Verse service, AT&T has 25 million pay-TV customers of its own that it does not want to see switch to the lower-cost streaming package, says Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, in a research report.""AT&T can't undermine the economics of traditional pay-TV; they would have the most to lose if they did,"" Chaplin said.The DirecTV Now streaming service, though, could boost AT&T's wireless business, where growth has stalled amid continuing postpaid subscriber losses.AT&T aims to get a jump on Hulu Live, a new offering expected from the joint venture of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast's NBC Universal. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) might also launch new streaming services with live content in 2017, analysts say.AT&T will not charge its own wireless subscribers for consuming data tied to the DirecTV Now service, a practice similar to what Verizon Communications (VZ) does with its millennial-focused Go90 service. T-Mobile US (TMUS), meanwhile, provides free streaming of Dish Network's (DISH) Sling service to its subscribers.AT&T's DirecTV Now does not provide a cloud-based DVR service and limits users to two simultaneous video streams. Dish's Sling on Monday said its customers will soon be able to record TV shows and store them online for later viewing.AT&T acquired satellite broadcaster DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015, gaining negotiating leverage with content providers. While Fox, Disney and NBCU have joined AT&T's programming lineup, CBS (CBS) is not part of the lineup. CBS has its own stand-alone streaming service.AT&T has stated DirecTV Now will have lower profit margins than its traditional, U-verse pay-TV services. Like other providers of so-called OTT (over-the-top) services, AT&T will not bear costs for network transport, installation or set-top boxes.Sling last week forged a deal to make its app available on Comcast set-top boxes. Analysts estimate Sling has 800,000 to 1 million subscribers.If AT&T's DirecTV Now is a big success, it could pressure Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) to acquire a wireless firm, perhaps T-Mobile U.S., some analysts have speculated.AT&T is seeking regulatory approval to acquire Time Warner (TWX) for $85 billion. Time Warner and its HBO, as well as content from Viacom (VIA), A&E, Discovery and Starz, are part of DirecTV Now's channel package. HBO will cost $5 extra per month, down from its usual $10 to $15 fee.RELATED:AT&T Swallows Razor-Thin Margins On $35 Video Streaming DealHulu Live Service Gets Fox And Disney, Waiting On CBS, NBCUJohn Malone Talks Up Apple Buy Of Disney, Likes AT&T Strategy

96,DISH,"A Sprint (S) merger with T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS) is more plausible under a Trump administration, says UBS, which hiked its price targets on Sprint and T-Mobile.A Sprint merger with T-Mobile is just one of many M&A scenarios, says UBS in a research report that also speculates that Verizon Communications (VZ) or Comcast (CMCSA) could acquire Sprint.UBS analyst John Hodulik hiked his price target on T-Mobile stock, which is controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), to 63 from 51. He hiked Sprint's PT to 9 from 7, while maintaining a neutral rating. Japan's SoftBank controls Sprint.""Our main question is the willingness of sellers to part with assets at reasonable prices given the number of potential buyers,"" said Hodulik in his report.""We believe T-Mobile could garner a multiple at the high-end given significant synergy opportunities and expectations of a more friendly regulatory approval process, which should increase the number of potential buyers,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Comcast's stock has gained 21% in 2016, with much of it coming since Trump's surprise election as President. AT&T stock, which had outperformed in the first half of 2016 amid the popularity of dividend-paying stocks, now is a laggard in the telecom sector. Lean more on telecom stocks at IBD Stock Checkup.In the stock market today, T-Mobile stock touched a record high for the fourth straight trading day, ending up 0.71% at 54.98. T-Mobile stock has shot up 40% in 2016 and is trading well-above it 50-day moving average. Sprint stock has charged ahead 121% on a subscriber rebound, though it's still losing money. It fell a fraction on Monday to 7.87 but earlier touched a 28-month high for a second straight day.Aside from a Sprint merger with T-Mobile, Hodulik says Verizon or Comcast could make an offer for debt-laden Sprint, which does have attractive tax credits for a buyer to utilize.T-Mobile has grabbed subscriber and revenue share from Verizon and AT&T (T) with its ""Uncarrier""-branded marketing campaign.AT&T seems out of the picture in wireless industry consolidation given its pending deal to acquire media giant Time Warner (TWX), says UBS. AT&T in October agreed to buy Time Warner for $85 billion.Hodulik also said that Verizon acquiring satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) or a Dish merger with T-Mobile loom as yet other scenarios.""The FCC under the Obama administration rejected 4-to-3 consolidation in wireless twice, blocked the creation of a cable behemoth and put 17 pages of conditions on a large satellite TV transaction despite finding it in the public interest,"" Hodulik wrote. ""Chairman Wheeler's departure from the FCC has to be music to the industry's ears.""RELATED:Sprint, T-Mobile Merger Hurdle: Subscriber ReboundsApple, Microsoft, Cisco Eye Trump Overseas Cash Tax PlanAT&T, Comcast, Verizon Eye Next FCC Chair, Eisenach Front-Runner?

97,DISH,"Sprint (S)-owner SoftBank Group seems to be setting the stage for another run at merging Sprint with T-Mobile US (TMUS), but T-Mobile Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) might prefer a suitor such as cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA), says Macquarie Capital.Billionaire businessman Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's founder and CEO, pledged a $50 billion investment in the U.S. following a Tuesday meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Son is setting up an investment fund with Saudi Arabia that would target the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and robotics. There's no indication Trump and Son talked directly about any possible Sprint merger with T-Mobile.Shares of Sprint and T-Mobile have climbed on news of the Trump-Son meeting. But Sprint's massive debt and industry consolidation trends could work against SoftBank and Sprint, Amy Yong and other Macquarie analysts wrote in a research report.""A handshake and a promise of $50 billion in U.S. investment reinforces our view that a Sprint-T-Mobile combo is no longer 'impossible,' though it's still not a slam dunk,"" the report said.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of chipmaker Broadcom, a supplier to smartphone makers like Apple, surged 4% Friday morning after it beat sales and earnings expectations. Broadcom is a current member of the IBD Leaderboard, which also includes Celgene and Netflix, a place to check to find top-performing stocks at or near possible buy points.Sprint and T-Mobile shares, though, on Friday gave back some recent gains. Sprint stock fell 3% and T-Mobile dropped 3.1% in the stock market today, but Sprint still is up 134% this year and T-Mobile stock has climbed 45%.Japan's SoftBank owns 83% of Sprint, while Germany's Deutsche Telekom owns two-thirds of T-Mobile.""Deutsche Telekom is content as an owner of T-Mobile and is in no rush for M&A,"" Yong added. ""Convergence dominates in Europe, which may sway them in favor of a cable-wireless combination.""We believe Deutsche Telekom would be pleased taking a lesser stake in a larger entity (for example Comcast-T-Mobile). One clear benefit is leverage; deconsolidating T-Mobile's net debt from Deutsche Telekom's balance sheet would lower net debt.""T-Mobile has openly courted cable TV partners on its earnings calls. But amid intensified wireless competition, the most profit-margin-friendly deal remains a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, many analysts say.Such a deal, though, would reduce the number of national wireless firms from four to three. The Obama administration blocked AT&T's (T) proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying it wanted to retain a four-player national market.RELATED:How Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosAT&T Seen Winning FirstNet, May Roil TV Airwaves AuctionT-Mobile Price Target Hiked On M&A Outlook With Sprint, Comcast, Dish

AT&T's announcement that it has surpassed the one million mark seems to put it on a similar subscriber growth path for the December quarter.AT&T has been packaging internet video streaming with wireless products as it aims to build a customer base that switches service providers less often. While DirecTV Now is growing, AT&T has been losing satellite TV and U-verse pay-TV customers.AT&T plans to upgrade DirecTV Now in early 2018 with internet video storage, 4K quality video, more movie and TV titles, and personalized viewing recommendations.Leichtman Research Group estimates that Dish's Sling-branded web streaming service has 1.68 million subscribers, including 240,000 added in the September quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Neither Alphabet-Google (GOOGL) nor Hulu's owners have disclosed subscriber numbers for their live TV streaming services.

103,DISH,"Dish Network (DISH) and CBS (CBS) agreed to a new multi-year contract, ending a blackout that would have left millions of satellite-TV subscribers without the nation's most-watched network and its popular football programming.X The agreement, which does not include online channels on Dish's Sling TV, allows Dish to use CBS content across various U.S. cities, according to a statement late Thursday. No financial details where provided. CBS and its local stations in 18 cities were pulled from Dish's service late Monday after failing to agree on a price that Dish would pay to carry the broadcast network.Media companies and pay-TV providers are tussling over how to split revenue from cable and satellite customers as subscriptions drop. Dish has lost 468,000 TV subscribers this year as people switch to streaming options like Netflix (NFLX). CBS has fared better, with revenue up 1.3% as fees from viewers and deals to license programs have more than offset falling audience ratings and ad sales.The standoff occurred during one of the most popular viewing times of the year, featuring big college football games throughout the Thanksgiving weekend, and an NFL doubleheader on Sunday. Still, the agreement came after the Dallas Cowboys played against the Los Angeles Chargers, resulting in Dish subscribers missing that game.The fact that CBS continues to keep its channels off Dish's Sling TV highlights how selective the broadcast network has been when making online TV partnerships. CBS offers All Access, its own web-based streaming service starting at $5.99 a month. And after holding out for months, CBS agreed in August to provide channels to AT&T (T)-owned DirecTV Now service. It's also available on Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google's YouTube TV service.Both companies faced risks if the blackout continued. Dish's 13.2 million customers are important to advertisers on CBS, which also counts on the satellite carrier's subscriber fees. Dish faced a backlash from angry subscribers who couldn't get the most-watched U.S. TV network and have more ways to cut their pay-TV subscriptions and replace them with cheaper online entertainment.RELATED:Dish Network Earnings, Revenue Miss Views But Internet TV Growing

105,DISH,"Increasingly, advisors are doing more than advising clients. They're educating the public.X Some planners seek to build their brand by sharing their investment philosophy or musings about the economy. Others want to empower investors to make smarter decisions or teach them about financial principles.Regardless of their motive, financial advisors seem intent on disseminating their thoughts in writing. From blogs to books, they're producing content like never before.If you're going to share your knowledge or opinions, what's the best vehicle to use? Posting short blogs from time to time on your firm's website is a low-cost, low-commitment endeavor. Writing a monthly or quarterly newsletter can strengthen your relationships with clients (and attract prospects), but it requires more time and effort. And completing a book can enhance your credibility and help you reach a wider audience.""What works best is pairing your writing channel with the appropriate demographic that you're trying to reach,"" said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner in New York City. ""Reaching certain baby boomers through social media can be a bad idea, because they may prefer a newsletter. But for Generation X or Generation Y, more digital content can be effective.""Even if you deliver substantive content to your target audience, you need to convey your points clearly and succinctly. Pruning away extraneous detail — and presenting digestible nuggets of insight — raises the odds that readers will take notice.It's also important to balance what you find fascinating with what your readers deem interesting and relevant to their lives. You may enjoy speculating about the inner workings of the Federal Reserve, while investors might simply want to know how the Fed's moves can impact their investments.Savvy advisors don't just write stuff in a vacuum, hoping that people read it. Instead, they follow the numbers to determine whether their content hits the mark.When Boneparth adds written material to his firm's website, he measures the results. Using tools such as MailChimp for email marketing, he tracks the number of readers, when they open a particular blog post or newsletter article, and how long they spend on it.""If you don't measure it, it's harder to make adjustments,"" he said. ""The analytics can show you if you're reaching whom you want to reach.""Boneparth, 33, wants to connect with readers from age 18 to 36. So he writes with them in mind, knowing that they tend to ""digest information in two- to three-minute spurts."" He also cites movies and other cultural touchstones that resonate with them.Some advisors strive to reach a mass audience in the hope of positioning themselves as thought leaders. With limited time to devote to writing, they may figure that the more readers they attract, the better.For the past three years, Jon Ten Haagen has written an article every other week for Long-Islander News, his regional newspaper. He's a certified financial planner in Huntington, N.Y.He says each ""Ask The Expert"" article takes about two hours to research and write, and he invites readers to sign up for his e-newsletter. He plans to compile the articles for a book.""I used to post my articles on my website, but that was a waste,"" he said. ""I didn't get much of a response. Now that I'm in the newspaper, I reach a lot more people.""For many advisors, the starting point for writing is launching a blog. They may lack grounding as writers, so blogging gives them a chance to polish their craft, find their voice and identify what topics trigger the most interest.Blogging requires experimentation and patience. Advisors usually don't see instant results, as it takes time to build a following. Those who offer compelling facts, trenchant observations and eye-catching graphics tend to stand out.Lauren Zangardi Haynes, a certified financial planner in Midlothian, Va., started a blog in 2016. Initially, she sought to help friends who posed questions about their personal finances.It took many months for her readership to grow. But she now finds that the blog solidifies her standing among prospects.""It's a way they can check me out before calling me,"" she said. ""People want to hire a planner who's knowledgeable, but it can be hard to connect with someone on a typical website.""Having the blog has also opened doors for new writing outlets. She has started to submit articles to a local magazine aimed at families.""I'm not sure I would have gotten that opportunity without having my blog in place,"" she said.RELATED: Why Quit Your Job?

106,DISH,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode.

107,DISH,"Neither Google nor Hulu's owners have disclosed subscriber numbers for their live TV streaming services, but Morgan Stanley says their success is helping give media companies a lift amid cable TV ""cord-cutting.""XBenjamin Swinburne, a Morgan Stanley analyst, estimates in a note to clients that Hulu Live has some 250,000 online subscribers while YouTube TV has 400,000. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google launched YouTube TV on April 5; Hulu Live started on May 3.But incumbent pay-TV companies AT&T (T) and Dish Network (DISH) have the most TV streaming subscribers and are adding to those numbers. Leichtman Research Group estimates that Dish's Sling-branded web streaming service has 1.68 million subscribers, including 240,000 added in the September quarter. AT&T's DirecTV Now service has 787,000 subscribers, including nearly 300,000 added in the third quarter.""At the margin, new virtual (streaming) adoption is a growing offset to traditional declines,"" Swinburne said in the report.AT&T has bundled its DirecTV Now streaming service with wireless products. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish also has not disclosed subscriber numbers.Cord-cutting, a term for consumers that cancel monthly pay-TV subscriptions, is still growing. LRG says the top six cable companies lost about 290,000 video subscribers in the third quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of about 90,000 subscribers a year earlier. Satellite TV services lost 475,000 subscribers vs. a gain of about 5,000 subscribers a year earlier.That's bad news for providers of content. Media companies such as Walt Disney (DIS), Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Time Warner (TWX) garner per-subscriber fees from pay-TV providers.Morgan Stanley's Swinburne, though, says media firms are getting a lift from the subscriber gains of Hulu Live, YouTube TV, Sling and DirecTV Now – even if per-subscriber revenue is lower than pay TV.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Google on Oct. 30 launched a new TV app for YouTube's streaming service, which could boost subscriber growth, analysts say.Hulu's parents are 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Disney, Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner.

109,DISH,"Merger talks that seem to have failed between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) rattled the telecom industry on Monday as investors sent up shares of Charter Communications (CHTR) and Dish Network (DISH) as possible partners for Sprint and T-Mobile — and boosted the fortunes of cellphone tower companies as well — while other telecom firms fell.XCharter gained 3.9% to 348.40 on speculation that Softbank could renew takeover talks with the No. 2 cable TV firm behind Comcast (CMCSA).  Cable industry pioneer John Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBDRA) is the biggest shareholder in Charter. Over the summer, Charter signaled that it's not interested in being acquired by Softbank.Meanwhile, Dish Network, another potential Sprint partner, climbed 5.7% to 50.82 on speculation it could eventually end up as a T-Mobile partner.The on-again, off-again talks between Sprint parent Softbank and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom collapsed over the weekend with both sides saying the deal is finally off. Sprint plunged 11.5% to close at 5.90 on the stock market today. T-Mobile lost 5.7% to finish at 55.54.AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) slipped as investors fretted that wireless competition will re-intensify after a brief lull. A merger combining Sprint and T-Mobile would have reduced the number of national wireless firms to three from four.""With T-Mobile and Sprint officially ending negotiations, we think we are likely back to a more challenging situation than we witnessed pre-election, with four players battling it out for market share,"" UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a note to clients. ""We believe competition will heat up after the recent abnormal lull as the holiday selling season begins, the Apple iPhone X becomes available and cable enters the mix.""IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile had been on the rise until early May, when it slipped into a flat base, where it's remained ever since. It was the top-ranked company in IBD's Telecom Services-Wireless Group but has since slipped to fourth place, behind Shenandoah Telecom, Mitel Networks and Boingo Wireless.

Federal regulators may file a lawsuit to block AT&T's $85 billion purchase of media giant Time Warner (TWX), reports said last week, although negotiations over conditions on the deal continue.If approved by regulators, a Sprint merger with T-Mobile would have eliminated one customer of the tower companies.Shares in American Tower (AMT) climbed 5.7% to 150.16, Crown Castle (CCI) rose 5% to 111.81 and SBA Communications (SBAC) gained 6.4% to 164.42. Wireless phone companies such as T-Mobile and Verizon rent tower space to house radio antennas.

110,DISH,"Is Bitcoin a great investment opportunity or a risky bubble waiting to burst like 1637's Dutch tulip mania?X Bitcoin's run-up has grown famous. Late Thursday morning, the digital currency was trading for more than $19,000 on exchanges in South Korea, before closing around $16,600 on Bitfinex, a large cryptocurrency exchange. The $19,000-ish price was up more than $5,000 in less than 24 hours. It was up from $12,000 at the start of the week. And it was up from a little more than $1,000 on Jan. 1.Not to belabor the point, but in 2016 alone the currency gained more than 100%.Still, in Friday morning trading  the cryptocurrency had fallen 7%.And now, in the coming week, in addition to the exchanges already hosting Bitcoin trade, Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) will launch Bitcoin futures contracts.So, should you pile into Bitcoin?

111,DISH,"Japan's Softbank could take Sprint (S) private if merger talks with T-Mobile US (TMUS) fall through, says one analyst.XJonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research, says Softbank Chairman Masayoshi Son could be engaged in high-stakes brinkmanship by threatening to walk away from a deal.If merger talks are scuttled, Softbank will need to invest billions of dollars in Spri nt's network, says Chaplin. That scenario could also involve Softbank taking Sprint private, he says.""If Softbank doesn't take Sprint private, the stock will be headed lower, and may well languish for some time before the new, new turnaround story emerges,"" Chaplin said in a note to clients.""This may be wishful thinking on the part of Sprint investors (and one embattled analyst); however, it isn't crazy (though we wouldn't expect the market to take it seriously),"" Chaplin said in his note, with parentheses included.Softbank owns 83% of Sprint.

It was the top-ranked company in IBD's Telecom Services-Wireless Group but has since slipped to third place, behind Boingo Wireless and Shenandoah Telecom.One view among analysts is that T-Mobile is less in need of a merger than debt-laden Sprint because T-Mobile has been taking market share from AT&T and Verizon Communications.Shares in satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) were unchanged on Tuesday after rising on Monday.

112,DISH,"Charter Communications (CHTR) can generate sufficient free cash flow to repurchase 25% of its current float by 2019, says RBC Capital, which initiated coverage of the No. 2 cable TV firm with an overweight rating.RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin set a price target of 325 on Charter stock. Media baron John Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) is the biggest shareholder in Charter, which trails cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA). Malone also controls European cable TV firm Liberty Global (LBTYA).Some observers speculate Comcast and Charter could team up to buy a wireless phone company, such as T-Mobile US (TMUS), if AT&T's push into mobile video succeeds. AT&T (T) last week launched its DirecTV Now video streaming service. AT&T's wireless customers can access DirecTV Now content without eating into monthly data caps.Atkin says if Charter does not make a major acquisition, then it's cable business will churn out enough free cash flow — net cash from operations minus capital expenditures — for a big stock buyback.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Comcast and Charter shot up after Donald Trump's surprise election as President on expectations broadband regulation will ease. Shares of T-Mobile US also popped on takeover speculation. If the cable firms pursue a wireless deal, T-Mobile's asking price would be high.

113,DISH,"As AT&T (T) forges ahead with its mobile video strategy, the incoming Trump administration aims to dismantle net neutrality rules that govern internet services, say political pundits.For AT&T, the timing couldn't be better. AT&T on Wednesday launched its DirecTV Now online video streaming service. The linchpin to AT&T's mobile video strategy is allowing its wireless subscribers to stream DirecTV Now without eating into their monthly data caps.While President Obama's Federal Communications Commission has voiced concern that AT&T's DirecTV Now plans might well conflict with net neutrality, a Republican-led FCC is not likely to stand in AT&T's way.Whether broadband service providers like AT&T can favor their own services has been one of the hot potatoes in the net neutrality debate. Net neutrality rules bar internet service providers from throttling, blocking or prioritizing web traffic. Under the Obama administration, the FCC sought new regulatory authority to enforce the rules and extended them to wireless networks for the first time.IBD'S TAKE: Comcast's stock has gained 21% in 2016, with much of it coming since Trump's surprise election as President. AT&T stock, which had outperformed in the first half of 2016 amid the popularity of dividend-paying stocks, now lags. Learn more about companies that may gain from lighter regulation at IBD Stock Checkup.A Trump FCC, on the other hand, will likely favor ISPs at the expense of companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Netflix (NFLX), analysts say. ISPs such as Comcast (CMCSA), AT&T, Verizon Communications (VZ) and Charter Communications (CHTR) could get a boost from new revenue streams.If net neutrality rules are weakened or eliminated, ISPs might be able to charge online video services for network bandwidth usage, raising questions for web streaming services from the likes of CBS (CBS), Alphabet's YouTube and soon Hulu, or potentially Walt Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL), among others that might join the competition. ISPs might seek fees for ""fast lane"" services from content providers.""We expect the idea of paying for fast lanes to be front and center in the debate,"" Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack told IBD. ""Content providers are likely to oppose any change, though larger, well-capitalized companies could hold an advantage relative to (smaller startups) unwilling or unable to pay for fast lanes.""Some observers say the stakes are big.""As video becomes an increasingly important growth driver for large-scale internet platforms (Amazon.com's (AMZN) Prime, Google's YouTube, Facebook (FB) Live), the risks posed by rollback of net neutrality are magnified,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a research report.While many pundits have touted a doomsday scenario for net neutrality, Trump hardly mentioned telecom policy during the campaign, so it's still uncertain if he'll seek to totally gut net neutrality. He did, however, voice opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), saying it would result in too much concentration of media power in one company's hands.AT&T stock fell 3% on Friday, Oct. 21, on reports of the deal for Time Warner, which the companies announced the next day, sending AT&T shares down another 1.7% the following Monday. Since then, AT&T stock has risen 5.5%, closing Friday down a fraction, to 38.61.Also, Trump has named two net neutrality opponents to his telecom transition team. One of them, pro-business economist Jeffrey Eisenach, could be named the next FCC chairman.The agency's current senior Republican member, Ajit Pai, also is in the running, analysts say. If current FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler steps down in January, Pai could be named chairman at least on an interim basis, until the U.S. Senate holds hearings on administration appointees.Obama named his telecom transition leader, Julius Genachowski, as the new FCC chairman in March 2009. The Senate, though Democratic-controlled, didn't confirm Genachowski as chair until late June that year.Pai is a net neutrality critic and a longtime Washington insider.Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan is cautious about sweeping changes under a new FCC in any event. He expects Republican lawmakers in Congress to play a bigger role.""We believe this group (lawmakers) is significantly more dovish on the net neutrality concept than their FCC peers,"" said Horan in a research report. ""We conclude the FCC will likely withdraw their authority to enforce net neutrality. However, we also believe that legislation will be passed that reintroduces the core tenants of net neutrality.""Republicans hold a narrow majority in the Senate, so Democrats could aim to stall any net neutrality bill with a filibuster.Andy Lipman senior partner at Washington, D.C., law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, says Republicans could forge a compromise with enough Senate Democrats to pass a bill that takes away the ""Title II"" public utility-type net neutrality rules sought by Obama's FCC while preserving core open internet tenets, such as no blocking or throttling of content.A new telecom bill might leave it up to the FCC to address issues such as fast-lane prioritization of content or ""zero-rating,"" a regulatory term for what AT&T is doing with wireless data caps, says Lipman.In the end, that would be good for ISPs.""Enforcement is at bottom discretionary,"" Lipman told IBD. ""A Republican FCC would be less willing to micromanage sponsored data and zero-rating.""Netflix stock has been among those pressured by hand-wringing over net neutrality.Netflix accounts for more than 30% of peak downstream internet traffic, making it a prime target of broadband providers for bandwidth fees, says a Baird report.During the Obama administration, Netflix pushed for stricter regulation of interconnection agreements between ISPs and programmers that operate their own content delivery networks.Interconnection deals involve internet ports, network locations where data traffic is exchanged. Netflix works with middlemen such as Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Cogent Communications (CCOI), whose networks carry traffic between cities.""Netflix already has paying arrangements in place with the major ISPs in the U.S.,"" said Ralph Schackart, an analyst at William Blair. ""Any potential reversal of net neutrality rules by the FCC would not supersede agreements that are already established. We believe the net neutrality fears are overblown.""RELATED:AT&T, Comcast, Verizon Eye Next FCC Chair, Eisenach Front-Runner?How Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosFCC's Wheeler, At Urging Of Republicans, Pulls Controversial ItemsComcast: Does Trump Win Portend Regulatory Rollback?

114,DISH,"Think you've got the post-election stock-market winners' sorted out? Well, have you considered consumer discretionary or companies likely to gain an edge as new tax rules are applied? Award-winner Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) sees stocks like CarMax (KMX), Charles Schwab (SCHW), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) doing well as a Trump administration ushers in corporate tax cuts and interest-rate hikes.Schwab and Fox also stand to benefit from demographic trends and the rising prospects of media-content winners.And despite issues weighing on Alphabet, Macauley expects the internet giant to nearly double earnings in the next five years.The $2.4 billion Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) is a Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner. To learn more about its managers' visions of likely stock-market leaders in the months and years ahead, IBD turned to Brian Macauley, one of the fund's three managers. Macauley, who is 42 years old, shared insights on those and other stocks he thinks will do well as corporate America adapts to life under new political leadership. He spoke from his office in Arlington, Va.IBD: Your fund's low turnover rate makes it look static. But the fund is flexible in other ways. Is that its real secret sauce?Macauley: Right, we don't manage to a style box or by market-capitalization size.This is a go-anywhere portfolio with an emphasis on finding long-term compounders — businesses with the competitive position, growth, and management to create outsized value over an extended period of time. We most often find business with these characteristics in the mid cap space, but sometimes small- or large-cap companies will fit our model.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders We try to build a portfolio with attractive expected returns and low risk of loss. We do not want artificial capitalization limitations or style boxes to constrain us.IBD: You recently told me your usual turnover rate is slightly higher. Why is that?Macauley: On average our turnover is about 15%. This past year is one of the lower years. The reason is that in general we've not had a lot of market volatility, so we haven't seen a lot of mispricing to take advantage of.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Whether 4% or 15%, this fund differs from its Hennessy stablemates, which rebalance just once a year, right?Macauley: We buy and sell when it is appropriate in the marketplace. We have a very different approach from our stablemates.IBD: Your turnover rate is a fraction of the 66% pace for U.S diversified stock mutual funds on average, according to Morningstar Inc.Macauley: Right.IBD: Tell me more about the traits you seek in stocks.Macauley: We're looking for businesses with a wide competitive moat, durable competitive advantages that can earn outsized returns on capital even if competitors come into their market. We look for businesses that have a different mousetrap that can gain a lot of market share over time, or that have a secular tailwind that benefits them or their whole industry.We look for high quality management that thinks and acts like long-term owners. We look for a low risk of catastrophic outcome. We try to stay away from situations where there's rapidly changing technology or a fad or a fashion risk.And we try to meld growth with valuation. We will pay for quality, but we want to make sure we get in at a discount. Warren Buffett says that a lot of accounting vagaries obscure the true economics of a business. We try to look through vagaries and understand a business's true economics.IBD: I know this is unlikely, but has the fund done anything to take advantage of the Trump election?Macauley: We don't make directional bets based on individual economic influences. We had a number of REITs and yield-sensitive positions do poorly (amid election results), but those have been offset by strength in our more consumer discretionary and yield beneficiary names.Names that benefited were CarMax, Charles Schwab and Encore Capital Group (ECPG).CarMax is the largest used-car retailer in the U.S. It has a differentiated consumer proposition — it is a no-haggle-on-price dealer. And it offers a wide selection of late-model used cars, making them easy to use to purchase a car.IBD'S TAKE: To get a handle on whether no-haggle pricing helps car-sellers like CarMax, read this IBD report.They've grown to 170 stores and should be able to about double their store base as they march across the U.S. in the next 10 to 12 years.They get two benefits from the Trump election. One, if there are tax cuts, then consumers will have more discretionary dollars in their pockets. Second, they are a purely U.S. company that pays a high tax rate. To any extent that corporate tax rates change, they could see a cut.Schwab is a broker and custodian of investor assets, serving individuals, wealth planners and registered investment advisors. They benefit from brokers leaving wirehouses like (Bank of America (BAC)-owned) Merrill Lynch and becoming fee-only advisors. Schwab provides the enabling technology for advisors to do that. Also, as baby boomers retire and roll their 401(k) balances into IRAs and look for financial advice, Schwab is a solution for them.And Schwab holds a lot of cash from clients. They can lend that out and buy securities with it. As rates rise, they earn more from that.IBD'S TAKE: Schwab is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank/Bankers industry group due to key growth metrics. It has a top-notch IBD Composite Rating. Consulting IBD's Stock Checkup is a quick way to get a handle on the traits of a stock like this.Encore Capital Group purchases charged-off credit-card receivables. Encore is a specialist in trying to get people to pay what they owe on those credit-card debts. Regulatory burden has compressed this industry to essentially two competitors that control 90% of the industry. It's difficult for new players to come back in. And it takes a large operation to collect debt efficiently.A softer regulatory environment should allow the supply of debt to come to market more quickly.IBD: Does Alphabet's recent softness reflect investors' fear that a Trump presidency will bring trade wars and an economic slump?Macauley: Our thesis is that between growth in online advertising and improved monetization of mobile search and growth at YouTube, that Google (Alphabet) should nearly double their earnings over the next five years. From the current valuation, that's a reasonable opportunity given the high quality business we believe Google is.Their competitive moat is not technology so much as it is users' habits. So there's a low risk of Google being leapfrogged.The election has done three things: One, it has caused scrutiny of low corporate tax rates. We think Google's taxes are not so low, but there still could be some increased tax burden. Second, if there is a trade war, Google and other large technology companies are high-profile places that other countries can retaliate against. Finally, there is the obtuse risk that these technology companies were biased in their presentations of (political) information during the campaign. They may receive more scrutiny from the new administration because of that.IBD: What's driving accelerating earnings per share growth at American Woodmark (AMWD), a kitchen cabinet maker?Macauley: About half of their business is driven by new home construction, which is still climbing out of a depression. We have a long way to go to get to long-term historical norms, so that cyclical uplift is a tailwind.Another thing: during this housing recession they had net cash that they used to improve their service levels and gain market share.After partnering with Home Depot (HD), then Lowe's (LOW), then large home builders in the 1980s, in the last few years they finally had the bandwidth to service the small kitchen-bath market.And they've culled out a lot of lower margin customers in the last few years, filling their capacity with higher-profit customers. So they will have much higher operating margins going forward.And they benefit from the election. Some of their competitors import products. Woodmark pays a full tax rate, so if corporate taxes go down they benefit. And if people have more discretionary income due to tax cuts, they're more likely to buy a home or remodel.IBD: Marlin Business Services (MRLN), which provides leasing for small-ticket equipment leasing, has trended higher in recent weeks. Any election cause and effect?Macauley: They are simply very good at underwriting those leases. They work with people leasing copying machines, equipment for dentists' offices, restaurant equipment. Because of the regulatory environment, regular banks have pulled back from this space. Even where banks compete, it can take weeks to get a loan from banks, but just hours from Marlin. And Marlin is working to bring this to other (business areas). That provides a good forward outlook.IBD: Why do you like 21st Century Fox among media companies?Macauley: The media world is separating into winners and losers, and 21st Century Fox will be a winner. They have must-have content. And they are included in all important over-the-top solutions like Hulu, Google Unplugged, Dish Network (DISH).IBD: Does ""over-the-top"" mean independent from a cable provider?Macauley: Yes. All you need is an internet solution. It's a more efficient means of distribution. People who want to cut the cord with their cable provider are likely to end up with a noncable solution that includes Fox content. And over-the-top is attractive to advertisers because ads can be targeted and lower advertisers' cost per thousand of reaching viewers.In addition, Fox owns 30% of Hulu, which we think will be successful.IBD: Insurance seems staid. What's the appeal of Aon (AON)?Macauley: This is a company that should be relatively a-cyclical, with a low teens growth profile.They are one of only three providers with a global insurance footprint, so there aren't many other places you can go for global coverage. And with their size, they collect a tremendous amount of data. They create information solutions that are valuable to clients and insurance companies, which enables them to grow market share. And they are available at a fairly attractive price — about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: American Tower (AMT) pulled back after the election. Do you still like it?Macauley: The stock has come under pressure as almost all REITs have because interest rates have risen and there's some expectation they might continue to rise, which would make (some) REITs worth less.In addition, there's concern that the new administration would be more amenable to a merger between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). Obama was strongly against the merger. If two large tenants merge, it would reduce revenue growth at American Tower for some period.Despite the risk, with its growth profile this is one of our four best ideas, which is why on one of our largest positions we (recently) could buy it cheaper than it was just days earlier.IBD: Why has O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) rallied in recent weeks?Macauley: O'Reilly is the best in their industry at getting parts to customers quickly. They've set up a distribution network that's more robust than anyone else's. And in this business, especially on the commercial side, a mechanic needs same-day parts so he can fix a car and return it to a customer in the afternoon. O'Reilly is in the best position to do that.They have 4,500 stores today. They'll have 6,500 or 7,000 stores in the U.S. over the next 10 years.They pay a full tax rate, so any tax cut should benefit them. As for possible new tariffs, they do import parts from Asia, but all of their competitors do as well. And any increase in tariffs will be passed on to their end customers.IBD: Mistras Group (MG) gapped down 13% on Oct. 7, a day after reporting a 4% decline in first-quarter EPS growth and a downward revision for the fiscal year. It has rallied since then. Do you still like the stock?Macauley: If you run an oil refinery, let's say, you deal with a very corrosive product. Mistras inspects plants to make sure it does not blow up. They are the leader in nondestructive testing for oil and gas and other infrastructure assets, like aerospace and bridges.Our thesis is that they can hold their market position and improve margins by applying some better-business practices being brought to them by the CFO they hired a few years ago. The business will be valuable to a private equity or strategic buyers. We think somebody else will own it after (current management) fixes the operations.IBD: Since you don't trade a lot, how do you spend your days?Macauley: We spend time monitoring businesses we own and industry developments. We have a watch list of 75 companies that represent our next-best ideas, and we always try to stay on top of that. It's a continual process of looking for ideas that are superior to what we already own.IBD: How do you and your co-managers divide portfolio responsibilities? Is each of you responsible for certain sectors, for example?Macauley: We're all equally responsible for names in the portfolio. Our voting on trades is one-third, one-third, one-third, majority rules. Day to day, we have a primary analyst in charge of each name. I'm the primary on CarMax, for example. My partners know my primary businesses well, but not in quite as much detail as I do.IBD: Financials are the fund's largest sector, with a 29% weighting as of Sept. 30. Why is that?Macauley: There is an important distinction for us. We're really invested in specialty companies. We do not tend to own traditional depository banks or commodity financials. Markel (MKL) is our largest. It's a specialty insurer. It's also our oldest holding. The records don't still exist, but I believe it's been in the fund since the fund opened in 1997.Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) (the fund owns A shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange) is an alternative asset manager. It invests in assets other than stocks and bonds. It owns office buildings, toll roads, retail real estate, hydroelectric plants, electrical transmission lines. They are infrastructure related assets.IBD: You had a 15% cash weighting as of Sept. 30, well above the industry average.

115,DISH,"Time Warner (TWX) stock climbed Thursday, a sign that investors may think AT&T's (T) proposed acquisition of the media giant will get approved by the Trump administration.While campaigning for president, Donald Trump voiced opposition to AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner. AT&T announced the $85 billion deal on Oct. 24. AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 per share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock has been trading far below that level amid uncertain regulatory approval.Time Warner stock rose 2.5% to 94.14 on the stock market today, its highest close since late 2001. Time Warner stock is up nearly 8% since Nov. 14.AT&T shares rose 0.65% Thursday.An Oppenheimer report last week quoted Andrew Lipman, a senior partner at Washington D.C. law firm Morgan Lewis, as saying candidate Trump's comments were likely ""rhetoric, not necessarily in line with what he will do as President.""IBD's TAKE: AT&T stock, along with Verizon Communications, were top performers in the first half of 2016 owing to their dividends. Apple and Cisco Systems are other companies that are increasing shareholder returns.

Several high-ranking Democratic lawmakers also have raised doubts over the merger.Time Warner shareholders will own about 15% of the combined company.If regulators approve the Time Warner acquisition, AT&T will have a national wireless network plus the assets of satellite broadcaster DirecTV, acquired in 2015, and the programming of Time Warner to whisk content to mobile devices.Time Warner's media empire includes HBO and Turner Broadcasting, which has rights to sports telecasts. It also owns Warner Bros. film studio and cable networks TNT, TBS and CNN. Time Warner owns a 10% stake in internet video provider Hulu.RELATED:AT&T Downgraded, FCC Might Also Review Time Warner AcquisitionDOJ Files Antitrust Lawsuit Vs.

Analysts had modeled EPS of 68 cents.Dish stock rose 2.2% to close at 57.93 the stock market today, as markets rallied after initially tumbling on Donald Trump's surprise victory in the U.S. presidential race.Dish Network had 13.64 million pay TV subscribers as of Sept. 30, down from 13.9 million a year earlier. The company does not break out its subscribers to its Sling-branded Internet video service but instead lumps them in with its total subscriber count.pay TV average monthly revenue per user (ARPU) in Q3 was $89.44, up 3.6% from $86.33 in the year-earlier quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Dish Network stock has traded on takeover speculation more than fundamentals, as its core pay TV business slows. Most mergers are on hold until a government spectrum auction ends. Investors interested in growth companies can take a look at IBD's Sector Leaders, where Palo Alto Networks on Monday joined Inphi and Gigamon.""Dish reported better sub metrics, against low expectations, as higher churn (tighter acquisition and retention policies) was offset by stronger gross adds. ARPU (+3.6% y/y) was in line, as was revenue,"" Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack wrote in a research note. ""However, EBITDA was below expectations given higher programming and advertising expense.""We expect little news on wireless strategy, which remains the key driver of stock performance.""

117,DISH,"Shares in Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) tumbled Monday after Japanese media firm Nikkei reported Softbank plans to call off merger talks with Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), though there were some reports the companies may still be at the bargaining table.Sprint plunged 9.3% to close at 6.34 on the stock market today after sinking as much as 13% earlier. T-Mobile tumbled 5.4% to finish at 59.58. Shares in satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) rose 4.1% to end the regular trading session at 48.39. Spectrum-rich Dish has been looking for a wireless partner.One view among analysts is that T-Mobile is less in need of a merger than debt-laden Sprint because T-Mobile has been taking market share from AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ). Brokerage MoffettNathanson recently in a report said Sprint could be valued at around $3 per share if a deal falls through.T-Mobile added 595,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the September quarter, once again leading the big four national wireless firms.Both Sprint and T-Mobile skipped earnings calls last week with analysts as parents Sprint and Deutsche Telekom continued to haggle over a merger.Sprint stock has been pressured by speculation that terms of the deal could disappoint its shareholders. SoftBank reportedly has been willing to give Deutsche Telekom a majority position in a combined Sprint and T-Mobile. However, SoftBank's board on Friday decided not to give up control, said the Nikkei report.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile had been on the rise until early May, when it slipped into a flat base, where it's remained ever since. It was the top-ranked company in IBD's Telecom Services-Wireless Group but has since slipped to third place, behind Boingo Wireless and No. 2 Shenandoah Telecom.Softbank chairman Masayoshi Son signaled in the spring that Softbank would be willing to cede control in order to get a deal done.However, SoftBank may not be willing to give Deutsche Telekom management control if it's only prepared to make a deal at or below Sprint's market price, analysts say.With a majority position, Deutsche Telekom would be able to consolidate the merged company's financial results.Sprint stock jumped after Republican Donald Trump won November's presidential election. Some analysts say that the Trump administration could approve a Sprint merger with T-Mobile, though regulators have opposed reducing the number of national wireless firms to three from four.RELATED:Three Reasons Why Telecom Merger Party On Hold: Goldman SachsT-Mobile Stock Buyback Possible In 2018, Says CFOTelecom Mergers: A 'Game Of Thrones' Without The Dragons

118,DISH,"Gourmands know the name Nobuyuki Matsuhisa. Also known as Nobu, he's the founder of the internationally renowned Matsuhisa and Nobu restaurant chains as well as Nobu Hotels.But fame didn't come easily. In fact, there was a time early on when if he didn't have bad luck, he had no luck at all.Matsuhisa's father died when Nobu was just a schoolboy in Japan. As a young teen without a driver's license, he ""borrowed"" his older brother's car and got into an accident that resulted in his expulsion from school.He apprenticed at a sushi restaurant where he spent three years washing dishes and making deliveries. Eventually, however, he learned about fish and sushi preparation, and became a favorite among the restaurant's clientele. When one regular, a Japanese-Peruvian, offered to help him open a restaurant in Peru, Nobu jumped at the chance.You'd think finding his calling and someone to finance it might mean his luck had changed. But you'd be wrong.The restaurant's success only fueled discord between the chef and his investor who, Matsuhisa writes in his newly published memoir, "" Nobu,"" put ""profit over quality.""There followed other stops, including a restaurant in Anchorage, Alaska, that burned to the ground 50 days after it opened. At the time, Matsuhisa was so upset that he contemplated suicide, a notion he rejected only because of thoughts about his family.""(Without) my wife and two daughters, I would have taken my life,"" he told IBD. ""My wife and two daughters gave me the energy to keep going. They saved my life.""Through a friend, Matsuhisa arranged a job in Los Angeles, where he worked for a decade at two sushi restaurants before, in 1987, opening his own, the eponymous Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills.It was almost an immediate success, for a number of reasons. Perhaps foremost was Matsuhisa's desire to please. In part this is due to ""omotenashi,"" the Japanese spirit of hospitality and service. He treats his customers ""like a family."" He'd greet them, ask what they liked and didn't like, and would explain the food to them as he made the rounds. He wasn't constrained by what was on the menu.His thought process: What would I want if I was a customer? How would I like to be treated?But his prime selling point, of course, was his food. His experiences in Peru (and Argentina, as well) led him to create distinctive dishes that combine Japanese style with South American ingredients such as  jalapeno-accented yellowtail and Chilean sea bass with miso.Some might call it fusion, but Matsuhisa disagrees. ""My cooking is Japanese. Every dish has a Japanese taste.""Whatever it's called, the unique combination soon attracted excellent reviews and overflow crowds. Tom Cruise was once turned away and New Yorker Robert De Niro became a regular when in Los Angeles. In fact, De Niro liked the food so much that the actor offered to help Matsuhisa open a New York location.Meir Teper, a film producer who became an investor, recalled that ""Mr. De Niro asked Nobu if he ever wanted to do something with him — he would love to do it with him.""In the beginning Nobu wasn't very excited. He was at Matsuhisa every night and he thought it would be too difficult to open another restaurant.""Four years later, De Niro tried again, this time getting a positive response. In 1994, Matsuhisa, Teper, De Niro and restaurateur Drew Nieporent opened the first Nobu restaurant, which are typically larger than Matsuhisa and less expensive, but based on the same concept of Japanese food with a helping of Latin American ingredients.Teper was confident of its success. He understood that ""the restaurant business is risky, but most business is risky. But the food (at Matsuhisa) was really special, and I thought there was really nothing like it in New York.""He was right. ""It was such a big success people started calling (about opening another),"" Teper said. ""The first gentleman was from London.""Interestingly, the Londoner wanted to sign a deal that excluded De Niro, but for Matsuhisa loyalty is a must. ""De Niro was a partner in the first Nobu. He's the one who invited me to New York. I can't go on without him.""The investor acquiesced, and once the deal was signed Matsuhisa spent a month in London sampling the food available at the city's sushi restaurants. What he found was uninspiring, he said, and fueled his confidence ""and my passion to share the delights of good sushi with people in England.""Once Nobu opened, Matsuhisa spent a month in the restaurant kitchen training his chefs on how to meet his high standards. Personal oversight is a hallmark of his operation. He said that his style of management dictates that in ""every country, every continent, food is prepared the same way"" so that the restaurants are ""familiar and like family to our customers.""To assure that, Matsuhisa spends virtually all his life on the road. At first, it was two weeks in Los Angeles, and a week each in New York and London. As the locations expanded, however, so did his travel schedule.""I travel 10 months a year,"" he said. ""I get to see all my kids (employees) around the world. I want the chefs to understand my style of cooking, my recipes.""I remember how thrilled I was to see the dishes that I had invented at Matsuhisa being produced identically in New York and again in London.""When he visits one of his restaurants, it's not a one-way conversation, though. ""I learn from them also. I travel to find something new, which is very important to the business.""Cross-pollination is also important to him. Chefs from London were sent to both Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills and Nobu in New York, while Nobu New York chefs were sent to London. The goal: to learn from each other.Chef exchanges continues to this day.While Matsuhisa obviously likes uniformity of product, he doesn't necessarily believe that you have to go along with the herd. During his first December in London, his manager planned to close the restaurant during the holidays, apparently a common practice in the city. But Matsuhisa demurred. The restaurant was located in a hotel that he knew would be filled with tourists and, as it turned out, so was the restaurant.""The experience confirmed my belief that while it's important to adapt to local ways, stepping outside convention is often just as good for business as it is for inspiring new recipes,"" he said.One of the areas where Matsuhisa excels is in employee relations. He believes in second chances, in part because he remembers his own early failures. He prefers praise to scorn. In Japan, he says, there is a strong tendency to point out faults. In fact, there's a saying: ""The nail that sticks out gets hammered down.""Matsuhisa prefers the way it's done here. ""Americans are good at praising people,"" he observed. And he likes to see that up and down the ranks. In fact, when he visits a restaurant, he makes a point of stopping to greet the dishwasher.""That's how I started. For three years I was a dishwasher and busboy. I understand how tough the work is. All day your hands are in hot soapy water, brushing dishes. If the plates are dirty, the chefs can't present the food.""His philosophy appears to be working. At last count, there were 47 Nobu and Matsuhisa restaurants and six Nobu Hotels around the world.Built two international sushi restaurant chains and then added hotels to his empire.Overcame: Need by some investors to increase profits.Lesson: Stick to your principles, even if it means speaking truth to power.Quote: ""Drew (Nieporent) wanted more sales, more money. He wanted us to put in more tables. I spoke to him and said people aren't machines. We're not robots. If I hadn't confronted him, the spirit of Matsuhisa may never have been carried over to Nobu.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS AND SUCCESS:Ina Garten's Recipe For Success: Equal Parts Simplicity And CharmCelebrity Chef Paul Prudhomme Caught Fire With Cajun-Creole CookingWolfgang Puck, Food Network Feeding Mobile AppetiteJulia Child Set The Course For The Foodie Craze

119,DISH,"The Department of Justice's antitrust battle with AT&T (T) likely will quash near-term megamergers involving media companies, such as 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), analysts say.XOn the other hand, if AT&T winds up acquiring Time Warner (TWX) as planned, more so-called vertical mergers involving media, telecom or internet companies might quickly follow in a new competitive landscape, they add.The Trump administration's crackdown on AT&T will make other companies leery of making media acquisitions, says Andy Hargreaves, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets.""The DOJ's lawsuit significantly increases uncertainty around the application of antitrust law. This is likely to dramatically slow the pace of M&A in media, and possibly other industries,"" Hargreaves said in a note to clients.The Department of Justice announced Monday it is suing to block AT&T's merger with media giant Time Warner. The DOJ says the megamerger would be harmful to consumers because the combined company might extract higher prices for Time Warner content from other video distributors such as Dish Network (DISH) or Charter Communications (CHTR).AT&T could also try to withhold content from emerging internet video rivals, such as Amazon.com (AMZN) or Apple (AAPL), asserts the DOJ.Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has reportedly engaged in talks with Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA), Amazon, and Verizon Communications (VZ), according to reports.John Hodulik, a UBS analyst says Fox is unlikely to made a deal until the AT&T case is resolved.""We expect the industry to be in a holding pattern pending final determination but continue to believe secular shifts will drive further M&A over the long-term,"" Hodulik said in his report.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.AT&T agreed to buy Time Warner for $85 billion in October 2016. AT&T has raised significant debt to finance the deal, notes a Wells Fargo report. AT&T aims for an expedited trial, with a court decision in 4 to 6 months.The DOJ has asked AT&T to sell off Turner Broadcasting or its DirecTV satellite business to gain approval. AT&T says no divestitures are required by law. The DOJ says it's not interested in placing conditions on AT&T as it did on Comcast in 2011, when the cable TV firm bought NBCUniversal. The conditions on Comcast expire in 2018.Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a report says the lawsuit's outcome will shape future M&A. If AT&T wins and no programming access conditions are placed on the deal, Moffett said: ""The only feasible alternative for distribution competitors would be to acquire their own content, either to differentiate their services from AT&T's or, alternatively, to threaten mutually assured destruction if AT&T's (Time Warner) content were to be withheld.""RELATED:AT&T Calls Out CNN Issue As DOJ Moves To Block Time Warner DealAT&T, Time Warner Deal In Distress?

120,DISH,"The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission may overreach in dismantling Obama administration net-neutrality rules, thereby fueling a future counter-reversal by a Democratic majority agency, says a longtime cable TV industry analyst.XCraig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, says FCC Chairman Ajit Pai jettisoned some pre-Obama existing internet rules, such as equal treatment of web content, that could go beyond the pale.""To judge by the public commentary, even the (service providers) themselves seem to suspect that this seeming good fortune will prove transitory.  A more limited reversal might have stood a better chance of standing for a while,"" Moffett said in a note to clients.""One obvious problem with anything out of the FCC on what has become such a hyperpartisan topic is that it can so easily be reversed by the next (Democratic) FCC,"" he added.Most observers had expected Pai would eliminate so-called ""Title 2"" regulations brought by the FCC under President Obama that put internet service providers in the same camp as public utilities. Few expected Pai to reach beyond Obama-era enforcement.The FCC will vote on Pai's proposal at its Dec. 14 meeting. Pai says the changes will encourage more broadband investment by service providers.Net-neutrality rules have been a political hot potato for over a decade. They've focused on consumer access to websites, the speed of web connections, and whether internet service providers can charge content firms or business partners for superior network performance.Back-and-forth regulatory shifts may not be what investors or broadband service providers need, says Moffett.""One can't imagine that there are any broadband providers who would be eager to test the limits of what is now allowable under this regulatory regime, given the enormous risk of popular and/or regulatory or legislative backlash,"" he said.Comcast (CMCSA), in a statement on Tuesday, noted: ""Independent of any FCC action, Comcast's commitment to our customers remains the same: We do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.""IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Under Pai's proposal, service providers may be able to charge content providers or business partners fees for ""prioritized"" services. Some regulatory authority on consumer protection would shift to the Federal Trade Commission.Pai says new ""transparency"" rules requiring policy disclosures by service providers will protect consumers.Moffett says it is unlikely Congress will step in to deal with net-neutrality issues on a bipartisan basis.RELATED:Why AT&T's Antitrust Battle May Quash Other Media MegamergersHow Hulu Live, YouTube TV Are Helping AT&T, Dish StreamingCable TV's Hail Mary: Hike Broadband Prices Amid Cord-Cutting

121,DISH,"Internet service providers such as AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ) could get a bigger-than-expected lift from overhauled net neutrality rules under a preliminary proposal from Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.Pai let trickle some key elements of his proposal via a commentary piece he wrote that appeared in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. As expected, Pai proposed that the telecom agency eliminate public-utility-type Title 2 regulations that were foisted on internet service providers by the Obama administration. The Title 2 rules are part of the Communications Act of 1934.Pai may in principle retain rules that bar ISPs from blocking or slowing web content, although they won't be enforced under Title 2 authority.""I look forward to returning to the light-touch, market-based framework that unleashed the digital revolution and benefited consumers here and around the world,"" Pai said in a news release.The Republican-led FCC will vote on Pai's proposal at its Dec. 14 meeting.There's speculation Pai's proposal could open the door to these service providers to seek fees from content producers or business partners for internet ""fast lanes"" or ""paid prioritization."" That could be a significant revenue stream for companies like Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR), AT&T and Verizon.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The details of Pai's proposal, which may include paid prioritization, are expected to be posted on the FCC's website Wednesday morning.Pai is expected to propose getting rid of the Obama-era ""general conduct"" rule that gives the FCC broad power to police all broadband activity by internet service providers.And, Pai proposed that the Federal Trade Commission re-asset its authority to protect consumer privacy in broadband services.Comcast, in a statement released on Tuesday said: ""(Pai's) proposal is not the end of net neutrality rules.

AT&T also blamed recent hurricanes for video subscriber losses. Comcast (CMCSA), which in early September warned of video subscriber losses, shed 3.3% to 36.19.Comcast had attributed some of its video subscriber weakness to aggressive promotions launched by AT&T's landline ""U-verse""-branded TV service. Analysts say AT&T's DirecTV satellite TV service likely suffered the bulk of its subscriber losses in the third quarter.Shares in satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) fell 5.1% to 49.03 on Thursday. While AT&T bought DirecTV for $49 billion in 2016, analysts say Dish has had trouble finding a suitor amid continued subscriber losses.Both AT&T and Dish have launched internet video services. AT&T said it added 300,000 online DirecTV Now subscribers in the third quarter, offsetting some of the traditional pay TV losses. However, both AT&T and Dish garner less profit from internet services than traditional pay TV, analysts say.While AT&T is losing a net 90,000 video subscribers, it's traditional pay TV customer losses in third quarter are higher — 390,000 — partially offset by the addition of 300,000 internet video subscribers.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.UBS estimates that Dish's Sling service has 1.8 million subscribers and DirecTV Now 760,000.

Eisenach opposes net neutrality rules.Trump on Monday named Eisenach as a top advisor on his transition team for telecom issues. At minimum, he'll help staff the agency, and he might well wind up as chairman, analysts say.""Eisenach is a front-runner for the FCC chair,"" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan said in a research report. ""Eisenach will likely craft an FCC makeup that rolls back net neutrality.""IBD'S TAKE: Internet giants Facebook, Google, Amazon.com and tech companies such as Netflix and Apple have a stake in the Trump administration's broadband and media regulation. After a post-election sell-off, the so-called FANG stocks have bounced back. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. Eisenach currently is a managing director at NERA Economic Consulting and a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He has worked as a consultant to Verizon and the National Association of Broadcasters.Net neutrality rules require internet service providers to treat all data equally and bar them from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content.Wheeler has been at odds with the cable-TV industry over internet regulation and so-called net neutrality rules; broadband data privacy; opening up the set-top box market to more competition; and specialized business services.""Ultimately, Eisenach will likely aim to craft a telecom strategy that erases much of current Chairman Wheeler's work and focuses on less governmental intervention,"" Horan said.For his part, Pai has been an FCC commissioner since 2012. He's a former FCC deputy general counsel.Shares of AT&T rose 2.2% in the stock market today, with Verizon rising 2.4% and Comcast 1.2%.RELATED:How Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosFCC's Wheeler, At Urging Of Republicans, Pulls Controversial ItemsComcast: Does Trump Win Portend Regulatory Rollback?

126,DISH,"AT&T (T) grabbed the headlines last month with its proposed $85 billion acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), but the future of the telecom industry also is riding on what happens next among Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA), satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) and fast-growing wireless firm T-Mobile US (TMUS).How federal regulators would view proposed mergers among these companies figures heavily into the industry's future, analysts say, and talks figure to heat up early next year with the ending of a government spectrum auction that prohibits strategic talks among any bidders.Among the big questions is whether the status quo will be shaken up — cable TV firms dominate in providing high-speed internet services to homes while phone companies AT&T and Verizon generate the lion's share of wireless industry profits.IBD'S TAKE: AT&T stock has shed 16% since Oct. 1 amid speculation over rising interest rates and reaction to the Time Warner takeover bid. Look for news about other dividend paying stocks at The Income Investor.In one scenario, Verizon could deepen its partnership with Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR) and other cable TV firms. In that case, Verizon and the cable TV firms would update a wireless network access and marketing deal born in 2011, says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.If that happens, Verizon could drop its much touted plans to unleash superfast 5G wireless services vs. cable firms in the residential broadband market. Verizon is testing 5G services and could roll out wireless broadband within two years, and it's considered to be ahead of rivals in 5G.""Verizon's entry into fixed wireless broadband is a clear threat to cable — and cable's entry into wireless is a clear threat to Verizon,"" Moffett told IBD. ""Each has a fair amount of leverage with the other.""If Verizon and the cable industry form an alliance, a Comcast acquisition of T-Mobile or Sprint (S) and a Verizon purchase of Dish Network — deals that have been subject of hot and cold rumors in recent years — would likely be off the table, analysts say.Another wild card in the industry's future is a government auction of radio spectrum owned by TV broadcasters. Begun in March, it's expected to end in early 2017. Companies that filed as bidders will once again be allowed to engage in strategic talks, as anti-collusion rules go away.If Comcast acquires substantial spectrum in the auction, that could be a precursor to buying a wireless firm such as T-Mobile around 2018, one theory goes. On the other hand, Comcast also might gain more spectrum to trade in a network-sharing deal with Verizon, so it wouldn't need T-Mobile.Dish Network has a big stake in the auction's outcome, analysts say. Depending on the results, Verizon could have more reason to acquire Dish Network and its nearly 80 MHz of wireless airwaves, says Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins.""As the 600MHz auction winds down, Dish may be a logical acquisition for Verizon,"" Rollins wrote in a research report. ""Dish helps Verizon close its spectrum gap vs. rivals.""Second, if Verizon deploys nationwide fixed wireless for in-home broadband (vs. cable), it will need a nationwide team of techs and trucks for installs. Dish has this. Third, Dish could help Verizon bundle video/mobile nationally at scale.""AT&T acquired satellite broadcaster DirecTV in 2015 to boost its mobile video strategy, he noted. If Verizon buys Dish Network, it could structure a stock and cash deal to ease concerns over its credit rating and tax worries for Dish founder Charles Ergen, Rollins says.Where do T-Mobile and Sprint fit into merger scenarios? T-Mobile has openly courted cable TV partners on its earnings calls. But amid intensified wireless competition, the most profit-margin-friendly deal remains a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, many analysts say.Such a deal, though, would reduce the number of national wireless firms from four to three. The Obama administration blocked AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying it wanted to retain a four-player national market.It's unlikely a new Democratic administration would be more friendly to a Sprint merger with T-Mobile, analysts say. Both companies are foreign-controlled. Japan's SoftBank owns 83% of Sprint, while Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) owns a two-thirds stake in T-Mobile.T-Mobile and Sprint, however, could have a better argument to present to regulators if their rivals continue to get bigger.AT&T and CenturyLink (CTL) didn't wait to find out how a Clinton-led or Trump-led Department of Justice would view telecom and media mergers.AT&T's agreement to acquire Time Warner, announced Oct. 22, bears similarities to Comcast's 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal from General Electric (GE), analysts say. Conditions that federal regulators set on the Comcast-NBCU deal might serve as a blueprint for the AT&T-Time Warner deal, though the Internet video market has evolved over the past five years, says Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack.Time Warner's assets include HBO and Turner Broadcasting, which has rights to sports telecasts. It also owns Warner Bros. film studio and cable networks TNT, TBS and CNN, as well as a 10% stake in internet video provider Hulu.CenturyLink (CTL), meanwhile, on Oct. 31 announced an agreement to buy Level 3 Communications (LVLT) for about $34 billion cash and stock. The combined company will be a stronger rival to AT&T and Verizon in the market for business services.Broomfield, Colo.-based Level 3 operates one of the world's largest internet backbones. CenturyLink morphed into the nation's No. 3 local phone company, behind Verizon and AT&T, by purchasing Qwest and Embarq. Neither CenturyLink or Level 3 owns a wireless network.AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner plays into its mobile video strategy, says UBS analyst John Hodulik.""It's a watershed event for the communications ecosystem,"" said Hodulik.Regulators are certain to look at whether AT&T aims to provide some of Time Warner's content exclusively to its customers. Netflix (NFLX) has stated it's fine with the deal as long as AT&T provides equally speedy internet access for its streaming video as its does for rival HBO.The AT&T and CenturyLink acquisitions announcements came amid slowing growth for each of them.AT&T's third-quarter revenue missed analysts' expectations, as it posted a net loss of 268,000 postpaid phone accounts amid intensified wireless competition.Buying Time Warner will boost AT&T's free cash flow to support its dividend payments, as did its 2015 purchase of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV Group, says Hodulik. Level 3's cash flow, meanwhile, will support CenturyLink's dividends.The current low interest rates will help both AT&T and CenturyLink finance their acquisitions.""Cheap debt makes the numbers work,"" Hodulik said. ""For CenturyLink, keeping the dividend safe was the main concern along with establishing a path to growth.""RELATED:How Aggressive AT&T Has Out-Maneuvered Verizon, Comcast

129,DISH,"Bulls and bears disagree on Dish Network's (DISH) long-term outlook but one common view is that the satellite broadcaster's third-quarter subscriber losses could increase.MoffettNathanson, which has a sell rating, on Tuesday lowered its price target on Dish Network to 37 from 54. Jefferies on Monday called Dish stock oversold because of its wireless spectrum holdings and stuck with a price target of 80.Both MoffettNathanson and Jefferies analysts, though, say Dish Networks' third-quarter subscriber losses could increase — due to pay-TV competition, internet video offering and recent hurricanes. Dish lost 116,000 subscribers in the September 2016 quarter.Comcast (CMCSA) has warned of higher subscriber losses in its September quarter. MoffettNathanson and Jefferies analysts say more aggressive pay-TV promotions by AT&T (T) could hit both Comcast and Dish in the third quarter.Dish fell 3.4% to close at 52.15 on the stock market today. Dish is down 17% since Aug. 1. One view is that it could be left on the sidelines as the telecom industry consolidates.Dish has cobbled together nearly 95 MHz of radio spectrum but has been unable to forge a deal with a wireless service provider, such as T-Mobile US (TMUS).""A spectrum sale now looks to be all but off the table,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a report.

130,DISH,"Cable TV companies are fighting cord-cutting with price hikes on broadband service, but the big question is whether those increases will come fast enough as premium video subscribers flee.XCable stocks have plunged ahead of third-quarter earnings amid angst that more consumers are turning to internet TV services, like Netflix (NFLX), and canceling subscriptions to premium pay-TV packages.Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) report Q3 results on Oct. 26.In a note to clients Tuesday, Morgan Stanley said that based on its own survey, cable TV companies hiked broadband prices by 12% to $66 monthly from a year earlier for customers that buy only high-speed internet and not a TV package.""As video revenue growth is increasingly pressured, leaning on data pricing is tempting to sustain earnings,"" said Benjamin Swinburne, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report.Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, in a report published last week, said Comcast and other cable TV firms will need to hike broadband-only pricing to $80 or more monthly to offset the loss of video subscribers. He says the average broadband price, including customers that buy a bundle of high-speed internet and TV services, is now about $49 monthly.""Cable companies are likely to raise stand-alone broadband pricing in order to combat the EBITDA declines from downsizing,"" said McCormack in a report. ""This practice is already evident and justified given the lack of a bundling discount. Based on our analysis, we estimate Comcast would need to raise stand-alone pricing to roughly $80 in order to break even from a profitability perspective.""He says that Comcast, in some markets, has brought in stand-alone broadband customers with $40 monthly promotions and has been able to hike prices to $65 monthly.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read  The Big Picture at the day's end (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Comcast shares have dropped 11% since early September when it forecast higher-than-expected subscriber losses in the September quarter, normally seasonally strong for cable TV companies.

131,DISH,"In this city, which is a petri dish of progressivism, a prevailing theory is that when you raise the price of something, people will buy less of it, except when they do not. Another, and related, theory is that constitutional and statutory texts should be construed in the spirit of Friedrich Nietzsche: There are no facts, only interpretations.The city council has voted to impose a tax, effective next year, on sugary soft drinks, raising the price of a 2-liter bottle of soda about $1.18. Presented as a public health measure to combat obesity, the tax is projected to generate about $15 million a year, although the aspiration of sin taxes (e.g., Seattle's taxes on guns and ammunition) should be zero revenues because chastened consumers will mend their benighted ways. Still, proponents of the tax are confident that it will make people behave better by consuming less of the disapproved drinks.Three years ago, the city council, adhering to another current tenet of progressivism, voted — unanimously, of course — to increase the city's minimum wage incrementally from $9.47 to $15 an hour. The council rejected the contention that when the price of entry-level labor increases, employers buy less of it. The city commissioned a study from six University of Washington economists ranging from left to right, presumably expecting their findings to be congruent with other studies purporting to show that the demand for such labor, unlike the demand for sugary sodas, is price-inelastic. (And unlike in Denmark, where the minimum wage increases 40% when a worker turns 18, and the employment of young workers declines one-third.)The University of Washington study, however, published as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, concluded that the costs to low-wage Seattle workers have been three times larger than the benefits. Using a richer trove of data and more sophisticated statistical methods than have been available for other studies of minimum wages, the report concluded that Seattle's still-advancing increase has cost more than 5,000 jobs, and that workers whose wages were increased to comply with the new minimum lost an average of $125 a month as employers reduced their hours. Although total employment in the restaurant industry, which hires a substantial portion of minimum wage workers, did not decline, employers replaced less skilled, low productivity workers with others able to produce higher-value work products. As one of the study's authors said, ""Basically, what we're doing is we're removing the bottom rung of the ladder.""The city responded by seeking alternative facts. Forewarned about the six economists' conclusions, it sought more congenial findings from some economists at the University of California, Berkeley, who are known for research that supports the agenda of the national ""Fight for $15"" movement. The Berkeley economists were so prompt that their findings were publicized before the University of Washington economists' report was released.Seattle's city council is as undeterred by constitutional and statutory language as it is by social science. In July, it enacted — unanimously, of course — a city income tax, setting the tax rate on incomes below $250,000 at 0 and a 2.25% rate on individuals' incomes above $250,000 and on household incomes above $500,000. Washington, which has no state income tax, has a law that says: ""A county, city or city-county shall not levy a tax on net income."" The city council, which overestimates its cleverness, claims it is taxing ""total income"" as defined on IRS 1040 forms. But that is net income, after deductions and exclusions. Furthermore, the state's constitution has this ""uniformity clause"": ""All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of property."" Twice the state Supreme Court has held that a graduated income tax is unconstitutional.A suit challenging the city council's tax notes that cities, as creatures of the state, have only such taxing authority as is expressly granted by the state Legislature. And the tax is explicitly designed to ""test the constitutionality of a progressive income tax,"" on which Washington's Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled. The city council must hope that the state's Supreme Court, which is very liberal, can be persuaded, in a third consideration of unchanging language, to say that constitutional and statutory facts can be made to disappear in a mist of interpretations.In 2010, advocates of a progressive income tax submitted this for a referendum. It lost almost 2-to-1 (64-36). It lost even in King County, home of Seattle and its Nietzschean city council.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.""Under the Trump administration, we have seen a rapid pace of deregulation by the Federal Communications Commission,"" said Feldman. ""While this implies a potentially more favorable regulatory back drop for pursuing M&A, we have not yet seen the FCC or the Department of Justice weigh in on any major mergers under this administration. As such, the major operators lack context for whether regulators take a different view on market structure than we saw under President Obama.""RELATED:Top Questions Apple Will Face At Sept. 12 iPhone EventTelecom Mergers: A 'Game Of Thrones' Without The Dragons

""There may also be a push to roll back some or all of what the FCC just did on privacy.""It's unclear whether Chairman Wheeler will be able to act on the open items related to business data services or set-top box reform before he departs.""IBD'S TAKE: Facebook, Google, Intel and other high-tech companies also have a stake in the Trump administration's trade policies.

137,DISH,"The Federal Communications Commission could get involved in the review of AT&T's (T) proposed acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), joining the Department of Justice, says Oppenheimer, which downgraded the telecom conglomerate's stock.Oppenheimer analyst Time Horan says AT&T stock will likely be range bound during the regulatory review, which he expects to drag on into 2018. MoffettNathanson on Monday also forecast that the AT&T-Time Warner review would continue into early 2018. While the DOJ looks at mergers on antitrust grounds the FCC determines whether deals are in the public's interest. MoffettNathanson, like Oppenheimer, also says there's a good chance the FCC will push its way into the AT&T-Time Warner review.Horan, meanwhile, upgraded CenturyLink (CTL) to outperform. CenturyLink last week agreed to acquire Level 3 Communications (LVLT) in a $34 billion cash and stock merger. CenturyLink's stock sold off more than 20% since the deal was announced.IBD'S TAKE: Some investors like telecom companies because many pay high dividends, but there are other options at IBD's Income Investor. ""We are downgrading AT&T from outperform to perform as we believe CenturyLink's dividend is relatively more attractive,"" said Horan in a research report. ""We also see the Time Warner merger as facing higher regulatory hurtles and taking more like 15 months to complete vs. nine for CenturyLink-Level 3.""AT&T agreed to pay $85.4 billion in cash and stock for Time Warner. Time Warner shareholders will own about 15% of the combined company.If regulators approve the Time Warner acquisition, AT&T will have a national wireless network plus the assets of satellite broadcaster DirecTV, acquired in 2015, and the programming of Time Warner to whisk content to mobile devices.""We see the DOJ suing DTV over the Dodgers as an ominous sign,"" added Horan. ""Also, the FCC may initiate a formal review with an eye toward its zero rating (data billing) policy.""AT&T's stock tends to take a pause when the company is in the process of closing on a major acquisition, and we suspect a similar outcome and see a better opportunity in CenturyLink currently.""AT&T stock rose 0.54% to 37.01 in the stock market today, while CenturyLink stock jumped 3.6% to 24.15.Time Warner's media empire includes HBO and Turner Broadcasting, which has rights to sports telecasts.

145,DISH,"TV broadcasters reduced their asking price for prime wireless airwaves by about 36% to $54.6 billion in the second-stage of bidding in a government auction of radio spectrum, raising expectations that AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) could bite.In the first stage of the auction, TV broadcasters had sought $86 billion for 100 megahertz of usable radio spectrum, an asking price viewed as much too high by telecom industry observers. The Federal Communications Commission lowered the spectrum to be auctioned off to 90 MHz from 100 in the second stage.IBD'S TAKE: A successful auction is important to T-Mobile, which most needs more airwaves and could engage in merger talks after the auction is over, analysts say. T-Mobile stock is up 18% in 2016 but has been in a trading range since early August. Learn more about T-Mobile and Comcast, another possible auction bidder, at IBD Stock Checkup.The bigger-than-expected reduction makes it more likely that AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and other bidders will buy the spectrum, though perhaps at a still lower price, analysts say. The next phase of bidding starts on Oct. 19.""The reduction is larger than we expected, and suggests the auction could end more quickly,"" said UBS analyst John Hodulik in a research report. ""Were the broadcasters to lower their ask in Stage 3 by a similar amount, 80 MHz of spectrum would be priced at around $35 billion, within our expectations for industry demand.""TV broadcasters can walk away at any point if they determine that bids are too low.""To us, the ($54.6 billion) target is still likely to be far off from what carriers might be willing to pay, given our projected spend for top industry players,"" Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack wrote in a research note.The auction's outcome is important to Dish Network (DISH), which has amassed nearly 80 MHz of spectrum but is still looking for a wireless partner. Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) has registered as a bidder and could buy airwaves as it readies a push into wireless services.UBS' Hodulik estimates that AT&T could spend $10 billion in the auction, followed by T-Mobile at $8 billion, Verizon at $6 billion and Comcast at $5 billion to $6 billion.If the auction drags on until the spring of 2017, it'll put a chill on telecom industry mergers and acquisitions.

Hulu is a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), Fox and Comcast (CMCSA).AT&T has stated DirecTV Now will have lower profit margins than its traditional, U-verse pay-TV services.

Time Warner owns a 10% stake in Hulu.AT&T acquired satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV Group in 2015.""We estimate monthly programming costs for DirecTV Now in the low $30 range, similar to the price AT&T will charge, meaning the company will not make much on this service,"" UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a research report. ""However, it will avoid costs for satellites, set-top boxes and installations/trouble-shooting, while also reaching customers who have left the pay TV market or never joined.""Strong growth in this product would support AT&T's vision for the TWX transaction and likely sit well with regulators concerned about the OTT ecosystem.""

149,DISH,"T-Mobile US (TMUS) and cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) will be the top two bidders in the government auction of radio spectrum owned by local TV stations, together amassing what would be a surprising three-fourths of the spectrum sold, predicts UBS.UBS analyst John Hodulik estimates that T-Mobile will end up spending a range of $8 billion to $10 billion for around 30 MHz of spectrum, with Comcast spending $5 billion to $6 billion for 20 MHz of airwaves. Hodulik estimated AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Dish Network (DISH) will acquire 5 MHz of spectrum each in the auction.Hodulik says if T-Mobile was able to buy 30 MHz of spectrum, wireless competition will further intensify.""If T-Mobile secures 30 MHz of low-band spectrum, this will only further close the network (performance) gap with the incumbents and ramp up competition across the country, including rural America, where T-Mobile has been less competitive historically,"" said Hodulik.AT&T and Verizon likely did not bid aggressively in the auction, says UBS. AT&T on Thursday was officially declared the winner of the FirstNet contract for building a national, wireless public safety network.The Federal Communications Commission is expected to announce the auction's results by mid-April. Bids topped $19.6 billion, the FCC said in February.T-Mobile stock was up a fraction to close at 65.13 on the stock market today. Shares in Comcast were up 0.8% to 37.51.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock has gained 12% in 2017 and has neared a buy point of 65.51. T-Mobile has had the highest revenue growth among the top four wireless firms for three years. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.The UBS analyst also speculates that a T-Mobile merger with Dish Network is less likely, while a Sprint deal remains an option.""We believe sizable auction winnings for T-Mobile would help address near-term capacity needs, position the company for long-term growth, and make them less reliant on M&A to build value,"" said Hodulik in the report.Under auction rules, registered bidders have been barred from holding strategic talks until it's over.Comcast has stated it plans to sell wireless services by late 2017 through a network leasing arrangement with Verizon. However, Hodulik doesn't expect Comcast to make a big push in wireless services until competition eases, perhaps through industry consolidation.Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in late 2011 sold spectrum to Verizon for $3.6 billion.

But it's tougher for graying wealth managers to appeal to investors half their age.""It can be hard for older advisors,"" said Joe Pitzl, 36, a certified financial planner in Minneapolis. ""Millennials expect a different approach, so a 50- or 60-year-old advisor has to change"" to curry favor with younger generations.The challenge starts with piercing long-held beliefs that millennials lack sufficient assets to make good clients. They will experience the fastest growth rate of net wealth among any age group, according to the Deloitte Center for Financial Services. As their incomes soar, so will their need for advisors' expertise.Older financial planners may assume that they have little in common with social media-loving millennials who are supposedly quirky, cynical and reluctant to pay experts for advice. It's tempting to give up and remain wedded to aging clients with a more familiar profile.While a small percentage of millennials have amassed vast wealth as visionary entrepreneurs, most do not possess sizable assets. But despite their modest savings, they may still crave investment and retirement-planning guidance.As a result, financial planners of all ages are embracing robo-advisor tools as an extension of their service offerings. Integrating financial technologies may limit the personal service that traditional advisors are accustomed to providing, but it's a cost-effective way to accommodate millennials with relatively simple asset-allocation needs.At some point, however, older advisors will need to connect with younger clients face-to-face. And that can prove vexing, at least at first.""The No. 1 thing I tell older advisors is millennials' learning styles and communication are very different,"" Pitzl said. ""A lot of older advisors think of themselves as the wise old sage who's there to educate clients. But if you think of how millennials have been educated, everything happens in teams. So they want a collaborative partner,"" not a lecturer bequeathing knowledge.When batting around investment ideas with millennials, for example, share your research reports and other raw data. Engage them in the process of analyzing risk and reward so that they fully participate in decision-making.""They want to see and understand the mechanics of what's going on,"" Pitzl added. ""They want a more transparent process as opposed to you making it sound like there's some mystique that they can't possibly understand.""As part of that transparency, millennials expect to be able to track their portfolio online. Advisory firms that seek to attract younger clients need to offer secure cloud-based platforms.""Client portals and aggregation tools are very important,"" Pitzl said. ""Millennials want 24/7 access to their information, whether they use it or not.""In their efforts to win over millennials, graying advisors need to position themselves as nonjudgmental allies who can help young professionals attain the lifestyle they want. This requires careful listening and the shrewd use of open-ended questions.Probe to determine how they define career success and how they would describe their ideal lifestyle. Show interest in their aspirations and values.""Brainstorm with them on how to make their day-to-day life mean more,"" Pitzl said. ""Millennials want a teammate who can get into the nuts and bolts — like wrestling with day-care costs — to help them figure out a plan"" that will make them happy and fulfilled.He cites an example of a young couple, both well-paid retail executives, who came to him in a quandary. One of them wanted to shift from full- to part-time work to escape from an oppressive job.""They're rethinking having to keep grinding it out with high-powered careers, especially as they're thinking of having kids,"" he said. ""But they're also committed to the dream cars and the dream house.""Rather than dish out stale advice (""You need to decide what's most important to you"") or judge them (""You don't even know how good you have it""), Pitzl says he crunched numbers as he guided them through various saving and spending scenarios. They left his office as satisfied clients.""I hear millennials say, 'My (former) advisor wasn't able to meet us where we are,' "" Pitzl said. ""You have to roll up your sleeves, model various decisions and go through what each decision will look like.""RELATED:How Lessons Advisors Learn As Youngsters Shape Their Futures

154,DISH,"T-Mobile US (TMUS)  is in the ""driver's seat"" with a number of merger options, according to brokerage firm UBS, which also hiked its price target on the wireless carrier firm Wednesday and cut first-quarter earnings estimates for rivals AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).UBS analyst John Hodulik raised his price target on T-Mobile to 80 from 63. Merger talks among telecom firms have been on hold pending the end of a government auction of radio spectrum owned by local TV stations. The auction is expected to end in April.""With M&A (mergers) coming into focus as the auction quiet period ends, we believe T-Mobile is in the driver's seat,"" said Hodulik in a report.The UBS analyst shaved his first-quarter earnings for Verizon to 95 cents from 99 cents amid intensified wireless competition. Hodulik reduced AT&T's first-quarter earnings estimate to 73 cents from 78 cents.""After a highly competitive end to 2016, Q1 shows no signs of relief as (promotions) are expected to weigh on service revenue and margin trends for the group,"" said Hodulik.Hodulik says the most likely scenario has T-Mobile merging with Sprint (S), although a Trump Department of Justice could oppose reducing the number of national wireless firms to three from four. Makan Delrahim, a former DOJ lawyer in the Bush administration, is reportedly the front-runner to head the agency's antitrust division.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are hitting 52-week highs? That's easy to find at IBD's New Highs, but that list goes one big step better. That is, it ranks the companies making new highs by Composite Rating. ""We continue to believe a Sprint/T-Mo deal is likely given the benefits of moving from 4 to 3 players and the significant synergies it would create,"" added Hodulik.Verizon last month reintroduced unlimited data plans amid market share gains by T-Mobile and Sprint, which aggressively pushed unlimited promotions in late 2016.One view among analysts is that the proliferation of unlimited-data offers among wireless firms could make it harder for cable TV firms Comcast  (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) to break into the wireless business. The cable TV firms hold rights to lease access to Verizon's network on a wholesale basis, under a so-called mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, deal.Shares in T-Mobile climbed 1.3% to 63.27 at the close on the stock market today.RELATED:Sprint Could Sell To T-Mobile, But Dish Network LoomsVerizon, Comcast Merger Talk A 'Nonstarter,' Says JPMorgan

155,DISH,"Google's pricing and content lineup for YouTube TV — its planned live-TV subscription-streaming service — has Wall Street analysts abuzz over implications for the likes of AT&T, Time Warner, Comcast, and Hulu parents Walt Disney and Fox, as well as second-tier media companies excluded from new online packages.YouTube is already a big moneymaker for Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). One big question is how much Google-owned YouTube's advertising revenue will grow as it adds live TV and original content for paid subscription services.Google on Tuesday took the wraps off YouTube TV, which will be ""available soon in the largest U.S. markets and will quickly expand to cover more cities across the country,"" the company said in a blog.YouTube TV will compete with other internet video services, such as AT&T's (T) DirecTV Now and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling. Hulu — a joint venture of Disney (DIS), Fox parent 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal — is set to launch yet another live TV streaming service in the spring.YouTube TV will offer access to all four major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox), and the cable channel offerings owned by their parent companies, such as sports channel ESPN. Missing from the content lineup, though, are channels from Viacom (VIA), Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting, Discovery (DISCA), AMC Networks (AMCX) and Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI).YouTube TV starts at $35 monthly, similar to AT&T's DirecTV Now service, but it's unclear whether YouTube's will eke out profits even with fewer channels.

AT&T and Dish were both up a fraction and Verizon was up more than 1%. IBD'S TAKE: Weibo and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Sprint has some $33 billion in debt, which could be a hurdle to a deal with T-Mobile or cable TV companies, some analysts say. Dish Network, controlled by founder Charles Ergen, has amassed nearly 80 MHz of spectrum but needs a wireless partner. Verizon has been viewed as a possible buyer of Dish Network.""With the broadcast spectrum auction complete, we expect M&A discussions to heat up in April,"" added Power. ""A T-Mobile merger with Sprint could generate significant synergies, though regulatory approval is not a slam dunk. A merger with Dish could add valuable spectrum, video content and an internet video platform, though it would have fewer (operating) synergies.""T-Mobile said it had 71.5 million subscribers as of Dec. 30, while Sprint had 59.5 million.Federal regulators blocked AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying a market structure with four national players would benefit consumers. Regulators signaled opposition to a Sprint-T-Mobile merger in 2014, leading SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom to shelve talks. At that time, Sprint appeared the likely buyer, with SoftBank's support.Wireless competition has intensified, with all four national carriers now offering unlimited-data plans, including holdouts Verizon and AT&T.RBC Capital, in a Jan. 29 research note, said the Department of Justice would still veto a Sprint-T-Mobile deal.""The rank and file of the DOJ feels vindicated in blocking the AT&T-T-Mobile merger and would want to preserve T-Mobile's status as a 'maverick' in the industry,"" said the RBC Capital report.Speculation that Sprint could be a seller arose after SoftBank's fiscal Q3 earnings call on Feb. 8.RELATED:Verizon, Charter Merger Knocked On 5G SynergiesDish Upgraded, Stock Rises On Verizon Takeout Scenarios

While rivals offer standard-quality video in unlimited data promotions, Verizon's advertising plays up its ability to deliver high-definition quality video.Further, Verizon's retail stores are reporting higher consumer traffic, Moffett says.""Verizon has seemingly found a path forward in what many have concluded is an irreparably commoditized wireless industry,"" Moffett said. ""Verizon is convinced that there is still room for network differentiation, and that offering full HD unlimited video will showcase not network deficiency, but instead will underscore its network advantage.""Moffett has a buy rating on Verizon stock.

159,DISH,"A Republican-led FCC may give AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon Communications (VZ) and other pay TV providers more tools to counter the threat from Google TV, Hulu and other nascent internet video services, says a Cowen & Co. analyst.Ajit Pai, named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by President Trump in January, has signaled that he'll scale back net neutrality rules that bar internet service providers from throttling, blocking or prioritizing web traffic. Under the Obama administration, the FCC sought more authority under utility-type regulations.Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says ""MVPDs"" a regulatory term for pay TV incumbents, could seek interconnection fees from YouTube TV or Hulu. Gallant warned that MVPDs like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon might tap other tools to counter the threat from internet video services, also called over-the-top, or OTT, services. Broadband caps on data usage are another possibility, Gallant says.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) on Tuesday announced YouTube TV, a $35 monthly paid subscription service. YouTube TV will offer access to all four major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox), and the cable channel offerings owned by their parent companies, such as sports channel ESPN.IBD'S TAKE: Quanta Services, Primerica and Nucor are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Google aims to set itself apart with unlimited cloud storage for users to record content.

""Whether they take these steps — and whether it draws influential companies like Google, Facebook (FB), Walt Disney, Fox and others into the net neutrality debate — could be important for the longer-term balance of power within the internet ecosystem.""""We suspect the new FCC will be much more open to ISPs charging interconnection fees to high bandwidth services, mainly video providers,"" Gallant added.He says Google could respond by imposing a ""Cable Company X Tax"" on its subscribers.YouTube TV will compete with other internet video services, such as AT&T's DirecTV Now and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling. YouTube TV does not provide channels from Viacom (VIA), Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting, Discovery (DISCA) , AMC Networks (AMCX) and Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI).Alphabet stock slipped a small fraction in the stock market today to 849.08 and is about flat since the YouTube streaming announcement.RELATED:$35 DirecTV Now Live Streaming Deals Lives On After Promotion EndsAT&T Streaming Foray Hits Snag; Did Apple Avoid Black Eye?Google Advertising Plans Key In YouTube TV Launch Vs.

""We expect T-Mobile and Sprint to continue taking net add share, but the incumbents' unlimited offerings may slow gains.""AT&T stock fell 1.3% to 41.82 in the stock market today.

162,DISH,"An asset swap between Dish Network (DISH) and sister firm EchoStar (SATS), both controlled by Charles Ergen, might be a precursor to a Dish company sale to Verizon Communications (VZ) or T-Mobile US (TMUS), some analysts say.Or maybe not.""We suspect many investors will think this transaction is motivated by Dish and its desire to sell the firm to Verizon or T-Mobile,"" Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet said in a research report. ""While that is certainly possible, we don't think that's the primary motivation. We think this transaction was initiated by EchoStar, not Dish. We suspect the real motivation for this transaction is to help EchoStar pursue M&A.""EchoStar stock soared 8.1% to close at 55.06 on the stock market today, just shy of a record high of 56 touched two years ago.Dish stock was up 3.3% to 61.14 at the close, still in a buy zone from its Dec. 8 breakout at 59.67, moving solidly above its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: NetEase, Stamps.com and GrubHub are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. In a deal announced late Monday, Dish Network will gain full control over the Sling TV-branded Internet video services that competes with AT&T's (T) new DirecTV Now offering. Dish launched Sling TV in 2015. The service has about 900,000 customers, according to analyst estimates.Dish Network also gets 8 megahertz of airwaves in the 28-GHz frequency band in four markets — Kansas City, Phoenix, San Diego and Cheyenne, Wyo.In 2014, the Ergen-controlled companies announced a complex deal in which Dish transferred five satellites to EchoStar and Dish received 80% of the former Hughes' retail satellite broadband business.At Macquarie Securities, analyst Amy Yong said in a report that Monday's ""move simplifies the corporate structure and, more importantly, facilitates M&A."" She added, ""We see Dish as one of many M&A options for Verizon. Sling TV could be Verizon's DirecTV Now.""Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, met with Verizon management recently, and he says a big deal might not be on Verizon's immediate horizon.""There is an increasingly consensus view that Verizon needs to do a deal, and the sooner the better,"" said Moffett in a research report. ""Verizon CFO Matt Ellis doesn't share that view.

163,DISH,"T-Mobile US (TMUS) early Tuesday reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue that topped expectations, but its 2017 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) guidance was light amid fierce price competition in wireless services. It also guided to fewer subscriber gains this year than analysts were expecting.T-Mobile said Q4 EPS jumped 32% from the year-earlier period to 45 cents, with revenue rising 23% to $10.2 billion. Analysts had projected EPS of 29 cents and $9.84 billion in revenue.For 2017, T-Mobile forecasts adjusted EBITDA of $10.6 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, excluding spectrum gains, vs. consensus estimates of $10.9 billion.T-Mobile said it expects 2017 postpaid subscriber additions of 2.4 million to 3.4 million, which again likely would lead the industry but which at the midpoint lags Wall Street expectations of 3.33 million adds.T-Mobile stock rose 1.2% to 61.60 in the stock market today, after falling in the premarket to near 60. Shares fell 2.4% on Monday on worries wireless competition has again intensified, after Verizon on Sunday announced its first unlimited data plan in more than five years. But T-Mobile continues to lead in subscriber gains with its ""Uncarrier"" deals, and its stock touched an all-time high of 63.68 on Jan. 27.""Not only are customers flocking to T-Mobile, but we're also producing rock-solid financial results including 11% growth in service revenues, 23% in total revenues, 31% in net income and 12% in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year in Q4,"" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in the company's earnings release.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile's 2016 revenue jumped 16%  to $37.2 billion. Look for more fast-growing companies at the IBD 50, which includes Nvidia, Momo, Broadcom and Facebook.T-Mobile in early January preannounced that it added 1.2 million postpaid subscribers in Q4, including 933,000 phone subscribers, topping Wall Street estimates.

In addition, market overlap in key markets, including the New York City area, would also need to be considered.""Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, doubts Verizon could afford Charter. Media baron John Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) is the biggest shareholder in Charter, which acquired Time Warner Cable in 2015, emerging as the No. 2 cable TV firm.Comcast on Thursday reported Q4 earnings that topped views.""The clearest take-away from this week's earnings reports is this: Cable is a much better business than wireless,"" Moffett wrote. ""Comcast's cable business is growing at 8% per year, while Verizon's and AT&T's wireless businesses are both shrinking. We would be hard pressed to imagine that John Malone would be willing to trade Charter for Verizon without a very large premium indeed.""Verizon bought out Vodafone Group's (VOD) 45% interest in their wireless joint venture, Verizon Wireless, for $130 billion in 2014.At Jefferies, analyst Mike McCormack says a Verizon-Charter deal lacks near-term synergies.""Reports of a Verizon-Charter deal are counter to Verizon's mobile first strategy,"" said McCormack. ""Most point to 5G (wireless) as the rationale, though we don't see Charter as providing the ideal geographies or technology platform for such a deployment.""Simon Flannery, analyst at Morgan Stanley, is in the same camp.""The benefit of a potential Charter acquisition to Verizon's 5G plans as it relates to fixed wireless is unclear,"" said Flannery. ""While bringing Charter's fiber network in-house adds to Verizon's backhaul capacity, 5G fixed wireless is intended to be a competitor to cable broadband, the primary earnings driver for Charter. Acquiring Charter and then deploying a fixed wireless competitor to Charter's broadband service would be counterintuitive.""At Deutsche Bank, analyst Bryan Kraft says some investors are wondering whether media leaks over a Verizon-Charter deal are aimed at bringing Dish to the bargaining table. Dish owns 78 MHz of mid-band radio spectrum but needs a partner to make use of that spectrum.Verizon may be trying to ""flush out another potential target,"" speculated Kraft.RELATED:Disney A Cure For Verizon Woes?

166,DISH,"Verizon Communications (VZ) could offer $85 per share for Dish Network (DISH) and its wireless spectrum, says Morgan Stanley, which on Monday upgraded the satellite TV broadcaster to overweight.Dish Network stock closed up 2.2% at 61.46 in the stock market today, still in a buy zone from a Dec. 8 breakout at a 59.67 buy point.Also Monday, JPMorgan on Monday issued a research report on the outlook for telecom industry mergers that speculated on Dish takeover scenarios involving Verizon, T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S).Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne upgraded Dish Network stock to overweight and raised his price target to 75. But he said one hurdle to a Verizon acquisition of Dish Network would be co-founder Charles Ergen's ""super voting shares"" in the satellite TV broadcaster.Swinburne posited two Verizon acquisition scenarios for Dish at $85 per share, one all stock and one with a mix of stock and cash.""We note that in either scenario, Dish Chairman Charles Ergen would be an about 6% to 8% owner of the combined entity, and Verizon would have to negotiate how to deal with his super voting B shares (which give him 80% voting control of Dish today),"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Dish stock has moved above a 59.67 buy point coming out of a flat base and is trading above its 50-day moving average. Learn more about Dish and Verizon at IBD Stock Checkup.He says Verizon would prefer a stock deal because it added a lot of debt with its $130 billion buyout of Vodafone Group's (VOD) 45% stake in Verizon Wireless in 2014.Verizon reports Q4 earnings before the open Tuesday and will likely be asked again about Dish, as well as potential deals with cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR).Dish Network owns more than 75 megahertz of mostly mid-band radio spectrum. ""Mid-band spectrum like DISH's offers greater data capacity than low-band, particularly in urban and suburban markets where network demands are highest,"" Swinburne said.Analysts expect telecom industry merger talks to pick up after a government auction of airwaves controlled by local TV broadcasters concludes, perhaps in mid-March. Bidders were barred from taking part in strategic talks since the start of the auction last March.JPMorgan, in its report, also spoke of the end of the auction as a catalyst.""While we expect strategic conversations to at least ramp up once the Incentive Auction is over, we don't see a Dish deal as anyone's first choice,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote. ""We see T-Mobile and Verizon as Dish's most likely partners, and if T-Mobile merges with Sprint, a Verizon-plus-Dish deal could become more interesting for both parties, though possibly at a lower price.""Sprint stock climbed 2.8% Monday, T-Mobile added 1%, while Verizon dipped 0.6%.RELATED:T-Mobile Hits All-Time High; Comcast, Verizon UpgradedCash Key In SoftBank-Sprint 'Knockout' Offer For T-Mobile?Would T-Mobile Spurn Debt-Laden Sprint For Comcast Offer?Verizon M&A Talk Swirls; Charter Stock Up, Yahoo Down

167,DISH,"Verizon Communications (VZ) and media baron John Malone's Charter Communications (CHTR) are exploring a merger, according to multiple reports Thursday.Media baron Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) is the biggest shareholder in Charter, which acquired Time Warner Cable in 2015, emerging as the No. 2 cable TV firm behind Comcast (CMCSA). Malone and Liberty Media's assets include stakes in Discovery (DISCA), Starz, QVC Group and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF). Malone is chairman of Liberty Media.In Europe, Malone-controlled cable TV firm Liberty Global (LBTYA) has forged partnerships with wireless firms such as Vodafone Group (VOD). Liberty Global and Vodafone backed away from merger talks in 2015, however. Malone, a cable TV industry pioneer, led Tele-Communications Inc. in the 1980s and 90s. The old AT&T acquired TCI in 1999, and most of its assets eventually were sold off to cable firms.Charter stock shot up 7.4% to close at 333.15 in the stock market today, at a record high for the fifth straight trading day as M&A rumors have swirled in the communications services field. Verizon shares ended 1.3% lower Thursday. Verizon stock slumped 4.4% Tuesday on disappointing 2017 guidance and is trading at two-month lows.The Wall Street Journal initially reported that Verizon had approached Charter, with the Financial Times following up by saying the companies have hired advisors for merger talks.IBD'S TAKE: Seacoast Banking, Inphi, GrubHub and NetEase are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters.Speculation over Verizon-Charter negotiations first surfaced in mid-December. Verizon's CEO Lowell McAdam told sell-side analysts in a meeting that a merger would make ""industrial sense.""Verizon also has been linked to Dish Network (DISH), which had wireless assets but needs a partner. Dish stock lost 6.8% Thursday on the Charter report.Charter and Comcast have an agreement to lease access to Verizon's wireless network on a wholesale basis. Comcast plans to launch wireless services in mid-2017.Merging with a cable TV firm would dovetail with Verizon's strategy to launch 5G wireless services. 5G services require connections to fiber-optic networks in dense urban areas.""We believe a combination of Verizon and Charter is feasible but difficult on the financials, but Comcast's overall size and NBC ownership make a deal with Verizon a nonstarter as the regulatory review process would likely be quite difficult,"" JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick wrote Monday in a broad research report on telecom industry M&A scenarios.Speaking at a Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. investor event in early January, Malone speculated that cable firms could buy T-Mobile US (TMUS). He also suggested that in a Trump administration maybe even Charter and Comcast could merge.

168,DISH,"Add Walt Disney (DIS) to the fast-growing list of M&A possibilities for Verizon Communications (VZ), whose shares took a hit Tuesday after the company gave disappointing 2017 guidance early in the day.""Should Verizon try to buy or merge with Disney to vertically integrate like AT&T (T),"" asked Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a research note. ""Will (Verizon) need a content company to stand toe-to-toe with AT&T?""AT&T is seeking Trump administration approval to acquire media giant Time Warner (TWX) for $85 billion. While Disney is often speculated about in M&A talk — whether it's as a seller to Apple (AAPL) or a buyer of Netflix (NFLX) — a merger with Verizon would give the Mouse access to top-notch wireless and wireline broadband networks to whisk content directly to consumers, Moffett points out.""In a postelection world where strategy has seemingly become synonymous with deal making, many might argue that the answer for fixing Verizon can only be M&A,"" Moffett wrote.

After falling 4.3% on Tuesday, Verizon stock dropped another 0.7% to end Wednesday trading at 49.77 on the stock market today.Verizon bought out Vodafone Group's (VOD) 45% stake in their wireless joint venture for $130 billion in 2014.Moffett noted that while AT&T has diversified away from wireless services with the 2015 acquisition of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV and the proposed Time Warner deal, Verizon has been adding assets to leverage its wireless network and move into digital media and advertising.Verizon bought AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015. In July, Verizon announced its agreement to buy the Yahoo (YHOO) internet business for $4.8 billion, though reportedly they are talking about lowering the price after news surfaced of wide-scale date breaches at Yahoo.Moffett says aside from a big media deal like Disney, Verizon's other options include acquiring satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) or a cable TV firm. JPMorgan on Monday, in a research report, said a Verizon merger with Comcast (CMCSA) is far-fetched and a Charter Communications (CHTR) deal would be very difficult to pull off.Citigroup on Wednesday removed Dish Network from its ""focus list,"" but it maintained a buy rating and price target of 94. Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins says Verizon is less likely to buy Dish Network if Sprint and T-Mobile US propose a merger.Rollins says a combined Sprint-T-Mobile would likely divest radio spectrum to gain regulatory approval.

Analysts estimate revenue will rise 4% to $18.64 billion, its smallest percentage rise in four quarters.Comcast stock was down a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 60.50.On Comcast’s earnings call, executives might discuss NBCU’s upcoming contract renewals with Dish Network (DISH) and Verizon Communications (VZ), and a programming dispute with 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA) (IBD) YES sports network.Charter Communications (CHTR)  will be the No. 2 cable TV firm if federal regulators approve its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House Networks.

170,DISH,"The S&P 500 index outperformed dividend stock mutual funds on average over the past 10 years, but the index and the dividend group were actually neck-and-neck for much of the decade.It wasn't until the second quarter of 2013 that the S&P 500 charged into the lead decisively. Earlier, dividend funds had outperformed in 2008 and then for much of 2010 through Q1 2013.That included the financial-crisis fueled market meltdown period, when investors sought the relative safe haven of funds holding stocks that paid dividends.Overall, over the past 10 years the S&P 500 averaged an 11.39% yearly gain. Dividend funds averaged 8.37% annually.That difference adds up. If you had invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 on March 31, 2006, by a decade later your money would have grown into $19,719.If you had invested the same amount in a cross section of dividend funds, it would have grown to $18,632.In that decade, the now $11.3 billion JPMorgan Equity Income Fund (HLIEX) was among the best performing U.S. dividend stock mutual funds. It posted a 7.96% average annual gain.Managed by Clare Hart and Jonathan Simon, the fund had 95% of its shareholders' money in U.S. stocks as of Dec. 31. The bulk of the balance was in cash.Financial services was the fund's biggest sector, with a 25% weighting. Health care was next with a 12% weighting. Industrials was the third biggest sector, at 11%.Share-price gains by medical supplies company Becton Dickinson (BDX) have helped make Equity Income the top performing dividend fund in the past decade.Shares are up 2% so far this year.Earnings per share grew 1%, 17%, 9600% and 28% the past four quarters.A little more than a year ago, the company acquired CareFusion through debt financing. The company has paid down a $1 billion term loan for the takeover. The firm continues to dish out dividends, but it has suspended share repurchases until it meets its debt reduction goals. Its dividend yield is 1.7%.The company has a 96 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings.Verizon Communications (VZ) is another recent contributor to the fund. Shares are up 12% so far this year.The telecom carrier's earnings per share grew 14%, 17% and 25% the past three quarters.The stock has a very strong 94 Comp Rating, and its dividend yield is 4.4%.Altria Group (MO) has been a third contributor. Shares are up 10% this year.The tobacco firm has an 81 Comp Rating. Its dividend yield is 3.6%.But EPS growth is slowing. It was 14%, 9% and 2% the past three quarters.

171,DISH,"Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBCUniversal is turning up the heat on satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) amid contract renewal talks for programming.Dish Network already is facing tough negotiations with Viacom (VIA). Comcast, on the other side as a pay-TV provider, has been in a dispute with sports channel YES Network over programming fees.NBCU has launched a marketing campaign warning viewers they could be blacked out on Dish Network by March 20, says Broadcasting & Cable. NBCU owns cable channels USA Network, Syfy, Bravo, CNBC and  MSNBC.Dish on Tuesday afternoon said it expects to file for arbitration in the dispute with NBCU.“Under the conditions imposed by the FCC and Department of Justice in approving the Comcast-NBCUniversal merger, NBC is forbidden from blacking out its networks if a pay-TV provider chooses, in its sole discretion, to exercise its right for binding arbitration,” Dish said in a statement.Viacom’s 24 cable networks, meanwhile, include MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Dish Network has had disputes with CBS (CBS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting unit.Comcast is at an impasse with YES Network. Fox took majority control of the YES Network in 2014 from the New York Yankees’ parent company. The Comcast-YES Network dispute affects about 900,000 Comcast customers in New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.According to an Oppenheimer research report, Fox Networks sought a 33% fee increase for YES programming. Walt Disney’s (DIS) ESPN garners the highest content fees.“We believe programming costs will rise sharply in the near term  but will moderate in the longer term as lower advertising revenues and cord cutting weaken the bargaining power of the content providers and ultimately break the paid-TV model,” wrote Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan. “Programming costs have risen at three times the growth rate of (cable company) revenues during the last five years.”

174,DISH,"The Verizon Communications (VZ) Go90 mobile video service is off to a slow start, says a UBS report, based on a study of app downloads at the Apple (AAPL) iOS store.The Go90 mobile video service -- ad-supported and free to users -- launched in late September, targeting millennials (adults ages 18 to 34) and gen Zers (teens).""Go90 appears to be off to a slow start, with its best showing around No. 300 when ranked against all apps in the iTunes store and No. 20 when ranked against other entertainment apps,"" said the UBS report.Verizon’s Go90 is usually lumped with emerging over-the-top (OTT) video services, such as Dish Networks’ (DISH) Sling, but the mobile app also competes for millennial attention with the likes of YouTube, Facebook (FB), Instagram and Snapchat, says UBS.“We believe Go90 will be hard-pressed to mount a meaningful challenge to mobile video and social networking leaders YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu,” wrote UBS analyst John Hodulik in the report. “That said, Verizon is pulling various levers to ramp up interest in and usage of Go90, including more live and exclusive content and free data for Verizon Wireless customers.”One Verizon challenge is that Facebook and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) YouTube garner the most mobile ad revenue.UBS studied downloads at Apple’s iOS store. “While downloads do not reflect app usage and engagement, we believe the two metrics are highly correlated in the medium to long term,” said the report.Verizon has not disclosed Go90 subscriber data. The service is not expected to be profitable for a few years. Go90 offers a mix of original Web TV series, live sports, concert streaming, prime-time TV and other short-form content.“Initial download trends suggest Go90 is doing better within the iPhone base relative to other entertainment applications, but appears to be lagging in the iPad market. This supports our view that the product is seen as a truly mobile service more geared to short-form content,” wrote Hodulik.Verizon stock was down a fraction in morning trading in the stock market today, above 52 and within range of a 51.30 buy point first touched Feb. 25.

175,DISH,"TiVo (TIVO) stock surged on reports the DVR pioneer is in talks to be acquired by Rovi (ROVI), a provider of interactive programming guides to pay-TV companies and smart-TV manufacturers.Shares in TiVo surged 21% in the stock market today by midafternoon. Rovi stock fell 4%.Both TiVo and Rovi hold intellectual property for features built into pay-TV set-top boxes and garner licensing revenue.Rovi and TiVo face big changes among their customers as the pay-TV industry faces growing competition from Internet video providers, such as Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet-Google’s (GOOGL) YouTube as well as new TV hardware from Apple (AAPL) and Roku. Federal regulators aim to open up the set-top box TV market.TiVo shareholders would reportedly get cash and stock in the deal and own about 30% of the newly formed company.TiVo has expanded beyond hardware sales and patent licensing to online subscription services. TiVo’s customers include small and midsize pay-TV companies. Analysts have said TiVo aims to provide more cable firms with next-generation features, including its cloud platform and mobile apps, analysts say.Apple and Google have been among companies rumored to be interested in acquiring TiVo in the past.Rovi gets an IBD Composite Rating of 86 out of a possible 99, though today's drop puts it below its key 50-day moving average. TiVo holds just a 26 Composite Rating.“Together, the combined TiVo and  Rovi entity would have more than 6,000 issued or pending patents,” said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, in a research report. “TiVo alone has generated around $1.6 billion of settlements to date from patent enforcement lawsuits vs. Dish Network (DISH), AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), and Cisco-Motorola-Time Warner. There are 380 issued patents in TiVo's portfolio, plus 340 pending patents, many of which expire beyond 2018.”

176,DISH,"Federal regulators appear set to go forward this spring with the auction of airwaves now owned by local TV broadcasters, but other spectrum-related developments loom as wild cards that could increase supply, thereby impacting wireless industry competition and M&As.Those other developments include the contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety; the re-emergence of LightSquared, renamed Ligado Networks, from Chapter 11; and whether wireless firms succeed in lobbying to use commercial LTE technology in unlicensed spectrum now allocated to Wi-Fi.The Federal Communications Commission still plans to begin the “Broadcast Incentive Auction” on March 29. The auction, which could last five to six months, will free up an estimated 60 megahertz to 80 MHz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum for wireless services.Results of the spectrum auction could affect the competitive future of IBD Leaderboard company AT&T (T), which has seen accelerating growth in recent quarters, and rival Verizon Communications (VZ) -- a member of IBD’s Big Cap 20 -- as well as highly rated Comcast (CMCSA). AT&T and Verizon are expected to buy TV airwaves in the auction, and cable leader Comcast also will likely bid, say analysts. Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has ruled itself out.AT&T and Verizon own more than 70% of low-frequency airwaves in the top 100 U.S. markets. Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and can pass through walls, improving in-building services.The FCC will impose a ""quiet period"" that bans negotiation over spectrum until the auction is over. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) has acquired some 75 MHz of midband spectrum -- which covers a little less territory than low-frequency spectrum -- but it lacks a wireless network partner and is in limbo until the auction ends, analysts say. Dish has filed to bid in the auction, but observers are uncertain that it will.The auction's outcome could well raise or lower the odds of some major deals, long rumored in the industry:-- that Comcast will acquire a wireless services provider;-- that a cable TV leader will strike an alliance with Verizon;-- that Verizon will enter into a spectrum-leasing deal with Dish;-- that Dish and T-Mobile will merge.But even beyond the auction, by early 2017, further developments involving the FirstNet contract, Ligado, unlicensed-LTE and satellite wireless firm Globalstar (GSAT) could impact Dish’s plans, as well as the spectrum strategies of AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. That’s because all these elements provide alternatives for network capacity, aside from the auction.Here’s a run-down of several scenarios:-- FirstNet. Whoever wins this first-responder contract would need to invest in network infrastructure. Congress has set aside 20 MHz of spectrum -- a wide swath of the airwaves -- in the ""D block"" of the 700 MHz frequency band for the public safety network.The winning bidder is expected to enter into a lease agreement with the FirstNet authority for access to the 20 MHz of prime airwaves. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services.The government will award the FirstNet contract after the TV airwave auction ends, if the government's timetable proceeds as planned. Verizon has been viewed as the front-runner, but AT&T has made clear that it’s interested. T-Mobile (TMUS) could bid but faces long odds vs. AT&T and Verizon, analysts say.-- LTE-U. Verizon and T-Mobile have been biggest proponents of developing a technical standard that would allow 4G LTE commercial technology to use unlicensed spectrum. Google, Microsoft (MSFT) and the Wi-Fi Alliance, which certifies Wi-Fi network gear, have lobbied the FCC to protect unlicensed airwaves, saying that interference could impair Wi-Fi services. Apple (AAPL), a Wi-Fi Alliance member, has not said anything publicly.Verizon and AT&T claim that no special LTE-U equipment certification is needed as long as devices meet certain basic FCC rules for unlicensed spectrum. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has been backing LTE-U deployment. The FCC in February allowed Qualcomm to move ahead with LTE-U testing at two Verizon facilities to demonstrate that the technology would not interfere with Wi-Fi. Qualcomm and the Wi-Fi Alliance have been working on “coexistence” plans.The cable TV industry has a big stake in the outcome, analysts say, because Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR) and others have been expanding public Wi-Fi networks. While Verizon has targeted 3.5 GHz spectrum in the near term, it could try to carry out LTE-U in higher 5 GHz airwaves that cable TV firms covet.If LTE-U gets a green light, the Apple iPhone and other devices could support the technology by 2018.-- LightSquared, now Ligado. Former Verizon Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg is chairman of Ligado, while former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt is a board member.Ligado, controlled by private equity firms, has a sizable 35 MHz of midband spectrum. After emerging from bankruptcy, Ligado reached agreements with tractor maker Deere (DE) and GPS device maker Garmin (GRMN), resolving issues over potential global positioning system interference. While Ligado might provide services to industries such as energy or transport, or pursue next-generation 5G services, it could sell the airwaves as well.The company hasn’t spelled out its new business model, analysts say, and it’s still awaiting some FCC approvals to use the spectrum for commercial purposes.-- Globalstar.  The FCC has been studying Globalstar’s petition to use airwaves in the midfrequency 2.4 GHz block for wireless services. The Wi-Fi Alliance and other groups have opposed Globalstar’s plans, citing possible interference issues. Globalstar could lease capacity to a wireless firm or an Internet company if it wins at the FCC. Globalstar’s stock, though, has plunged about 50% in the past year to near 1.40 while its FCC approval has languished.Image provided by Shutterstock.

177,DISH,"According to Forrester Research (FORR), 80% of companies say that they deliver exceptional customer service. The problem is, only a scant 8% of their customers agree.Those stats come from Jay Baer, author of “Hug Your Haters: How to Embrace Complaints and Keep Your Customers.”As Strother Martin’s character famously said in the movie “Cool Hand Luke,” “What we have here is failure to communicate.”Baer, who is president of Convince & Convert, an online customer service and digital marketing consultancy/media company, goes on to say that organizations ignore one-third of customer complaints, most of them in online, public venues. That's a mistake, he said: “Haters are the most important customers, but they are treated as the least important. Haters aren’t your problem; ignoring them is.”Tips on turning complaints into satisfied and loyal patrons:Engage banter. Baer doesn’t mince words: “Answer every customer complaint, in every channel, every time.”He notes that each time you do, customer advocacy increases up to 25%, according to the research conducted for his book. Also, interact with customers in the venues they prefer, not the ones the business finds convenient.Baer says that only 5% of unhappy customers ever complain, and they “are vital because they go out of their way to tell the company what it needs to do better. Complaints are the petri dish of improvement.”They also might be the tips of a larger iceberg. Those who don’t complain may just stop buying from your company.You reply only twice. The most important lesson for handling online complaints, Baer states, is “you never, ever, ever respond more than two times to any customer in a public, online venue.”His reasoning: If a customer has a positive comment, two replies is more than sufficient. “In the more likely scenario of negative feedback, when you encounter a ranting and raving customer, reply twice with an apology and a remediation option. Then just walk away.”Recognize patron feelings. Liz H. Kelly, a marketing consultant who was a vice president of training and quality for T. Rowe Price (TROW), says that it’s imperative that customer service reps “acknowledge when someone is upset.” Instead of being defensive with an angry customer, “the most important thing to do is acknowledge their emotion first. You can usually diffuse someone’s anger by simply saying, 'I understand your frustration’ or 'We are sorry you had a bad experience and want to get your issue resolved right away.’ You don’t have to agree with them, but you do have to acknowledge their frustration.”Right from the get-go, make sure that an angry customer believes you are on his team. By doing so, she said, “you will significantly increase your chances of not only keeping the customer but turning them into a loyal supporter.”Accelerate response times. Forty percent of customers who complain in social media expect a reply within one hour, Baer relays.A firm that replies that fast, Kelly said, “rebuilds trust and minimizes damage to their reputation. AT&T (T) and DirecTV are among many brands who now have dedicated customer service teams who deal with complaints on social media.”Consider that the average time it takes a company to reply to an email is 44 hours. “This is too slow, and in many cases a sluggish email response causes customers to assume they will not hear back at all, so they then complain online, in public,” Baer said.As for the telephone, consumers say that response time is the most important factor in their satisfaction with customer service.See the big picture. Customer service is becoming a spectator sport, Baer points out, because “every time you interact with a customer in an online, public venue like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR), review sites or forums, you are displaying for hundreds or thousands of onlookers the values of your business.”Kelly adds that because customers look online first before making a purchase, brands must learn to hug their haters on social media.Baer cautions that’s why it’s so dangerous to ignore online complaints: “After all, no reply IS a reply that says, 'We don’t care about our customers.’ ”Image provided by Shutterstock.

178,DISH,"Federal regulators say 104 companies -- including, as expected, AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) -- have applied to bid on airwaves owned by TV broadcasters, but analysts are still tempering expectations for the auction.While the Federal Communications Commission late Friday released the list of applicants, it was still unclear just which telecom companies are tied to some of the 104 bidding entities. The FCC is expected to release a more detailed list soon.“The more interesting takeaways will evolve as we learn more about the underlying ownership of the bidding entities,” said Michael Rollins, a Citigroup analyst, in a research report.“Initial applicant lists for FCC auctions can be a bit difficult to decipher since many bidders will submit applications through subsidiaries with different names,” Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman wrote in a report.The FCC plans to begin the ""Broadcast Incentive Auction"" on March 29. The auction, which could last five to six months, will free up an estimated 60 to 80 megahertz of prime, low-frequency spectrum for wireless services.Based on public statements, analysts expect Comcast (CMCSA) and Dish Network (DISH) to be among the bidders. Cable firm Charter Communications (CHTR) is not among the 104 listed companies, but John Malone-controlled Liberty Global (LBTYA) is included.Despite speculation that Sprint (S)-owner SoftBank (SFBTY) could take part in the auction, there’s no sign of the Japanese telecom in initial filings.In a report published on Monday, Goldman Sachs estimated phone and cable TV companies may spend only $21 billion in the auction, though other bidders could raise auction proceeds as high as $30 billion.Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has ruled itself out, and no Internet companies are in the 104 public applicants, though ties to some bidding entities might exist.A Bloomberg survey has estimated the auction will raise only $33 billion, much less than the $60 billion figure floated by some observers in mid-2015.Citigroup estimates bids could reach $43 billion, however, in the neighborhood of 2015’s “AWS-3” auction, which had 80 listed eligible bidders.

179,DISH,"Leveraging its acquisition of DirecTV, AT&T (T) announced today that it will roll out a national Internet-video service by year-end, a national video-streaming service tailored for mobile phone users, and a Web offering targeting millennials.AT&T says the ""DirecTV Now,"" ""DirecTV Mobile"" and ""DirecTV Preview"" products will be available in the fourth quarter.While Verizon Communications (VZ) has launched an ad-supported mobile video service, Go90, and Dish Networks’ (DISH) “Sling” streaming service has some 500,000 subscribers, AT&T aims to set itself apart from rivals with a broad range of video offerings.AT&T surpassed Comcast (CMCSA) as the biggest pay-TV provider with the DirecTV purchase, which closed in July. AT&T had 25.4 million U.S. video subscribers as of Dec. 31 -- 5.6 million fixed-line U-verse customers and 19.8 million satellite TV subscribers.AT&T has negotiated with content companies for digital streaming rights. AT&T says there will be limits on how many people can log onto the services via smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, PCs or other devices. It says consumers will have options to buy premium content for its online, or over-the-top, video services.“Having the largest number of pay-TV subs in the U.S. gives AT&T the scale it needs to compete in the OTT market, enabling it to acquire mobile and out-of-home rights,” said UBS analyst John Hodulik in a research report. “The ability to sell pay-TV subscriptions nationally is one of the keys to AT&T's segmented mobile-video strategy.”AT&T in January announced a wireless product with unlimited data, but only for new or existing subscribers at DirecTV or its U-verse landline business in 22 states. AT&T did not say in its announcement today how many channels would be included in the new video-streaming products.“These new video subscription models reflect the flexible content choices, viewing options and simple, transparent pricing that consumers want,” John Stankey, CEO of AT&T Entertainment Group, said in the company's news release.AT&T says its “DirecTV Now” product will be available via fixed-line broadband from any Internet service provider or AT&T’s wireless network, when bundled with a wireless plan. ""Bundling OTT video with wireless should provide the stickiness that is missing from stand-alone OTT services,"" said Hodulik. DirecTV Now will include on-demand and live programming as well as premium add-on options.The less expensive “DirecTV Mobile” package will be accessible from any wireless service provider. Some short-form content will be tailored for mobile devices.The ad-supported “DirecTV Preview” service will feature content for millennials, including video from Otter Media, a joint venture of AT&T and the Chernin Group.Verizon’s Go90 mobile video service is available as an app for any wireless network. Dish Network’s Sling is included in T-Mobile US’ (TMUS) “Binge On” service, in which video does not count toward monthly data caps.Image provided by Shutterstock.

180,DISH,"Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) has shelved plans to put T-Mobile US (TMUS) up for sale, pending the outcome of a wireless spectrum auction and the U.S. presidential election, a Reuters report said Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.Deutsche Telekom, which owns two-thirds of T-Mobile, is also in no rush to seek a merger because T-Mobile has been gaining market share vs. AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and struggling Sprint (S).The Obama administration’s Department of Justice signaled its opposition to a T-Mobile-Sprint merger in 2014, fearing less competition in the wireless services sector.Some observers speculate cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) could acquire T-Mobile. And satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) has also been looking for a wireless network partner.Federal regulators appear set to go forward this spring with the much-anticipated auction of airwaves now owned by local TV broadcasters. The Federal Communications Commission plans to begin the “Broadcast Incentive Auction” on March 29.The auction, which could last five to six months, will free up an estimated 60 to 80 megahertz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum for wireless services.In connection with the auction, the FCC will impose a quiet period that bans negotiations over spectrum and other matters. ""During that period, there will be no M&A activity in the U.S. telecoms sector,"" a source close to Deutsche Telekom told Reuters.T-Mobile has said it could spend up to $10 billion in the auction, with Verizon and AT&T among the other expected bidders. Comcast, too, is seen as likely to bid.If Comcast buys a large amount of spectrum in the auction and thus becomes another major provider of wireless services, that could be a precursor to a wireless acquisition that regulators would likely view favorably, analysts say.
"
181,DISH,"Amazon.com (AMZN) is moving closer to launching a live TV streaming service to complement its Prime video service, which offers movies and on-demand content, analysts speculate in the wake of media companies' earnings calls.In the pay-TV industry, ""virtual MVPD"" (multi-channel video programming distributor) is a term for a cable-TV-like service delivered via the Internet.“Amazon appears most likely to launch a virtual MVPD in 2016,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a research report. “Amazon was hinted at multiple times throughout the quarter as being in negotiations with content providers in the hopes of launching a video product in the future.”AMC Networks (AMCX) referred to ongoing “experimentation” at Amazon on its Q4 earnings call on Feb. 25. Walt Disney (DIS), meanwhile, mentioned Amazon while discussing ESPN’s streaming strategy on Feb. 17.Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) has more than 500,000 subscribers to its “Sling” Web TV service, launched in early 2015, analysts estimate. However, Sling does not offer live content from the four major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC).Bloomberg reported in October that Amazon was in talks with Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal, CBS (CBS) and others.Amazon’s challenge would be aggregating content licensed from major programming networks. Apple (AAPL) reportedly has, for now, broken off talks with the broadcast networks for a Web TV service.If Amazon’s offers live content, it would set itself apart from Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu, both of which do not. Amazon, like Netflix, has already moved into producing original content.One Amazon strategy could be licensing content for current seasons of popular programming now available mainly from pay-TV companies. Federal regulators are probing the influence of cable TV companies over content deals, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.In a report in mid-February, Jefferies noted that Amazon’s Prime video service offers the most content from CBS, including “Vegas.” Its on-demand shows, though, are from prior broadcast seasons.“Relative to Netflix and Hulu, Amazon Prime carries significantly less network programming,” said the Jefferies report. “Overall, the platform only carries nine fall shows aired between 2012 and 2015, six of which aired on CBS.”Amazon in 2015  licensed season-one episodes from NBCUniversal’s hit, “Mr. Robot,” which airs on the USA Network. Amazon also signed content deals with AMC Networks and Time Warner (TWX) for six seasons of HBO’s “Sex and the City.”
"
182,DISH,"Shares of AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) have rallied in 2016, owing to falling interest rates and their relative safety amid the stock market tumult.One factor sure to impact trading for both companies the rest of the year is the government’s auction of airwaves now owned by local TV broadcasters, set to start this month.Shares of the high-dividend-paying AT&T and Verizon are up 13% and 11% so far in 2016, respectively. But higher-than-expected auction spending would hit free cash flow and possibly credit ratings.Many analysts continue to downplay potential spending by wireless phone companies and others, but Citigroup estimates bids could reach $43 billion, in the neighborhood of 2015’s “AWS-3” auction.A Bloomberg survey, meanwhile, estimates the auction will raise only $33 billion, much less than the $60 billion figure floated by some observers in mid-2015.The Federal Communications Commission plans to begin the “Broadcast Incentive Auction” on March 29. The auction, which could last five to six months, will free up an estimated 60 to 80 megahertz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum for wireless services.Both AT&T and Verizon have talked down their interest in the TV broadcast airwaves, and both have alternatives for spectrum, as IBD reported.T-Mobile US (TMUS) has stated it could spend up to $10 billion, while cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) has filed to be a bidder. There’s fresh speculation Japan-based SoftBank (SFTBY), Sprint’s majority owner, could bid, though Sprint (S) itself has bowed out. Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google also recently ruled itself out.Analyst estimates proved far too low for the AWS-3 auction, which ended in January 2015. Most analysts pegged AWS-3 auction spending in the mid-teens of billions of dollars, with the highest estimates around $20 billion. The auction, however, raised more than $41 billion -- minus $3 billion in airwaves Dish Network (DISH) later surrendered.During that auction, wild rumors about Verizon's purported spending pressured its stock at points, while AT&T eventually emerged as the top AWS-3 bidder.In the TV broadcast auction, JP Morgan estimates that bidders could spend anywhere from $25 billion to $35 billion. Cowen & Co. estimates AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile will spend $27.5 billion combined.Comcast and private equity firms loom as wild cards. Several analysts have estimated Comcast’s spending at $5 billion-$6 billion.For the complex, two-part auction to succeed, bidding prices have to reach levels high enough that TV broadcasters follow through and sell the spectrum.If the auction doesn’t proceed as planned, it would be a blow for spectrum-needy T-Mobile, analysts say.Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and through walls, improving in-building services. AT&T and Verizon own more than 70% of low-frequency airwaves in the top 100 U.S. markets.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, whose legacy will be tied in part to whether the auction succeeds, has downplayed pre-auction comments by AT&T and Verizon, saying it’s normal for bidders to lower expectations.

183,DISH,"Walt Disney (DIS) shares plummeted late Tuesday on a second-quarter miss, as the House of Mouse noted a decline in both ESPN subscribers and the sports network's advertising revenue.But CEO Bob Iger sees a ""very robust marketplace and a very strong upfront"" season ahead for both ABC and ESPN, he said during the post-earnings call.Shares sank 5% late, after closing the regular session up 1.2%.ESPN didn't consume the Q2 call as it did during the previous quarter, but Iger did say that the channel's inclusion in over-the-top bundles correlated with some ""very encouraging sign-ups.""Instead, focus drifted to Hulu, which has become an ""important investment for us not just as a distributor but as a buyer of original product,"" according to Iger, and he put Hulu's recently announced live-TV package as a ""best of cable approach"" that lies somewhere between a big, expanded bundle and lighter packages, such as those from Dish Network’s (DISH) Sling TV.Disney is ""fully aligned"" with joint Hulu co-owner 21st Century Fox (FOXA) on a strategy for the over-the-top platform, he said, and doesn't foresee Disney having issues related to being both a content distributor and a content creator.The lookout for a successor to Iger's chief exec spot also came up, as Wall Street tries to anticipate who will take the helm of the media titan.Iger was mum on the circumstances of Tom Staggs' recent exit from the COO post, but confirmed that he has no plans to extend his contract beyond June 2018, when he is currently scheduled to step down as CEO.The board is ""actively engaged in a succession process as it has been for some time,"" he said, and the board believes it has ""ample time"" to identify a successor.The media conglomerate's Q2 earnings per share grew 11% to $1.36, excluding items, and revenue rose 4% to $12.97 billion, falling short of expected adjusted EPS of $1.40 on $13.19 billion in revenue.Media networks revenue, which includes the cable networks and broadcasting units, was ""relatively flat"" at $5.8 billion. Cable networks revenue fell 2%, while broadcasting revenue rose 3%.ESPN revenue rose, but advertising revenue notably decreased, and the company said affiliate revenue growth was ""partially offset by a decline in subscribers."" Iger had said in a February call that ESPN had experienced a slight uptick in subscribers in recent months.Studio revenue shot up 22% to $2.1 billion, bolstered by the theatrical success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and the recently released ""Zootopia.""Parks and resorts revenue rose 4% to $3.9 billion. The anticipated Shanghai Disney Resort opens on June 16.Consumer products and interactive media revenues fell 2% to $1.2 billion.Notably, Disney shuttered its Infinity console games business, taking a $147 million charge during the quarter. While the company ""did quite well"" with the first iteration and ""OK"" with the second iteration, console gaming is a changing business that ""we didn't have the confidence"" to stay in, said Iger during the call, asserting that Disney was better off staying in licensing than publishing.RELATED:Verizon, Disney Bury The Hatchet Over ESPN, Skinny TV BundleWhat ‘Captain America: Civil War’ Means For Disney Ahead Of Earnings

184,DISH,"Walt Disney (DIS) missed second-quarter expectations late Tuesday, sending shares gapping down out of buy range Wednesday, closing down 4%.But is it all bad news? Here are a few takeaways from the media conglomerate's earnings call.IBD's Take: How sturdy is the House of Mouse? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupFewer sports fans are paying for ESPN (again), but Disney's pay-TV situation is perhaps not as dire as once perceived, thanks to ESPN's inclusion in over-the-top bundles from Dish Network (DISH) and on the Sony (SNE) PlayStation.""The numbers on both of those platforms have been encouraging, and they were a driver of (subscribers),"" Chief Executive Bob Iger said on the earnings call late Tuesday. ""They did contribute incremental subs for ESPN this last quarter."" He added that current and new distributors have an ""avid interest"" in including ESPN in their packages.Disney's 10-Q filing for the quarter notes subscriber declines having a 1% revenue impact to its media networks division, down from a 2% impact in its fiscal first quarter. Cable networks, (including ESPN and others) and broadcasting (including ABC) make up the media networks division.""These trends suggest some deceleration of subscriber declines, likely related to positive momentum coming from Sling TV and to a lesser extent Sony Vue,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers wrote in a recent note to clients, referring to so-called ""skinny bundle"" packages involving a few select channels. Meyers reiterated his overweight rating on the belief that ""the upcoming film slate will drive significant value over the next five years despite the decelerating pace of growth at ESPN.""Media networks revenue, which was flat from the prior year's second quarter, was ""largely in line (with my expectations) and, more importantly, largely in line on the affiliate (revenue) front,"" wrote Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil, who rates Disney a buy.Revenue from both the cable networks unit and greater media networks segments slightly missed Wall Street consensus, according to Stifel, but analysts didn't seem to mind much -- in stark contrast to the previous quarter's call.Once in the shadow of Netflix (NFLX), Hulu garnered some attention in the wake of news that it will launch a live-TV package next year that will include broadcast and cable channels, as well as live sports and news.""Hulu's become an important investment for us, not just as a distributor of the programs that we make, but ultimately as a buyer of original product and ultimately as a distributor of our channels"" Iger said during the call, billing it as a ""best of cable"" middle-ground option between a bigger package and a Sling-style skinny bundle.The streaming service is a ""key strategic asset for Fox (FOXA) and Disney and one which allows for greater ad monetization over time but, more importantly, is expected to continue to bridge the product gap between MVPD (multichannel video programming distributor) service and OTT (over-the-top) services,"" Mogil wrote in a separate note.Iger refrained from commenting on Disney's plans for subscription video-on-demand, except to say that it will keep investing in the creation of intellectual property.""One of the best examples of that would be Marvel and what we've been able to do with Netflix in terms of multiple original series, renewal of second seasons on two of them, and the addition of another series from Marvel to Netflix,"" he said, adding that Marvel has also ""been in discussions"" with other distributors.Netflix shares were down 2.6% Wednesday.Separately, he said the value of Disney's IP in China ""is on the rise."" The soon-to-be-opened Shanghai Disney Resort will feature Marvel characters, and characters from the Disney animated film ""Zootopia"" will pop up in the park ""sooner than we had initially anticipated,"" said Iger, due to the movie's success in China.""In general, you're going to find a park that is going to take advantage of what is clearly a growing interest in our intellectual property, as well as a blend of some original intellectual property too,"" he said.Disney's IP flows through its various branches, as original characters become Disneyland attractions and toys that help the consumer products segment chug along.Spider-Man's return to the Marvel fold won't hurt, either. Marvel and Sony struck a deal last year to share the character, the top Marvel character from a merchandise perspective, said Iger. That means Disney probably expects fans to snap up Spider-Man toys and products next year when ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" hits theaters.

185,DISH,"Dish Network (DISH) stock rose Friday after the company responded to reports that hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital Management has taken a short position in the satellite TV broadcaster and views its spectrum assets as overvalued.Bloomberg had reported Thursday that Kerrisdale had raised $100 million in a new fund aimed at shorting a large company that it didn't identify, but that Bloomberg said was Dish.Dish Network, meanwhile, in an emailed statement to IBD Friday, said: “We understand Kerrisdale is shopping a negative report on DISH and has shorted our stock in an attempt to make a short-term gain while DISH is in an FCC-mandated quiet period. We will continue to manage the business for the long-term benefit of our shareholders as we have done over the last 35 years.""Dish Network has amassed some 77 MHz of radio spectrum, spending some $15 billion in the process, according to Citigroup. Dish, however, lacks a wireless partner to deliver mobile video services.Verizon Communications (VZ) has stated it’s not interested in acquiring Dish Network’s spectrum but might be open to a wholesale network deal, analysts say. Dish -- along with AT&T (T), Verizon and T-Mobile US (TMUS) -- have filed as bidders in a federal auction of airwaves now owned by local TV broadcasters. The auction, begun in late March, might drag on until Q4. Depending on the auction’s outcome, wireless firms may be more or less interested in partnering with Dish Network or buying its spectrum.According to Bloomberg, Kerrisdale said on Twitter that it is betting against a more-than-$10-billion company that it thinks is worth 60% to 80% less than its current price. Kerrisdale also reportedly tweeted ""we're still weeks -- perhaps many weeks -- away from actual publication.""Growth has slowed in Dish Network’s core pay-TV business. Dish last year launched its Sling Web-TV service, which has been gaining subscribers.Dish Network stock was up 5% in early trading in the stock market today, above 46.As of Thursday's close, Dish Network’s stock was down 23% in 2016 and has slumped 33% in the past 12 months. Dish stock has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 23 out of a possible 99, meanings it's performed among the bottom 23% of all companies on key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.

186,DISH,"Xiaomi, Apple’s (AAPL) Chinese smartphone rival, this year plans to launch a 4K TV streaming device in the U.S. featuring Google’s Android software.Xiaomi made the announcement at Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google I/O developer’s conference on Wednesday.The item will compete with Roku, Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Fire TV devices, Apple’s set-top box and Google’s own Chromecast streaming sticks, as well as Web-connected TV sets featuring Google's Android software.Xiaomi’s Android-based TV system will be its first hardware product sold in the U.S. Xiaomi’s online store so far has sold only accessories in the U.S. However, Xiaomi has sold set-top TV boxes in Asia that stream HD-quality video.Hugo Barra, vice president for global at Xiaomi, joined the company in 2013 after leaving Google, where he had worked on mobile products and the Android mobile operating system.“This is a significant milestone for Xiaomi,” Barra said in a statement released at Google I/O.Xiaomi’s 4K streaming device will provide apps such as Netflix (NFLX) and YouTube, as well as Dish Network’s (DISH) Sling Web TV service.In China, Xiaomi will be one of the first smartphone makers to feature virtual-reality technology that Google has put into Android N, the new version of its mobile operating system.Samsung and HTC also plan to sell Android-based mobile phones with the VR mode.Xiaomi was the top smartphone seller in China in Q4, followed closely by China’s Huawei, with Apple down at No. 3.

187,DISH,"T-Mobile US (TMUS) stands to gain from the availability of more radio spectrum than expected in a government auction of airwaves, though it’s not good for the wireless communications provider if the auction drags on, says a Goldman Sachs report.T-Mobile says it could spend up to $10 billion in the auction. Other bidders are expected to be AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA).The complex ""Broadcast Incentive Auction,"" which started March 29, is expected to free up airwaves now owned by local TV stations. The Federal Communications Commission said Friday as much as 100 MHz of spectrum may be available for bidders in most U.S. markets. About 70 MHz had been forecast.The next step in the auction involves setting initial prices for the airwaves in specific cities.""While broadcasters will only sell if they get their desired prices, a large spectrum supply may yield attractive prices for wireless carriers,"" Brett Feldman, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said in a report. ""We view this as most positive for T-Mobile, which is looking to bolster its thin low-band spectrum position in this auction so it can provide coverage that is more competitive with AT&T’s and Verizon’s.""UBS analyst John Hodulik had a similar view. ""Greater spectrum availability is a positive for T-Mobile, given its low-band needs and Comcast,"" Hodulik said in a report.Shares in T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), are about even in 2016. T-Mobile stock edged down 0.4% in the stock market today.Analysts say one overhang on shares in Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile is how much they may spend in the auction. Another view is that telecom mergers and acquisitions are on hold until the auction is over.While the auction has been expected to be over in the September quarter, it may drag on until the fourth quarter.That would be a negative for “Dish Network (DISH) and T-Mobile, since many investors believe that their strategic options will be limited until the auction concludes,” said Feldman.Citigroup recently said Dish Network, which has amassed some 77 MHz of radio spectrum, could resume talks with Verizon over a possible sale after the auction ends.

188,DISH,"Internet TV service Hulu announced Wednesday that it will reach 12 million subscribers in the U.S. this month, up 30% from a year ago. It also confirmed media reports that it plans to offer a live-TV service in 2017 to complement its on-demand video service.Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins made the announcements at an upfront event in New York City for advertisers.Hopkins said the live-TV service will offer news, sports and entertainment from broadcast and cable TV, but it did not detail content and pricing, TechCrunch reported.“We’re going to fuse the best of linear television and on-demand in a deeply personalized experience optimized for the contemporary, always-connected television fan,” Hopkins said.Hulu's live-TV service is targeted at cord cutters and cord nevers -- those consumers who don't subscribe to traditional pay-TV services but might be interested in a lower-cost, ""skinny bundle"" of TV channels. Hulu is looking to charge about $40 a month for the live TV package, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. It would compete with other live-TV streaming services, such as Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue.Dish stock fell 2.9% to 46.04 and Sony's U.S.-listed shares dropped 1.1% to 23.85 on the stock market today.Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Disney also owns ABC, ESPN and Disney Channel; Comcast owns NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, Syfy and USA; and 21st Century Fox owns Fox, Fox News, FX and Fox’s sports channels.Hulu competes with Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) in the subscription video-on-demand sector. Like its rivals, Hulu has been increasing its original programming, most recently with shows such as ""11.22.63"" and ""The Path.""

189,DISH,"Negotiations between Dish Network (DISH) and Verizon Communications (VZ) over a radio spectrum sale might heat up after an ongoing government auction of airwaves is over, said Citigroup, which on Monday added the satellite TV broadcaster to its “focus list” of stocks.The Federal Communications Commission in late March began its Broadcast Incentive Auction of airwaves owned by local TV stations. The complex auction is expected to drag on until Q4, says Citigroup.Dish Network, meanwhile, has amassed some 77 MHz of radio spectrum, spending some $15 billion in the process, according to Citi’s estimate. Dish, however, lacks a wireless partner to deliver mobile video services.Citigroup maintains a price target of 94 on Dish stock. Shares in Dish have dropped over 30% since June, to near 50. Dish stock was up 1% in morning trading in the stock market today.Citigroup expects results of the current auction to reinforce the valuation of Dish's airwaves.“Our target price values (Dish’s) spectrum at $36 billion, or roughly $1.78 per MHz-pop, less than the $2.09 per MHz-pop we believe Verizon would be willing to pay,” said the Citigroup report. “MHz per pop” refers to the spectrum available in a specific market.Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet says Dish is more likely to sell, rather than “operationalize,” its spectrum by building out a wireless network. Wireless competition has intensified among AT&T (T), Verizon, T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S).“Carriers that have filed to participate in the TV auction -- like Dish and Verizon -- cannot pursue M&A while the auction is underway,” wrote Bazinet. “But, they can enter M&A discussions after the auction ends. Since we expect the auction to end in Q4 2016, we expect the Street to ascribe some sort of M&A likelihood into their valuation calculus for Dish.”

190,DISH,"Federal regulators opted to place no conditions related to John Malone’s sprawling media and telecom holdings in approving Charter Communication’s (CHTR) acquisitions of Time Warner Cable (TWC) (IBD) and Bright House Networks.California regulators are expected to approve Charter’s deals as soon as Thursday, the final hurdle to Charter’s makeover. Charter will leap to No. 2 in the cable TV industry, behind Comcast (CMCSA).Comcast owns NBCUniversal and NBCU-related conditions that the FCC imposed on Comcast in 2011, which are set to expire in 2018. NBCU's assets include the broadcast TV network, cable channels and a movie studio.Consumer group Public Knowledge, the American Cable Association and others asked the FCC to look into Malone’s holdings as part of the Charter review. Dish Network (DISH) waged the biggest fight against the TWC deal, while Netflix (NFLX) stayed on the sidelines.Malone controls Liberty Broadband (LBDRA), which will own about 18% of the new Charter and has rights to name three board members. Privately held media firm Advance/Newhouse will own about 13.5% of Charter. Liberty Broadband stock touched a record high for the second straight day on Wednesday.Malone holds a 28.7% voting interest in Discovery (DISCA); a 31.8% voting interest in Starz (STRZA); a 37.7% voting interest in the QVC Group, and a 3.3% voting interest in Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF), which holds a stake in Epix, according to the FCC.While much of Malone’s media holdings will now constitute Charter’s “affiliated programming,”  the FCC says it already has rules in place to govern those companies' relationships with other pay-TV providers.“Because New Charter will lack the incentive or ability to withhold or raise prices of affiliated programming, we further find it unnecessary to extend or modify our program access rules or impose other conditions on the licensing of New Charter’s affiliated content,” the FCC said in its May 6 order approving Charter’s acquisitions.The FCC’s conditions on Charter’s acquisitions aim to protect competition from Internet video providers such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com (AMZN).Charter will not be allowed to charge data usage-based prices or impose data caps on broadband customers for seven years. Those conditions could impact Comcast if it makes more acquisitions.Some analysts have speculated that Malone could consolidate some of his media assets and/or acquire more.Malone also controls Liberty Global, a Europe-based telecom company.""Malone's ownership of distribution and content assets globally implicitly has a scale larger than even Comcast, but with a much more fragmented ownership structure and working relationships,"" said a Barclays report in January.
"
191,DISH,"Dish Network’s (DISH) Q1 profit topped views, sending the satellite TV broadcaster’s stock up, as shares in Viacom (VIA) fell again amid stalled negotiations with Dish over a programming contract renewal.Englewood, Colo.-based Dish, which normally reports Q1 earnings in May, said that profit rose 11% from the year-earlier period to 84 cents a share. Revenue rose 2% to $3.79 billion, Dish said.Analysts had modeled EPS of 62 cents and revenue of $3.8 billion.Dish stock was up nearly 2% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 48. The satellite TV broadcaster’s stock is down 15% in 2016. Dish has been unable to find a buyer for its wireless radio spectrum or a wireless partner to offer mobile video services. Viacom stock, which fell 7% on Tuesday, was down about 2% late Wednesday morning, near 38.Dish said that it lost 23,000 net pay-TV customers in Q1. The company combines satellite TV customers with subscribers to its new online video service branded “Sling,” but it does not break out results.Dish lost 158,0000 satellite TV customers in Q1 but gained 135,000 Sling customers, estimated Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.While Dish aims to stabilize rising programming costs, its dispute with Viacom could increase subscriber losses, says Moffett.John Hodulik, a UBS analyst, agreed in a report.“DirecTV faced a similar dispute in July 2012, which kept Viacom networks off the air for 10 days, contributing to an 80% year-over-year drop in net adds in Q3 2012. While this is likely a negotiating tactic by Dish, since 2014 smaller cable operators, including Cable One and Suddenlink, have dropped Viacom’s networks entirely to save cost,” wrote Hodulik.Vijay Jayant, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a report: “We estimate that DISH pays Viacom between $350M and $400M in programming costs. While Dish will save these costs in case there is no agreement, it will also lose subscribers at a higher pace initially than in a scenario where there is a deal.  Dish also has an ongoing dispute with (Comcast (CMCSA)-owned) NBCU.”Viacom’s 24 cable networks include MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Viacom lacks sports content, a strength of Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Dish has had disputes with CBS (CBS), 21st Century Fox and Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting unit.Viacom rose more than 1% near 36 Wednesday afternoon after tumbling 8.3% on Tuesday.
"
192,DISH,"Dish Network (DISH) will make some Viacom (VIA) cable networks available on its Sling Web TV service as part of a programming deal that sent shares of both the satellite TV broadcaster and the media company up on Thursday.Viacom stock was up nearly 11% in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Dish Network stock was up 1.5%.Terms of the programming contract renewal, announced Thursday morning, were not disclosed. The deal averted a blackout of 18 Viacom channels on Dish Network’s satellite TV service.A protracted battle might have hurt both companies, analysts say. Viacom stock is down more than 35% in the past 12 months, while Dish stock has shed about 30%.“We view the overhang removal (for Viacom) as significant and believe the deal allows the company more flexibility and time regarding options for a Paramount partial sale stake,” said Benjamin Mogil, an analyst at Stifel, in a research report.Dish stock has dropped amid investor concern over its wireless strategy. Dish has been unable to find a buyer for its wireless radio spectrum or a wireless partner to offer mobile video services.Its online video service Sling, which starts at $20 monthly, has been growing. UBS analyst John Hodulik on Thursday upped his year-end Sling subscriber estimate to 1.5 million from 1.2 million.Dish recently added a separate Sling package featuring add-on channels from 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Sling will offer Comedy Central, Spike, MTV, Nick Jr. and other channels later this year under the new programming deal.

193,DISH,"Media titan Walt Disney (DIS) appears to be in pretty good shape heading into Tuesday's second-quarter results, as a super-team of theatrical releases continues to crush it at the box office.But as indicated by the previous quarter, investors may let their thoughts again drift to the Dark Side, as months-long hand-wringing over the state of the broader pay-TV environment just will not abate.Walt Disney investors were divided like the Avengers in Marvel's ""Captain America: Civil War."" Shares rose as high as 106.68 early on the stock market today, moving past a buy point at 105.70. But shares reversed to closed down 0.2%.As of late Monday, Wall Street expects Disney to log 14% profit growth to $1.40 a share on a 6% revenue gain to $13.2 billion.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" should again prove to be a revenue-booster, with moviegoers choosing the seventh installment of the hallowed Lucasfilm franchise over newer releases in recent months.According to Box Office Mojo, the movie remained high in the box office rankings -- coming in at No. 14 over the April 1-3 weekend -- around the end of Disney's Q2 and close to four whole months after its big-screen premiere. The movie has so far raked in almost $2.1 billion worldwide.Disney's reign over movie theaters also includes the success of ""Zootopia"" and box-office leader ""The Jungle Book,"" though the latter counts toward the current quarter.Captain America has already pulled an estimated $181.8 million from its U.S. opening weekend, giving it a global box-office total of over $678 million since it debuted abroad in late April, said Variety. The film’s debut displaced “Iron Man 3” as the fifth-best all-time best domestic opening weekend.But the recent departure of Disney COO Tom Staggs - Iger's heir apparent - will likely prompt questions during call late Tuesday. And the question of ESPN’s subscriber data looms large.Despite a solid Q1 earnings and revenue beat on Feb. 9, lofty expectations and a hyper-focus on ESPN subscriber numbers dogged Disney shares the next day, with the stock sinking 3.8% on Feb. 10.Disney acknowledged previous subscriber losses but noted a more recent uptick amid the popularity of skinny cable bundles that include ESPN.Even if Q2 results top views, CEO Bob Iger may again get grilled about cable subscription figures, as he was during the previous quarter's earnings call.Why the persnickety attention to one sports cable channel amid a sea of products from the House of Mouse? For one thing, Disney's cable networks segment alone made up almost 30% of Q1 revenue (the greater media networks segment accounted for 41.5% of revenue for the quarter).By contrast, the studio entertainment unit only comprised 12.5% of Disney's overall Q1 revenue.""If (ESPN) looks more stable in the March quarter -- and management did say on last quarter’s call in February that Sling TV subs had helped overall subs tick up again -- then the DIS relief rally could continue,"" wrote Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen on April 26.""If there is any indication of weakness or further uncertainty at ESPN, or the cable networks in general, then DIS shares could struggle again.""More pressingly for the industry, the performance of Disney's cable networks might be taken as an indicator of the health of the greater media and pay-TV environment. It was, after all, comments about ""modest declines"" in ESPN subscriptions that helped fuel a media-stock meltdown last August.But Time Warner (TWX), CBS (CBS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) all reported solid earnings results over the past week, and Iger hinted in February that ESPN could come in more streaming forms.The sports channel is currently a member channel of Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV, Verizon Communications' (VZ) Custom TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue bundles.""While we expect a messy quarter due to the timing of the college football games (Q1 vs. Q2 last year), we expect the cable affiliate revenue to grow 2.9%,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers. ""We do expect to see some upside from recent inclusion of ESPN into Verizon's Custom TV and Sony's Vue packages.""Lastly: Hulu, of which Disney is part-owner, might prove to be an interesting discussion point come Tuesday. The over-the-top service said this week that it is developing a live-TV package, which is reportedly expected to include ESPN.RELATED:Hulu’s New Service Could Give Netflix, Cable A Run For Their MoneyDisney CEO: ESPN, Star Wars, Marvel ‘Tailor-Made’ For StreamingDisney Lost More Subscribers In Q1 But Seeks New ESPN Platforms.

198,DISH,"Stock markets struggled for a second straight week as Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year closing low. Tesla Motors (TSLA) stock skidded as skeptics doubted production plans, Under Armour (UA) lost key execs, while shale producers topped low-ball output targets, and Alibaba (BABA) reported strong revenue growth.With the market uptrend already under pressure, stocks continued to slide. The Nasdaq lost 0.8%, dropping below its 50-day moving average after undercutting its 200-day line in the prior week. Apple fell to the lowest since mid-2014, and Tesla Motors tumbled. But Facebook (FB) held on to the prior week's big earnings-related gain. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% for the week, but on Friday found support at the 50-day moving average after briefly undercutting that key area for the first time in two months.The U.S. economy added just 160,000 in April, the smallest gain in seven months. Earlier in the week, ISM's manufacturing index signaled activity barely increased last month, while productivity fell for a second straight quarter. Those headline figures suggested the U.S. is resolving the contradiction -- solid labor market gains but sputtering economic growth -- in favor of weaker hiring. But wage gains accelerated, and the workweek picked up.The week's economic data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates at its June meeting.The luxury electric carmaker’s 57-cent Q1 loss was a penny smaller than estimates, while its 70% surge in revenue to $1.6 billion met views. Tesla bumped up its 500,000 unit build plan by two years to 2018, due to Model 3 demand.The stock dropped 5% on Thursday, as analysts said the projection is too optimistic. For the week, Tesla sank 10.8%, falling below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Tesla partner Mobileye (MBLY) said Q1 adjusted EPS jumped 88% to 15 cents on a 65% hike in revenue to $75.2 million. Both beat expectations but marked a second straight quarter of decelerating growth. The maker of advanced driver assistance systems is working with big-name automakers on their self-driving technology.

GM sales fell 3.5% vs. April 2015 to 259,447, in large part due to a drop in low-margin sales to rental fleets. Ford sales rose 4% to 231,316, but both GM and Ford were below forecasts. Fiat Chrysler rose 6% to 199,631 units, beating Edmunds.com’s 5% estimate.Meanwhile, Ford sales in China fell 11% in April, while GM’s sales there rose 7.5%, partly on a 13% pop in Cadillac sales.GM shares fell 2.6%, Ford 0.9% and Fiat Chrysler 4.6% for the week, trading near their 50-day lines.Gunmaker Sturm Ruger (RGR) on Monday handily beat first-quarter forecasts and boosted its quarterly dividend by 37%, following similarly strong results in March from rival Smith & Wesson (SWHC).Both companies have benefited from an increasingly diverse crowd of shooting enthusiasts. Regulatory concerns and widening fears following mass shootings like those in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Europe have also made guns more popular in the U.S.On Wednesday, the FBI reported 2,145,865 NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) firearm background checks for the month of April. That’s the best April on record for the system but lower than recent months, in keeping with similar patterns in previous years. The background checks are used as an indicator of gun demand, and stocks of both companies have been sensitive over the years to signs of demand topping out.Sturm Ruger rallied 5.5% Monday ahead of results and climbed 1.5% on Tuesday, but the stock found resistance at the 50-day line and ended the week up 2.6%. Smith & Wesson also wrapped the week with pared gains.

199,DISH,"YouTube, the video website of Alphabet (GOOGL)-Google, aims to roll out a new paid subscription service called “Unplugged” that would offer customers a bundle of cable TV channels streamed over the Internet, says a report.The Bloomberg report comes after Hulu on Monday disclosed plans to stream live content from two of its parents, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Walt Disney (DIS). Comcast (CMCSA), the third co-owner of Hulu and owner of NBC Universal, was not included in the initial plans. CBS (CBS) has its own stand-alone Web service to consumers.The Bloomberg “Unplugged” report notes that Google’s YouTube has not secured programming rights for the online video service. Speculation over YouTube “Unplugged” also comes amid a firefight over federal regulators' proposal to open up the pay TV set-top box market to more competition.Comcast, AT&T (T) and others object to the Federal Communications Commission’s set-top box proposal. They’ve charged that it might favor Google.The FCC says that only pay TV subscribers will gain access to programming, and that copyright protections will be preserved. Google, critics say, aims to swap its own advertising for the local ads sold by cable TV companies. Fox, Disney, CBS and Time Warner (TWX) have objected to the FCC proposal.According to the Bloomberg “Unplugged” report, YouTube has overhauled its technical architecture for the live product, slated to arrive as soon as 2017.Google last month introduced YouTube Red, which costs $10 monthly. It features movies, original content and other fare. Fox, Comcast-NBCU and CBS agreed to provide YouTube Red with content, while Disney did not.Hulu competes with Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) in the subscription video-on-demand sector. Dish Network (DISH) offers Sling TV, and has been gaining more content partners, including Fox.

But he was involved in some of those talks between Apple and media giants. Stern will run cloud services, which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay iTunes and iCloud. He will report to Eddy Cue, who reportedly took a tough line in streaming TV negotiations.Dish Network (DISH) has its own Sling TV skinny network streaming TV service, while Sony (SNE) has the Playstation Vue.Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) announced a pact with Liberty Global (LBTYA) to be on its cable set-top boxes in more than 30 countries. That follows a Netflix deal with Comcast (CMCSA) earlier this year.Apple shares rose 3.5% to 111.77, boosted by generally strong iPhone 7 pre-orders as well as Samsung's exploding Note smartphone fiasco.

202,DISH,"As Comcast (CMCSA) nears the launch of a Netflix (NFLX) app on its cable set-top boxes, whether it'll provide the same support for Hulu's upcoming live TV service looms as a big question.Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast. Time Warner (TWX) recently bought a 10% stake in Hulu.Hulu in early 2017 is expected to launch a new live streaming TV service, priced at around $40 monthly. Hulu's live service might pose more of a threat to Comcast's  cable TV business than Netflix's on-demand service, some analysts say.Netflix is more akin to HBO, which also is available on Comcast's X1 set-top boxes.Comcast CEO Brian Roberts showcased how Netflix programming will be presented on Comcast's X1 cable platform at a Goldman Sachs conference on Tuesday.Roberts also signaled that Comcast might offer other streaming video services, aside from Netflix. ""Our organization has made a conscious decision that we are going to aggregate other people's content, some of which we sell directly, some of which we don't,"" Roberts said.""Netflix, as we know, is wildly successful, and it has pretty much got content that you don't get with your (Comcast) X1 existing subscription,"" added Roberts.Shares of Comcast ticked up 0.6% to 66.23, while Netflix added 0.2% to 98.25 at the close on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock is down about 13% in 2016 and has been trading in a tight range in lower volume amid higher investments. With a market cap over $42 billion, it's a big fish. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Roku, Verizon Communications (VZ) and Dish Network (DISH) provide access to apps from Netflix and Hulu.On Comcast's Xfinity platform, existing Netflix customers will be able to log-in and watch shows as normal. Comcast customers will be able to search for Netflix programming before deciding whether to subscribe.Analysts say one benefit for Netflix will be reaching an older demographic, as opposed to millennials that view most content on mobile devices. Comcast gains by making Netflix available to its customers as federal regulators seek to open up the set-top box market.Comcast did not disclose pricing for Netflix's service.It will vary depending on how many devices can view shows at the same time.At Apple's (AAPL) iTunes store, Netflix offers the same monthly rates for people who buy through iOS as it does for web sign-ups.

203,DISH,"If you are the status quo candidate in a change election in which the national mood is sour and two-thirds of the electorate think the country is on the wrong track, what do you do? Attack. Relentlessly. Paint your opponent as extremist, volatile, clueless, unfit, dangerous.Indeed, Hillary Clinton's latest national ad, featuring major Republican politicians echoing that indictment of Donald Trump, ends thus: ""Unfit. Dangerous. Even for Republicans.""That was the theme of Clinton's famous open ""alt-right"" speech and of much of her $100 million worth of ads.Problem is, it's not working.Over the last month, Trump's new team, led by Kellyanne Conway, has worked single-mindedly to blunt that line of attack on the theory that if he can just cross the threshold of acceptability, he wins. In an act of brazen rebranding, they set out to endow him with stature and empathy.Stature was acquired in Mexico whose president inexplicably gave Trump the opportunity to stand on the world stage with a national leader and more than hold his own. It's the same stature booster Sen. Barack Obama pulled off when he stood with the French president at a news conference in Paris in 2008.That was part one: Trump the statesman. Part two: the kinder gentler Trump.Nervy. Can you really repackage the boasting, bullying, bombastic, insulting, insensitive Trump into a mellow and caring version? With two months to go? In a digital age in which every past outrage is preserved on imperishable video?Turns out, yes. How? Deflect and deny -- and pretend it never happened. Where are they now -- the birtherism, the deportation force, the scorn for teleprompters, the mocking of candidates who take outside money? Down the memory hole.Orwell was wrong. You don't need repression. You need only the sensory overload of an age of numbingly ephemeral social media. In this surreal election season, there is no past.Clinton ads keep showing actual Trump sound bites meant to shock. Yet her numbers are dropping, his rising.How? Trump never goes on the defensive. He merely creates new Trumps. Hence:(1) The African-American blitz. It's a new pose and the novelty shows. Trump is not very familiar with the language. He occasionally slips, for example, into referring to ""the blacks."" And his argument that African-Americans inhabit a living hell and therefore have nothing to lose by voting for him hovers somewhere between condescension and insult.But, as every living commentator has noted, the foray into African-American precincts was not aimed at winning black votes but at countering Trump's general image as the bigoted candidate of white people.Result? A curious dynamic in which Clinton keeps upping the accusatory ante just as Trump keeps softening his tone -- until she finds herself way over the top, landing in a basket of deplorables, a phrase that will haunt her until Election Day. (Politics 101: Never attack the voter.)(2)  The immigration wobble. A week of nonstop word salad about illegal immigration left everyone confused about what Trump really believes. Genius. The only message to emerge from the rhetorical fog is that he is done talking about deportation and/or legalization. The very discussion is off the table until years down the road.Case closed. Toxic issue detoxified.Again, that's not going to win him the Hispanic vote. But that wasn't the point. The point was to soften his image in the Philadelphia suburbs, pundit shorthand for white college-educated women that Republicans have to win (and where Trump trails Romney 2012 by 10 points).Which brings us to:(3) The blockbuster childcare proposal. Unveiled Tuesday, it is liberalism at its best, Big Government at its biggest: tax deductions, tax rebates (i.e. cash), and a federal mandate of six weeks of paid maternity leave. The biggest entitlement since, well, Obamacare.But wait. Didn't Trump's acolytes assure us that he spoke for those betrayed by the sold-out, elitist, GOP establishment that for years refused to stand up to Obama's overweening mandates, Big Government profligacy and budget-busting entitlements?No matter. That was yesterday. There is no past. Nor a future -- at least for Ivanka-care. It would never get through the GOP House.Nor is it meant to. It is meant to signal what George H. W. Bush once memorably read off a cue card. ""Message: I care.""And where do you think Trump gave this dish-the-Whigs cradle-to-college entitlement speech? Why, the Philadelphia suburbs!Can't get more transparent than that. Or shameless. Or brilliant.And it's working.

204,DISH,"Federal regulators appear to be warming up to a radio spectrum proposal from Ligado Networks, formerly LightSquared, which could provide AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) or T-Mobile US (TMUS) with a new strategic option -- but could spell trouble for Dish Network (DISH) and its spectrum holdings.The Federal Communications Commission recently began its Broadcast Incentive Auction involving airwaves owned by local TV stations. The top bidders are expected to be AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. The complex auction is expected to drag on for months.Ligado’s re-emergence from Chapter 11 has been a wild card. Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile might be less likely to buy Dish’s spectrum or partner with the satellite TV broadcaster if Ligado’s spectrum becomes commercially available. Dish has struggled to find a wireless partner to pursue mobile video services.Former Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg is chairman of Ligado, while former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt is a board member. Ligado, controlled by private equity firms, has a sizable 35 megahertz of midband spectrum.“Recent filings suggest the FCC may soon open inquiry on Ligado’s new spectrum proposal,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners, in a research report. “We believe Ligado’s restructured spectrum plan stands a reasonable chance of winning FCC approval.“If Ligado’s path to market becomes clear, it (would be) a long-term positive for Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, and a potential concern for Dish’s spectrum valuation (if Dish has not already monetized its spectrum).”After emerging from bankruptcy, Ligado has reached agreements with tractor maker Deere (DE) and GPS device maker Garmin (GRMN), resolving issues over potential global positioning system interference.

205,DISH,"Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) video typically dominate the conversation about subscription video-on-demand, or SVOD services, but a new service from Hulu could be a game-changer that poses a threat not just to SVODs but to traditional pay-TV providers.The conglomerate-owned online streamer is developing a new subscription service that would include feeds of both broadcast and cable programs, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources. The service, which appears to be akin to a skinny bundle, is looking to debut in the first quarter of 2017 and would cost around $40 a month, the Journal said.The new Hulu service would include channels such as ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel, as well as Fox's sports channels, Fox News and FX, said the Journal. It also may offer cloud-based digital recording and an archive of on-demand shows.The move comes as traditional media conglomerates and pay-TV providers have been looking for new ways to appeal to viewers inclined to get their entertainment online. Dish Network (DISH) and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation each offer streaming bundles that include cable channels such as ESPN, TBS and CNN.Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) jointly own Hulu, and offer many of their popular shows on the platform, including ""Scandal,"" ""Empire"" and others.Following concern -- and an ensuing media-stock kerfuffle last summer -- over cord-cutters and the strength of Disney's ESPN subscriber base, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in February that the company was exploring new platform providers for the sports-cable network.As the major entertainment names begin reporting quarterly results this week, investors might expect more chatter about the SVOD environment and the performance of over-the-top services such as HBO Now and CBS All-Access.CBS (CBS) reports Tuesday, while Time Warner and Fox both report Wednesday. Disney reports next week.Netflix shares closed up 3.4%. Amazon shares climbed 3.7% while Disney shares added 1.1% and Fox gained 0.3%.

206,DISH,"Comcast’s (CMCSA) programming costs should moderate after 2017, boosting the cable TV side of its business, while its NBCUniversal division gets a lift from its own contract renewals, says a bullish Nomura report.Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente expects Comcast to report a strong first quarter. Comcast is slated to post Q1 earnings on April 27. Some analysts have been raising estimates for Comcast’s Q1 video subscriber additions.“Comcast is likely to meet or beat Q1 expectations,” said DiClemente in the report. “We expect 2016 to be a strong year of execution for Comcast, driven by video and broadband subscriber upside, as well as NBCU tailwinds from retransmission and affiliate fee growth, constructive parks trends and the Rio Olympics.”Comcast stock has gained more than 10% in 2016, and was down a fraction, near 62, in early trading in the stock market today.“After 2017, we believe Comcast likely has the majority of its major programming rights locked in until around 2020, suggesting substantial earnings potential and operating leverage in the out years,” said DiClemente. “Comcast (also) stands to benefit from the other side of the rights negotiation table through its ownership of NBCUniversal.”He says NBCU has upcoming renewals with Dish Network (DISH) and Verizon Communications (VZ).Comcast is the nation’s No. 1 cable TV provider. Charter Communications (CHTR) will be No. 2 if federal regulators approve its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House Networks. The Federal Communications Commission is expected to approve the Charter-Time Warner Cable deal with conditions, but California regulators may not green-light the merger until May.

207,DISH,"""One fine day, in a fit of euphoria, after he had picked up the telephone and taken an order for zero-coupon bonds that had brought him a $50,000 commission, just like that, this very phrase had bubbled up into his brain. On Wall Street he and a few others -- how many? -- three hundred, four hundred, five hundred? -- had become precisely that ... Masters of the Universe.""""Bonfire of the Vanities,"" Tom WolfeDonald Trump, a man about town in Manhattan, doubtless fancies himself a Master of the Universe. He is, however, no match for folks who have run rings around his ramshackle campaign in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Casper, Wyo.They met to select, by settled rules comprehensible to all who can read, delegates to the Republican National Convention. They selected so many sympathetic to Ted Cruz that Trump has declared the system in both states, and wherever else the diligent are defeating the dilettante, to be ""rigged, disgusting, dirty."" Actually, he is having the novel experience of competing in systems that are not rigged.Voters can only surmise what Trump is hiding by refusing to release his tax returns, and can only guess how much he is exaggerating his wealth, or how much he has made from the money his father gave him. (To the question, ""When you publicly state what you're worth, what do you base that number on?"" he replied: ""I would say it's my general attitude at the time that the question may be asked."") Voters know, however, his repeated boasts that he has prospered in the New York City real estate business, a Petri dish of crony capitalism, by making lavish payments to political decision-makers:""I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me."" And: ""As a businessman and a very substantial donor to very important people, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do."" And: ""I've got to give to them, because when I want something, I get it. When I call, they kiss my ass.""No wonder Trump, in his New York City parochialism, considers grassroots politics in Colorado and Wyoming (and Louisiana, South Carolina and elsewhere) mysterious and sinister. His rule-or-ruin approach to the GOP, which this real estate operator is treating like a short-lease rental property, is attempting to delegitimize any process in which he does not win.He is theatrically enraged by two things he finds inexplicable and illegitimate -- the spirit of federalism and the wisdom of The Federalist Papers. He is offended that states have the right to have different delegate-selection processes.And he is scandalized that some states have chosen processes that establish what the authors of The Federalist Papers, and the Constitution's framers, recommended -- indirect democracy (the framers wanted only House members directly elected) that tempers opinion by filtering it through multiple layers of deliberation. Complex delegate-selection processes test candidates' abilities that are pertinent to governing, including skillful staffing and an aptitude for long-term planning.Trump's campaign to discredit the GOP would benefit from any attempts, whatever their motivations or consequences, to rewrite convention rules now, in the middle of a process that all participants began on the assumption that this year's rules were settled. Next year, however, when this year's competition is, like Trump, just a fragrant memory, state parties that have open primaries should rethink this practice.It makes parties susceptible to free-floating voters and freebooting candidates who are, like Trump, lightly -- if at all -- invested in the party's historic mission and its future. Open primaries are not unconstitutional but they are discordant with a First Amendment value -- the freedom of the individual to associate with like-minded persons in political parties to advance a particular political doctrine.Reformers are apt to revive familiar proposals for making the nomination process tidier by instituting four or five rotating (in their places on the nominating calendar) regional primaries. Leave aside the question of whether tidiness, an essentially aesthetic value, is a sensible political goal for a complex continental nation.But this arrangement, which this year might have quickly nominated Trump, or any future reform must be evaluated in terms of how it would facilitate or impede future Trumps. Measures to prevent candidacies like his could be his contribution -- inadvertent, of course -- to the public good.

T-Mobile, with its Uncarrier-branded marketing strategy, has gained market share vs. bigger rivals.Controlled by Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile has “strategic appeal to potential industry partners,” wrote Niknam.“With video increasingly going mobile, and reports that Comcast (CMCSA) has recently triggered its (wholesale) agreement with Verizon, we believe cable companies may increasingly view mobile network ownership as a longer-term strategic option.”While Comcast has plenty financial muscle to pull off an acquisition, Dish Networks’ stock has dropped while Sprint holds more than $32 billion in debt.AT&T’s acquisition of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV, meanwhile, has bolstered its competitive position, says Niknam.“We believe AT&T is best positioned strategically, given AT&T’s presence across each of the key distribution platforms (mobile, video, wired broadband/phone), and its leadership position (#1 or #2 share) across each market,” he said.Frontier stock was up about 4.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Sprint and CenturyLink were up more than 2%, and SBA more than 3%.

240,DISH,"It's not your imagination — the cost of pay-TV service is going through the roof. U.S. household spending on pay-TV service has risen 39% since 2010, according to a new report by Leichtman Research Group. Average reported monthly spending on pay-TV service is now $99.10, Leichtman said. That's up from $89.78 last year and $71.24 in 2010. Ten years ago, the average was $49.51.Leichtman notes that the figures are self-reported and that 18% of 2015 survey respondents either didn't know or did not provide their current spending.For its latest survey, Leichtman conducted a phone survey of 1,222 U.S. adults in June.Rising cable TV bills are often cited as a reason for talk of cord-cutting and cord-trimming — subscribers either canceling their pay-TV service or reducing the number of channels they get. There are also cord-nevers, who have never paid for cable, satellite or telecom TV.About 83% of U.S. households subscribe to some form of pay-TV service, analyst Bruce Leichtman said in a statement Thursday. The percentage of households that subscribe to a pay-TV service peaked at 88% in 2010 and has slid nearly every year since.Among TV households that do not currently subscribe to a pay-TV service, 17% paid for a service in the past year, while 70% of non-subscribers last subscribed over three years ago or never subscribed to a pay-TV service.Overall, about 2.5% of TV households paid to subscribe to a service in the past year, but currently do not — compared with 1.5% in 2010 and 2.3% in 2005, Leichtman said.Among the non-subscribers, 63% get a subscription Internet video-on-demand service like Netflix (NFLX) or Hulu and 62% have an over-the-air broadcast TV antenna.Renters are much more likely not to subscribe to pay TV.In households using a TV, 12% of homeowners do not subscribe to a pay-TV service, compared with 23% of renters.In the first six months of 2015, the 13 largest pay-TV providers in the U.S. lost a combined 463,000 subscribers. They lost 126,000 subscribers last year and 105,000 in 2013, Leichtman says.Comcast (CMCSA) has lost 77,000 video subscribers this year, after losing 194,000 in 2014 and 305,000 in 2013.Time Warner Cable (TWC) lost 10,000 video subscribers in the first half of 2015. It lost 401,000 in 2014 and 825,000 in 2013.Charter Communications (CHTR) lost 35,000 video subscribers in the first six months of this year. It lost 49,000 last year and 121,000 in 2013.Cablevision Systems (CVC) has lost 44,000 video subscribers so far this year. Cablevision lost 132,000 in 2014 and 80,000 in 2013.Satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) shed 215,000 subscribers in the first six months of the year. It lost 79,000 last year and gained only 1,000 in 2013.Telecom companies have been net gainers recently.AT&T (T) added 28,000 video subscribers in the first half of 2015, after signing up 660,000 in 2014 and 924,000 in 2013.Verizon Communications (VZ) tacked on 116,000 video subscribers in the first half of 2015. It added 387,000 in 2014 and 536,000 in 2013.
"
241,DISH,"Federal Spending: President Obama has been crowing over a decline in the budget deficit. But what he doesn't mention — and Republicans shouldn't forget — is a major reason for that progress: budget caps.The deficit has dropped to less than $500 billion this year from the towering heights of $1.5 trillion during Obama's first term. But as the nearby chart shows, much of the improvement came after spending restraints were imposed under the Budget Control Act of 2011, during the fiscal fight between the president and congressional Republicans.Now Obama (again) wants to wriggle out of those spending restraints and go on another Washington shopping spree. The caps legally constrain domestic non-entitlement programs and national defense spending.The White House plan would increase discretionary spending to $1.091 trillion from $1.017 trillion. This $74 billion increase would be split evenly between defense and domestic spending. The 7% hike in 2016 would dish out plums to unions, foreign aid groups, the education blob, government contractors, federal employees, the climate change lobby and other tax guzzlers.Our Senate sources tell us that Minority Leader Harry Reid is threatening in private that if Republicans don't give Democrats the raise they want, there will be fiscal paralysis in the Senate and another government shutdown Oct. 1 — which, of course, they will blame on the GOP.Many Republicans are inclined to go along with the great fiscal escape plan. Some have legitimate concerns about more money needed for our military in times of growing national security threats. Already 60% of the cuts are in defense, even though military spending is less than 20% of the budget. But many GOP appropriators just want more domestic pork for their own districts.Wait a minute. Since 2012, these spending ceilings have been breached at least three times — it's become an annual fall ritual. Spending as a share of GDP bumped up this year because of the upward revisions in the caps.Republicans should force Obama to live by the law he signed. The caps are the best leverage they have to keep a lid on spending, given the president's planned blowout. And keep in mind that this year's caps aren't even a real cut. They simply hold spending to last year's levels. Capping government spending and debt helps the economy because it frees up resources for private investment and consumption.If Republicans fold on the caps again, it won't be just a fiscal setback but a political election-eve disaster as well. They keep running for office as fiscal disciplinarians only to cave to their most craven instincts to spend. Less than a year ago, the voters gave the GOP control of the House and the Senate in no small part to clean up the fiscal mess. Have they forgotten that pledge already?Perhaps Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner hope that voters aren't paying attention to the spiraling debt and runaway spending. That's a bad bet.Donald Trump's poll surge should be a blaring siren that voters have grown weary of the Republicans going to Washington and breaking solemn promises. A GOP betrayal of fiscal conservatives this year would only intensify that voter contempt.If clueless Republican leaders think voters are angry now, wait till McConnell and Boehner must confront the fury after another spend-and-borrow binge. A budget surrender is the best way to ensure that Reid is reinstalled as majority leader in 2017 — reason alone why the caps must stick.

U.S. carrier activity remains stable at historically low levels, but a number of growth drivers — new spectrum deployments/re-farming, 5G trials and FirstNet, for example — could modestly re-accelerate growth for the group,"" said Greg Miller, a SunTrust analyst, in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Both Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pay dividends. REIT stocks perform well when interest rates are low. But IBD's Finance-Property REIT group ranks just No. 90 out of 197 industry groups amid worries that interest rates could rise. A good place to check on industry group ratings is Stock Checkup. After a big run, dividend-paying AT&T and Verizon are also being pressured by views that the Federal Reserve may hike short-term rates.Verizon has stated it plans to be a leader in next-generation 5G wireless services. The U.S. government, meanwhile, is expected to soon award a contract for FirstNet, a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety.Miller expects intensified wireless competition to drive investments in network capacity. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint have stepped up marketing for unlimited data offers, while AT&T and Verizon are selling bigger data buckets.""In our view, the U.S. wireless industry remains fiercely competitive, and the risk of standing still from a network-quality perspective is just as great if not greater than ever,"" added Miller in the report. ""We believe carriers — particularly AT&T and, to a lesser degree, Verizon — will need to continue to spend on networks in order to maintain long-term competitiveness and, should 2016 play out as we expect, the odds of greater activity next year increase from a historical perspective.""Crown Castle, American Tower and SBA Communications all fell hard in the stock market today. Crown Castle stock fell 2.2%, to 91.87, while American Tower stock dropped 2.8%, to 108.11, and SBA fell 2.3%, to 108.99.

245,DISH,"A government auction of spectrum owned by TV broadcasters might drag on until the spring of 2017 -- putting a prolonged chill on telecom industry mergers and acquisitions.AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile US (TMUS), cable firm Comcast (CMCSA) and satellite-TV firm Dish Network (DISH) are among companies that have filed as bidders in the auction, which began March 29.In the first stage of the auction, TV broadcasters agreed to sell spectrum in local markets within a price range set by the Federal Communications Commission.The second phase of the complex, so-called ""broadcast incentive"" TV auction, started Tuesday, with the FCC providing auction updates.While some 126 megahertz of spectrum will be available overall in the second stage of the auction, about 100 MHz of that will be for commercial wireless use after the FCC ""re-packs"" broadcast airwaves.Broadcasters are seeking over $86 billion for the spectrum. But there's a wide gap between how much money TV broadcasters are seeking to part with their airwaves and how much wireless and other companies are prepared to bid, though it might be posturing, analysts say.""We expect $30 billion to $40 billion of spending from the wireless industry -- including AT&T ($10 billion), T-Mobile ($8 billion), Verizon ($6 billion), and Comcast ($3 billion to $5 billion) -- well below the broadcasters' $86 billion ask for 100 MHz of spectrum,"" said UBS analyst John Hodulik in a research report.The FCC has imposed a quiet period on bidders, banning strategic talks among them until the auction is over.""The process will likely require at least four rounds of auction, which could push it into 2017,"" Jonathan Atkin, an analyst at RBC Capital, said in a report. ""The FCC's anti-collusion rules will continue to apply during this period, having a continuing chilling effect on sector M&A.""IBD'S TAKE:  Shares of Comcast, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile have all gained in 2016, but Dish Network is down as its core pay-TV business slows. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Some analysts expect demand by wireless and other firms to peak at around 60 MHz to 70 MHz of commercial-ready spectrum.Michael Rollins, a Citigroup analyst, said in a report: ""We see the auction finishing in the winter or spring of 2017, recognizing the auction could go longer if the reverse and forward auction values don't meet the final stage rule within a range of auctioned mobile spectrum of 60 to 80 MHz.""Indeed, TV broadcasters could walk away from the auction if they deem bidding prices in local markets to be too low.Analyst Hodulik says a ""failed"" auction could be a plus for Dish Network, which has cobbled together nearly 80 MHz of spectrum and needs a wireless partner.Shares of AT&T fell 2.5% to 41.96, closing below their 50-day line, on the stock market today. Verizon fell 1.6%. Disney lost 0.2%, Comcast eased 0.3%, and T-Mobile fell 1.1%.

The auction is expected to continue into late 2016.AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Comcast (CMCSA) are among the expected bidders.Macquarie's Yong says the value of Dish Network's nearly 80 MHz of airwaves could rise, depending on what bidding levels are reached in the TV spectrum auction. If the TV spectrum auction falls apart, Dish would could also be better-positioned, Yong says. TV broadcasters could walk away from the auction if they deem bidding prices in local markets as too low.""Auction postponement or hiccups could make Dish one of few near-term sources of spectrum,"" Yong wrote.IBD'S TAKE: The Telecom-Services Cable/Satellite group is ranked No. 168 out of 197 industry groups. Comcast is top-ranked within the group but has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 75 out of a possible 99.

247,DISH,"Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates and announced Tuesday plans to bring to life an ""ESPN-branded multisport subscription streaming service,"" a move that has been hinted at for months now as the House of Mouse seeks to soothe fears of cable TV cord-cutting.The company is paying $1 billion to acquire a 33% stake in BAMTech, which has been Major League Baseball's MLB Advanced Media streaming unit. The news comes weeks after reports of the deal first surfaced.Under the agreement, expect to see a collaboration between BAMTech and ESPN ""in the future,"" according to a Disney statement, though a timeline was not specified. Disney said that BAMTech was separated from MLB Advanced Media as part of the deal.""The direct-to-consumer service will feature content provided by both BAMTech and ESPN, and include live regional, national and international sporting events,"" the company said in the release.CEO Bob Iger said on the earnings call late Tuesday that he sees the streaming service as a companion to ESPN, and that the goal was not to pluck content from ESPN's current offerings but to use existing licensed content that is not found elsewhere on the sports network.At ESPN, advertising and affiliate revenue grew during the quarter, but subscribers continued to decline at the network, a key moneymaker for Disney in years past.Iger also said that ESPN and select Disney channels would be available on AT&T's (T) DirecTV over-the-top bundle. Disney content can already be found on Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue, two streaming services.When asked about the significance of Disney's presence in streaming packages, Iger pointed out that Sony saw subscriptions increase ""substantially"" when ESPN was added to the PlayStation bundle.""Our best interest is to invest more in the total pie even if it means fragmentation,"" said Iger on the call, because the addition of those new parts will ""result in a greater whole.""For the fiscal third quarter, Walt Disney earned an adjusted $1.62 a share, up 12% and above expectations for $1.61. Revenue grew 9% to $14.28 billion vs. the Street's projections for $14.15 billion.Disney's media-networks revenue rose 2%, with a 1% gain in the cable-networks subsegment. Parks revenue rose 6%. Studio revenue jumped 40%, thanks to movies such as ""The Jungle Book,"" ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""Finding Dory."" Consumer products and interactive media revenue fell 1%.Shares were down 1.6% in late trade, after finishing the regular session up almost 1% to 96.67.Now the question becomes how Disney will manage pricing for the new streaming service, said Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich.""How do you keep the cash cow going when you're growing the new service?"" she told IBD. She added that customers ""are clearly wanting that service. If they price it right, there's room for both business models to live and keep the brand strong.""Meanwhile, Hulu, of which Disney is part owner, is launching a live-streaming package of its own next year, but Diedrich does not necessarily expect that to cannibalize the new ESPN streaming service.""The vast majority -- well over 90% -- of Netflix (NFLX) subscribers still have a connection for some other kind of service,"" she said, indicating that the various platforms have space to co-exist.

Between its studios, networks, theme parks and products, there's a lot going on at the House of Mouse.Read on for what to expect, and come back later for the results.Wall Street is expecting 11% third-quarter profit growth to $1.61 per share on 8% in revenue gains to $14.15 billion.The entertainment conglomerate has been disappointing analysts in recent quarters, missing earnings estimates in the second quarter and falling short of revenue expectations for three out of the last four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters.Shares shaved 8 cents off their price to 95.75 at the close Monday, ahead of earnings, and are trading up about 0.3% to 96.02 in the pre-market hours Tuesday.As it builds a flat base, the stock has been trading below its 200-day line since early May. And since mid-May, shares have infrequently come up for air above their 50-day moving average.Is Disney still a Hollywood sweetheart? The mega-success of the seventh ""Star Wars"" was a high point for Disney's theatrical arm. But some worried that Han Solo would be a solo studio-revenue spike.Even outside of the Lucasfilm franchise, however, Marvel and Pixar have been pumping out hits, feeding the public's appetite for superhero movies and adorable animation.Flicks like ""The Jungle Book,"" ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""Finding Dory"" performed well during the quarter.Per Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil: ""We continue to be of the view that the Studio and corresponding Consumer Products segments continue to deserve a strong multiple reflecting the very strong pipeline which the Studio continues to have and which we believe no longer justifies an asterisk or a one-off and instead is more reflective of a strong cycle from not just from Marvel and Pixar, but increasingly from Disney Animation and Disney live action.""Is ESPN experiencing more subscriber losses? Ever since Bob Iger's year-ago comments on ""modest"" ESPN subscriber losses that prompted investors to take a light saber to media stocks, it's practically become a staple on earnings calls now for the Disney chief to field questions about the state of the company's cable moneymaker.Why all the pearl-clutching over how many people pay to get ESPN? For reference, Disney's cable networks segment alone made up over 30% of revenue in the previously announced quarter, and its broader media networks unit -- which includes cable -- accounted for about 45% of total revenue.And in the age of cord cutting, every eyeball matters.IBD'S TAKE: Media conglomerates are searching for new ways to reel in young viewers, and virtual reality is an appealing medium. Read IBD's recent cover story for more: Disney, Comcast Pour Cash In Virtual Reality As The 'Netflix Of VR' Looms.The panic has subsided to a nervous whisper. In May, Iger told analysts on the call that Disney's inclusion on bundles from Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue had contributed to ""incremental subs"" for ESPN during the quarter.Still, Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich expects ""slower growth than in the past as competition for consumer time and entertainment dollars increases,"" according to a July 29 note.What's going on with Hulu? Hulu -- the streaming service jointly owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal, and now Time Warner (TWX) -- is launching a live-streaming TV package next year. (Yahoo (YHOO) and Hulu just struck a licensing deal for its free content, by the way.)Iger said last quarter that Hulu has ""become an important investment for us,"" not just as a distributor, but also as a buyer of original content and distributor of Disney's channels.He added that the company ""feel(s) really good about the opportunity.""Expect more commentary on Disney's new Shanghai Disney Resort, which opened to praise and good reviews.

265,DISH,"BAMTech invested an undisclosed amount in college sports streaming company Silver Chalice just weeks after Walt Disney (DIS) took a one-third stake in BAMTech.The digital media rights, technology and investment partnership announced Monday between BAMTech, Major League Baseball's streaming media service, and Silver Chalice includes a new suite of live streaming products for college sports fans across mobile and connected platforms, to be released later this year. Financial terms of the BAMTech-Silver Chalice deal weren't disclosed.Silver Chalice CEO Brooks Boyer said in a written statement that, ""Silver Chalice has focused on building partnerships with rightsholders, producing compelling content and delivering it to college sports fans where they want it, when they want it.""It's BAMTech's first initiative in college sports programming. Silver Chalice is controlled by Chicago White Sox and Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who is also chairman. Silver Chalice owns sports news and information site Campus Insiders and the Atlantic Coast Conference network, among others, according to Bloomberg.IBD'S TAKE: Walt Disney has announced plans for an ESPN streaming service. Here's why the ESPN streaming offering isn't what you think it is.Silver Chalice networks are available on Verizon (VZ) offering Go90, Dish Network (DISH) streaming offering Sling TV, Twitter (TWTR), Microsoft (MSFT) unit MSN.com, Yahoo (YHOO) -- which is being acquired by Verizon for $4.8 billion -- Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google's YouTube and USA Sports, among others.Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger disclosed the investment in BAMTech on Aug. 9, saying Disney is ""investing for change,"" including its recent announcement of an over-the-top ESPN service, which could debut as early as end of this year.Disney stock has been working on a flat base since mid-May with a 106.85 buy point. The House of Mouse has lined up five new Star Wars movies to roll out over as many years, and showed a trailer for the first one, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" during the Rio Olympics. That movie is slated for release on Dec. 16.Disney shares fell 0.5% to 95.87 on the stock market today. The stock is trading below its 50-day line as part of a downtrend that started in early November.
"
266,DISH,"Dish Network (DISH) stock fell in heavy volume Tuesday after the company announced plans to raise $2 billion in a convertible-debt sale amid a government auction of airwaves owned by local TV broadcasters.Dish Network stock plunged 8% to close at 49.19 in the stock market today.The Federal Communications Commission's auction of radio spectrum owned by local TV firms could drag on into Q4. AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Comcast (CMCSA) have been expected to be the leading bidders. Federal regulators have banned strategic talks among listed bidders until the auction is over.Dish Network spent nearly $10 billion in the so-called ""AWS-3"" auction, which ended in early 2015.Dish Network has amassed nearly 80MHz of radio spectrum for mobile video services, but it's been unable to partner with Verizon, T-Mobile or Sprint. AT&T acquired No. 1 satellite TV firm DirecTV Group in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Dish Network has added sizable debt to fund its wireless spectrum purchases. T-Mobile's Q2 earnings fell 52%, to 20 cents, on higher interest costs tied to its borrowing to fund auction bidding. T-Mobile stock has gained 19% in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Dish Network's core pay TV business has been losing subscribers. In Q2, Dish Network said it had a net loss of 281,000 pay TV customers, including satellite and the Sling web TV service, marking it biggest quarterly subscriber loss ever.Dish Network shares bounced back, though, when Dish Network on its earnings call mentioned joint work with AT&T to build an advertising platform. There's speculation that AT&T could be a buyer of a small block of airwaves that Dish Network owns in the 700 MHz frequency band.Dish has told analysts that it will not face pressure to build out a wireless network until 2020, under its agreements with federal regulators.
"
267,DISH,"Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Bob Iger said Tuesday that the House of Mouse is ""aggressively investing for change,"" led by its one-third stake in streaming company BAMTech and newly announced plans to launch an over-the-top ESPN service, ""probably"" by the end of 2016.Despite more ESPN subscriber losses, Wall Street seemed happy with both the streaming news and the better-than-projected third quarter, as shares were up Wednesday afternoon, looking to close above their 50-day line.But before cable subscribers get scissors-happy and cut the cord, let's take a look at what that new service might actually include, and what it means for Disney's place in this brave new digital world.Iger stated plainly that the ESPN-branded service will be a ""complementary service to what ESPN is already providing,"" making clear that Disney wasn't planning on nicking current ESPN content.""The goal is not to take product off ESPN's current channels, but to use sports and product that ESPN has already licensed that's not appearing on the channels,"" he said during the call.If that's the case, don't expect to watch the Wimbledon championship or NBA conference finals via an over-the-top ESPN platform. Sports enthusiasts will still need a regular cable subscription (or Sling TV or Vue) for that. What the new digital sports-network service will feature, according to Iger, is licensed content from BAMTech's stable of MLB and NHL programming, plus ""college sports, football and basketball, tennis, rugby, cricket, etc.""For investors, the bright spot of this deal comes not from what sports cord-cutters might be able to access, but what the Mouse has in store for this technology down the road.""We think Disney has bought its way into a commanding position on future content viewership,"" said Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen, who upgraded Disney to outperform from neutral on Wednesday. ""BAM Tech is a premier (over-the-top) streaming technology in its own right, and Disney now has the means to connect directly with consumers.""IBD'S TAKE: Media conglomerates are searching for new ways to reel in young viewers, and virtual reality is an appealing medium. Read IBD's recent cover story for more: Disney, Comcast Pour Cash In Virtual Reality As The 'Netflix Of VR' Looms.The entertainment giant is spreading its tendrils across the digital universe, most recently adding AT&T's (T) DirecTV service as a streaming partner that will have access to Disney content.So that means that in addition to those two MVPDs (multichannel video programming distributors), Disney has streaming content on Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV. And let's not forget Hulu -- Disney is a part owner -- which has its own live-streaming service launching in 2017 that will reportedly include ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel, according to the Wall Street Journal.The question now becomes: Is the Mouse spreading its digital content too thin?Anticipating that, Iger tackled the concern during Tuesday's call with analysts: ""What will be interesting is, long term, to what extent do we hold back product to put on services that are ours that we're selling direct to consumer vs. third-party distributors, but it's really premature to get into all of that because, right now, we've got kind of a best of all worlds in the sense that we're monetizing really well on multiple platforms from multiple parties.""Disney shares rose 1.2% to 97.86 in the stock market today.
"
268,DISH,"Dish Network (DISH) reported second-quarter earnings that topped views but said it had a net loss of 281,000 pay-TV customers, including satellite and the Sling web TV service, marking it biggest quarterly subscriber loss ever.Sales missed Wall Street views, but Dish Network stock reversed course and ended the day up 3.3% to 53.66 on the stock market today, near 50.Dish Network does not break out satellite and Sling services separately. Sling starts at $20 monthly, while satellite TV customers spend more than four times that on average.""Dish's dismal Q2 results in their core business suggest that there is less sand in the hourglass, faster than we thought,"" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a research report. ""Dish combines the core with Sling TV, two fundamentally different businesses.""Over the past year, gains at Sling TV have softened the blow of losses in the satellite core. This time, combining the two businesses likely obscures how quickly Sling TV is hitting a wall. By our estimates, Dish added just 49,000 new Sling TV subscribers.""Dish Network said it earned 88 cents per share, up 26% from the year-earlier quarter, with revenue about flat at $3.84 billion. Analysts had modeled profit of 73 cents and $3.86 in revenue.""Our pay-TV churn (disconnection) rate continues to be adversely affected by increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and wireless services, as well as cord cutting (online video),"" Dish Network said in a regulatory filing.The filing went on to say: ""As part of our increased emphasis on retaining higher-quality subscribers, we have been more selective in issuing retention credits, which has had a negative impact on our pay-TV churn rate.""IBD'S TAKE:  Dish Network's broadband services in rural areas are no match speed-wise for those of cable TV rivals such as Comcast. Analysts expect more broadband gains by Comcast. Dish stock is down more than 10% this year. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Dish Network has amassed a swath of radio spectrum for mobile video services, but it's been unable to partner with Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile US (TMUS) or Sprint (S). AT&T (T) acquired Dish archrival and No. 1 satellite TV firm DirecTV Group in 2015.Dish Network, Verizon and T-Mobile are prohibited from engaging in strategic talks until an auction of airwaves owned by local TV broadcasters concludes. It's uncertain when that auction, which began in March, will end.Dish Network had 13.59 million pay-TV subscribers as of June 30, down from 13.93 million a year earlier.
"
269,DISH,"Reports that federal regulators will disallow bidding discounts awarded to Dish Network (DISH) partners in a blockbuster government spectrum auction and that the satellite TV broadcaster's merger talks with T-Mobile (TMUS) are going nowhere sent Dish stock down late in Thursday's regular session. Dish stock had recovered a bit in after-hours trading. Sprint (S) stock, meanwhile, rose in after-hours trading…

298,DISH,"Viacom's (VIAB) 9% drop in fiscal Q3 U.S. ad revenue due to a decline in ratings added to fears that traditional media and cable firms are losing the battle againstNetflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN). Earlier in the week, Walt Disney (DIS) sparked the media stock sell-off after saying ESPN has lost a ""modest"" number of subscribers and trimming its guidance…
"
299,DISH,"With Stream, Comcast (CMCSA) hopes to hit upon what young adults, called Millennials, want from a streaming video service provider. Comcast strutted out a new low-priced streaming video service on Monday that rivals will struggle to match, at least in a battle for new customers in areas where Comcast sells high-speed Internet. Comcast stock was up nearly 1% in afternoon…
"
300,DISH,"Not only are young adults more likely to ""cut the cord"" and give up pay-TV services, they're also more likely to switch among providers of Internet video streaming services, says a BMO Capital Markets report.The report cites data from TV ratings provider Nielsen.Young adults, oft-called called millennials, have been big users of Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com 's (AMZN) video service, and Hulu. Dish Network (DISH) and Sony early in 2015 launched over-the-top (OTT) services — so called because they piggyback landline broadband services sold by other companies. Even if consumers don't buy a traditional pay-TV package, they still need broadband Internet to stream video.Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to launch a new Web TV service. Apple's entry could spur some subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) users to switch, a trend already underway, says Daniel Salmon, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, in his research report.""SVOD households generally churn at a higher rate than multi-channel video programming distributor (cable TV) households,"" Salmon said. ""We expect this is in part due to SVOD services' generally non-restrictive cancellation policies.""For example, over a three-month period, Nielsen generally finds that 99% of the households in the sample who had cable still have cable. However, 5-7% of people who had SVOD won't have it three months from now.""According to Nielsen data, 10% of persons aged 18-34 use only OTT services when they turn on a TV. SVOD users tend to watch less television overall.Among U.S. households, 41% now subscribe to a video streaming service, up from 36% a year earlier, said a Nielsen study released this year. Netflix by far is the most popular streaming video service, with Amazon No.2. Netflix stock recently got a boost when the company announced a 7-for-1 stock split.Another rival is Hulu — owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). It offers a free option with ads, as well as a paid service.
"
301,DISH,"Internet television services like Netflix (NFLX) are often described as beneficiaries of the cable and satellite TV ""cord cutting"" trend. But slowing subscriber growth at Netflix has some wondering whether cost-conscious consumers are now ""stream cutting.""Netflix added just 160,000 net new streaming subscribers in the second quarter, a steep drop from 900,000 in Q2 last year. Netflix blamed higher churn, or the percentage of customers canceling the service, for the shortfall.The churn coincided with press coverage of price hikes for longtime subscribers who had been grandfathered for up to two years at the old prices and were starting to see increases.The higher churn indicated that Netflix customers were more price sensitive than previously thought. Some of the customers who quit had decided that the current price ($9.99 a month for the standard plan) wasn't worth what they were getting. Others, though, might have tired of Netflix's offerings and opted to switch to another streaming service with a different lineup.The nature of subscription video-on-demand services like Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now and others makes it easy to cancel, especially after binge-watching all the shows of interest. Videophiles easily can switch among different over-the-top TV services from their Roku box, smart TV or other device.By comparison, cable companies make it difficult to start and stop their video services. They'll often lock customers into two-year contracts and charge fees for reconnecting service. Then there's the hassle of returning set-top boxes or having to go through the set-up process if you want to start again.""Even if you've had Netflix for three to five years, you can drop them for a few months and pick them right back up,"" Phillip Swann, president and publisher of TVPredictions.com, told IBD. ""What's the big deal? It's not like you have to have someone come out and put up a satellite dish or bring you a cable box.""Streaming video news website Extreamist suggests Netflix's shrinking library of content was behind the increased churn, not just the price hike. Extreamist reported in June that the size of the Netflix library had fallen 40% over the past four years.That puts pressure on Netflix to continue adding good content, including licensed Hollywood content and original shows, to keep subscribers happy.Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter warned in May that Netflix had fallen behind Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video when it comes to making quality original content. Netflix this year has released a bunch of critical turkeys, such as the comedy series ""Fuller House"" and Adam Sandler movie ""The Do-Over.""The higher Netflix churn last quarter was likely a combination of the price hike, reduced content selection and churn from increased streaming competition, Swann said.""There's been an explosion of streaming services of various kinds over the last 12 to 18 months that finally had an effect on Netflix,"" Swann said. ""You've got now HBO, Showtime, Starz (STRZA), Seeso, Sling, Sony (SNE) Vue and so on. There are so many internet TV options now that the competition for that audience has grown.""Many subscribers might sign up for a streaming video service when it offers a new season of a popular show, such as ""Game of Thrones"" on Time Warner's (TWX) HBO, ""Marvel's Daredevil"" on Netflix, and the upcoming ""Star Trek: Discovery"" on CBS (CBS) All Access. Then, once they're done watching all the episodes, they cancel and move on to another streaming service.Premium cable channels like HBO and Showtime have dealt with this for years, Swann said. People will sign up for big shows and cancel when the season is over, he said.""The same thing will happen to Netflix,"" Swann said. ""If you're a 'House of Cards' fan, you might cancel and wait for the new season to premiere.""With the growing number of streaming services, churn will be an issue as consumers experiment with different offerings, Brett Sappington, senior director of research for Parks Associates, told IBD.There were 101 subscription streaming video services available in the U.S. market as of March, Parks reported.Beyond major services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, there are a host of smaller niche services. They include NBCUniversal's comedy network Seeso, anime video service Crunchyroll and horror movie provider Shudder.At the end of 2015, about 20% of U.S. broadband households had canceled at least one over-the-top video service in the previous 12 months, Parks Associates said. Some 64% of U.S. broadband households subscribe to an OTT video service, the firm said.Netflix shouldn't be too worried about its recent increase in subscriber churn, Sappington said. It holds a commanding lead in subscribers (47 million in the U.S. alone in Q2) and has a solid track record for giving viewers what they want.""As over-the-top services mature, their churn rates tend to drop over time,"" he said. ""In fact, Netflix is the longest-running one, and it's got the lowest churn relative to the size of its base of customers among all of the services out there.""At the end of last year, 52% of all U.S. broadband households subscribed to Netflix, according to Parks. Some 5% of U.S. broadband households canceled Netflix in 2015, the research firm said.Besides offering popular content and competitive prices, there's not much streaming services can do to reduce churn. The phenomenon of consumers canceling streaming services and hopping to another one could continue for a few years, until the number of services is winnowed down, Swann said.Once the culling has finished, Netflix is almost certain to remain one of the leaders, both Swann and Sappington said.

302,DISH,"Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ESPN is said to be in talks with Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and other online distributors to feature its sports content, according to The Street, citing people familiar with the matter.Further specifics weren't provided, and sources told the outlet that an announcement is not necessarily expected from the negotiations.Shares of Disney dipped 0.3% to 99.88 on the stock market today. Amazon, which reported strong Prime Day sales, slid 0.75%. Facebook fell 1%. Facebook once again undercut a 117.09 buy point and closed just above its 50-day line.For the last year, the sports cable network and Disney moneymaker has faced scrutiny over worries about viewer migration away from traditional cable packages, particularly as services like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon Prime Video have gained steam.That has put Disney on the defensive -- and ESPN subscriber figures under the microscope. The media conglomerate has been exploring new platform providers for ESPN, and CEO Bob Iger said earlier in the year that Disney has seen positive signs from ESPN's inclusion in over-the-top bundles from Dish Network (DISH) and Sony (SNE) PlayStation. Both platforms contributed ""incremental"" subscribers for ESPN in Q2, he said in May.IBD'S TAKE: Walt Disney stock has been in a downtrend. Not coincidentally, so has earnings growth. Investors should turn the dial over to CBS, which has accelerating earnings and is trading just below a 57.99 buy point. For a detailed analysis of CBS, see IBD Stock Checkup.And Hulu, the over-the-top programmer jointly owned by Disney, Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox (FOXA), said in May that it is preparing a live-TV package that will feature live sports and news among its broadcast and cable channels. The service, which launches next year, is said to include ESPN and other Disney channels.RELATED:Disney Treasures This Netflix Rival, While ESPN Bleeding Slows

303,DISH,"Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) received its second stock downgrade in as many days on Wednesday.Investment bank Jefferies lowered its rating on Netflix stock to underperform from hold and cut its price target to 80 from 120, as analyst John Janedis assumed coverage of the company.On Tuesday, Needham downgraded Netflix stock to hold from buy.Netflix stock ended trading down 3.4% to 94.60 on the stock market today.""Although Netflix's runway will span multiple years, our research suggests the domestic subscriber growth trajectory may be somewhat flatter than the market's current expectations,"" Janedis said in a research report. ""While international will remain strong, we think the slowing U.S. market will pressure the stock's multiple.""Netflix is seeing more competition in the U.S. streaming market from the likes of Amazon.com (AMZN) and Hulu, compared to what it's seen in years past, Janedis said. Also, U.S. content owners are being more selective in licensing content to Netflix, he said.""The landscape will be much more competitive over the next 5-plus years,"" Janedis said.Netflix management has guided to a long-term target of 60 million to 90 million U.S. subscribers.

Comcast, the nation's No. 1 pay-TV operator, will soon offer direct access to Netflix through its broadband-based X1 set-top box.Comcast would offer Netflix through its ""triple play"" digital media platform, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein said in a report.""This demonstrates that the largest U.S. MSO (multiple system operator) has decided that Netflix will be a permanent media offering, and Comcast can benefit from a partnership in several ways,"" he said.First, since Netflix subscribers are heavy data users, Comcast can aggressively price its broadband data packages. Second, the integration of Netflix with the cable TV interface reduces the risk of cord-cutting. Third, Comcast likely will receive a bounty for new subscribers who sign up through its platform, Helfstein said.Helfstein rates Netflix stock as outperform.Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves called the Comcast-Netflix deal a ""win-win.""""For Netflix, this should reduce consumer friction and help support higher usage and subscriber levels,"" Hargreaves said in a report. ""For Comcast, the deal should improve its competitive position vs. virtual (multichannel video programming distributors like Sling TV from Dish Network (DISH)) and benefit demand for higher broadband tiers.""Hargreaves rates Netflix as overweight with a price target of 130.

304,DISH,"AT&T (T) stock slipped Friday after the telecom conglomerate late Thursday reported in-line Q2 earnings but light revenue, as it again lost wireless ""postpaid"" phone users and U-verse video subscribers despite growth at its satellite broadcaster DirecTV.On their earnings conference call with analysts, AT&T executives touted plans to take on Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN), Hulu, Dish Network (DISH) and others with a web TV offering, using DirecTV's programming.AT&T said Q2 adjusted earnings rose 3% to 72 cents per share, meeting estimates, while revenue rose 23%, including DirecTV, to $40.5 billion. Analysts had modeled revenue of $40.64 billion.AT&T said it shed 160,000 postpaid phone users, marking the sixth straight quarter of postpaid phone losses. Postpaid users have contracts and are more lucrative than pay-as-you-go prepaid users.""Results were again in line with expectations, though AT&T continues to lose postpaid phone customers and offset DTV additions with U-verse losses,"" Michael Bowen, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst said in a research report.AT&T shares rose 1.4% to 43.11 in the stock market today. The stock has been consolidating since reaching 43.89 on July 7, the highest since October 2001.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of AT&T and Verizon Communications jumped in the first half of 2016 as investors flocked to dividend-paying stocks amid falling global interest rates. AT&T has been a member of the IBD Big Cap 20 list of large-cap growth stocks that investors might want to consider.DirecTV added 343,000 video subscribers, but U-verse shrank by 391,000, resulting in a net loss of 49,000 video subscribers.John Stephens, AT&T's chief financial officer, on the call touted  plans to roll out a streaming-TV subscription offering, branded DirecTV Now, by year-end .AT&T aims to reverse wireless postpaid subscriber losses with an over-the-top (OTT) video offering, as well as offset continued subscriber losses in its landline, U-verse-branded TV service.Analysts seem upbeat on AT&T's plans.""Management spoke very highly of the much-awaited, Q4 OTT video product release, which is in line with our own bullish view,"" said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., in a report.""AT&T expects DTV Now to have very similar channel choices to what is currently offered on the traditional DTV platform,"" said Mike McCormack, an analyst at Jefferies. ""This could be the most compelling OTT offer in the market.""Jennifer Fritzsche, analyst at Wells Fargo, says stakes are big. AT&T acquired DirecTV for $49 billion in 2015.""We believe Q4 2016 will be the 'rubber meets the road' quarter, as we gauge the customer acceptance of the new over-the-top (OTT) plans,"" Fritzsche said.

305,DISH,"MoffettNathanson downgraded Dish Network (DISH) stock on views that neither AT&T (T) nor Verizon Communications (VZ) will buy Dish's radio spectrum at a hypothetical price tag of $30 billion, and that Dish's prospects for a merger with T-Mobile US (TMUS) have dwindled.While cash-rich Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN) have the money to acquire Dish Networks' spectrum, they will not make an offer, says analyst Craig Moffett, who downgraded the satellite TV broadcaster to sell, with a price target of 40. He says ""downward pressure on Dish shares will mount"" as investors realize an asset sale is a long shot.""We suspect that Dish's exit options are more tightly constrained than many believe,"" said Moffett in a research report. ""The option to buy their way out of their spectrum position by using their equity as currency (or acquire another company such as T-Mobile) may already be gone.""What is left is an outright sale -- leasing the spectrum to a suitor would be accounted for as a sale for balance sheet purposes, so it's a distinction without a difference. Dish's suitors (AT&T and Verizon) simply don't have the strong balance sheets many believe them to have.""Dish Network stock closed up 1.5% at 50.33 in the stock market today.The pay-TV company has amassed some 77 MHz of radio spectrum, spending some $15 billion in the process, but it lacks a wireless partner to deliver mobile video services over that spectrum.AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US have filed as bidders in a federal auction of airwaves now owned by local TV broadcasters. The auction, begun in late March, might drag on until Q4.Verizon and AT&T are also considered among the most likely buyers of Yahoo's (YHOO) core internet and advertising business. Yahoo's final round of bidding is expected to end in July.Moffett left open the possibility that Dish Network could forge a long-term spectrum leasing deal with AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile, though he said there are financial hurdles under that scenario as well.

329,DISH,"Federal regulators on Thursday proposed a cap on discounts given to small businesses when the government auctions off radio spectrum, in the wake of a review into Dish Network's (DISH) bidding practices with two partners in the recent AWS-3 auction.Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also proposed placing limits on bidding partnerships that can be formed during auctions.The FCC is reviewing whether to award Dish Network spectrum it won in the AWS-3 auction along with two bidding agents, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless. That airwaves auction ended in late January. Northstar and SNR spent $13.3 billion in the auction but received a 25% discount, lowering their bill to about $10 billion.AT&T (T) spent $18.2 billion in AWS-3, the most of any company, while Verizon Communications (VZ) spent $10.4 billion.The FCC on Thursday made no comment on the ongoing review of Dish Network.Wheeler said the proposed rules are aimed at preventing big companies from tapping a discount program intended for small businesses. The FCC plans another big spectrum auction in 2016 involving airwaves now owned by TV broadcasters.Wheeler's proposal would cap the discount for small businesses at $150 million and for rural service providers at $10 million for the 2016 auction.The FCC may vote on the proposal at its July 16 meeting.The Department of Justice, meanwhile, has sent the FCC a letter that could help T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) in the upcoming Broadcast Incentive Auction, says a report by Re/code.T-Mobile US, controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), and Sprint, majority owned by Japan's SoftBank, are pushing the FCC to set aside more spectrum for smaller wireless firms in the Broadcast Incentive Auction.The FCC has reserved for smaller firms 30 MHz of the expected 70-80 MHz of airwaves expected to be auctioned, but T-Mobile and Sprint are seeking 40 MHz.The FCC has been leaning against reserving more spectrum. TV broadcasters, who would sell spectrum in the auction, have voiced concern that bidding revenue would be lower if rules prevent AT&T and Verizon Communications from obtaining a large chunk of the airwaves, as IBD reported.

330,DISH,"ESPN parent company Walt Disney (DIS) has agreed to purchase one-third of Major League Baseball's digital business and take a four-year option to increase its stake to two-thirds, sources told Bloomberg.The reported deal would provide the media giant with access to an online streaming platform at a time when Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and other web-based programming have eroded its subscriber base.MLB Advanced Media, which handles online services from digital ticketing to sponsorships to live streams, says on its website that it distributes ""25,000 live events annually and 10 million streams daily,"" and that it has the resources to support ""millions of multi-platform subscribers and processes."" Paid streaming subscription services like MLB.tv and the WWE Network are MLB Advanced Media partners.The transaction with Disney is said to value the MLB company at $3.5 billion or so.Disney CEO Bob Iger has frequently been put on the defensive in recent quarterly earnings calls since last year's media market maelstrom, spurred by concern over the health of the pay-TV environment.But Disney, which also owns Marvel, Lucasfilm and the TV network ABC, appears to be exploring its online options.In the company's May earnings call, Iger told listeners that streaming service Hulu -- which it jointly owns with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal -- was an ""important investment"" and that Hulu's newly announced live-TV package was a ""best of cable approach"" between a skinny bundle and mega-cable package.ESPN has been bleeding subscribers, but its inclusion in streaming bundles -- such as Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and others -- could be linked to some ""very encouraging sign-ups,"" Iger said in May. Prior to that, he alluded in February to partnering ESPN with ""new platform providers.""Disney shares were up 0.2% on the stock market today. Netflix shares surged 5.7% on bullish analyst comments.

332,DISH,"Mergers and acquisitions involving wireless phone companies and the likes of Dish Network (DISH) and Comcast (CMCSA) could be on hold longer than expected, as the government auction of radio spectrum now owned by local TV broadcasters drags on.The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday disclosed first-stage results of the complex, so-called ""broadcast incentive""  TV auction. In the first stage of the auction, TV broadcasters agreed to give up spectrum in local markets, such as New York or Chicago, at set prices.While the FCC said that some 126 megahertz of spectrum will be available in the next stage of the auction, that's more airwaves than bidders are prepared to buy, analysts say. The proposed value of the 126 MHz of spectrum is $86.4 billion, based on prices for airwaves in local markets. TV broadcasters are seeking market valuations much higher than expected, at least according to Wall Street analysts that follow phone and cable companies.AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and cable TV leader Comcast have been among expected bidders. Upfront deposits are due Friday.Some analysts, however, say wireless firms might be interested in bidding on only 70 MHz to 80 MHz of spectrum, which would lower auction proceeds. If not enough bidders show up for the 126 MHz of spectrum, the FCC would lower the amount of airwaves available in follow-on rounds. The spectrum to be sold would be reduced from 126 MHz to 114 MHz at the next stage, and to 108 MHz, 84 MHz, 78 MHz, 72 MHz and 60 MHz in follow-on bidding rounds.The process could drag into 2017, some analysts speculate. The FCC has imposed a quiet period on bidders, banning strategic talks among them until the auction is over.TV broadcasters could walk away at any point if spectrum demand is too low or if bid prices don't meet their expectations. Wireless firms or Comcast, on the other hand, might not be able to cobble together enough national spectrum to meet their strategic needs.If the auction falls apart, Dish Network would be in a better position to sell its spectrum or form a partnership with a wireless firm such as Verizon, analysts say.""Wednesday's news suggest multiple stages, a protracted timeline and greater likelihood of a failed auction,"" UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a research report. ""Less spectrum in the wireless market would put upward pressure on spectrum valuation, a positive for holders such as Dish and Ligado Networks. Multiple stages will also prolong the quiet period and dampen any near-term strategic activity across the space.""Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins said in a research report that ""with the auction potentially going through multiple stages, it could last longer than the FCC's hoped-for 3Q/16 completion. If that were to happen, it would lengthen the time in which strategic discussions between bidders would be largely prohibited under the anti-collusion rules attached to the auction.""While registered bidders could get held up longer from strategic pursuits within the wireless category during an extended auction period, we believe the likelihood for less spectrum to be licensed at this band at better valuations could be positive for other holders of spectrum, including Dish.""Some auction estimates were as high as $60 billion in mid-2015, though most analysts have forecast spending in a range of $35 billion to $43 billion. But a different government spectrum auction that ended in early 2015 blew past estimates.Shares of Dish Network rose 0.9% to 52.40 on the stock market today. Comcast climbed 1.9% to 65.12, rising to a new high, clearing a consolidation going back to July 2015. AT&T advanced 1.6% to 43.21, further extended from an early June breakout. Verizon grew 1.4% to 55.84, a new high but still in buying range. T-Mobile US fell 0.4%.

333,DISH,"Comcast (CMCSA) stock Monday touched an all-time high for the fifth day in the past seven trading days, as an Oppenheimer analyst called the cable-TV and media company the ""most attractive"" large-cap telecom stock for the rest of 2016.Shares of Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, rose 0.45% to 67.41 in the stock market today. The benchmark S&P 500 index also hit an all-time high Monday.Comcast stock is up 19% in 2016, and the run isn't over, said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan in a research report.""We believe Comcast shares offer attractive upside despite the strong performance year to date,"" said Horan, Oppenheimer's telecom analyst.While Comcast's dividend yield is lower than AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ), the cable TV firm's stock rise comes amid falling interest rates globally, which has helped steady dividend-paying stocks.As of March 31, Comcast had $8.8 billion available under its share repurchase authorization. In Q1, Comcast paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of its own stock.Comcast is scheduled to report Q2 earnings on July 27.AT&T stock has jumped 23% in 2016, while Verizon stock is up 20%. AT&T fell 0.2% to 42.51 on Monday. Verizon rose 2 cents to 55.92, still in buy range.Comcast's rise comes despite regulatory headwinds. The Obama administration has been tough on cable-TV firms and internet service providers. Federal regulators thwarted Comcast's takeover of Time Warner Cable in 2015.Horan says ""reduced marketing spending"" by Dish Network (DISH), AT&T and Verizon is a plus for Comcast.""Cable's favorable competitive position in broadband, improving competitive position in video, and a hedge on inflation costs with NBC all offer catalysts for earnings growth,"" said Horan.

Netflix last year enabled in-app subscriptions for iOS users for the first time.“We think Charter, and perhaps even Comcast, could move to integrate Netflix into their video offerings,” Benjamin Swinburne, a Morgan Stanley analyst, wrote in a research report.He said there’s upside for Netflix if it can add “older demographics,” which he called a “key area where it remains under-penetrated.”While Comcast and Charter have been holdouts, Swinburne pointed out that Dish Network (DISH), Suddenlink, Cablevision Systems (CVC) and Verizon Communications (VZ) offer Netflix or Hulu apps.“We would expect Netflix to give up some economics, similar to other distribution partners like Apple or TiVo (TIVO), but we do not believe it would meaningfully alter the direction of Netflix profits over time,” Swinburne said. “Payments to distribution partners are reported in marketing expenses on Netflix's consolidated financials.”The Morgan Stanley analyst, though, says the cable TV firms might see a reduction in pay-per-view movie revenue if they integrate Netflix content into set-top boxes.Netflix stock, down about 12% in 2016, closed up 1.15% in the stock market today.

It's a good value proposition for the customer, and we'll continue to roll it out to other markets.""The Federal Communications Commission is likely curious about how Stream is doing in hard numbers, given that the agency has been asking questions about the Web service related to its net neutrality rules. The problem, according to critics, is that Comcast does not count its own Stream service toward the monthly data caps of its broadband customers. Comcast says the Stream service is not a net neutrality issue because the service uses IP technology over its own network, not the public Internet, to reach households.A federal court is expected to rule on the FCC’s net neutrality rules in April. The agency's clout could again be gutted -- or not, which might lead to more enforcement of the new net neutrality rules.Comcast joins Dish Network (DISH) in mashing new Web streaming video subscribers along with traditional pay TV customers in earnings reports. In Dish’s case, new subscribers to its $20-per-month Sling Web TV service have helped offset its loss of satellite TV customers.Dish discussed Sling subscriber additions for the first time when reporting Q2 earnings in early August. Sling had 240,000 subscribers as of June 30.Dish Network did not update Sling’s subscriber total when reporting Q3 earnings. Goldman Sachs has forecast that Sling could hit 2 million by the end of 2016.For Comcast, Stream numbers might be more material by the time it reports Q1 earnings. Comcast’s 89,000 video subscriber additions in Q4 were way up from 6,000 in the year-earlier period.Aside from launching Stream, Comcast has also stepped up its promotion of lower-priced skinny bundles, with fewer TV channels and broadband-first promotions to college students.Analysts say its deployment of  Internet-ready X1 set-top boxes and improved customer service have improved video subscriber results.On Comcast’s earnings call, Smit played down the impact of  lower-revenue skinny bundles. He said 75% of video subscribers added in the December quarter had “higher-end packages.”

414,DISH,"Celebrity chef Paul Prudhomme took pretension out of the kitchen and popularized Creole-Cajun cuisine.His view: “You don’t need a silver fork to eat good food.”The 13th child of a Louisiana sharecropper, he learned to cook as a tot stirring the pot for his mother. Prudhomme’s culinary school was 12 years traveling the U.S., taking kitchen jobs in truck stops, swank resorts and various spots in between. The Americana apprenticeship led Chef Paul back home.''I was struck by the reactions to my food from people all over the country. I began to understand how unique the traditional foods of my family were,” he wrote in “Chef Paul Prudhomme’s Louisiana Kitchen.”Drawing on those roots, Prudhomme (1940-2015) started a Cajun-Creole craze.It began at Commander’s Palace, New Orleans’ fine-dining jewel, where he became the restaurant’s first American executive chef in 1975.“Everybody believed you had to import a chef from France. With Paul, that mold was broken,” said Poppy Tooker, host of NPR-affiliated radio show “Louisiana Eats!”Chef Paul deftly mixed his down-home Cajun approach into the restaurant’s upscale Creole fare.“He was the reason the words Creole and Cajun got hyphenated,” Tooker told IBD. “What he was creating was the first American fusion food.”Four years later, Prudhomme opened his own Crescent City restaurant, called K-Paul’s Louisiana Kitchen. Lines stretched around the block for his signature dish -- blackened redfish -- and other specialties.A retail seasoning line followed, as did cooking shows on PBS, public appearances in the U.S. and abroad, and a string of cookbooks -- all raising Prudhomme’s stature as one of America’s first celebrity chefs.He never acted like an unapproachable luminary.Chef John Besh, author of “Besh Big Easy,” recalls Prudhomme as unfailingly generous.“He selflessly passed his television show on to me with the directions to continue to share our great cuisine and culture with the world,” said Besh, whose 12 restaurants celebrate Louisianan gastronomy. “He also carved the way for chefs to break out of the kitchen, into entrepreneurship, and called each of us to follow his example. We are all indebted to him and his leadership.”Born in Opelousas, La., Prudhomme was the son of Eli, a sharecropper who grew cotton and sweet potatoes. After the family’s youngest daughter left home, Paul, 7, was drafted into the kitchen.Every day, Prudhomme harvested roots and vegetables, tended barnyard animals and helped his mother, Hazel, prepare meals for the large family.“Cooking with her was like working for a small restaurant,” he wrote.He learned nuances, such as how the order of ingredients influenced a dish’s taste. “My mother was also a great storyteller, and she talked to me a lot about food -- its lore, the different kinds of food, and how they’re prepared.”Prudhomme decided to make a career of the kitchen. His first restaurant -- a hamburger stand outside Opelousas dubbed Big Daddy O’s Patio -- folded after nine months.Still determined to break into the business, the 17-year-old aspiring chef hit the road. With each new cooking job, he learned regional tastes and techniques, also sharing his own flavors. Some chefs, he felt, didn’t add enough spice.“I would yearn to season food, so I would mix up little packets of different herbs and spices, sneak them into the restaurants and use them as I cooked,” he wrote.Prudhomme never tired of sharing Louisiana’s flavors with diners up north.“At the same time, I would notice when I returned home for visits that my Cajun family and friends didn’t seem to recognize the uniqueness of their cooking,” he wrote.In 1970, Prudhomme returned to New Orleans, first working as a sous chef at Le Pavillon Hotel and later helping Clarence Dupuy open his restaurant, Maison du Puy. That’s where Prudhomme met waitress Kay Hinrichs. She became his second wife (Paul had been briefly married as a teen).By 1975, Commander’s Palace proprietors Ella and Dick Brennan had spotted something special in Prudhomme and hired him as their first non-European executive chef.The restaurant was already known for its white-tablecloth service and sophisticated Creole cuisine. Considered city cooking, Creole’s roots came from the kitchens of New Orleans’ upper-crust families, and its flavors were influenced by French, Spanish, Italian, American Indian and African chefs.The Cajun cooking that Prudhomme grew up with simply wasn’t found in New Orleans restaurants at that time. It was French country cooking -- simple and hearty -- and spiced with regional ingredients like bay leaves, peppers and file powder from the sassafras tree. No one had mixed the two styles -- Creole and Cajun -- until Prudhomme created a sensation with dishes like his andouille gumbo.“The result was an explosion of spectacular flavors and wonderful cooking that influenced the city, state, country and the world,” Ella Brennan said after Prudhomme’s death.In 1979, while still working at Commander’s Palace, Chef Paul and wife Kay opened K-Paul’s Louisiana Kitchen in the French Quarter. At the 64-seat eatery, reservations weren’t accepted, and celebrities and city workers sat side by side at communal tables.Prudhomme’s food was the star.This was where Chef Paul introduced blackened redfish -- colored with spices and seared for flavor -- which would become his signature dish. It was so popular, the local redfish population was temporarily depleted.To perfect his flavors, Prudhomme recalled his roots.“I couldn’t seem to get a potato to taste like my mother’s until I realized that it wasn’t anything that was done in the kitchen; it was just the freshness of the potato that made it completely different,” he wrote.Ahead of the farm-to-table trend, Prudhomme bought direct from local growers. Available ingredients dictated Chef Paul’s menu, which was written anew each day.To help home chefs replicate his dishes, Prudhomme launched Chef Paul’s Magic Seasonings in 1983. The line of spices, rubs, sauces and marinades sells globally.The Louisianan chef became a regular guest on “Good Morning America” and other TV shows in the 1980s. In 1986, the first of Prudhomme’s nine cookbooks became a New York Times best-seller. That same year, Kay was diagnosed with incurable lung cancer. She died seven years later at age 48.Prudhomme continued reaching into America’s kitchens via his 1995 PBS cooking show, “Chef Paul’s Fork in the Road,” and later “Chef Paul Prudhomme’s Always Cooking!” His catchphrase: “My mission is to make your dinner better.”A firm believer in hospitality and a helping hand, Prudhomme stepped up after Hurricane Katrina decimated New Orleans in 2005. He and his crew turned K-Paul’s into a relief center and prepared thousands of meals for military personnel and locals.“He cooked in the street. He hired a band,” Tooker said.In 2010, Prudhomme married Lori Bennett, his third wife. He’d struggled with his weight throughout his life and died last year at age 75.Over his distinguished career, Chef Paul spoke internationally, cooked for two presidential inaugurations (1985, 2005) and received several honors, including France’s Order of Agricultural Merit in 1980 and Bon Appetit’s Humanitarian Award in 2006.His greatest pride was serving fabulous food: “I came to realize that the joy of cooking Cajun and Creole food was not just that I appreciated its goodness so much, but that there was this great pleasure I got from watching other people eat it and seeing the joy in their eyes.”Created and popularized Cajun-Creole cuisine.Overcame: Lack of means and formal education, entrenched cooking traditions.Lesson: Learn the business, stay true to your roots, share what you know.“I think the most wonderful thing in the world is another chef. I'm always excited about learning new things about food.”

442,DISH,"As banks farm out more tech services and try to keep up with customers managing more of their money via their phones, Fiserv (FISV), a company that provides back-end technology to the finance industry, seems to be expanding at a solid, measured pace.Companies spilling over with triple-digit growth every quarter are drawing more adventurous investors, which is why many on Wall Street seem to like Fiserv’s steadiness. The company routinely generates single-digit sales gains and low-double-digit earnings growth, aided by share buybacks.Following the Fed’s rate hike last year and forecasts for fatter industry tech budgets, more of the same could be in store despite worries over a downturn and consolidation, the company and analysts say. That's due primarily to a steady income base.“When you have 85% of revenue recurring, it gives them a very good visibility into their numbers,” helping enable more accurate guidance and minimizing surprises when earnings season rolls around, Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Alexander Veytsman told Investor's Business Daily.“They do increase pricing, but given the longevity of those contracts and given the fact that these clients have been with them for a number of years, I would say they’re growing it slowly and steadily,” Veytsman said.The nature of the company’s contracts with clients helps Fiserv maintain its firm footing. Many deals are longer-term and retention is high, Morningstar notes in its research on the company. In addition, it’s costly and potentially hugely disruptive for financial companies to switch from one core-processing service to another, helping Fiserv keep customers in the fold.And even amid Wall Street’s hand-wringing over a possible recession, Chief Executive Jeffery Yabuki told IBD that he sees the trends in tech spending among Fiserv’s own clients continuing.""Most of our revenue is based on non-discretionary, mission-critical technologies under longer term contracts and is not subject to dramatic fluctuation,” he said via email. “We are seeing stable and growing demand for newer technologies that enhance experiences in the increasingly digital world.”Brookfield, Wis.-based Fiserv serves 13,000 banks, credit unions, retailers and other clients around the world. If you’ve withdrawn money from an automated teller or transferred a balance from one account to another, there’s a good chance it went smoothly in part because of Fiserv.Created in 1984 through a merger, Fiserv handles everything from transaction processing to data analysis to person-to-person payment systems. With this year’s technology spending seen growing 4%-5% among banks and credit-union customers -- Fiserv’s bread and butter -- the company is set to follow, Argus Research says.“We believe that Fiserv remains well positioned to benefit from technology infrastructure spending among its primary customers (banks and credit unions), many of whom are working to improve processing efficiency for online bill payment and debit card transactions,” Argus analyst Stephen Biggar said in a research note last month.“This should help revenue to keep rising at a modest mid-single-digit pace,” Biggar said, adding that Argus sees 5.5% in sales growth this year.Shares are up 25% over the past 12 months. The company has a Composite Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99, boosted most recently by its strong fourth-quarter results that were marked by better-than-expected operating margins.The company also has tried to stay relevant through acquisitions. In 2011, Fiserv snapped up mobile banking company M-Com and digital payments outfit CashEdge, which gave it Popmoney, a bank-based person-to-person payments system for participating institutions that has helped drive sales growth. The company in 2013 announced that it acquired Open Solutions, giving it real-time account-processing technology.“You don’t need a new product every day,” Biggar said, “but you need something fairly significant every 2-3 years that would have its own sort of life cycle.”Last month, Fiserv said the United Nations Federal Credit Union for U.N. employees, among the largest in the U.S. by assets, will begin using Fiserv’s core account-processing technology. Analysts say the Federal Reserve’s rate hike in December could help strengthen banks’ finances, potentially freeing up cash for their technology budgets.“We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade as good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend, as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape,” CEO Yabuki said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call last month.Some concern persists that Fiserv could make less money if consolidation continues within the banking industry, either due to tightening regulations or an event like the 2008 financial crisis. Mergers and acquisitions could reduce client count and give those bigger, combined companies more muscle in negotiating cheaper contract prices with companies like Fiserv.However, the reduction in clients hasn't materialized, Veytsman said, and the prospect of more banks bringing tech operations in-house seems unlikely. Fiserv counts Wells Fargo (WFC) among its big clients, potentially signaling a stronger shift to outsourcing among larger banks.Monness Crespi's Veytsman said consolidation could actually accelerate the trend of tech outsourcing.“When they consolidate they also look to see what’s happening with the bottom line and what they’re doing around the costs,” he said. “And if someone was not considering using Fiserv as a client, maybe together, they will.”Yabuki sees consolidation continuing, but stressed that the number of accounts and transactions has kept rising for the company.Foreign exchange amid a stronger dollar could also hurt the company, although its international exposure is limited, Veytsman said. Jack Henry & Associates and FIS are among the company’s primary competitors. Concern also lingers about Fiserv’s debt, although Yabuki cites the company’s $1-billion-plus free cash flow last year.Still, both Biggar and Veytsman say the company’s acquisitions have been relatively focused and restrained.And one might be forgiven for wondering whether a person-to-person service like Popmoney can compete with PayPal’s (PYPL) Venmo, or payment-tech offerings from Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and, potentially, Apple (AAPL).However, Yabuki said P2P was in the early innings. And Veytsman said Popmoney is intended more as a side dish in its offerings to midcap banks than a main course.""It’s very hard to challenge PayPal,” he said.

443,DISH,"Rovi (ROVI) stock jumped as much as 19% Friday to an 11-month high, following the company's fourth-quarter earnings late Thursday that beat estimates, as revenue growth reversed four straight quarters of deceleration.The focus now shifts to first-quarter performance and Rovi’s ability to renew licensing agreements with Comcast (CMCSA) and Dish Network (DISH).Rovi provides technology for interactive TV program guides licensed by AT&T (T), Comcast, Time Warner Cable (TWC), Dish and others, used for interactive TV guides and video-on-demand services. It also provides advertising services, including Big Data analytics that provides TV-audience insights and ad campaign management in various entertainment sectors.It posted Q4 revenue of $149.5 million, up 11% year over year and topping the consensus estimate of $130.7 million. It was the first time in five quarters that Rovi revenue accelerated. It reported earnings per share minus items of 65 cents, smashing estimates of 37 cents. That reversed four straight quarters of slower EPS growth.Rovi stock was up 14%, near 20.50, in afternoon trading in the stock market today.During Q4, Rovi renewed a technology licensing agreement with AT&T, which now includes the DirecTV footprint, for a seven-year term, in addition to a renewed licensing agreement with Sony (SNE).“In 2016, Rovi is focused on successfully renewing our IP Licenses with Comcast and Dish and on building our product portfolio,” Rovi CEO Tom Carson said in the earnings release. “We believe achieving these goals will help drive stockholder value for years to come.”While Rovi said it expects to successfully renew agreements with Comcast and Dish, its revenue and EPS from those agreements are not included in current estimates. Excluding revenue from Comcast and Dish, Rovi anticipates 2016 revenue of $490 million to $520 million and EPS less items of $1.35 to $1.65.Andy Hargreaves, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said the renewals with Comcast and Dish remain likely but are far from certain.""Rovi is in the latter stages of negotiations with Comcast and Dish, as the current deals expire over the next two months,” Hargreaves wrote in a research note. “Rovi’s history suggests it is more likely than not to complete the deals successfully, but a delayed negotiation or even a lawsuit remains highly possible, either of which could drive significant stock volatility.”

445,DISH,"Verizon Communications’ (VZ) spat with Walt Disney (DIS) over sports channel ESPN could be over.Verizon on Friday revamped its “Custom TV” programming packages for FiOS TV subscribers. Verizon FiOS now offers two standard bundles -- one with sports channels ESPN, Fox Sports and NBC Sports and one without them, according to a release.The “Essentials” package without sports has more popular entertainment channels.  Ray McConville, a Verizon spokesperson, said the new bundles still give customers the option of skipping sports. He said the Custom TV revamp had nothing to do with a dispute that flared in April between Verizon and Disney.When Verizon launched Custom TV, its $55 monthly base package for 35 channels excluded Disney’s ESPN, which garners the highest fees among cable networks. Disney sued Verizon claiming it doesn’t have rights to exclude its sports channel from TV bundles under programming deals.Verizon expanded the number of channels in both new packages. The new offering now cost $69.99, along with FiOS Internet and digital voice services.Following Verizon’s Q4 earnings call, analysts speculated that a Verizon-Disney resolution could be in the cards, as IBD reported.Disney, meanwhile, on its Q4 call commented on ESPN’s success as part of Dish Networks' (DISH) online TV service called Sling. Disney is exploring streaming deals with other companies.Disney’s ESPN is also not part of Comcast’s (CMCSA) over-the-top “Stream” TV service.Image provided by Shutterstock.

447,DISH,"JPMorgan is bullish on the upcoming “Broadcast Incentive Auction,” which will free up prime, low-frequency airwaves owned by local TV broadcasters for wireless data services.Naysayers continue to contend that the Federal Communications Commission faces many challenges in pulling off a successful auction, which for now is scheduled to start late next month. One risk is that broadcasters might drop out of the auction if they determine that bidding prices are disappointing.The auction is key for T-Mobile US (TMUS), which needs spectrum. AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) own most of the available low-frequency spectrum, in which waves travel longer distances, among other advantages over higher-frequency spectrum.JPMorgan expects at least 70 MHz of airwaves, and possibly more, to be auctioned. The key is that broadcasters that own two local TV stations will sell off airwaves from one and keep spectrum from the other, says JPMorgan.“We estimate that 70-100 MHz will be auctioned, for $25 billion to $35 billion,” said JPMorgan in a research report.Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) and CBS (CBS) are expected to sell airwaves in some markets. While Comcast’s (CMCSA) cable company is a potential bidder, it also owns media firm NBCUniversal, a likely seller of airwaves.Smaller local TV station owners include Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) and Gray Television (GTNA).“We view FOX and CBS as best positioned to monetize duopoly affiliates in large markets, followed by Comcast and Sinclair,” said JPMorgan. Walt Disney (DIS), which owns ABC, is not expected to sell airwaves. Private investment firms such as Columbia Capital are eyeing the auction, says a Washington Post report.JPMorgan predicts cable TV firms will show up, but it doubts that Internet giants will bid.""We expect that AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile will be the biggest bidders ($21 billion-$30 billion cumulative spend), that Sprint (S)/SoftBank (SFTBY) will not register, and Dish Network (DISH) will at most be an opportunistic buyer,"" said the JPMorgan report. ""We estimate Comcast, potentially in partnership with other cable companies, could spend $3 billion-$5 billion, and private equity funds in aggregate could spend $1 billion-$2 billion.""We do not expect digital economy players like Alphabet-Google (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN) to bid, though they can never be ruled out.”

456,DISH,"Can satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network reinvent itself like Netflix, the one-time DVD renter that became a streaming-video giant? Dish (DISH) founder and CEO Charlie Ergen was careful making comparisons on the satellite broadcaster's Q1 earnings conference call Monday, but Ergen said he expects Dish's fledgling Internet over-the-top video service Sling TV to one day provide significant revenue.""We're excited about where it's going to go,"" he said. ""I think it's going to be meaningful revenue.""Dish Network, which lost 134,000 video subscribers in Q1, isn't ready to say how many customers have signed up for the $20 monthly Sling service, launched in January.Sony launched its own OTT service this year, while Verizon Communications (VZ) is ramping up a mobile video service.Apple (AAPL) could join the mix by 2016, some analysts say.Content providers HBO andCBS (CBS) have also launched Web-only services.The services are dubbed OTT because they piggyback landline broadband services sold by other companies. Even if consumers don't buy a traditional pay-TV package, they still need broadband Internet to stream video.""The (early Sling) results are encouraging,"" Ergen said. ""We're really encouraged with it. We don't think it's a flash in the pan.""Netflix (NFLX), meanwhile, had 41.2 million U.S. streaming customers as of March 31 and only 5.6 million DVD-by-mail customers.Ergen concedes the conventional pay-TV market is mature. Dish had 13.84 million pay-TV customers at the end of Q1, down from 14.1 million a year earlier.Ergen says there are many technical and marketing challenges for Sling, which has suffered streaming setbacks during high-demand periods. Ergen says the economics of the streaming business are much different than broadcast TV.""This (OTT) is not as dramatic as perhaps what Netflix went through, but it's somewhat similar in the sense that when Netflix went from a DVD business in the mail to being able to deliver something instantly through the Internet, they started focusing on that (streaming) side of the business. I'm not saying that's going to happen here, but I do think that things like Sling TV are going to become more and more prevalent.""Ergen says that for the pay-TV industry, a generation of potential customers, millennials ages 18 to 34, are increasingly cancelling pay-TV service in favor of more affordable, on-demand content.Ergen expects pay-TV providers, including Dish, to continue adjusting the product bundles offered to consumers. Verizon recently sparked a fight with content firms, including Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN, over plans to offer consumers a new ""slim"" TV package for its landline FiOS pay-TV service.""Linear pay television business probably peaked a couple of years ago,"" Ergen said. ""But it's not declining as fast as I would have thought it would.""Ergen says pay-TV companies have gained some negotiating clout over content firms as consumers resist price hikes. Contract disputes with content providers contributed to Dish's Q1 subscriber losses as unhappy customers cancelled service. Dish's programming dispute with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) ended in mid-January.In Q1, Dish said it earned 76 cents per share as programming expenses and customer acquisition costs fell. Revenue rose 3.6% to $3.72 billion. Analysts had modeled EPS of 40 cents on sales of $3.74 billion.Average revenue per monthly pay-TV subscriber edged up 4% in Q1 to $86 from $82.36 in Q1 2014.Some analysts question Ergen's strategy of amassing radio spectrum with no apparent buyers of those airwaves — or a strategic wireless partner — in sight.In a recent airwaves auction, Dish achieved its main goal: securing licenses in major markets in order to pressure wireless firms such as Verizon or T-Mobile to negotiate, some analysts say.Ergen said T-Mobile remains a potential partner.""We're keeping all our options open, and we admire what (CEO John Legere) and his team have done with T-Mobile,"" Ergen said.

457,DISH,"AT&T (T) CEO Randall Stephenson on Monday said new federal net neutrality rules will be short-lived, though some analysts say they may last long enough to be a factor in approval of the DirecTV Group acquisition.Referring to the next presidential election, Stephenson said: ""Administrations change and we're 18 months away from a different FCC and you're a three-two vote away from these rules being modified and improved.""AT&T and telecom trade groups on May 13 asked a federal court to block the Federal Communications Commission from carrying out stricter net neutrality rules until lawsuits challenging the rules are decided.""We actually believe that the court challenge to this is quite strong and there's a reasonable probability that these rules get modified in some level and in the courts,"" said Stephenson, speaking at a JPMorgan conference in Boston.The FCC, however, may ask AT&T to accept net neutrality-related merger conditions to win approval of its purchase of DirecTV.Analysts expect regulators to decide on the AT&T-DirecTV deal in June. The two companies on Friday extended their merger agreement. AT&T announced its $48.5 billion purchase of DirecTV (DTV) in May 2014.Netflix (NFLX), Dish Network (DISH), and Cogent Communications (CCOI) are among companies asking federal regulators to require AT&T to comply with stricter net neutrality rules for Internet service providers for up to seven years after the DirecTV deal is approved.The FCC in February voted 3-2 along party lines to regulate ISPs such as Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T under what Chairman Tom Wheeler called modernized public utility, Title II rules. Net neutrality rules will apply to wireless networks for the first time.Comcast in 2011 agreed to net neutrality rules as part of conditions in its acquisition of NBCUniversal from General Electric (GE).Stephenson said Congress may pass net neutrality legislation if court challenges fail.""If I believed the rules that were passed by the FCC on Title II were going to be the rules of the land for the next five to 10 years, it would have a dramatic impact on how we thought about investment,"" Stephenson added. ""We actually have a certain degree of conviction that this will not be the rules of the land in the long term.""AT&T shares were up 1.4% to 34.81 by midafternoon in the stock market today.

Shares of Disney closed down 3.8% Wednesday. Here are five takeaways from Iger's sometimes exasperated comments on ESPN and Disney's plans to adapt to…
"
468,DISH,"Walt Disney’s (DIS) first-quarter results trounced expectations as “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” boosted the studio and consumer products segments, though the media and entertainment giant continued to lose subscribers for its cable channels.But Disney CEO Robert Iger said Tuesday that ESPN, which lost 7 million subscribers in the last two years, has “actually seen an uptick” in subscribers in recent months, and has benefited from the growth of light cable packages, particularly from Dish (DISH).In what amounted to a vigorous defense of ESPN during a conference call, Iger said skinny bundles with the sports cable channel had even wooed cord cutters back. The idea that ESPN is cratering is “ridiculous,” he said. “Sports is too popular.”Disney shares fell 3% late.Iger also clarified the reason behind ESPN’s subscriber decline, blaming faulty Nielsen figures. Once Nielsen corrected those numbers, “we concluded that our sub loss was largely due to the fact that ESPN was not part of skinny bundles that had launched,” he said.He said Disney is exploring “new platform providers,” hinting at more over-the-top, or streaming, options for ESPN.Revenue from Disney’s media networks division, which includes ESPN, grew 8% in fiscal Q1. The segment logged higher ad revenue, offset by lower ratings. Higher programming costs weighed on the sports cable channel, due to the timing of the College Football Playoff bowl games, but that was partially offset by an increase in ad and affiliate revenue, said the company.""Affiliate revenue growth was due to contractual rate increases, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts,"" Disney said in a statement.The hubbub over ESPN comes amid industry-wide concerns that cable viewers are taking their dollars elsewhere — namely, to Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Prime and other over-the-top streaming services.During the quarter, adjusted earnings climbed 28% to $1.63 a share, well above views for $1.45 per share. Revenue grew 14% to $15.24 billion vs. consensus estimates for $14.75 billion.“Driven by the phenomenal success of ‘Star Wars,’ we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in the history of our company, marking our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth,” said Iger in a statement.“The Force Awakens” crossed the $2 billion threshold in global box office sales over the weekend. Studio revenue skyrocketed 46%, year over year.Disney’s theme park and resorts segment revenue rose 9%, said the company. Consumer products and interactive media revenue rose 8%.Earlier Tuesday, Viacom (VIAB) shares tanked 21.5% after the media company logged its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue declines and Q1 revenue fell short of expectations.Earnings fell 8.5% to $1.18, in line with consensus estimates, as sales fell 6% to $3.15 billion, below analysts’ forecasts for $3.26 billion.Viacom's filmed entertainment revenue tumbled 15% on theatrical and home-entertainment revenue declines. Media-networks revenue fell 3% as domestic ad revenue dropped 4% and ratings declined.

Netflix on Jan. 6 announced its expansion to 130 new countries, bringing its total to 190 countries worldwide. The same day, CFO David Wells brought up Bitcoin during a Q&A at a Citigroup investor conference in Las Vegas.Satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), Dell, Expedia (EXPE) and Overstock.com (OSTK) are among U.S. companies that accept bitcoin in transactions.Netflix, meanwhile, faces challenges as it expands its video streaming service globally. Acquiring content rights is a biggie, but payments and pricing are other issues. Netflix plans to roll out its service in China later this year.Netflix accepts payments in some local currencies, Wells noted at the Citigroup conference. The Netflix CFO says Netflix has aimed to keep pricing comparable to the U.S., where its service starts at $8 monthly.Wells says it's possible that Netflix may offer wireless-only subscriptions in some countries where mobile broadband is actually faster than fixed-line Internet services.Wells says Netflix aims to keep its log-in procedure and payment systems as simple as possible as it expands to more countries.""The world in general from an e-commerce perspective is balancing security and fraud detection with friction-less sign-up,"" Wells said.Bitcoin, a decentralized, peer-to-peer, digital-payment network, is not designed for recurring payments and the digital currency is non-refundable. Still, it may work better in the future with payment systems such as PayPal (PYPL), some analysts say.""You have to authenticate, you have to make sure you have the right person, the right bank account, but you don't want to run people through a 20-step process, because that's not going to work,"" Wells added.Wells has learned from rolling out its service in markets such as Mexico, Brazil and parts of Europe, he says.""Payments are becoming more of a global world,"" said the CFO. ""You still have central banks. We'll see where we go from here in the next 10, 15 years. Countries still want to hold onto their monetary policy.

503,DISH,"Setting aside more radio spectrum for Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) in an upcoming government auction of airwaves for wireless services could endanger a successful auction, says consulting firm Recon Analytics.The Federal Communications Commission risks rattling TV broadcasters, who would sell spectrum in the auction, by creating rules that prevent AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) from bidding on a large chunk of the airwaves, says Roger Entner, founder and lead analyst of Recon.""The fewer the restrictions, the smaller the set-asides, the more revenue will be generated during the auction,"" Entner said. ""This is a particularly important consideration for the incentive auction where the demands of the broadcasters will have to be met before the U.S. treasury will get its cut.""Both Sprint and T-Mobile have enough spectrum on a per-subscriber basis, weakening their case for government policy that would tilt auction rules in the favor, said Entner in a blog post Thursday.""Perhaps a better idea than giving more spectrum to T-Mobile and Sprint at a discount would be to make 20 MHz available for small rural operators,"" he wrote.T-Mobile US, controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), and Sprint, owned by Japan's SoftBank, are pushing the FCC to set aside more spectrum for smaller wireless firms in the Broadcast Incentive Auction. The FCC has reserved for smaller firms 30 MHz of the expected 70-80 MHz of airwaves expected to be auctioned.T-Mobile, Sprint and some consumer groups are seeking 40 MHz instead of 30.""One should not be fooled into thinking that T-Mobile and Sprint are weak sisters who would not otherwise be able to compete,"" said Entner.AT&T and Verizon spent nearly $29 billion combined in the AWS-3 auction that ended in January. AWS-3 raised nearly $45 billion. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) also was a major buyer.Goldman Sachs recently estimated that the big four U.S. wireless firms and Dish Network own spectrum cumulatively valued at $368 billion.

504,DISH,"Time magazine has singled out White House strategist Steve Bannon for its Darth Vader cover treatment. Shown is a picture of Bannon looking like a Marvel Comics villain and the title ""The Great Manipulator."" Bannon dared to identify the liberal media as ""the opposition party."" Time took offense and demonstrably proved him right.Demonizing the president's aides is something Time and its liberal ilk have not done to Democrats since the days of President Jimmy Carter, when Time was liberal but not nearly as leftist as it is today. At this point eight years ago, the same magazine was profiling President Obama's aide Larry Summers as the ""brash and brilliant economic advisor,"" the ""economic wunderkind ... moving at flank speed"" who speaks with ""an almost poetic clarity.""Obama was always center stage. No evil wizard manipulated him from behind the curtains. That only happens under apparently ""manipulated"" dolts like President Reagan, President George W. Bush and now, President Trump.The new article is headlined ""The second most powerful man in the world? Steve Bannon has the President's ear. But he wants more."" For Trump, Bannon is ""a director who deploys ravenous sharks, shrieking tornadoes and mushroom clouds as reliably as John Ford shot Monument Valley.""Decades ago, Time shredded the notion that it is a news magazine, steadily becoming evermore politicized. It's a badly disguised journal of rampaging liberal opinion. But it is a stubborn pretender. It insists that its brand of liberal advocacy passes as acceptably objective inside today's news business, and it's right, of course.Time managing editor Nancy Gibbs unfurled a nasty gram at Bannon in her ""From the Editor"" letter up front. She cited Bannon's ""opposition party"" comment and then spat, ""To demonize the press, to characterize it as not just mistaken but malign, is to lay the groundwork for repression.""These people dish out criticism, but wow, are they incapable of taking it. Criticize Trump, and you are Honorable Dissent. Criticize the media, and you are Nazi Dictatorship.Gibbs thinks her magazine is serenely centrist and objective, which makes her a fool. Lest anyone take offense, consider the alternative: If not a fool, she'd be a raging liar. She boasts: ""At a time when the media is ever more fractured and siloed, and much of it partisan on both sides, TIME is one of the few remaining institutions that speaks to a broad and global audience. ... Our purpose is not to tell people what to think; it is to help them decide what to think about.""Someone should please make an appointment to meet with Ms. Gibbs for two minutes and simply show her the Time cover of Trump's face melting, and the cover of Trump's face melting into a puddle. Is one not to conclude a wee bit of hostility toward Trump? How traumatically gullible does Time think America is?This kind of bloviation is especially nonsensical coming from Gibbs. Take her valentine to Obama after his first victory. She placed him on par with Christ, saying: ""Some princes are born in palaces. Some are born in mangers. But a few are born in the imagination, out of scraps of history and hope."" What a bottle of ipecac.Then there's Gibbs on President Bill Clinton during the Monicagate scandal. She said: ""In the gaudy mansion of Clinton's mind there are many rooms with heavy doors, workrooms and playrooms, rooms stuffed with trophies, rooms to stash scandals and regrets. He walks lightly amid the ironies of his talents and behavior, just by consigning them to different cubbies of his brain. It's an almost scary mind, that of a multitasking wizard.""Put a cork in it. The jig has been up for 30 years. No one's buying the outraged protests of nonpartisanship. What Time is claiming to be news is the very definition of fake news.Bozell is the president of the Media Research Center. Graham is director of media analysis at the Media Research Center and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.RELATED:The Real 'Fake News' Comes From The Mainstream MediaMedia Misreport Gallup Poll Results About Trump's AbilitiesGot Fake News?

505,DISH,"Akamai Technologies' (AKAM) network security business is expected to be a bright spot when the company reports Q4 earnings after the market close Tuesday.Akamai's earnings per share minus items in the December quarter are expected to fall 5% year over year to 68 cents, with revenue rising 4.5% to $605 million.In the current quarter, analysts are modeling 1% EPS growth to 67 cents and revenue climbing 6.5% to $605 million.Akamai is the biggest provider of content delivery network, or CDN, services, which increase the speed of e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices.Several big customers, including Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), have shifted some of their traffic to internal networks, slowing Akamai's revenue growth. Akamai stock jumped nearly 27% in 2016 just the same.Akamai stock remains near a buy zone after breaking out of a cup-with-handle at a 69.36 buy point a month ago. Shares rose 0.23% to 69.71 in the stock market today. It's trading just above its 50-day moving average, last week passing a couple tests of that line.IBD'S TAKE: While revenue growth is harder to come by for Akamai these days, the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks includes fast-growing Nvidia, GrubHub and Netease. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital, estimates that Akamai's security business revenue rose 46% in Q4 to $106 million. ""Security is becoming an increasingly meaningful part of the financial story, accounting for 16% of revenue in Q3,"" said Mahaney in a research report.Akamai in December bought Cyberfend for an undisclosed amount, continuing its acquisitions of computer security firms.""Concern over whether additional top media customers will migrate off Akamai remains a potential future overhang on the stock,"" added Mahaney.Akamai's top six internet platform accounts (Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple, Facebook, Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Netflix (NFLX) accounted for 10% of its revenue in Q3, down from 17% in the year-earlier quarter, analysts say.AT&T (T) launched its DirecTV Now video streaming service in late November.""We believe Akamai has been serving as the primary CDN provider for Direct TV Now, although we are admittedly unsure on how much revenue Akamai has generated from it,"" said Colby Synesael, a Cowen & Co. analyst, in a report.RELATED:Akamai Security Business Shines, Offsets Apple, Facebook ShiftDish Network Taps Netflix As Streaming Battle Heats UpWill The Launch Of AT&T DirecTV Now Herald Net Neutrality's End?

Comcast stock also is trading near an all-time high. Learn more about T-Mobile and Comcast at IBD Stock Checkup.Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman, in a research report Tuesday, called T-Mobile the likely ""big winner"" in the government's auction of radio spectrum of airwaves controlled by TV broadcasters. T-Mobile likely gained the spectrum it needed at a lower price than estimated, he said.HSBC, meanwhile, upgraded Comcast (CMCSA)and Verizon Communications (VZ)to buy and initiated coverage on Charter Communications (CHTR) with a hold rating.Comcast has also been viewed as a possible suitor for T-Mobile, which is controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY).Comcast stock, which on Friday hit a record high just under 73, edged up a fraction Thursday to 72.61. It's extended from its November breakout at a buy point of 68.46.The Federal Communications Commission's auction of airwaves brought in about $18.2 billion in bids, more than the latest $10 billion asking price of TV broadcasters. Broadcasters stand to get their $10 billion, while other proceeds will cover costs tied to ""repacking"" the spectrum for wireless services or go to the U.S. treasury.T-Mobile had estimated it could spend $8 to $10 billion in the auction alone. Analysts expect that Verizon and AT&T (T) bid less than forecast. One hitch for T-Mobile is that the TV spectrum might not be ready for wireless services until 2020.Bidders were barred from taking part in strategic talks until the auction closes, which BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk says could be in late February. Telecom firms may be free to resume M&A talks by mid-March, he says. Goldman Sachs says the FCC's quiet period might not be over until the end of March.""With the close of the auction, attention should quickly turn to M&A, which has largely been prohibited during the auction, for registered participants,"" Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack said in a research report. ""We expect investors to focus on Sprint, T-Mobile, and Dish Network (DISH) as targets, with Comcast, Charter, and Verizon viewed as potential acquirers.""Dish stock rose 0.54% Thursday to 61.68, near a 13-month high of 62.97 touched on Friday.RELATED:Cash Key In SoftBank-Sprint 'Knockout' Offer For T-Mobile?Would T-Mobile Spurn Debt-Laden Sprint For Comcast Offer?Verizon M&A Talk Swirls; Charter Stock Up, Yahoo Down 
"
507,DISH,"Sprint (S)-owner SoftBank Group could muster a knockout offer for T-Mobile US (TMUS) that would thwart any counter bid by cable TV firms such as Comcast (CMCSA), says New Street Research.Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at U.K.-based New Street Research, says debt-laden SoftBank would need to pump a lot of cash into any Sprint offer for T-Mobile to get a controlling stake in a merged company.T-Mobile, which is majority owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), has a market valuation of $48 billion after a steep runup in 2016. T-Mobile shareholders would expect a premium, with bids by satellite TV firm Dish Network, cable companies or perhaps even a cable-consortium possible, New Street said in a research report published Sunday.In a ""knockout"" scenario, Sprint could offer about $47 billion in cash and $22 billion in equity, for a combined $69 billion, not including deal synergies, says Chaplin.""In this scenario, we assume an offer price of $80 per share,"" said Chaplin in a report. ""We would consider this a knockout bid; it would be tough for a cable company, Dish Network (DISH) or some other interloper to table a more compelling offer.""IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock jumped in late 2016 on speculation that it could merge with Sprint during a Trump administration. But short interest in T-Mobile doubled in December. Learn more about T-Mobile at IBD Stock CheckupJapan-based SoftBank seems to be setting the stage for another run at merging Sprint with T-Mobile US. In meeting with President-elect Donald Trump last month, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has promised to up U.S. investments and create jobs.Mergers between cable TV and wireless companies has picked up in Europe, and Deutsche Telekom might prefer Comcast as a suitor for T-Mobile, some analysts say. The deals are aimed at creating multiproduct bundles and network synergies.Media baron John Malone last week said Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR) and other cable TV firms could bid successfully for T-Mobile.SoftBank owns 83% of Sprint, while Deutsche Telekom owns two-thirds of T-Mobile.T-Mobile has openly courted cable TV partners on its earnings calls. But amid intensified wireless competition, the most profit-margin-friendly deal remains a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, many analysts say.Such a deal, though, would reduce the number of national wireless firms from four to three. The Obama administration blocked AT&T's (T) proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying it wanted to retain a four-player national market of AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Communications (VZ).Chaplin speculates that a combined Sprint and T-Mobile would sell off some 50 MHz of spectrum to garner regulatory approval as well as raise cash.Sprint stock edged up 4 cents in the stock market today to 8.65. The company's market cap is $34 billion. T-Mobile stock fell 14 cents to 57.05.RELATED:Would T-Mobile Spurn Debt-Laden Sprint For Comcast Offer?Verizon M&A Talk Swirls; Charter Stock Up, Yahoo Down

541,DISH,"A long-overdue refresh to the Apple TV set-top box reportedly will feature a radically redesigned remote control. The new remote will use a touch pad for scrolling around and include just two physical buttons, the New York Times reported Monday. It also will be slightly thicker than the current remote control, which has a click wheel and two other buttons.The new Apple TV and remote control are expected to be unveiled at Apple's (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference, which runs June 8-12 in San Francisco.Other rumors about the next-generation Apple TV point to it using Siri voice search and controls as well as an App Store.Apple also is believed to be working on its own over-the-top Internet TV service to compete with similar offerings from Dish Network (DISH), Sony (SNE) and others.Apple hasn't significantly updated the Apple TV box since a third-generation model debuted in March 2012. The device today allows owners to stream such third-party services as Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu Plus, as well as access content from Apple's iTunes store. It competes with devices from Roku, Google (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and others.Last month, Apple was the first streaming device vendor to offer Time Warner's (TWX) HBO Now service.During Apple's fiscal second-quarter earnings conference call with analysts on April 27, Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted at things to come regarding television.""HBO Now has been incredibly popular with Apple TV users since its debut, and it has been one of the top downloaded apps on the U.S. App Store as well,"" Cook said. ""We're marrying their great content with our great product and ecosystem. And it's clear from looking at the early returns ... that there's a lot of traction in there.""Asked about Apple's next steps for Apple TV, Cook played coy.""We're in the early stages of just major, major changes in media that are going to be really great for consumers, and I think Apple could be a part of that,"" Cook said.RELATED:Apple building new set-top box for its Internet TV service.

542,DISH,"Comcast says that it's in no rush to launch a national Internet video service now that regulators have thwarted its merger with Time Warner Cable, which would have created a coast-to-coast cable TV giant.On its Q1 earnings conference call with analysts early Monday, Comcast (CMCSA) said that it is focused on expanding its ""X1"" service platform. Had regulators approved the Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger, Comcast's interest in licensing the X1 platform to other cable TV firms would have gained momentum, analysts say.Philadelphia-based Comcast aims to reverse video subscriber losses and boost cable TV revenue by rolling out X1 technology.Spending Will RiseMore than a set-top box, X1 is an advanced video operating system that gives users the option of watching traditional TV as well as on-demand, recorded and online video. No. 1 cable firm Comcast has invested heavily in cloud-based technology and told analysts on Monday that it expects its capital spending to rise, including spending at its subsidiary NBCUniversal.Analysts say that the X1 platform is well-suited as the foundation for an OTT, or over-the-top, Internet video service. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) and consumer electronics firm Sony (SNE) launched OTT products this year. Verizon Communications (VZ) is ramping up a mobile video service. And Apple (AAPL) could join them by 2016, some analysts say.The services are dubbed OTT because they piggyback on landline broadband services sold by other companies. Even if consumers don't buy a traditional pay-TV package, they still need broadband to stream video.Comcast executives say that Comcast isn't ready to roll out an OTT product, which would make the company a national competitor via broadband lines.""X1 acceleration is core to our plans,"" said Neil Smit, CEO of Comcast's cable division.Even without TWC, Comcast's cable network reaches nearly 55 million U.S. homes and businesses.Comcast disclosed on the earnings call that about 2.5 million of its ""triple play"" customers — those who buy a bundle of TV, Internet and phone services — now use X1 set-top boxes.Comcast has 22.37 million video subscribers, having lost 8,000 in Q1, compared with a gain of 24,000 in the year-earlier period.""In terms of over-the-top, we feel very comfortable in our footprint, we've got a lot of penetration still to go, and we'll be focusing there,"" Smit said.Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said that the company is in talks with content companies about expanding distribution to mobile devices both inside and outside of homes.""I think the ecosystem is always evolving,"" Roberts said. ""We'll have more to talk about as we go forward, but right now getting X1 rolled out, I think, is still the best opportunity in the company in the very short run, and that's what we're focused on.""Some observers speculate that Comcast could bid for T-Mobile US (TMUS), controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), though not until the Obama administration ends.Analysts say that while Comcast has expanded its public Wi-Fi network, it faces a long-term threat from the pending merger of AT&T (T) and DirecTV Group (DTV). AT&T has plans to whisk mobile video to smartphones over its 4G wireless network.Google Latest MVNOComcast has options. It already holds rights to lease network capacity from Verizon or Sprint (S) under earlier deals. In the industry, wholesale agreements are called MVNOs, or mobile virtual network operator. Google (GOOGL) last month joined the MVNO ranks, launching a wireless service that leases network capacity from both Sprint and T-Mobile.""In the wireless space, we've been spending a bit, building out our Wi-Fi network, (where) we've got 8.6 million hot spots,"" Smit said on the call. ""We have the MVNO agreements with Sprint and Verizon. We don't have anything to announce right now, we're still working on our wireless strategy.""Comcast said that its Q1 earnings minus items rose 16% to 79 cents, topping views. The company raised its 2015 stock repurchase program by nearly 60% to $6.75 billion. Revenue rose 2.6% to $17.9 billion, also topping Wall Street consensus estimates. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled EPS of 74 cents on revenue of $17.4 billion.

543,DISH,"At the end of every year, business journalists and Wall Street analysts sit down and write up their boldest predictions for mergers and acquisitions in the coming year. And like the people shown riding hoverboards in YouTube videos, they're likely to fall on their butts.Tech M&A predictions are often wrong because they're born out of wishful thinking. They ignore market realities, CEO personalities and other factors that can make such deals tough to pull off.But they're fun to consider. So with that in mind, here's a roundup of the boldest predictions for tech company mergers and acquisitions in 2016.Apple Buys Tesla MotorsApple (AAPL) is rumored to be working on an electric car and it could ""dramatically accelerate"" those efforts if it bought Tesla Motors (TSLA), says Aaron Task, digital editor at Fortune magazine.""With over $200 billion cash on hand, the iPhone maker has more than ample resources to absorb the purchase, especially now that some of the bloom has come off Tesla's once-rosy stock,"" Task wrote. ""In addition to its automobile know-how, Apple gets access to Tesla's battery, which CEO Elon Musk claims can help change 'the entire energy infrastructure of the world.'""Plus, Musk would be a worthy heir to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and would be ideally suited to be Apple's futurist, chief technologist and CEO-in-waiting, Task said.AT&T Buys YahooWeb giant Yahoo (YHOO) will be sold to telecom powerhouse AT&T (T), mirroring Verizon's (VZ) acquisition of AOL earlier in the year, predicts Chris Ciaccia, technology editor at TheStreet.""Yahoo's purchase of BrightRoll could help AT&T with its reported streaming service, as it seeks to have ads inserted into it,"" Ciaccia wrote. ""There are other players for Yahoo, like a media company or a private equity firm, but AT&T just makes too much sense to me.""GoPro Sold To Larger Tech FirmWith GoPro's (GPRO) stock depressed, a larger technology firm is likely to sweep in and buy the maker of action cameras, according to Orange Peel Investments.""With zero debt and $513 million in cash, the company has a clean slate for an LBO to come in, whisk them off their feet and take advantage of the company's ability to lever,"" the firm said in a post on Seeking Alpha. ""The obvious acquiring party in this transaction would be a larger technology or electronics outfit, such as an Apple, Samsung or Microsoft (MSFT). They could use the company's brand in a way similar to how Apple is using Beats. They could continue to have the brand name separate from the core brand and then eventually vertically integrate the two companies for future projects.""Comcast Will Try To Buy NetflixIn a prediction out of left field, Yahoo Tech editor Dan Tynan believes cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) will try to acquire Internet TV service Netflix (NFLX) or possibly vice versa.""Whether or not you're a cord-cutter, streaming media is the future of entertainment — and nobody streams bigger than Netflix, which accounted for nearly 40% of all Internet traffic last year. Since Big Cable can't beat the streamers at this game, the only thing left is for it to join them by acquisition,"" Tynan wrote. ""Comcast ($192 billion valuation) and Netflix ($42 billion) are the most logical candidates for an arranged marriage. While it stands to reason that the larger company will swallow the smaller one, it's not inconceivable that the reverse will happen — not unlike AOL's acquisition of Time Warner 15 years ago, but perhaps with better results.""Apple Buys A Movie StudioVariety magazine's writers and editors are predicting a lot of M&A activity in Hollywood in 2016. Most notably, they think Apple will buy a movie studio to support its goals for a subscription Internet video service.""With more than $200 billion in cash on hand, the Cupertino colossus is poised to rewrite the rules of the media game,"" the Variety staff wrote. ""Viacom (VIAB) or HBO might seem the likeliest prey, but Sony (SNE) is a juicier target, given the mix of hardware and programming under its hood.""Variety thinks Chinese Internet giant Alibaba Group (BABA) also is interested in buying a Hollywood player. Possible targets for Alibaba include Viacom, CBS (CBS), Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF) and DreamWorks Animation.However, John Malone is most likely to snap up Lions Gate and merge it with cable channel Starz (STRZA), Variety said.Time Warner (TWX), parent of HBO and Warner Bros., could become an M&A target in 2016, Variety said. One likely bidder would be 21st Century Fox (FOXA), the trade paper said.Intel Or Qualcomm Buys InvenSenseU.K.-based research firm CCS Insight makes a lot of annual tech industry predictions, including some about mergers and acquisitions.It predicts that Intel (INTC) or Qualcomm (QCOM) will acquire InvenSense (INVN) in 2016.""The acquisition follows a large fall in the market capitalization of InvenSense in the second half of 2015,"" CCS Insight said in a report. ""Its purchaser recognizes the opportunity to snap up InvenSense's assets in sensor technology. As sensors take on greater importance in the Internet of Things and wearable devices, the buyer integrates InvenSense's technology into a wider range of semiconductors.""CCS Insight also predicts that Samsung will acquire chipmaker GlobalFoundries by 2017.""GlobalFoundries is currently struggling to compete against Intel, Samsung and TSMC (TSM),"" it said. ""Chip manufacturing becomes increasingly capital- and scale-intensive, with huge pressure on capacity as demand balloons for silicon for the Internet of Things. Samsung's foundry business accounts for a growing proportion of the company's profit, and the acquisition helps cement Samsung's position in this area.""Dish Network Gets MarriedDish Network (DISH) will merge with someone in 2016, says Phillip Swann, president of TVPredictions.com.""The nation's second-largest satellite TV service needs help to stay competitive, and that assistance can only come from a merger,"" Swann wrote. Possible merger partners include T-Mobile (TMUS), Verizon, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.""Out of full disclosure, I have predicted in the past that Dish will merge with someone, and it hasn't happened yet,"" Swann said. ""But this time, well, this time I really think it will happen.""RELATED:Apple 2016 Predictions: Acquisitions, Accessories.Cloud, Virtual Reality Among Top Tech Trends For 2016.

545,DISH,"T-Mobile US' (TMUS) stock has hit a rough patch amid a furious Q4 and holiday season wireless marketing battle, as its M&A prospects seem to be on hold until a 2016 spectrum auction — and possibly the presidential election — are concluded.The Uncarrier-branded wireless firm continues to unleash promotions targeting Sprint (S) and AT&T (T). Cowen & Co. on Friday lowered its price target on T-Mobile stock, citing in part higher SG&A (selling, general and administrative) costs, which include marketing to acquire new customers.T-Mobile on Thursday offered AT&T customers who switch an Apple iPhone with 128 gigabytes of data storage at the same price of the 16GB model, a $200 discount.The iPhone offer follows a T-Mobile promotion that gives Sprint customers who switch $200 in billing credit.While T-Mobile's subscriber growth might continue, the Q4 marketing battle will likely take a toll on profit.""T-Mobile shares are down 17% since reporting Q3 results (Oct. 27) as a laundry list of concerns have piled up, including issues with the quarter itself; recent pricing/promo actions by Sprint and itself; and, even more recently, anticipated 2016 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization),"" said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co.T-Mobile was up more than 1% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 35. But shares are down nearly 20% since hitting an eight-year high of 43.43 on Sept. 21.Auction March 29Synesael says a sustained rally in T-Mobile shares is unlikely until a radio spectrum sale slated for March concludes.The Broadcast Incentive Auction is slated to start on March 29. The auction could free up an estimated 60MHz to 80MHz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum owned by TV broadcasters.""Investors will need to remain patient as it's not clear that the stock will make any notable run in front of the (auction),"" Synesael said.There's been speculation cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) will bid for T-Mobile, or take a stake in the company, after the auction is over.At Macquarie securities, analyst Kevin Smithen also is cautious. He says near-term M&A involving T-Mobile, satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) or Sprint is unlikely.""In the U.S., many 'deal stocks' like DISH, TMUS and S have lost their M&A premiums,"" Smithen said in a Macquarie global telecom report. ""Heading into the March 2016 spectrum auction and November election, we felt that consolidation was unlikely.""However, post-election by late 2016, we believe M&A is necessary to fix what we consider to be a broken market structure in U.S. wireless, as return on capital investment continues to plummet for all players. By Q4 2016, several deal stocks could begin to rally as a result.""Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @IBD_RKrause.

546,DISH,"Chick Hearn elevated professional basketball to the level of world-class entertainment. Not from the court. From his perch in the TV and radio booth.His team was the Los Angeles Lakers.Their peak era was the 1980s, when the Showtime Lakers' fast break sped to legendary proportions. And five National Basketball Association titles.Hearn spread the word with such classic calls as:""Slam-dunk.""""Air ball.""""No harm, no foul.""""He put him in the popcorn machine.""Hearn received the Gowdy Award in 1991 from the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, where he was inducted posthumously in 2003. Other honors include a place in the American Sportscasters Hall of Fame, three-time National Sportscaster of the Year, three-time Golden Mike award winner, Academy of Television Arts & Sciences 50th Anniversary Award, a 1965 Emmy Award for Excellence in Basketball Coverage, and a coveted star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Pat Riley, a Hearn sidekick before hoisting four of those trophies as Showtime's head coach, told IBD from his office as president of the Miami Heat, ""There came a time when Chick Hearn was bigger than the game itself.""Riley credits Hearn with being his mentor and lauds him as a powerful ally in Pat's playing days.""I had just been cut from the Portland Trail Blazers,"" Riley recalled. ""It was 1970, I was newly married and deeply in debt. I was coming up through the tunnel after the game, and I saw Chick. I shook his hand and he said, 'I just heard the bad news, kid. Let me make a few calls and see what I can do.' And two days later, I was playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.""Illinois RiseBorn Francis Dayle Hearn (1916-2002) in Aurora, Ill., Chick acquired his nickname as an Amateur Athletic Union basketball player, with teammates placing a dead chicken in the shoe box that he though contained new sneakers.Chick went on to call a record 3,338 straight Lakers games, starting in November 1965 and ending in the middle of the 2001-02 season because of surgery. Then, two months after the Lakers' sweep of the Nets in the NBA Finals, he died after striking his head in a fall.Testament to his keen eye, Hearn is credited with the now-common tradition of estimating the distance of shots taken — long before on-screen metrics provided these measurements. He voiced-over 42 seasons, highlighted by nine Los Angeles titles and 33 victories in a row in its first title run of 1971-72.His razor-sharp yet folksy play-by-play was heard on the radio as well as via TV broadcasts. ""Chick taught Los Angeles about basketball,"" said Bob Ryan, retired sports columnist for the Boston Globe and frequent ESPN contributor, ""and he became part of the inner circle during those years when the Lakers were unstoppable.""Hearn calls became vintage.• On L.A. center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: ""Kareem's yo-yoing into the popcorn machine! The salt's out of the shaker on that one!""• If a player displayed showy but unproductive moves: ""Too much mustard on the hot dog.""• Traveling in the lane: ""A bunny-hop in the pea patch.""• Shots awry: ""Can't throw a pea in the ocean"" or ""Marge (his wife of almost 64 years) coulda made that shot"" or ""That guy couldn't beat the Sisters of Mercy.""• A minor bump that drew a whistle: ""Ticky-tack foul.""• A player nailed for deliberately reaching in: ""Caught with his hand in the cookie jar.""• The suavely suited Riley, who chewed hard when the action got hot: ""There goes GQ Riles, workin' the Wrigleys. It's nervous time.""Amid Showtime, owner Jerry Buss featured the lissome Laker Girls and a live band at the Fabulous Forum, and Tinseltown A-listers such as Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty and Dyan Cannon at courtside made a home game the hottest ticket in town.Still, Hearn retained his Midwestern authenticity and never went Hollywood, anchored by a stubborn work ethic.Hearn refused to call in sick until December 2001, when he went under the knife for a blocked aortic valve. Other than that, he missed only two games before his historic streak — once for weather, once for a conflicting assignment.Even when his greatest asset — his voice — was temporarily on ice with laryngitis on a few occasions, he announced the first half of the game and sat out the second.""Chick was the MVP of that team,"" said John Beyrooty who worked for Buss as director of public relations for Forum Boxing, broadcasting alongside Hearn at ring events in the mid-1980s. ""He treated the building janitor the same as he treated a CEO.""Eric Pincus, who writes about basketball for the Los Angeles Times, said: ""Oddly, it wasn't the television simulcast, but his radio broadcast that captured my imagination. He had a way of capturing the action in words, at his lightning pace, that both educated and entertained.""Riley recalls Hearn as ""one tough Irishman. After I retired, or thought I had retired, Chick called me on the phone and said, 'Get off the beach and go back to work!'""Magic TouchHearn clearly kept a soft spot for the purple and gold. Soon after his death at age 85, Showtime great Magic Johnson told ESPN: ""When I talked to Chick, a lot of times it was hardly about basketball. He was always so proud of me. I would get little notes from him. That would make me feel so good.""He could also dish out tough love. Pat Riley remarked on ESPN that Hearn ""was the man who taught me about discipline.""Mike Bresnahan, another writer for the Times, said of Chick: ""He was more than a homer or a booster, because he was never afraid to speak his mind. Looking back, you can just see the letdown in Magic's puppy-dog eyes when Chick called a bad play. Chick had far-reaching influence, and those players had to earn his respect.""Riley, who spent 2-1/2 years with Hearn in the broadcast booth before becoming L.A.'s coach, recalls the first time he saw Hearn lose his cool. The reason: Riley showed up an hour and half late at the Forum.""He was furious,"" Riley said. ""I never made him wait again.""Hearn didn't mess around. When they shared the booth, he made Riley arrive at 4 p.m. (""that seemed a little early to me,"" says Pat) to prepare for the 7 p.m. tipoff.To prepare, Hearn meticulously reviewed lettered cards identifying key statistics and other details that he had created with colored markers. Still before game time, ""We would call imaginary plays looking out over the empty court,"" Riley said. ""We would do fake interviews with each other to practice and warm up. Then he made me start writing up the cards, which were essentially blueprints of the teams.""Hearn Still HeardJeremy Treatman, the founder of Play By Play Sports Broadcasting Camps, where kids attend summer sessions in 10 cities to learn the trade, said: ""I always use Chick as an inspirational model for our campers. He had a fluid command of all the facts, yet he was original and always sounded like himself. And he filled in the spaces with natural storytelling.""After graduating from Bradley University in 1938, Hearn served in the Army in the South Pacific during World War II, then returned to Illinois as a sportscaster, doing play-by-play for an Amateur Athletic Union basketball team.Hearn arrived in Los Angeles in 1956, initially broadcasting USC football and basketball for CBS radio and NBC TV.By March 1961, he was broadcasting for the Lakers amid their first season in Los Angeles, shortly after the team relocated from Minneapolis. He married Marge that year, and they would have two children.The versatile Hearn also called bowling and golf events — plus did voice-over work for movies and voiced himself while calling a Lakers game for an episode of ""The Simpsons.""Hearn's presence continues to be felt in multiple ways throughout Los Angeles. When the Lakers moved from the Forum to the Staples Center in 1999, the press room was named in his honor, and nearby West 11th Street was renamed Chick Hearn Court. The adjacent Metro Blue Line rail station is called Pico-Chick Hearn depot, and his bronze likeness stands at Star Plaza outside Staples Center.Each year, the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism awards two broadcast journalism students the Chick Hearn Memorial Scholarship.He was simply ""the best of the best,"" said Riley.Bresnahan noted: ""The end of Lakers ball was as much about Chick as Kareem, Magic and Riley. And as for Chick Hearn, he's an impossible act to follow. Who comes after Sinatra?""

547,DISH,"Apple's (AAPL) rumored pay-TV service, consisting of a skinny bundle of cable and broadcast channels, isn't likely to appeal to many consumers, UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson said in a report Monday.Consumers like the idea of a less expensive pay-TV service, but not when it's missing some of the channels they want, Mitchelson said.Current skinny bundles are ""unpopular because consumers have a surprisingly wide variety of channel bundles that they prefer,"" he said.Skinny bundles such as Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue offer fewer channels for a lower price than regular pay-TV services.Meanwhile, over-the-top Internet television services like Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video, Hulu and Netflix (NFLX) typically supplement linear TV services by providing a selection of on-demand TV shows and movies.UBS reached its conclusions based on data from a survey of 1,855 U.S. pay-TV households. Its study sought ""to understand whether a la carte pay TV was viable (it is not), whether slimmed down bundles could prove to be popular (they are not) and the level of importance that each major media network group has to the bundle (all are quite important, including Viacom (VIAB), but some much more than others),"" Mitchelson said.Apple has been in talks with media companies over the past year about launching an online pay-TV service with a bundle of channels that includes live and on-demand video, to be paired up with its Apple TV hardware, Mitchelson said. Those companies include CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX). Apple has discussed offering a service costing $25 to $39.95 a month, he said.But media companies have been ""unwilling to let Apple cherry pick channels from their line-up,"" Mitchelson said.Content companies currently have little incentive to break up traditional pay-TV bundles. Cord-cutting, or pay-TV subscribers canceling their service, has not posed a big enough threat for content companies to change their business models, Mitchelson said.Also, media companies are mandating ""new entrant pricing,"" which is at a significant premium per customer than what the fully scaled traditional distributors have to pay, he said. ""Offering a healthy selection of high quality channels at a low price quickly becomes impossible under the constraints demanded by the media companies,"" Mitchelson said.Apple isn't the only tech company actively pursuing Internet-delivered pay-TV bundles, he said. Amazon.com and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google also are in the hunt, Mitchelson said.""In fact, Amazon and Google might beat Apple to market as Apple may be frustrated with the pricing and carriage demands of the media companies,"" Mitchelson said.UBS survey data indicate that Apple could be successful if it can pull together a compelling lineup of channels.Some 16% of U.S. pay-TV households surveyed indicated that they would consider signing up for an Apple TV service with 25 live TV channels (including CBS, ESPN and FX) costing $30 to $40 a month, Mitchelson said.""Not surprisingly, interest in the Apple TV offer skewed toward younger households, higher income homes, larger households and families with children, as well as streamers being significantly more interested than non-streamers,"" he said. ""Perhaps the most promising for media companies, among 18-34 year olds, 42% suggested they would definitely or probably subscribe to the Apple OTT service.""When asked to put together a custom bundle of channels, most survey respondents came up with bundles that would cost more than their current setups.The average custom bundle cost would be $127, 20% higher than their existing package, Mitchelson said. Only 28% of those who designed custom packages thought it was a better value, he said.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves came to a similar conclusion — doubting Apple's prospects in the pay-TV realm — two weeks ago.""Odds may be increasing that Apple has decided the opportunity is not worth the effort,"" Hargreaves said in a Nov. 16 report.Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

551,DISH,"TV broadcasters reduced their asking price for prime wireless airwaves for the fourth time — to just over $10 billion from what was once $86 billion, though now for a reduced amount of spectrum — setting the stage for a possible auction failure if wireless phone companies and other bidders do not bite at the fire-sale price.The Federal Communications Commission has imposed a quiet period on bidders, banning any strategic talks during the action, which began in March.If the auction ends suddenly, it would open the doors to renewed merger talks among phone companies and cable TV firms. In that case, industry speculation would focus on T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Comcast (CMCSA), Dish Network (DISH) and Verizon Communications (VZ), as well as others.In the meantime, AT&T (T) is seeking approval to buy Time Warner (TWX) for $85 billion, a deal that itself could spark other M&A talks.In earlier auction rounds, TV broadcasters lowered their asking price from $86 billion to $54.6 billion, then to $40.3 billion, and then again to $19.7 billion.The $10 billion-plus reduced price would be for up to 84 MHz of radio spectrum, down from the original plans to auction off 120 MHz of airwaves.TV broadcasters can walk away if bids do not meet the now drastically reduced price tag. While there is an overall goal, the bidding process involves blocks of airwaves in local markets such as New York and Chicago, as well as much smaller markets.IBD'S TAKE: The auction outcome is especially important to T-Mobile, which analysts say needs more airwaves. But T-Mobile could fill its needs through a merger or partnerships as well. T-Mobile stock jumped in late 2016 on speculation that it could merge with Sprint during a Trump administration. Learn more about T-Mobile at IBD Stock CheckupThe auction resumes on Jan. 18. Analysts say it's possible that the two biggest wireless firms, AT&T and Verizon, are no longer aggressively bidding.AT&T appears likely to win the federal contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety, analysts say. As part of the FirstNet contract, AT&T would gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum.The auction's outcome is important to Dish Network, which has amassed nearly 80 MHz of spectrum but has spent years looking for a wireless partner.While Verizon looms as a partner for Dish, another scenario is that Verizon could deepen its relationship with cable TV firms Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) under a wholesale network leasing agreement.Broadcasting and Cable reported that the FCC's soon-to-be Republican majority has been asked by one TV station owner to hit the pause button on the broadcast incentive auction and re-evaluate its ""anemic participation"" by wireless providers.RELATED:AT&T Seen Winning FirstNet, May Roil TV Airwaves AuctionHow Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosSpectrum Wild Cards May Add Supply, Impact Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T

555,DISH,"AT&T (T) now has 7.9 million subscribers who purchased both DirecTV satellite and unlimited wireless data service. It's a number that cable TV giant Comcast (CMCSA) could be eyeballing as it mulls whether to buy a wireless service provider such as T-Mobile US (TMUS) or Sprint (S), analysts say.AT&T acquired DirecTV Group for $49 billion in July, 2015. In early 2016, AT&T began selling unlimited wireless data plans but only to customers that also buy the DirecTV satellite service.T-Mobile US and Sprint both sell unlimited data packages but without pay-TV plans while Verizon Communications (VZ) does not.AT&T had 3 million bundled DirecTV/unlimited data wireless subscribers at the end of Q1, over 5 million in Q2, and 6.7 million in Q3. The number rose to 7.9 million in the December quarter.""The bundle helps lock in AT&T customers,"" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan told IBD.The 7.9 million bundled DirecTV subscribers represent roughly 14% of AT&T's smartphone customer base, says John Hodulik, a UBS analyst.IBD'S TAKE:  Netflix, steel maker Nucor, Quanta Services and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.AT&T also says it has signed up 200,000 subscribers for its Internet-based, DirecTV Now video streaming service.""Early trends, including the 7.9 million subscribers, suggest AT&T is effectively cross-selling products,"" said Hodulik, in a report. One question, though, is how many of the nearly 8 million subscribers are new to AT&T as opposed to existing ones that opted-in on the unlimited data/pay TV offer.Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Security, says AT&T's strategy works either way.

557,DISH,"Verizon Communications' (VZ) Go90 mobile video service was ""overhyped,"" Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said at an investor conference Tuesday.McAdam downplayed expectations for Go90, speaking at the JPMorgan financial conference in Boston. “I think maybe it did get a little over-hyped, and I’m sure we contributed to that to a certain extent,” McAdam said. “We didn’t believe it was going to move the needle on a $130 billion revenue stream overnight. It’s one of those things you have to work into.”Verizon has not disclosed how many subscribers it has for the ad-supported Go90 service, which targets millennials (ages 18 to 34) and ""Gen Zers"" (teens). Launched in September, Go90 provides a mix of original Web TV series, live sports, concert streaming, prime-time TV and other offerings.Verizon’s Go90 is usually lumped with emerging over-the-top (OTT) video services, such as Dish Network's (DISH) Sling, but the mobile app also competes for millennial attention with the likes of Alphabet (GOOGL) parent Google's YouTube, Facebook (FB), Instagram and Snapchat.“We have seen enough success to make us excited about continuing to work it. We’re on pace,” McAdam said. “Bottom line is that Go90 is in a good spot from our perspective. We’re going to continue to pursue it. But our expectations are realistic.”At an analyst meeting in April, Verizon executives indicated they might expand Go90 to multiple video streaming platforms this year.As for speculation that Verizon remains the front-runner to acquire the main business of Web portal Yahoo (YHOO), McAdam acknowledged interest, though it's not the first such acknowledgement by Verizon executives.""We can't talk about Yahoo, but that's a possibility,"" McAdam said at the conference, news website TheStreet reported.  ""That's a possibility to gain greater scale.""Verizon stock was up 0.9%, near 49.58, at the close in the stock market today.

558,DISH,"You're looking at the Airbnb website, and you see an apartment offered in downtown Cleveland during the Republican National Convention in July for an astounding $2,500 a night.You blink and dollar signs flash in your eyes like a cartoon character. Could that be you making that kind of money?Well, your home may not be worth that much a night -- few are -- and not all homes have the luxury of being near a big one-time event that would drive up prices temporarily. But it really is easy to start offering your house or any property you own up for Airbnb stays, and start raking in the bucks. At least that's what property ""hosts"" and Airbnb officials say.In fact, you don't even have to own the property, says Scott Shatford of Santa Monica, Calif. At one point he was renting out several apartments near his home in that coastal suburb of Los Angeles and essentially subletting them through the Airbnb network. He's become well enough versed to be able to write a book on the subject, ""The Airbnb Expert's Playbook,"" and runs Airdna, a data analytics firm for those seeking to rent out properties via Airbnb.The idea first hit Shatford in October 2012 when he decided to sublet his apartment during an extended trip. Using the Airbnb network, his $3,500-a-month apartment brought in $6,000 a month over a period of four months.""The light bulb had gone on about what a big opportunity this was,"" he said.For a while, Shatford said he was clearing $250,000 a year working roughly four hours a week, but now the city of Santa Monica has cracked down on the practice. He says hotel operators were getting concerned Airbnb rentals would cut into their business, which is why he's turned to data analytics for Airbnb landlords.But in the four years he's sublet apartments through Airbnb, Shatford says he's handled roughly 3,000 stays -- he estimates a 90% to 95% booking rate -- with just two negative experiences. One left a mess and the other broke a dish.In fact, Airbnb hosts could well have a better success rate with their guests than hotel owners or others who rent out their properties through other means, experts say. Hosts get to know their guests by communicating via Airbnb or other means several times before the transaction actually takes place.""The negative experiences are extremely rare,"" said Richard Serino, a public safety expert and visiting fellow at the Harvard University School Of Public Health who now serves as an advisor on safety matters to Airbnb. Serino was the No. 2 official at the Federal Emergency Management Administration from October 2009 to January 2014, and headed the Boston Emergency Medical Services department prior to that.Serino says the fact that Airbnb handles the transaction for a 3% fee and offers property protection insurance helps ensure a better experience for hosts, plus there's a staff member available 24 hours a day to take care of any emergencies. The key, he says, is how the transparency between host and guest helps to guarantee a safer experience.He adds that when he came aboard to advise the company, he was impressed with the strides they had already made in assuring few troubles.""Airbnb is really interested in people's safety,"" Serino said. ""They've been very proactive in doing it.""That doesn't mean the experience is pitfall-free. Shatford says there are several red flags to keep in mind.Guests who book at the last minute and do a short-term booking are signs of potential trouble.""You're usually getting weirdos,"" he said.It is critical, he says, for hosts to remember they can screen guests beforehand -- many will have a profile on file with Airbnb. Plus, the ability to communicate beforehand sets Airbnb apart from, say, a hotel.""You can't just show up like you do at a Marriott,"" he said. ""It's certainly much less of a strange experience than showing up to a front desk and talking to a stranger.""

559,DISH,"Investment firm Jefferies added Dish Network (DISH) to its “franchise pick” stock list, saying Wall Street ""has an overly bearish view” on the satellite TV broadcaster.Analyst Mike McCormack set a year-end 2017 price target of 80 on Dish stock, on views that its strategy of cobbling together radio spectrum for wireless or mobile video services will pay off.“We value Dish’s spectrum portfolio at nearly $45 billion on a pretax basis, or roughly $32 billion on a tax-adjusted basis,” McCormack said in a research report.Dish stock was up more than 3% in morning trading in the stock market today, near 46, but it's still down nearly 20% in 2016, and off 33% from a year ago. Dish has a low IBD Composite Rating of 19 out of a possible 99.Dish Network has amassed some 77 MHz of radio spectrum, spending some $15 billion in the process. However, the company lacks a wireless partner to deliver mobile video services over that spectrum.Verizon Communications (VZ) has stated it’s not interested in acquiring Dish Network’s spectrum but might be open to a wholesale network deal, analysts say.Dish -- along with AT&T (T), Verizon and T-Mobile US (TMUS) -- have filed as bidders in a federal auction of airwaves now owned by local TV broadcasters. The auction, begun in late March, might drag on until Q4. Depending on the auction’s outcome, wireless firms may be more or less interested in partnering with Dish Network or buying its spectrum.“We believe there are many outcomes and opportunities to realize value for Dish shareholders,” added McCormack in the report. “On concerns Dish is 'running out of time,' we believe there is plenty of time for various scenarios to unfold.”

566,DISH,"Comcast (CMCSA) stock has been on a quiet roll heading into Q4 earnings, amid analyst banter over telecom industry M&A.Comcast stock hit an all-time high of 73.79 on Tuesday and is up 6% in 2017, after shooting up 22% last year. Shares of Comcast rose 0.46% to 73.60 in the stock market today.Comcast reports Q4 earnings before the open Thursday, with analysts modeling 10% EPS growth to 87 cents and revenue rising 7.5% to $20.68 billion. Analysts are eyeing management's outlook for 2017 stock repurchases and the company's annual dividend hike.In Q3, Comcast repurchased 20.8 million of its common shares for $1.4 billion. Comcast bought back $3.8 billion of its own stock in the first nine months of 2016. As of Sept. 30, 2016, Comcast had $6.2 billion available under its share repurchase authorization.""Investors should expect another double-digit dividend hike, with repurchases likely to remain steady at $5 billion (annually),"" said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, in a research report.Besides boosting EPS, buying back shares tends to lift a stock, which could help Comcast in acquisitions involving a mix of cash and stock, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Freeport-McMoRan, steel maker Nucor, Burlington Stores and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Comcast stock is trading well above its 50-day moving average, 8% extended from a buy point of 68.46 first touched in November,Q4 is a seasonally strong period for cable TV firms; Comcast added 89,000 video subscribers in the year-earlier (2015) period.Comcast appears on track to have positive video subscriber additions for the second year in a row, despite internet video competition, owing to its investments in the X1 set-top box platform.

593,DISH,"Verizon Communications CFO Fran Shammo had kind words for Dish Network, tough words for Comcast, and perhaps worrisome words for TV broadcasters selling spectrum in a 2016 auction. Shammo was speaking on the phone company's Q3 earnings call Tuesday.The upshot: A Verizon (VZ)-Dish Network (DISH) deal on wireless spectrum might still be possible, Verizon appears reluctant to renegotiate terms of a 2011 wholesale network deal with Comcast (CMCSA), and Verizon is lukewarm about buying spectrum in the 600 MHz frequency block that the government plans to auction next year.Shammo had nothing to say about iPhone maker Apple (AAPL), however.Verizon stock rose 1.2% Tuesday as the telecom firm reported Q3 earnings and revenue that topped analyst estimates.In 2011, Verizon bought spectrum from a consortium of cable-TV firms that included Comcast. Verizon paid $3.6 billion and also gave the cable-TV firms rights to use its network at set terms and pricing, under what the industry calls an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement. Tuesday, Shammo confirmed the interest of cable-TV firms in reselling wireless services, though he did not name Comcast specifically.""We have an existing MVNO agreement. We were informed that they're going to execute on that agreement, and the agreement is the agreement,"" he said. ""I'm not going to get into whether we're discussing revising the agreement. We'll see how this plays out.""A Verizon spokesperson later confirmed Shammo was referring to Comcast. Comcast could not be reached for comment.Shammo's comment ""sounds like an indication that Comcast is going to move ahead with launching an MVNO,"" Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, told IBD.AT&T's (T) acquisition of DirecTV Group could pressure Comcast to offer mobile video services as well, analysts say. Some analysts have speculated Comcast could bid to acquire T-Mobile US (TMUS).Auction Still ScheduledMeanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission last week released proposed opening-bid prices for the ""Broadcast Incentive Auction,"" slated to start on March 29. For the auction to succeed, TV broadcasters need to be persuaded to put their spectrum up for sale.AT&T Mobility CEO Glenn Lurie recently said estimates the auction could raise $60 billion were ""unrealistic."" Sprint (S) has bowed out of the auction, but T-Mobile has said it could spent up to $10 billion.Shammo, meanwhile, says Verizon is happy with its airwaves in the 700 MHz frequency band, some of which were acquired from cable TV firms in 2011. Shammo told analysts that Verizon isn't sure the TV broadcasters' 600 MHz spectrum is a good fit with Verizon's 700 MHz footprint because of potential interference issues.""600 and 700 spectrum don't play well together,"" Shammo said.Dish, though, bought some 700 MHz airwaves in a 2008 auction and has cobbled together 75 MHz of spectrum overall. ""We've said all along that (Dish CEO and founder) Charlie (Ergen) is sitting on very good spectrum. It's very good for capacity,"" Shammo said.At a financial conference in September, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said Verizon would be interested in obtaining rights to Dish's spectrum on reasonable terms but would not acquire the satellite TV broadcaster outright.Because of the upcoming auction, the FCC will impose a ""quiet period"" that bans negotiations over spectrum and that will likely start at the end of 2015 and extend at least six months.For Q3, Verizon said it earned $1.04 per share ex items, up 16% from the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 5% to $33.2 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.02 EPS and $32.9 billion in revenue.Excluding AOL, which Verizon acquired in June for $4.4 billion, revenue rose 3.1%.Verizon in September launched Go90, a free, ad-supported mobile video product. The app, targeting millennials, offers live events, on-demand shows and Web videos. Verizon did not disclose on its earnings call how many wireless subscribers have signed up for Go90.Total wireless revenue rose 5.4% to $23 billion.Wireless service revenue fell 4.1% to $17.6 billion, but wireless equipment revenue jumped 73% to $4.3 billion.

But Verizon has the least spectrum per-subscriber among the nation's four national wireless firms, behind AT&T (T), T-Mobile US and Sprint (S).Verizon, though, could acquire more spectrum if it wins rights to the FirstNet public safety network build-out.The FCC plans to hold the TV ""Broadcast Incentive Auction"" in March 2016.

612,DISH,"AT&T (T) and CenturyLink (CTL) are vulnerable to further broadband market share losses vs. Comcast and other cable TV firms, says Morgan Stanley, based on customer dissatisfaction in areas where copper-based DSL broadband service is available.While cable TV firms — including Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR), Time Warner Cable (TWC) and privately held Cox Communications — already dominate the broadband market, there's still upside for them, Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research report.Swinburne says that cable TV firms should also target the pay TV customers of satellite broadcasters DirecTV Group and Dish Network (DISH), which currently resell DSL services from phone companies. Morgan Stanley surveyed 2,500 U.S. households during August and September on broadband and TV services.""U-verse and AT&T DSL had especially weak satisfaction results, and satellite pay-TV subscribers' broadband satisfaction fell materially year over year,"" said the Morgan Stanley report. ""For cable broadband, satellite TV households remain an opportunity.""Cable customers reported an average speed of 38 megabits per second (Mbps), while DSL subscribers said they had 21 Mbps service on average. Verizon Communications (VZ) FiOS customers on average had nearly 30 Mbps service and were happier, despite price hikes, says the Morgan Stanley report.There's also good news in the survey for media firms (Walt Disney (DIS), CBS (CBS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast-NBCUniversal) that own broadcast TV networks ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC.""Seventy-five percent of pay-TV respondents ranked the broadcast networks as one of the top three most important channel groups in their bundle.

616,DISH,"Dish Network (DISH) shareholders should brace themselves for a wireless radio spectrum leasing deal with so-so economics, not an outright sale of the airwaves to the likes of Verizon Communications (VZ), says Barclays.Comments by Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam at last week's Goldman Sachs conference seemed to open the door to renewed talks between the wireless firm and the satellite TV broadcaster over Dish's 80 MHz of radio spectrum, notes Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar in a research report Wednesday.While a wireless firm like Verizon would gain usage rights to spectrum in a leasing deal, Dish would want network access to provide its satellite TV customers with mobile video services. Dish has about 14 million subscribers, but customer losses have plagued its core business.""We believe Dish is looking at some form of corporate restructuring with the ultimate intention of monetizing spectrum,"" wrote Venkateshwar. ""Spectrum leasing is the highest probability path, since it allows Dish to monetize the spectrum and retain some optionality (long-term M&A) on the upside. However, we believe that the wholesale leasing deal is unlikely to help the equity value based on the likely underlying economics and scale.""Venkateshwar rates Dish stock underweight.Speculation that Dish might be unable to sell its spectrum and could pursue a wholesale leasing deal gained support among analysts in mid-2014 afterAT&T (T) agreed to buy satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV Group.Verizon has the least spectrum per subscriber among the nation's top four wireless firms and spent only $10 billion in a recent government auction of airwaves. Analysts have also speculated that Verizon might buy a chunk of airwaves from Sprint (S).Dish, meanwhile, has more total spectrum than T-Mobile US (TMUS), which is controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY).

637,DISH,"Akamai Technologies has a big play in Internet video, says Deutsche Bank, which joins other bullish Wall Street analysts on the CDN provider's long-term market opportunity with Apple (AAPL) and others.Website Streaming Media, however, says sell-side views that Akamai has a big payday coming from Apple's launch of a Web TV service are misguided.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai (AKAM) is the biggest provider of CDN (content delivery network) services to media and entertainment companies. While Apple's launch of an over-the-top (OTT) video service may have been delayed until 2016, Akamai stands to benefit from a wide array of Web video launches, says Deutsche Bank analyst Vijay Bhagavath in a research report.""We see a $500 million a year opportunity for Akamai in TV OTT, as the long tail (NBC, CBS (CBS), HBO, ESPN, Apple, Dish-Sling (DISH), Comcast (CMCSA), Hulu) generate the next 10% or more of Internet video traffic,"" said Bhagavath.Bhagavath joins other bullish Wall Street analysts in saying Akamai's network investments and higher capital spending will pay off.Pacific Crest Securities says Apple will still need Akamai if it expands its own CDN capabilities. William Blair & Co. also says Akamai's higher capital spending will generate more revenue.Dan Rayburn, a blogger at Streaming Media and analyst at Frost & Sullivan, says otherwise.""Apple's OTT service will not be a big revenue driver for Akamai or any other CDN right out of the gate,"" said Rayburn in a blog post. ""If Apple signs up tens of millions of subscribers and gives a large percentage of the delivery to third-party CDNs like Akamai, then the numbers could start to add up. But Apple would be lucky to get a few million subs, within a few quarters, with what is expected to be a pared-down selection of content available.""Apple is still in talks with programmers over rights to live broadcasts and a limited number of cable TV channels.Deutsche Bank's Bhagavath expects many companies to jump into Internet video. He raised his price target on Akamai to 80 from 77.As more U.S. households cut the cord and use only broadband to get TV, ""we note a base of 11 million broadband homes in the U.S., growing 10% year over year (SNL Kagan data), is a significant and growing viewer base for the exabytes of Internet Video traffic that Akamai could monetize over the next few years,"" he said.Akamai gets a strong Composite Rating of 90 out of a possible 99 from IBD. Akamai stock has been consolidating around its key 10-week line, though after several days of market volatility it has been trading just under that point in the stock market today.RELATED:Akamai Web TV Payoff Seen 'Late 2015 And Into 2016'

638,DISH,"As federal regulators ready rules for the next government auction of radio spectrum for wireless phone services, the impact of the AWS-3 auction is still rippling through the industry.The AWS-3 auction raised $41 billion, adjusted for discounts provided to bidding partners of satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH). In the upcoming Broadcast Incentive Auction, slated for early 2016, the Federal Communications Commission is mulling changes that would curtail discounts to bidding entities backed by larger companies.The AWS-3 results, says a Goldman Sachs report, raised the value of other airwaves owned by wireless phone companies. AT&T (T) spent $18.2 billion in AWS-3, the most of any company, while Verizon Communications (VZ) spent $10.4 billion.In all, AT&T now holds spectrum licenses worth more than $91 billion, estimates Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman in the report. He estimates the value of Verizon's spectrum at $79.4 billion.Wireless firms are buying more airwaves for data services, especially mobile video. Sprint (S) owns the most spectrum, but it's high-band and not yet used. AT&T has more low-band spectrum than Verizon, while T-Mobile US (TMUS) lags.In all, Feldman estimates that the wireless industry and Dish own spectrum valued at $368 billion.High-frequency bands require costlier network gear. At lower frequencies, wireless signals travel over longer distances — important in rural areas — and through office walls. The upcoming broadcast TV spectrum will offer wireless firms another chance to buy coveted low-band spectrum. The spectrum, in the 600 MHz frequency band, would come from TV broadcasters.AT&T Happy With SpectrumOn AT&T's Q1 earnings call late Wednesday, CFO John Stephens said the company is well-positioned for now. Besides the AWS-3 auction, he noted that AT&T acquired spectrum from its purchase of Leap Wireless.""Needless to say, we feel good about our spectrum position. This takes a lot of uncertainty out of the process with our ability to add capacity and maintain quality in a cost-efficient manner,"" he said.Verizon CFO Fran Shammo, on that company's earnings call Tuesday, said it's too early to make plans for the 2016 broadcast TV auction.Some speculate Verizon could buy spectrum from Dish Network or partner with the satellite TV broadcaster. Sprint, meanwhile, could put some of its spectrum up for sale.""As far as any type of strategic acquisitions or additional spectrum (related to) the incentive auction, I think that we are just going to have to wait and see what the rules are before we decide how we're going to execute on or around the incentive auction,"" Shammo said.T-Mobile, controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), and Sprint, owned by Japan's SoftBank, are pushing federal regulators to set aside more spectrum for smaller wireless firms in the Broadcast Incentive Auction. The Federal Communications Commission has reserved for smaller firms 30 megahertz of the expected 70-80 MHz of airwaves expected to be auctioned.""We believe that AT&T and Verizon remain in a very strong spectrum position for the next five years. ... We believe lack of interest for Dish's spectrum may compel Dish to acquire T-Mobile or partner with Sprint,"" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan said in a recent report. ""Otherwise, it risks losing its spectrum.""

663,DISH,"Verizon Communications (VZ) has become the latest pay-TV provider to offer skinny bundles of TV channels to consumers seeking lower-cost viewing options.Following the lead of Dish Network (DISH), Verizon's FiOS service will begin offering a slim package of TV channels, including broadcasters like ABC and Fox and cable networks like CNN and AMC, starting Sunday. It will offer add-on ""channel packs"" covering genres such as sports, news, lifestyle, entertainment and children's shows, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.FiOS Custom TV is targeted at millennials, cord shavers and cord cutters, Verizon spokesman Phillip Burrows said. ""It's a simple way for customers to choose the types of channels they want without paying for those they don't,"" he said.The cheapest plan costs $55 a month and includes a base channel package with over 35 channels (all local broadcast channels and cable favorites like CNN, HGTV, AMC and Food Network), plus two add-on channel packs. Extra channel packs cost $10 a month. Each of the seven current genre-specific channel packs includes an average of 10 to 17 channels.Verizon's skinny bundle offering comes as consumers are starting to demand greater flexibility in selecting channels to watch and lower-cost options. Earlier this year, Dish's Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue became the first to offer skinny bundle alternatives to traditional pay TV services. Apple (AAPL) reportedly plans to offer a similar service.Last month, Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger said the new skinny TV bundles are unlikely to please either potential cable TV cord-cutters or cord nevers. The offerings are too narrow for existing pay-TV subscribers and are too expensive for people who have opted not to subscribe to traditional pay-TV services, he said.The trend coincides with the rise of over-the-top Internet television services, such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Prime Instant Video and Hulu Plus, which provide subscription on-demand programming.On a conference call with analysts Wednesday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings sounded the death knell for traditional linear TV channels.""Linear TV has been on an amazing 50-year run,"" Hastings said. ""Internet TV is starting to grow. Clearly, over the next 20 years Internet TV is going to replace linear TV.""Programmers are starting to launch stand-alone subscription over-the-top video services.

714,DISH,"Media Bias: In a classic gotcha interview with a GOP candidate, Bloomberg big shot Mark Halperin sought to discredit Ted Cruz as a ""real"" Latino with patronizing questions. It goes to show the proprietary sense that the left has toward minorities.In a week-old televised interview discovered and called out by columnist Ruben Navarrette writing in the San Jose Mercury News, Halperin asked the Republican candidate for president in a dour interrogator's intonation what kind of Cuban food Cruz ate, which Cuban musical artists he listened to, whether he identified himself as Latino on his application to college (Princeton, Harvard) and, grossest of all, asked him to say something in Spanish for him.Cruz kept his composure and politely answered all but the speak-Spanish-for-me request. But there was a look on his face that suggested discomfort.Bloggers and Tweeters on the Internet, particularly those of Latin American background, rightfully blasted the interrogation.""I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, and, if I had $5 for every liberal idiot who looks at me and says 'You don't look Puerto Rican,' etc., because I don't fit the liberal template of what a Lateeeno/Lateeena (sic) should be like, this blog wouldn't need to carry ads,"" ranted blogger Fausta Wertz, accusing Halperin of expecting Cruz to perform like '50s comic actor and bandleader Ricky Ricardo.Several bloggers compared Halperin's line of questioning with that of someone looking for a minstrel show. And even on the far left, the Think Progress blog weighed in. ""The prize for the most racist interview of a 2016 candidate goes to Bloomberg's Mark Halperin,"" one of them wrote.The waves of disgust across the spectrum pretty well told the Bloomberg editor he'd stepped in it, bad, and as a result, he apologized Monday, with qualifications indicating that the problem was with the offended, not him. His main regret, he said, was his haste and tone, and he was sorry if anyone was offended. Yeah, sure.It seems the mainstream media, which even after years of nonwhite leaders in high positions, are still unable to get their heads around the idea of a black or Latino running for office who isn't a lockstep Democrat.This problem is not new. The left already has a long history of questioning the authenticity of people like former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, declaring her not really black, and for that matter, Sarah Palin, insisting that she doesn't share a real woman's concerns. Now with a large nonwhite, male contingent among the GOP's presidential hopefuls, the obnoxiousness has started right on schedule.It won't be long before the media starts asking Dr. Ben Carson, chief pediatric surgeon at the prestigious Johns Hopkins medical school and an African-American Republican, if he likes fried chicken.Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina can probably look forward to some mafia and spaghetti questions. Cuban-American Marco Rubio will be asked if he engages in drug-dealing (a smear that's already been attempted, by the way).And we can't wait to see what they cook up for the multiracial family of Jeb Bush.With Halperin convinced that the problem was his tone, not his line of questioning, the remaining question is why he wanted to know the answers to such questions anyway. The apparent aim was to ""prove"" that Cruz was not really a Latino if he couldn't name a Cuban dish (he could) and thus could not be considered Latino.Halperin and his ilk have nobusiness making that call. But they're trying, and it's encouraging to see some blowback. Latinos are not the property of the Democratic Party. They are individuals and have the right to be treated as such.

716,DISH,"Net neutrality rules could throw a wrench into Verizon's plans to launch a mobile video-streaming service. Analysts expect Verizon Communications (VZ) to join Dish Network, Sony and Apple in launching online video-streaming services. Verizon, which could launch its service as early as June, aims to set itself apart by focusing its service on wireless phone users.But in the meantime, Verizon is battling the Federal Communications Commission over new Internet rules. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam last week asked Congress in a letter to rewrite the 1996 Telecommunications Act to address net neutrality rules, which ban Internet service providers from blocking or unfairly slowing down any Web traffic.The FCC in February voted 3 to 2 along party lines for net neutrality rules, for the first time extending those rules to wireless networks. The revised rules don't directly ban plans such as T-Mobile's (TMUS) Music Freedom, a plan offering subscribers unlimited music streaming without it counting toward their data caps.That's where Verizon's planned mobile video-streaming service comes in. For Verizon, one potential issue is that wireless customers have data caps that limit how much video, music and other content they can download. If subscribers go over data caps, bills quickly mount.'Provocative Move' By VerizonWhen it launches a mobile video service, Verizon could skirt the data cap issue by exempting some or all of customer OTT usage from data caps. But it's unclear if that tactic would run afoul of net neutrality rules.""I think that would be a very provocative move,"" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""I don't think the FCC would be pleased.""Internet video services target young adults and other consumers who ""cut the cord,"" people who disconnect from pay-TV service in favor of more affordable video content via the Internet. Web-based services generally offer fewer channels at a lower cost than traditional pay-TV services.Apple (AAPL) reportedly aims to offer about 25 TV channels for $30 to $40 per month. Sony (SNE) and satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) recently launched their Vue and Sling video services, respectively.The services are dubbed over the top, or OTT, because they piggyback on landline broadband services sold by other companies. Even if consumers don't buy a traditional pay-TV package, they still need broadband Internet service to stream video.What makes Verizon different is that unlike Apple, Dish or Sony, it operates its own nationwide 4G wireless network. Verizon aims to offer a mobile video service that whisks live TV, original shows and pay-per-view to consumers. While many consumers watch TV in homes, analysts say that Verizon's wireless network would let them watch live sports, breaking news or a favorite show on the go.Verizon CFO Fran Shammo recently said that the company might rely on advertising for revenue, not a subscription model like the other OTT services.Verizon hasn't laid out how an add-on mobile video service would impact data consumption.T-Mobile US last year rolled out Music Freedom. One factor working in favor of Music Freedom's not conflicting with net neutrality, analysts say, is that it doesn't compete directly with music services such as Spotify or Pandora (P).AT&T; (T), meanwhile, has been pushing a sponsored-data business model, where data charges are billed to a sponsoring company and not to AT&T; customers, who basically use an app for free. The FCC's new net neutrality rules appear to allow AT&T;'s sponsored-data initiative, analysts say.Telecom firms object to the FCC's net neutrality ruling, saying that it's unnecessary and will stifle investment and innovation. The FCC revised its net neutrality rules after a Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals ruling in January 2014 gutted much of the agency's authority, in reaction to a Verizon suit challenging the FCC's legal basis to impose Internet regulation.A trade group backed by Verizon and AT&T; already has sued the FCC over its new net neutrality rules.Verizon says that it's premature to discuss its mobile video strategy.""It's too soon to provide specifics about a product that hasn't been launched,"" company spokesman Robert Varettoni said.Video Can Get Costly FastVerizon Wireless has nearly 103 million postpaid customers — those billed monthly, including some 86 million smartphone subscribers, as well as tablet users. Verizon also sells FiOS TV and video services via a landline fiber-optic network.The company is a serious contender in the OTT market, says Alan Wolk, an analyst at TDG Research.""Verizon has the potential to be disruptive because whatever play they have will be aimed at their 100 million-plus customers who are all over the U.S. and who are outside its FiOS territory,"" Wolk said.But a streaming service could be ""crazy expensive, given bandwidth caps,"" he said. ""Unless they (Verizon) start selling unlimited LTE plans, all that video gets very, very costly.""Like Apple, Verizon is in talks with content companies. Media companies have been leery of undermining their business relationships with pay-TV distributors like Comcast (CMCSA), which pay programming fees. Cable TV companies have pushed a new ""TV anywhere"" model that requires consumers to log in as pay-TV customers to view programs using an Internet connection. Content companies, though, have struck deals with Dish, Sony and Apple, and would be expected to sign up with any Verizon mobile video service.Content firms want more ad revenue. Nielsen and other market trackers are working on new tools to measure mobile viewing, whether via in-home or public Wi-Fi, or out-of-home cellular networks.Verizon has been developing a spectrum-efficient LTE multicast technology. With multicast technology, Verizon plans to send the same TV signal to thousands of smartphone users in the same area. Sending on-demand video to individuals, in contrast, gobbles up a lot of network bandwidth.For now, the economics of mobile video remain unclear, says Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.""The vast majority of TV viewing is going to be on a conventional TV set and in the home,"" he said. ""Delivery of video content over a wireless network would not be exactly the most cost-effective approach. There may be subscribers willing to pay for the incremental service, but whether it's enough to justify the costs that Verizon might incur in launching and operating the service is another matter.""

717,DISH,"Apple (AAPL) made much ado about its standalone streaming HBO Now service last month, but ""Game of Thrones"" enthusiasts without a cable subscription don't need an iPad to watch the season premiere on April 12.Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV, an over-the-top service, said Wednesday that it is bringing live and video-on-demand HBO to its ""Best of Live"" core-package subscribers for an additional $15 a month. The core package costs $20 and includes about 20 channels, such as (Walt Disney (DIS) ESPN, (Scripps Network Interactive (SNI) as well as Time Warner (TWX) channels such as TBS and CNN.Shares of Dish closed down 0.5% to 69.73.The move comes as part of a new distribution agreement between media giant Time Warner and the satellite TV provider. The two companies ended their dispute Tuesday, allowing Dish customers to continue to access Turner channels.The deal also comes just in time for college hoops fans to watch the NCAA Final Four games on TBS, TruTV and TNT on Saturday.The exact launch date of HBO on Sling has yet to be announced, but presumably it will come before April 12, when new seasons of both ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Silicon Valley"" begin. Sling TV — which is supported by Roku, Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One, Android and iOS devices, Amazon (AMZN) Fire TV and Macs and PCs — said HBO will be available by the season premiere.Apple in March said Apple TV would be the exclusive streaming device partner for HBO. Apple reportedly is working on a a streaming service that would include more channels than Dish's Sling TV.

719,DISH,"New Internet television services from Dish Network (DISH), Sony and possibly Apple are unlikely to please either potential cable TV cord-cutters or cord nevers, Bernstein Research said in a report Thursday.The over-the-top video services announced or rumored so far are too narrow for existing pay-TV subscribers and are too expensive for people who have opted not to subscribe to traditional pay-TV services, Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger said in the report.His findings were based on comments made at focus groups in New York City and San Francisco. The groups were composed of people who identified themselves as ""highly likely to cut the cord in the next six months,"" as well as people who felt just the opposite.Based on the focus groups, Juenger is pessimistic on the prospects for Sling TV from Dish Network, PlayStation Vue from Sony (SNE) and a rumored Apple (AAPL) TV service.""A strong body of evidence is emerging that suggests to us that none of these services are likely to gain much traction,"" he said. ""Simply put, for existing pay-TV subscribers, the content is too limited (relative to the cost savings); and for cord-nevers, the price is too high (relative to the appeal of the content).""The OTT services are handicapped by having fewer networks in order to achieve a lower price, but not enough networks to make the service appealing.""Cord-cutting, in large numbers, isn't likely to happen,"" Juenger said. ""It's one of those ideas that sounds great in the abstract but crumbles when faced with the reality. OTT services seem poised to garner few subscribers, which is more good news than bad. We believe it's better for the pay-TV ecosystem to remain in the status quo than to add millions of OTT subscribers at the cost of blowing the whole system apart.""One of the big problems with ""skinny"" TV bundles is that individuals differ on what the ideal package of networks should be.Content Companies Cutting InAs Dish and others are putting together online programming bundles, some content companies are making stand-alone subscription video-on-demand services. These include Time Warner 's (TWX) HBO Go service, set to launch next month on Apple TV hardware; CBS All Access; and Nickelodeon's Noggin from parent Viacom (VIAB).Complicating matters even more are subscription streaming video services like Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Hulu, which offer original programming as well as licensed TV shows and movies.The concept of over-the-top television is appealing because many people hate their cable TV providers but are stuck with them unless an effective alternative emerges.""The vitriol toward the cable companies was intense"" in the focus groups, Juenger said. ""A surprising number of participants are currently subscribing to pay-TV only because it is actually cheaper than buying high-speed Internet on its own.""Bernstein rates Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner as outperform.It rates AMC Networks (AMCX), CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), and Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) as market perform; and Viacom as underperform.RELATED:Apple building new set-top box for its Internet TV serviceSony pursues cord cutters with over-the-top TV service.

722,DISH,"ESPN bills itself as the Worldwide Leader In Sports, and the slogan is not mere hyperbole. ESPN is available in 94 million pay-TV homes in the U.S., and its channels air in more than 200 nations.Clearly, Burbank, Calif.-based Walt Disney (DIS) has benefited wildly from buying an 80% stake in ESPN in 1995. For openers, ESPN, which broadcasts jewels ranging from the NFL and NBA to Major League Baseball and all sorts of college sports, provides a gateway to the hearts and minds of 18- to 34-year-old males. Advertisers covet that viewing audience.But ESPN is also essential for Disney as the worlds of media and technology continue to blur. As such Silicon Valley heavyweights as Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) make inroads into what has been regarded as traditional media ecosystems, media companies likewise must begin to act more like technology companies if they hope to remain relevant.In January, Dish Network (DISH) announced Sling TV, which lets subscribers watch cable channels over the Internet (what the industry calls OTT, for over the top) without mandating a satellite subscription. For a mere $20 a month, OTT subscribers get access to ESPN and ESPN 2, as well as such channels as Disney, the Food Network, HGTV, TBS, TNT and CNN.It's the first time that Disney has made ESPN available online without a cable or satellite subscription. ""It's the thing a lot of people really miss when they don't have a pay-TV service,"" Dish's outgoing CEO Joe Clayton said in announcing Sling TV at the Consumer Electronics Show. ""They want live sports. They want ESPN and ESPN2.""Disney, though, must protect its ESPN franchise. The company had to consider the move seriously for competitive reasons, say observers.""ESPN is a primary profit center for Disney and annually contributes close to $7 billion from subscriber fees alone to the corporate bottom line,"" Neal Pilson, former president of CBS Sports and now a TV industry consultant, told IBD.""ESPN and Disney have sophisticated and talented executive leadership, so it's hard to imagine they would agree to any OTT deal between ESPN and Dish that might, in any way, jeopardize the revenue stream ESPN continues to generate from the traditional cable/satellite industry.""But OTT has become a rallying cry, if not a mantra, in the industry.""ESPN has been dipping its toe into the OTT space for over a year, mulling whether streaming an ESPN channel might work,"" said Porter Bibb, an analyst with MediaTech Partners. ""It will — and it will be forthcoming sometime in the next year or so.""The MSOs (multisystem operators, or pay-TV providers) won't dare penalize ESPN, but ESPN knows the multibillion-dollar fees they currently extract from MSOs aren't going up and upon contract expiry — which in most cases runs to 2020 — will start to go down.""ESPN needs to replace that revenue with the only alternative, which is OTT.""Downgraded On Ad ChallengesBTIG analyst Rich Greenfield likes ESPN, but on Monday he downgraded Disney stock to neutral from buy, in part on the increasing challenges for broadcast TV ad revenue.""Disney is clearly best-positioned among its broadcast/cable network peers, with its must-have sports-driven ESPN networks and non-advertising-driven Disney channels,"" Greenfield said in a research report Monday. ""However, we are increasingly struggling with the question of whether anyone in the sector can flourish as consumer behavior shifts away from traditional television viewing, not to mention a complete lack of interest in wasting time on commercials.""But in Q4, Disney reported higher earnings that surpassed Wall Street's forecasts, thanks in large part to ESPN. Disney had adjusted earnings per share of $1.04, topping the 92 cents estimated by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Net income jumped 33% to $1.8 billion.Disney's media networks division, which stars ESPN, clocked in with $1.5 billion in operating income, up 20%.ESPN is crucial to not only Walt Disney's fortunes but also its image, particularly among investors. Under CEO Bob Iger, Disney has established an enviable record for making good on its promises to Wall Street.While Disney's assets range from theme parks to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ESPN is rapidly becoming arguably its most transferrable property worldwide. As Viacom's (VIA) MTV unit has somewhat declined in buzz value over the years, ESPN now stands alone at the top of the cable-channel heap.Controlling A DemographicIn a way, Disney is following a tried-and-true formula with ESPN. Disney, of course, is the content king when it comes to enriching the lives of young people with programming that continually appeals to this special demographic — and doing it in many forms, ranging from old-fashioned TV to DVDs and Blu-ray innovations.""Walt Disney, for a long time, has had a control over our childhood, from Mickey Mouse and Snow White to Cinderella and trips to Disney World and the old Sunday TV show with Walt Disney himself,"" noted Robert Thompson, who teaches a course in television and American culture at the Newhouse School of Syracuse University.""ESPN basically owns the culture of men, especially young men,"" Thompson said. ""Sports translates so well to new technologies and all media forms, such as second screens, third screens (and) streaming.""Sports — especially professional football, which ESPN broadcasts — is the golden goose. The Oscars broadcast this year declined 15% in the ratings, but the Super Bowl goes up.""Disney's mandate is to keep ESPN the worldwide leader of sports — and the destination for the key demographic of young adult men.To do it, Disney must continue to tap into the new technology.""Dish/Sling is the beneficiary for the moment and is small enough not to rile the big MSOs,"" Bibb said. ""But the writing is on the wall, and ESPN will be right there with HBO, the other 'must-have' cable network, on the Net. And it will be there sooner rather than later.""

743,DISH,"After months of beta testing, Sony (SNE) on Wednesday launched its PlayStation Vue television service, which aims to compete with cable and other pay TV offerings.PlayStation Vue offers a starting package of 50 channels for $50 a month, but you must own a Sony PS3 or PS4 game console and have broadband Internet service to receive it. Initially it will be available only in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia.Sony introduced the service in November, calling it a ""pioneering new cloud-based TV service that reinvents the television experience.""The company also is offering two higher-priced tiers of Vue that include more channels for $60 and $70 a month.PlayStation Vue follows the nationwide launch of Sling TV from Dish Network (DISH), another over-the-top Internet pay TV service. Sling TV offers a starting package of 20 channels for $20 a month and is available using Roku and Amazon.com (AMZN) streaming devices and Microsoft 's (MSFT) Xbox One game console.Apple (AAPL) reportedly is preparing to enter the OTT TV market this fall. Media reports say Apple will launch its service with about 25 channels for $30 to $40 a month. Apple stock has risen three straight days since the Wall Street Journal broke the news.The OTT services from Dish, Sony and Apple are aimed at ""cord cutters"" — consumers who have quit traditional pay TV services — and millennials who have never received cable. Each offers a different set of channels with noticeable absences. For instance, Sony's Vue is missing the CW network and channels from Walt Disney (DIS), including ABC and ESPN.Meanwhile, several content providers are launching their own OTT services. Time Warner (TWX) will launch its HBO Now service in April for $15 a month. CBS (CBS) offers CBS All-Access for $6 a month. Viacom (VIAB)-owned Nickelodeon offers its Noggin programming for $6 a month.These services both complement and compete with subscription video-on-demand services from Amazon, Hulu, Netflix (NFLX) and others.Programmers wouldn't be participating in over-the-top TV services if they didn't believe it was additive to their businesses, rather than cannibalistic, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft said in a research report Wednesday.""They believe it could be an opportunity to monetize some of the (about) 18 million TV households that don't subscribe to a pay-TV service today, which we forecast to grow to 31 million by 2020,"" Kraft said.

"
770,DISH,"Facing Uphill Climb
"

"
773,DISH,"The spectrum, in the 600 MHz frequency band, would come from TV broadcasters. The broadcast spectrum is low-band, so wireless signals travel over longer distances — important in rural areas — as well as through office walls, a big plus in cities.

780,DISH,"""Broadcasters will not relinquish spectrum at a low price,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan.
"
781,DISH,"The proposed auction has two parts, a process aimed at getting as many TV broadcasters as possible to give up airwave rights in local markets. In all, broadcasters hold about 120 MHz of spectrum, which they obtained for free from the government in the 1930s and '40s.
"
782,DISH,"Paul de Sa, an analyst at Bernstein Research, questions whether increasing the spectrum set-aside for small wireless firms would impact results. ""For me, (it's) not totally clear that a higher reserve leads to lower dollars for broadcasters,"" he said via email.

"
784,DISH,"Broadcasters Filed Suit
"
785,DISH,"Final auction rules have yet to be set. The FCC plans to take a patchwork of vacated TV channels in local markets and create tighter blocks of spectrum for wireless firms to use. Local TV stations would keep airwaves for broadcasting purposes.
"
786,DISH,"The National Association of Broadcasters and a group led by Sinclair Broadcasting Group (SBGI) have sued the FCC, claiming proposed auction rules are unfair. Among other things, broadcasters worry that the repacked spectrum would be prone to interference.

But it doesn't seem like either SoftBank or Deutsche Telekom will step up.""We believe that Deutsche Telekom will not fund T-Mobile's participation in the incentive auction and that this could become a small overhang on T-Mobile shares if the auction somehow happens in 2016,"" Kevin Smithen, a Macquarie Capital analyst, said in a research report.AT&T and Verizon spent nearly $29 billion combined in the AWS-3 auction that ended in January. AWS-3 raised nearly $45 billion, with satellite TV broadcaster Dish also a major buyer.Dish now owns more U.S. spectrum than T-Mobile, though it has yet to build out a wireless network.Many TV broadcasters have objected all along to the policy of reserving spectrum for smaller wireless firms. Some analysts say the broadcasters stand to get less money if bidding is restricted to smaller carriers.""Broadcasters will not relinquish spectrum at a low price,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan.The proposed auction has two parts, a process aimed at getting as many TV broadcasters as possible to give up airwave rights in local markets. In all, broadcasters hold about 120 MHz of spectrum, which they obtained for free from the government in the 1930s and '40s.Paul de Sa, an analyst at Bernstein Research, questions whether increasing the spectrum set-aside for small wireless firms would impact results. ""For me, (it's) not totally clear that a higher reserve leads to lower dollars for broadcasters,"" he said via email.Sprint has suggested that it could form a bidding coalition with the Competitive Carriers Association, an industry advocacy group, for the 600 MHz spectrum.Broadcasters Filed SuitFinal auction rules have yet to be set. The FCC plans to take a patchwork of vacated TV channels in local markets and create tighter blocks of spectrum for wireless firms to use. Local TV stations would keep airwaves for broadcasting purposes.The National Association of Broadcasters and a group led by Sinclair Broadcasting Group (SBGI) have sued the FCC, claiming proposed auction rules are unfair. Among other things, broadcasters worry that the repacked spectrum would be prone to interference.Preston Padden, executive director of the Expanding Opportunities for Broadcasters Coalition, a group of broadcasters that are interested in participating in the auction, told IBD that AT&T or Verizon might sue if auction rules disadvantage them. He adds that increasing the set-aside to 40 MHz from 30 MHz could be a factor.Padden recently spoke to the Competitive Carriers Association.""I told them to be careful not to push too far on this reserved spectrum (issue), because they may invite AT&T and Verizon to go to court to seek an injunction against the auction,"" Padden told IBD.

One fresh rumor has Apple developing a car.Apple CEO Tim Cook on Tuesday drummed up interest in the company's Apple Watch, due for release in April, while speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco. He also said sales of iPhone 6 handsets and Mac computers remain strong, while iPad sales could get a boost later this year from Apple's enterprise partnership with IBM (IBM).Apple shares peaked at 127.48 on Thursday, but ended the day up 1.2% to 126.43.On Wednesday, Icahn posted a public letter online repeating his plea for Apple to be more aggressive with its stock buyback plan. He also raised his price target for Apple stock to 216 from 203.Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster on Thursday reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of 135.Now that the Apple Watch has been announced, Apple likely is turning its focus to television, Munster said in a research note. He doesn't expect an Apple television set soon, but says the company is working on an update to its Apple TV set-top box and software.""We believe the most likely path to a TV would be an update to the Apple TV hardware and software that potentially integrates content, gaming, and HomeKit in the fall of 2015, and a television at least a year later,"" Munster said.Apple might be able to put together an Internet television service, now that Dish Network (DISH) has blazed a trail with its Sling TV service, he said.""The concept of content providers being willing to participate in the paid Internet streaming model is a positive sign that Apple could develop a content service,"" Munster said.Meanwhile, rumors are swirling that Apple might be contemplating entering the car business, competing with luxury electric car maker Tesla Motors (TSLA).This week, Business Insider quoted an Apple employee who said ""vehicle development"" at the company ""will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money."" The source said many Tesla employees were ""jumping ship"" to work at Apple.On Tuesday, Bryan Chaffin, co-founder of The Mac Observer , wrote that his sources confirmed that Apple is indeed working on a car.""Apple has been looking for — and acquiring — the kind of people from Tesla with expertise that is most suited to cars,"" Chaffin said. ""So much so that I went from being a doubter to a believer almost instantly.""To those who dismiss the idea by saying Apple doesn't know anything about cars, Chaffin responds that Apple didn't know anything about cellphones before it started developing the iPhone.

851,DISH,"Time Warner's (TWX) upcoming negotiations to renew programming deals with pay-TV service operators will be key for the media and entertainment giant's growth prospects, analysts say.Time Warner, which on Wednesday reported Q4 earnings that topped estimates, has upcoming talks with Comcast (CMCSA), satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) and Time Warner Cable (TWC). Federal regulators are reviewing the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger.""The pivotal question for Time Warner investors is whether management will successfully complete the U.S. affiliate deals in 2015 needed to drive a dramatic acceleration,"" said UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson in a research report. ""We expect TWX will be successful with renewals.""Analysts say that the biggest content providers — such as Time Warner, Walt Disney (DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) — may have an edge over smaller programmers as pay-TV distributors look to lower programming costs.Pay-TV companies are shifting to slimmer programming packages, offering consumers fewer channels either in new ""over-the-top"" Internet video services or in ""broadband-first"" deals. To target cord cutters looking for ""a la carte"" packages, Comcast, Cox Communications and AT&T (T) have stepped up promotions of cheaper, $40 to $50 monthly plans that feature high-speed Internet and basic TV — without ESPN, Discovery (DISCA) and other high-cost channels.Larger content firms have a better chance of having their cable networks included in slimmed down TV packages, analysts say. That's why Viacom (VIA) and CBS (CBS) are reportedly exploring a merger to gain more negotiating clout.""(Time Warner's) outlook for growth beyond 2015 appears much more reliant on a meaningful acceleration in revenue growth, which is likely to require successful renegotiation of the last two major domestic (pay-TV) deals and highly successful box office performance,"" said Andy Hargreaves, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report. Time Warner owns the Warner Brothers film studio.Dish Network has rolled out a new TV Web-only offering called Sling. It's called ""skinny"" because the satellite TV broadcaster's Web-based offering includes only 12 channels, but for just $20 monthly.Dish's deal includes programming from Disney, Time Warner's Turner network, Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) and AMC Network (AMCX). Left out of the Dish Sling TV package were the big four national TV networks — ABC, CBS, Fox and Comcast's NBCUniversal — as well as cable channels from CBS, Discovery, Fox, NBCU and Viacom.Some media firms plan to go it alone with their own Web offerings. Time Warner plans to sell HBO on the Webin 2015, and CBS has launched a subscription streaming service. The Web streaming services target young adults and other consumers that ""cut the cord,"" industry jargon for the growing number of people that disconnect pay-TV service in favor of more affordable online video options and on-demand content.

853,DISH,"Apple (AAPL) reportedly will unveil a long-awaited revamp of its Apple TV set-top box this June, at the same event where it is likely to announce a subscription Internet TV service.Apple's next-generation set-top box will include a faster processor, a big increase in onboard storage and an improved operating system that can support Siri voice controls as well as downloadable apps from a new App Store, BuzzFeed reported Friday. Apple will release a software development kit and finally allow developers to write apps for the device, BuzzFeed said.Apple hasn't significantly updated the Apple TV box since a third-generation model debuted in March 2012. Apple has sold 25 million units of its streaming video box since it first hit the market in January 2007. The device allows owners to watch subscription video-on-demand services like Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu Plus and pay-per-view movies from Apple.It competes with streaming devices from Roku, Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and others.Last week, Apple cut the price of its current Apple TV hardware by 30% to $69. It also announced that it would be the exclusive launch partner for Time Warner's (TWX) new streaming video service HBO Now.Apple will announce the new Apple TV hardware and software at its Worldwide Developers Conference, tentatively scheduled for early June in San Francisco, BuzzFeed said. At the same conference, Apple is expected to announce a new subscription streaming music service, as well as an over-the-top Internet TV service to compete with cable offerings and new OTT services from Dish Network (DISH) and Sony (SNE).Apple's Internet TV service is expected to launch in September with about 25 channels, including CBS (CBS), Fox (FOXA) and Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC broadcast networks. Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBC would be offered as a separate subscription on Apple TV, not part of the basic bundle, according to news reports. The price for the Apple television service is rumored to be $30 to $40 a month.An Apple Internet TV service could accelerate Apple's path to getting 20% of its operating income from services in the next couple of years, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a research report Friday. Other Apple services include iTunes, App Store, Apple Pay and the Beats subscription music service. Services accounted for 14% of Apple's operating income in 2014, she said.""Just in the U.S., we see the potential for Apple to add 15 million subscribers to its TV service, or 8% of U.S. Apple users,"" Huberty said. At $30 a month, 15 million Apple TV subscribers would bring in $5.5 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion of earnings before interest and taxes, she said.RELATED:Here's why Apple wants a new streaming music serviceSony pursues cord cutters with over-the-top TV servicePaid Video Streaming Reaches Over 40% Of U.S. Homes.

In addition, Dish may be closer to entering the wireless fray in some form or fashion, which may not be good for existing players.""
"
902,DISH,"Wireless phone companies, led by AT&T and Verizon, and satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) spent nearly $45 billion in the AWS-3 auction, far past estimates. The Federal Communications Commission disclosed bid results on Friday, a day after the auction ended.
"
903,DISH,"The upshot from analysts: AT&T, which spent $18.2 billion, the most of any bidder, will continue paying a high dividend to shareholders. And AT&T gained spectrum that it needs to expand mobile data services, especially in key markets.
"
904,DISH,"Both AT&T and Verizon will add to their debt. Verizon borrowed heavily to fund its 2014 buyout of Vodafone's (VOD) 45% in their wireless joint venture. And AT&T hopes soon to complete its acquisition of DirecTV Group (DTV).

910,DISH,"Non-Bidder Sprint Also Wins
"
911,DISH,"Sprint (S), which did not take part in the auction, still gained, some analysts speculate. Sprint is in a better position to sell off some of its own spectrum to raise cash, says Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins.
"
912,DISH,"Verizon also looms as a possible buyer of Sprint spectrum. And if their new spectrum makes AT&T and Verizon even more formidable, regulators might rethink approval of a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile US (TMUS).
"
913,DISH,"Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY)-owned T-Mobile spent only $1.8 billion in the auction, less than estimates. T-Mobile didn't add much spectrum in major markets. Still, the federal government plans another spectrum auction in 2016 using airwaves from TV broadcasters. T-Mobile could bid in this ""Broadcast Incentive Auction."" Post-AWS-3 auction, Dish Network will own more U.S. spectrum than T-Mobile, though the satellite TV broadcaster has yet to build out a wireless network.
"
914,DISH,"Dish Network in the auction achieved its main goal: securing licenses in major markets in order to pressure wireless firms such as Verizon or T-Mobile to negotiate, says Pacific Crest Securities.
"
915,DISH,"Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan agrees. ""Dish could be able to make a compelling argument to Deutsche Telekom that a merger would give the two companies (Dish and T-Mobile) greater leverage down the road to eventually pursue a deal with Sprint,"" said Horan in a report.
"
916,DISH,"Prior to the AWS-3 auction, Dish Network had cobbled together nearly 55 MHz of spectrum licenses. It has been looking for a wireless partner to offer mobile broadband services.
"
917,DISH,"One option for Charlie Ergen, Dish Network's founder and chairman, is spinning off the spectrum holdings into a separate company that would lease airwaves to wireless firms.
"
918,DISH,"Dish lowered its auction costs by investing in two bidding agents, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless, along with partners. The two companies spent $13.3 billion in the auction but received a 25% discount, lowering their auction bill to about $10 billion.
"
919,DISH,"Dish will fund about $8.5 billion of the auction tab owed by Northstar and SNR, analysts estimate. Republican FCC member Ajit Pai on Monday objected to the 25% discount, but analysts say that it likely will be upheld. Northstar and SNR got the discount based in part on their small size.

And Verizon has the option of either acquiring Dish or leasing radio spectrum from the satellite TV broadcaster, says JPMorgan in a note.Non-Bidder Sprint Also WinsSprint (S), which did not take part in the auction, still gained, some analysts speculate. Sprint is in a better position to sell off some of its own spectrum to raise cash, says Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins.Verizon also looms as a possible buyer of Sprint spectrum. And if their new spectrum makes AT&T and Verizon even more formidable, regulators might rethink approval of a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile US (TMUS).Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY)-owned T-Mobile spent only $1.8 billion in the auction, less than estimates. T-Mobile didn't add much spectrum in major markets. Still, the federal government plans another spectrum auction in 2016 using airwaves from TV broadcasters. T-Mobile could bid in this ""Broadcast Incentive Auction."" Post-AWS-3 auction, Dish Network will own more U.S. spectrum than T-Mobile, though the satellite TV broadcaster has yet to build out a wireless network.Dish Network in the auction achieved its main goal: securing licenses in major markets in order to pressure wireless firms such as Verizon or T-Mobile to negotiate, says Pacific Crest Securities.Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan agrees. ""Dish could be able to make a compelling argument to Deutsche Telekom that a merger would give the two companies (Dish and T-Mobile) greater leverage down the road to eventually pursue a deal with Sprint,"" said Horan in a report.Prior to the AWS-3 auction, Dish Network had cobbled together nearly 55 MHz of spectrum licenses. It has been looking for a wireless partner to offer mobile broadband services.One option for Charlie Ergen, Dish Network's founder and chairman, is spinning off the spectrum holdings into a separate company that would lease airwaves to wireless firms.Dish lowered its auction costs by investing in two bidding agents, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless, along with partners. The two companies spent $13.3 billion in the auction but received a 25% discount, lowering their auction bill to about $10 billion.Dish will fund about $8.5 billion of the auction tab owed by Northstar and SNR, analysts estimate. Republican FCC member Ajit Pai on Monday objected to the 25% discount, but analysts say that it likely will be upheld. Northstar and SNR got the discount based in part on their small size.Dish stock fell 4% Friday on the news that it spent more than expected in the auction, but its shares rose 3.2% Monday. Shares of AT&T and Verizon each rose more than 2% and T-Mobile a fraction.

922,DISH,"Apple (AAPL) has been trying for years to break into the Internet television business with plans to offer a package of basic cable channels that could serve as an alternative to traditional pay-TV services. But Apple hasn't been able to secure the content deals needed to make it happen.Now that Dish Network (DISH) and Sony (SNE) have blazed a trail with such services, Apple once again is looking to enter the over-the-top television business. Apple is now negotiating with TV programmers and has shown demos of its proposed service, Re/code reported Wednesday.Apple's talks with TV programmers are at an early stage, and details like pricing and timing still need to be worked out, Re/code said.Meanwhile, Apple's streaming video box, the Apple TV, is overdue for an upgrade. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company hasn't come out with a new version of the $99 set-top box in two years.Dish Network began rolling out its Sling TV service last month after earning rave reviews with its introduction at the 2015 International CES show in Las Vegas.For $20 a month, Sling TV will deliver live sports, lifestyle, family, news and information channels, video-on-demand entertainment and the best of online video to broadband-connected devices at home and on the go. The base package includes 12 channels: ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ABC Family and CNN. Dish also will sell add-on packs costing $5 a month focused on sports, news and kids channels.Sony's PlayStation Vue will launch soon with about 75 channels from CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), Fox (FOXA), NBCUniversal, Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) and Viacom (VIAB). By the end of March, the subscription cloud TV service is expected to go live in four cities: New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles. Pricing has yet to be announced, but some reports say it could cost $60 to $80 a month.

929,DISH,"Dish Network was among the big winners at last week's International CES. The satellite broadcaster introduced what could be the first real over-the-top Internet video competition for traditional pay-TV services.Dish Network (DISH) said it will launch Sling TV nationwide in the first quarter. For $20 a month, Sling TV will deliver live sports, lifestyle, family, news and information channels, video-on-demand entertainment and the best of online video to broadband-connected devices at home and on the go, the company said Jan. 5 at CES.At a press event, Dish CEO Joseph Clayton said Sling TV is targeted at millennials who balk at paying for higher-priced cable, telco and satellite TV packages.Sling TV will be supported by a host of Internet-connected devices, such as Amazon's (AMZN)  Google's (GOOGL) Nexus Player, as well as game consoles, smart TVs, PCs, tablets and smartphones.For $20 a month, Sling TV will offer a ""Best of Live TV"" package that includes 12 channels: ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ABC Family and CNN.Consumers will be able to add extra channels with add-on packs costing $5 a month. A ""Kids Extra"" add-on includes Disney Junior, Disney XD, Boomerang, Baby TV and Duck TV. A ""News & Info Extra"" add-on includes HLN, Cooking Channel, DIY and Bloomberg TV. A ""Sports Extra"" package is coming soon, Dish said.Engadget awarded Sling TV its ""Best in Show"" CES award, after giving it earlier awards for best home theater product and best software app.""Many of us have been waiting, hoping and even lusting after Sling TV before we'd ever heard of it: an Internet TV service that gives you the channels you love, on any screen, anywhere, without a subscription to traditional cable or satellite TV service,"" Engadget Editor-in-Chief Michael Gorman wrote . ""Sling TV is a big deal, folks. It could very well be the beginning of the end for traditional pay TV here in the U.S.""CNet declared that Sling TV ""stole the show"" at CES.""None of the major TV networks (CBS, ABC, Fox, etc.) (is) included, but if you add Sling TV to an over-the-air antenna and/or subscriptions to Hulu Plus or CBS All Access, you're pretty close to a basic cable package for far less money,"" CNet section editor David Katzmaier wrote.GoPro, Facebook, other CES winnersA lot of consumer electronics companies came out with action cameras at CES to compete with GoPro (GPRO) . But GoPro emerged with its mindshare lead intact, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Brian Blair said in a note Monday.""While CES showcased a number of would-be GoPro competition from companies like Sony (SNE), Panasonic and Polaroid, none of them garnered much attention in our view,"" Blair said. ""A number of Chinese manufacturers were additionally showing low end knock-offs of the camera in a variety of colors. If CES is reflective of the current consumer view, there is one player that holds the mindshare in the action-camera genre and it remains unchallenged.""Third-party accessories for GoPro cameras were plentiful at the show in another indicator of GoPro's success, Blair said.Another big winner at the show was Oculus VR, owned by Facebook (FB). Several pundits noted the long lines at the Oculus booth for people wanting demonstrations of the virtual reality headsets.Digital ad company Amobee Intelligence put together a list of the most talked about products and companies at CES 2015, based on social network chatter.Samsung was the most talked-about company on social media at CES with its 4K televisions, advanced washing machines and Internet of Things initiatives, Amobee reported Sunday. Sony came in second for online chatter about CES news, followed by LG and Intel (INTC).The most buzzed-about car company at the show was Mercedes-Benz, which showed off its concept of a self-driving car. Audi came in second, followed by BMW, Amobee said.The four-day International CES in Las Vegas ended Friday. It was the largest show to date, drawing more than 170,000 industry professionals.

"
944,DISH,"Most of its revenue is subscription-based. ServiceNow doesn't record all revenue upfront but over the billing cycle of a contract, which is typically one or three years. But it recognizes expenses upfront. That and the revenue lag creates a ""mismatch,"" says Rob Owens, analyst with Pacific Crest Securities.
"
945,DISH,"Earnings, he said, are a ""lagging indicator,"" while cash flow and billings are more ""leading indicators.""

970,DISH,"Just as a savory dish is often made with a variety of ingredients, many elements come together to form a great base.
"
971,DISH,"Bases are chart patterns that form as a stock corrects and digests its gains following a strong prior run-up.
"
972,DISH,"A stock can boast strong fundamentals and belong to a leading industry group or sector. But those qualities alone aren't enough to warrant a buy. This is when a stock's daily and weekly charts come into play. They help investors track not only a stock's price and volume action but also new bases that set up the next big run.
"
973,DISH,"""It's not enough to buy a stock simply because it has good fundamental characteristics, like strong earnings and sales,"" IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""
"
974,DISH,"""In fact, no Investor's Business Daily reader should ever buy a stock based solely on IBD's proprietary SmartSelect Ratings. A stock's chart must always be checked to determine whether the stock is in a proper position to buy, or whether it is the stock of a sound, leading company but is too far extended in price above a solid basing area and thus should temporarily be avoided.""
"
975,DISH,"Leading stocks make their biggest moves after breaking out from proper bases. It's difficult to know when the optimal time to buy shares is if you don't know how to spot or interpret a stock's basing pattern. Buying at the wrong time raises downside risk.
"
976,DISH,"Keep in mind that all bases are not created equal — nor are all good bases perfect. And there are various patterns, including the cup, cup without handle, flat base, double-bottom and so forth. But there are some basic similarities, which will be covered in detail in subsequent columns.
"
977,DISH,"For now, remember these key points to check when studying bases: the length of the base; the size of the decline; the smoothness of price action; visual symmetry; and the importance of accumulation, which indicates that savvy institutional investors are eagerly grabbing and holding shares before the actual breakout occurs.
"
978,DISH,"The size of the decline, or correction, in a cup base should generally be between 12% and 33%. In a severe bear market, deeper bases may form.
"
979,DISH,"A proper cup base needs to span a minimum of seven weeks, while a flat base can be as short as five weeks. Some bases form handles. A proper handle forms in the upper half of a base and drifts slightly downward along its price lows. Volume should mostly ease until the breakout.
"
980,DISH,"Baidu (BIDU) got off to a rocky start right after rocketing 470% above an IPO price of 27 on its Aug. 5, 2005, market debut. But the stock eventually came back to form a series of bases on its way up, including the one shown in the daily chart above.
"
981,DISH,"In early January 2007, it began shaping a base. The stock pulled back 31%, in proper range. Volume slowed along the bottom of the base as the stock found support at its 200-day moving average. The right side of the base formed in a hurry as the stock gapped up and soared 14% on April 27 (1).
"
982,DISH,"Turnover fell sharply as it shaped a handle, then surged 110% on May 14 as Baidu briefly rose above a 132.90 buy point (2). The stock pulled back slightly below the entry but soon cleared it again.

It's difficult to know when the optimal time to buy shares is if you don't know how to spot or interpret a stock's basing pattern. Buying at the wrong time raises downside risk.Keep in mind that all bases are not created equal — nor are all good bases perfect. And there are various patterns, including the cup, cup without handle, flat base, double-bottom and so forth. But there are some basic similarities, which will be covered in detail in subsequent columns.For now, remember these key points to check when studying bases: the length of the base; the size of the decline; the smoothness of price action; visual symmetry; and the importance of accumulation, which indicates that savvy institutional investors are eagerly grabbing and holding shares before the actual breakout occurs.The size of the decline, or correction, in a cup base should generally be between 12% and 33%. In a severe bear market, deeper bases may form.A proper cup base needs to span a minimum of seven weeks, while a flat base can be as short as five weeks. Some bases form handles. A proper handle forms in the upper half of a base and drifts slightly downward along its price lows. Volume should mostly ease until the breakout.Baidu (BIDU) got off to a rocky start right after rocketing 470% above an IPO price of 27 on its Aug. 5, 2005, market debut. But the stock eventually came back to form a series of bases on its way up, including the one shown in the daily chart above.In early January 2007, it began shaping a base. The stock pulled back 31%, in proper range. Volume slowed along the bottom of the base as the stock found support at its 200-day moving average. The right side of the base formed in a hurry as the stock gapped up and soared 14% on April 27 (1).Turnover fell sharply as it shaped a handle, then surged 110% on May 14 as Baidu briefly rose above a 132.90 buy point (2). The stock pulled back slightly below the entry but soon cleared it again. Baidu gained 223% in the next six months.

1053,DISH,"AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) are expected to bid for spectrum. Sprint (S), which has the most spectrum among carriers after acquiring Clearwire last year, says that it will not bid. Nor has Google (GOOGL), or any other Internet firm, registered to bid.
"
1054,DISH,"Dish Network, controlled by co-founder Charlie Ergen, has said that its growth will come from providing mobile video services to pay-TV subscribers. Dish has more than 14 million subscribers.
"
1055,DISH,"Dish Network has cobbled together nearly 55 MHz of spectrum and has been looking, so far in vain, for a wireless partner.
"
1056,DISH,"Dish figures to be a key player in the AWS-3 auction, says UBS analyst John Hodulik.
"
1057,DISH,"""AT&T and Verizon will clearly be the big bidders,"" Hodulik told IBD. ""T-Mobile will also top up its holdings in markets where it is light.
"
1058,DISH,"""The big question is whether Ergen will pay 'retail' (bid in a competitive auction) for a lot of spectrum. He did for his chunk of 700 MHz spectrum, but that's a small piece of his total holdings.""
"
1059,DISH,"In the 2008 auction, Dish Network acquired 168 licenses across the U.S. for $712 million.
"
1060,DISH,"Then, in 2012, Dish spent an estimated $3 billion acquiring spectrum from two bankrupt companies. Federal regulators granted Dish Network a waiver to use the airwaves, originally earmarked for satellite services, for 4G wireless services, as long as Dish built out a network.
"
1061,DISH,"Industry analysts have valued Dish's airwaves at $7 billion to $17 billion, depending on whether Dish ultimately sells the spectrum to a wireless phone company or finds a partner.
"
1062,DISH,"The outcome of the AWS-3 auction will help set the value of Dish Network's spectrum, analysts say. Dish has an interest in seeing bidding heat up and could play a part in making that happen.
"
1063,DISH,"Dish could also bid for spectrum targeted by Verizon or T-Mobile, some analysts speculate, aiming to drive them to the bargaining table for a network-sharing arrangement after the auction is over.
"
1064,DISH,"Dish Network has registered as American AWS-3 for the auction. It may have joint bidding arrangements with Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless, analysts say.
"
1065,DISH,"Analyst Hodulik estimates that the AWS-3 auction could raise up to $15 billion. Adam Ilkowitz, a Nomura Securities analyst, estimates $17 billion in auction proceeds. Citibank analyst Michael Rollins and Oppenheimer's Tim Horan both estimate that bids could reach up to $20 billion.
"
1066,DISH,"""Spectrum bidding will be heavy,"" said Horan via email. ""The wild card in the auctions will be T-Mobile, which may be quite aggressive.""
"
1067,DISH,"The AWS-3 spectrum is located near frequency bands where Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T already have holdings. It's adjacent to spectrum held by Dish.
"
1068,DISH,"The 65 MHz of spectrum being auctioned includes 50 MHz of ""downlink"" spectrum and 15 MHz of ""uplink"" spectrum.
"
1069,DISH,"Dish Network has accumulated plenty of downlink spectrum for potentially whisking mobile video to subscribers, but it needs uplink spectrum for two-way communications. Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman expects Dish Network to bid for the 15 MHz of uplink spectrum in the AWS-3 auction.
"
1070,DISH,"Besides Dish, other companies will be closely watched in the auction. Nomura's Ilkowitz says that one surprise entrant is an entity going by the name SAAS, which he says is ""a combination for former Lightsquared CEO Sanjiv Ahuja and potentially former Vodafone (VOD) CEO Arun Sarin.""

1090,DISH,"Several analysts have upped their Q3 and Q4 estimates for T-Mobile's postpaid subscriber additions, but others warn that T-Mobile's momentum will slow in 2015 and 2016.

1108,DISH,"Time Warner's decision to sell HBO on the Web in 2015 and CBS' plans to launch a subscription streaming service are fresh proof to pay-TV companies that the trend is not their friend.
"
1109,DISH,"Federal regulators are mulling rules to help Internet TV providers acquire content and live programming from media companies. Dish Network (DISH), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Sony are ramping up Internet video, also called over-the-top (OTT) services, that may soon debut.

1110,DISH,"The Web streaming services target young adults and other consumers that ""cut the cord,"" industry jargon for the growing number of people that disconnect pay-TV service in favor of more affordable online video options and on-demand content.
"
1111,DISH,"As pay-TV subscriptions fall, cable-TV channels such as Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN and TNT reach fewer U.S. households, impacting their revenue stream. More advertising dollars, meanwhile, are flowing to Google's (GOOGL) YouTube and other online streaming websites as broadcast TV audience ratings fall.
"
1112,DISH,"Cable Has Broadband
"
1113,DISH,"Shares in Comcast (CMCSA), Time Warner Cable (TWC), satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network and other pay-TV companies fell on Thursday as investors digested the latest moves from Time Warner's (TWX) HBO and CBS (CBS). Pay-TV stocks rallied Friday.
"
1114,DISH,"Pay-TV companies face big challenges to preserve their ecosystem in the face of a growing OTT threat.
"
1115,DISH,"""The Golden Goose appears to be shedding some feathers,"" said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, referring to the annual increases in pay-TV subscriber bills that have fed cable industry free cash flows as well as programming fee increases garnered by media companies.
"
1116,DISH,"On the other hand, ""The Goose is not cooked quite yet,"" McCormack added.
"
1117,DISH,"Cable TV companies are likely better off than satellite TV providers, he says.
"
1118,DISH,"That's because cable TV companies are the biggest providers of high-speed Internet services to homes. They stand to keep that revenue stream as online streaming services expand and likely require faster connections.
"
1119,DISH,"Satellite TV Woes
"
1120,DISH,"Satellite firms don't sell broadband services. With prospects for video subscriber growth bleak, DirecTV Group (DTV) agreed in May to be acquired by AT&T (T).
"
1121,DISH,"Much depends on the ability of Internet service providers to charge a premium for the fastest broadband connections, perhaps bundled with out-of-home Wi-Fi, analysts say. Long-run, Internet service providers could try to impose usage-based billing systems, though regulators might block that course.
"
1122,DISH,"To target cord cutters looking for ""a la carte"" packages, marketing may shift to broadband-first deals. Comcast, Cox and AT&T have stepped up promotions of cheaper, $40 to $50 monthly plans that feature high-speed Internet and basic TV — without ESPN, Discovery and other channels. In the future, pay-TV companies may package their broadband products with popular streaming services from Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) or Hulu, says Moody's analyst Karen Berckmann.
"
1123,DISH,"What's clear is that the pay-TV ecosystem is fraying.
"
1124,DISH,"HBO's decision to launch a stand-alone Web offering that does not require consumers to have a cable TV or satellite subscription could mark a turning point, some analysts say, by encouraging more cable partners to dabble in Web offerings.
"
1125,DISH,"Time Warner had been ""the most stalwart protector of the status quo,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.
"
1126,DISH,"Disney's ESPN sports channel, an early adopter of online streaming services, has required users of its app to log in as pay-TV customers, a process called authentication. The danger for pay-TV companies is that more media companies will stray from the TV Everywhere authentication model and offer content directly to consumers via the Web.
"
1127,DISH,"HBO CEO Richard Plepler cited 10 million ""broadband-only"" homes in the U.S. in explaining its decision. ""In 2015 we will go beyond the wall and launch a stand-alone, over-the-top service with the potential to produce hundreds of millions in revenue,"" Plepler said at Time Warner's investor day. Half of the 10 million homes subscribe to streaming video services, he said. HBO's 10 million figure doesn't refer only to cord-cutters as such, because it includes homes that never had pay-TV.
"
1128,DISH,"HBO's rivalry with Netflix as well as 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) aborted bid for Time Warner may have contributed to the decision to launch a stand-alone streaming service, analysts say. HBO generated $4.9 billion in 2013 revenue vs. $4.4 billion at Netflix, whose sales jumped 21% last year.
"
1129,DISH,"Netflix late Wednesday said Q3 subscriber growth fell short of its forecasts. The company also reported rising content acquisition costs and gave a weak Q4 EPS forecast. Its stock plunged 19% Thursday.
"
1130,DISH,"HBO did not disclose a launch date, pricing, or other specifics of its streaming strategy. One decision HBO faces, analysts say, is whether to make hit shows such as ""Game of Thrones"" available at the same time to Web and pay-TV customers, or delay Internet availability. Cable TV companies typically charge $15 monthly for HBO as part of top-tier plans.
"
1131,DISH,"Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar says HBO still has a lot at stake in the pay-TV ecosystem, including 30 million U.S. subscribers. If HBO's goal is tapping new consumer demographics, Venkateshwar says it can do that by teaming with cable TV firms for ""skinny broadband packages.""
"
1132,DISH,"Comcast's Internet Plus bundle includes 25 Mbps Internet service, basic TV and HBO for $50. Cox's $60 ""Flex Watch"" package includes 50 Mbps broadband, basic TV, HBO and Starz.
"
1133,DISH,"The cable plans now require customers to get a set-top box to access HBO. But, Venkateshwar sees them evolving toward broadband-only services. Cable industry-led plans, he says, ""have the potential to reshape the competitive dynamics for HBO relative to Netflix.""
"
1134,DISH,"If consumers don't buy Internet services as part of a ""triple play"" or ""double play"" bundle that includes video and/or phone services, pay-TV firms typically charge $20 to $30 more monthly. Even so, cord-cutters don't have to pay for channels they don't watch. Pay-TV companies have passed on rising programming fees to consumers in monthly bills.
"
1135,DISH,"Jefferies' McCormack calls sports programming the ""ace-in-the-hole"" of pay-TV companies. CBS broke new ground by offering live streaming as part of its new $6 monthly ""All Access"" service.

Pay-TV stocks rallied Friday.Pay-TV companies face big challenges to preserve their ecosystem in the face of a growing OTT threat.""The Golden Goose appears to be shedding some feathers,"" said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, referring to the annual increases in pay-TV subscriber bills that have fed cable industry free cash flows as well as programming fee increases garnered by media companies.On the other hand, ""The Goose is not cooked quite yet,"" McCormack added.Cable TV companies are likely better off than satellite TV providers, he says.That's because cable TV companies are the biggest providers of high-speed Internet services to homes. They stand to keep that revenue stream as online streaming services expand and likely require faster connections.Satellite TV WoesSatellite firms don't sell broadband services. With prospects for video subscriber growth bleak, DirecTV Group (DTV) agreed in May to be acquired by AT&T (T).Much depends on the ability of Internet service providers to charge a premium for the fastest broadband connections, perhaps bundled with out-of-home Wi-Fi, analysts say. Long-run, Internet service providers could try to impose usage-based billing systems, though regulators might block that course.To target cord cutters looking for ""a la carte"" packages, marketing may shift to broadband-first deals. Comcast, Cox and AT&T have stepped up promotions of cheaper, $40 to $50 monthly plans that feature high-speed Internet and basic TV — without ESPN, Discovery and other channels. In the future, pay-TV companies may package their broadband products with popular streaming services from Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) or Hulu, says Moody's analyst Karen Berckmann.What's clear is that the pay-TV ecosystem is fraying.HBO's decision to launch a stand-alone Web offering that does not require consumers to have a cable TV or satellite subscription could mark a turning point, some analysts say, by encouraging more cable partners to dabble in Web offerings.Time Warner had been ""the most stalwart protector of the status quo,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.Disney's ESPN sports channel, an early adopter of online streaming services, has required users of its app to log in as pay-TV customers, a process called authentication. The danger for pay-TV companies is that more media companies will stray from the TV Everywhere authentication model and offer content directly to consumers via the Web.HBO CEO Richard Plepler cited 10 million ""broadband-only"" homes in the U.S. in explaining its decision. ""In 2015 we will go beyond the wall and launch a stand-alone, over-the-top service with the potential to produce hundreds of millions in revenue,"" Plepler said at Time Warner's investor day. Half of the 10 million homes subscribe to streaming video services, he said. HBO's 10 million figure doesn't refer only to cord-cutters as such, because it includes homes that never had pay-TV.HBO's rivalry with Netflix as well as 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) aborted bid for Time Warner may have contributed to the decision to launch a stand-alone streaming service, analysts say. HBO generated $4.9 billion in 2013 revenue vs. $4.4 billion at Netflix, whose sales jumped 21% last year.Netflix late Wednesday said Q3 subscriber growth fell short of its forecasts. The company also reported rising content acquisition costs and gave a weak Q4 EPS forecast. Its stock plunged 19% Thursday.HBO did not disclose a launch date, pricing, or other specifics of its streaming strategy. One decision HBO faces, analysts say, is whether to make hit shows such as ""Game of Thrones"" available at the same time to Web and pay-TV customers, or delay Internet availability. Cable TV companies typically charge $15 monthly for HBO as part of top-tier plans.Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar says HBO still has a lot at stake in the pay-TV ecosystem, including 30 million U.S. subscribers. If HBO's goal is tapping new consumer demographics, Venkateshwar says it can do that by teaming with cable TV firms for ""skinny broadband packages.""Comcast's Internet Plus bundle includes 25 Mbps Internet service, basic TV and HBO for $50. Cox's $60 ""Flex Watch"" package includes 50 Mbps broadband, basic TV, HBO and Starz.The cable plans now require customers to get a set-top box to access HBO. But, Venkateshwar sees them evolving toward broadband-only services. Cable industry-led plans, he says, ""have the potential to reshape the competitive dynamics for HBO relative to Netflix.""If consumers don't buy Internet services as part of a ""triple play"" or ""double play"" bundle that includes video and/or phone services, pay-TV firms typically charge $20 to $30 more monthly. Even so, cord-cutters don't have to pay for channels they don't watch. Pay-TV companies have passed on rising programming fees to consumers in monthly bills.Jefferies' McCormack calls sports programming the ""ace-in-the-hole"" of pay-TV companies. CBS broke new ground by offering live streaming as part of its new $6 monthly ""All Access"" service. But, CBS' streaming service doesn't include National Football League games or other live sports.

1136,DISH,"The 13 largest pay-TV providers in the U.S. collectively lost about 150,000 net video subscribers in the third quarter.That was a Q3 all-time record and compared with just 25,000 subscriber losses in Q3 2013, according to Leichtman Research.The data suggest cord cutting continues to take hold as people cancel their pay-TV service and turn to Internet services such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Prime, and Google's (GOOGL) YouTube to watch TV programs.Cable TV companies took the biggest hit. The top nine cable companies lost 440,000 video subscribers in Q3. Time Warner Cable (TWC) led the list with subscriber losses of 182,000, followed by Comcast (CMCSA) at 81,000.DirecTV (DTV) and Dish Network (DISH), the two satellite TV providers, lost 40,000 subscribers combined.AT&T (T) U-verse and Verizon (VZ) FiOS, the two phone companies offering pay-TV services, were the only major providers to show market gains. AT&T added 216,000 subscribers while Verizon added 114,000.RELATED:AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Dish Among Likely AWS-3 Spectrum Auction Bidders.

1137,DISH,"The Federal Communications Commission could raise the U.S. broadband standard as soon as January, a move that's aimed at increasing network investments but that also might have implications for Comcast's proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable.
"
1138,DISH,"Internet service providers oppose increasing the broadband standard from the current 4 megabits per second (mbps) to 10 or higher.
"
1139,DISH,"For one thing, most ISPs would need to step up investments to reach that speed, mainly DSL upgrades in rural areas. ISPs want to decide what ""broadband"" is, not have regulators impose it on them.
"
1140,DISH,"And while an increase to 10 mbps appears most likely, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler hinted at raising the bar much higher in an Oct. 1 speech when he said, ""Table stakes for the 21st century is 25 mbps.""
"
1141,DISH,"Wheeler says that U.S. households need faster Internet connections for high-definition video streaming and emerging apps. He adds that faster broadband would boost education, health care and the economy.
"
1142,DISH,"AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association in September asked the FCC to keep the standard at 4 mbps.
"
1143,DISH,"The Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger is another element of the issue. Opponents of the merger have cited Comcast's broadband market share as a reason why regulators should block the deal or impose tough conditions. Comcast says that the combined company would have 35% of U.S. broadband subscribers.
"
1144,DISH,"If the broadband threshold is increased to 10 mbps from 4, then Comcast's broadband market share would rise. Many slower DSL phone lines in rural areas, owned by telecom ISPs, would not reach 10 mbps. And even bigger market share for the combined Comcast-TWC, in theory, lowers the chances that regulators will approve the merger without stringent conditions — if they approve at all.
"
1145,DISH,"The merger of the Nos. 1 and 2 cable TV firms, though, isn't the target of the FCC's move to refine broadband, Guggenheim Partners analyst Paul Gallant told IBD via email.
"
1146,DISH,"""It's something they've said for a while they want to do,"" he said. ""But nonetheless, it would have the effect of making Comcast look more dominant in broadband, which in turn strengthens the FCC's leverage over the companies for more extensive conditions.""
"
1147,DISH,"Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, agrees.
"
1148,DISH,"""Comcast would be viewed as having materially higher market share if broadband were to be defined as 10 mbps or 25 mbps (rather) than under today's definition,"" Moffett said in a research report. ""This would bolster the FCC's and Department of Justice's 'moral authority' to impose more significant conditions on the transaction or perhaps even to block the deal outright.""
"
1149,DISH,"Jeff Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, speculates that the FCC could require Comcast to provide minimum guaranteed download speeds of 60 mbps to 100 mbps within five years as a condition of the TWC deal.
"
1150,DISH,"On Oct. 22, the FCC paused its review of the Comcast-TWC merger as well as AT&T's proposed acquisition of DirecTV Group (DTV). The FCC said that it will decide how to handle highly confidential documents related to agreements with media companies.
"
1151,DISH,"Comcast expects approval of the TWC acquisition in early 2015, but some analysts say that the review could stretch until Q2.
"
1152,DISH,"The timing is important because if the FCC adopts a new broadband definition in January, it still might be able to apply the new threshhold to the Comcast-TWC review.
"
1153,DISH,"""Wheeler has laid the groundwork for aggressive action against Comcast/TWC, portraying the key broadband market as speeds of 25 mbps or more,"" research firm The Capital Forum said in a report. ""This view aligns with those of merger opponents, not Comcast.""
"
1154,DISH,"Conditions imposed on Comcast-TWC could involve net neutrality.
"
1155,DISH,"David Cohen, Comcast executive vice president and chief lobbyist, told IBD that the FCC's broadband speed standard has no relevance to the Time Warner Cable deal.
"
1156,DISH,"""It is not analytically connected to our transaction,"" Cohen said. ""The definition of broadband is all about the government's aspirational goals. In a transaction review, the government looks at relevant markets. There has never been a relevant market analysis within the antitrust, FCC or DOJ purview that relied on a definition of broadband speeds.""
"
1157,DISH,"Nor does Comcast believe that its broadband market share should be looked at nationally. The service areas of Comcast and TWC do not overlap.
"
1158,DISH,"""Relevant markets are defined by consumer choice and consumer options,"" Cohen said. ""Broadband is sold in local and regional markets. It's not sold on a national basis.""
"
1159,DISH,"In 2010, the FCC raised the definition of broadband to 4 mbps from 200 kilobits per second. The FCC in June proposed to redefine broadband to 10 mbps or higher for purposes of its Connect America Fund (CAF) broadband build-out initiative, which provides subsidies to rural phone companies.
"
1160,DISH,"Wheeler has aimed to promote ""municipal broadband,"" a term for local governments partnering with the likes of Google (GOOGL) or others, in order to build high-speed networks. Gallant says that Wheeler hopes Google or others offering superfast Internet services will pressure cable TV companies broadly, not only in top U.S. markets.
"
1161,DISH,"Speaking at the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors annual conference on Oct. 1, Wheeler said: ""We need faster networks in more places ... . Unfortunately, today there is an inverse relationship between competition and throughput. Three-quarters of American homes have no competitive choice at 25 mbps. That includes almost 20% who have no option at all at those speeds.""
"
1162,DISH,"Comcast's Cohen says that the TWC merger would not reduce competition.
"
1163,DISH,"""Chairman Wheeler notes accurately that as you move up the speed ladder, there is less and less competition. There's no way to dispute that,"" Cohen said. ""The next question is whether there is anything in our transaction that reduces the level of competition in a relevant market at any speed level, and the answer is there's nothing.""
"
1164,DISH,"Consumer group Public Knowledge and video streamer Netflix (NFLX) in filings have asked the FCC to increase the broadband threshhold to 25 mbps. Dish Network (DISH) opposes the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal, saying that the combined firm would have 50% of residential broadband connections if the 25 mbps standard is used.
"
1165,DISH,"Telecom companies such as CenturyLink (CTL) and AT&T, meanwhile, could be impacted if the FCC adopts at least a 10 Mbps standard.
"
1166,DISH,"""This adds more pressure to AT&T to upgrade their DSL network broadband speeds,"" said Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Capital.
"
1167,DISH,"AT&T had 14.84 million consumer broadband connections as of Sept. 30, including 12 million customers on its U-Verse high-speed Internet network. The others are either DSL residential lines or satellite broadband customers.
"
1168,DISH,"In a regulatory filing, AT&T said: ""Given the pace at which the industry is investing in advanced capabilities, there is no present need to redefine advanced capabilities. Consumer behavior strongly reinforces the conclusion that a 10 mbps service exceeds what many Americans need today to enable basic, high-quality transmissions.""
"
1169,DISH,"AT&T has stepped up broadband investments. AT&T said in September that it has completed rolling out its 1 gbps ""GigaPower"" service to parts of the Austin, Texas, area. AT&T GigaPower is also available in parts of Dallas and Fort Worth.

1171,DISH,"Sprint and T-Mobile shareholders punished both stocks on Wednesday after merger talks between the two wireless carriers ended, but Dish Network rose as its CEO demurred on any takeover bid.Struggling Sprint (S) halted its pursuit of T-Mobile US (TMUS), the industry's comeback kid, after concluding that a deal would not win regulatory approval. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler praised Sprint's decision. U.S regulators prefer a national market with at least four players, including leaders Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T), rather than three.Besides announcing that it wouldn't pursue T-Mobile any longer, Japan's SoftBank, which owns 80% of Sprint, replaced Sprint CEO Dan Hesse with Marcelo Claure, the former CEO of wireless phone distributor Brightstar.Sprint stock plunged 19%, while T-Mobile stock fell 8.4%. Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), which owns 67% of ""Uncarrier""-branded T-Mobile, saw its U.S. shares slip 2.7%. SoftBank's stock tumbled 3.5% in Japan.Analysts see Dish Network (DISH); France's Iliad, which has made an offer; America Movil (AMX); and No. 1 cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) as potential buyers of T-Mobile, which has gained market share thanks to its aggressive marketing.Despite earlier statements of interest, Dish Network Chairman Charlie Ergen was cautious on the satellite broadcaster's earnings conference call early Wednesday.""It's not a surprise that Sprint is walking away from T-Mo. Regulatory officials sent clear messages,"" Ergen said. ""Obviously, we need to re-look at things based on what's happened on the M&A side the last 24 hours.""The No. 1 U.S. satellite TV broadcaster, DirecTV Group (DTV), agreed in May to be purchased by AT&T.""Obviously the AT&T-DirecTV deal probably lessened some optionality that we had. The Sprint announcement probably increases some optionality,"" Ergen said.In May, Ergen said that if Sprint and T-Mobile didn't merge, then he would be interested in T-Mobile. And last November, Ergen said that buying T-Mobile was still ""on the table"" despite Sprint's interest.Ergen has touted mobile video services as the satellite-TV firm's next growth engine as its core business matures.For Q2, Dish reported fewer video subscriber losses than expected but turned in a financially mixed quarter, with EPS light and revenue in line with estimates. Dish said that it lost 44,000 subscribers in Q2, compared with 78,000 in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had expected a loss of 77,000 subscribers. Dish had 14.05 million customers as of June 30.Ergen Controls Dish VotingErgen, who holds nearly 90% of Dish's voting power, has had wireless setbacks. At one time, Dish pursued MetroPCS Communications, a regional wireless carrier eventually acquired by T-Mobile. Last year, Dish lost takeover battles for Sprint and Clearwire to SoftBank.Federal regulators in 2012 granted Dish a waiver to use airwaves that it acquired from two bankrupt satellite companies for 4G wireless service, as long as Dish builds out a network. To do that, Dish needs to find a wireless partner or to make an acquisition.Sprint — which will likely need cash for building out its 4G network and for upcoming spectrum auctions — and T-Mobile loom as possible Dish targets or partners.""With Sprint out of the way, this may finally be Dish Network's moment to bid for T-Mobile,"" said William Power, an analyst at R.W. Baird""Deutsche Telekom still has several exit options, the best strategically being Dish — who would bring a material amount of spectrum, a customer base, the potential for video bundling and experience in the U.S. market,"" Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Paul de Sa said in a research report.French telecom upstart Iliad last week made a surprise $15 billion, $33 per share bid for a controlling stake in T-Mobile. But Deutsche Telekom has said that it's not in talks with Iliad, which has been a price cutter in France.According to Reuters, Iliad is speaking with Dish and other U.S. firms to pursue a joint bid for T-Mobile. Potential partners include cable TV firms.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, is skeptical of a Dish bid for T-Mobile.""Is Ergen now a buyer rather than seller?"" Moffett asked in a report. ""Dish's valuation assumes the company will sell its spectrum. Whether it would be accorded the same valuation (as a buyer) is unclear.""Dish has more than $9 billion in cash on its balance sheet and could borrow from banks to fund a wireless deal. Analysts have pegged the value of Dish's spectrum to a wide range of $7 billion to $17 billion. It's not clear if regulators would set conditions on a sale.Moffett, on the other hand, also said that ""the logic of an America Movil bid (for T-Mobile) looks very compelling.""Mexico-based America Movil, controlled by Carlos Slim, operates U.S. prepaid firm TracFone. TracFone, which leases network capacity from AT&T and Verizon, has almost 26 million U.S. subscribers. AT&T in June sold its 8.27% stake in America Movil for $5.57 billion, making it more plausible that the Latin American firm might make a push into the U.S.Mobile VideoMeanwhile, AT&T's proposed acquisition of DirecTV Group could spur Comcast to bid for T-Mobile US to compete better with AT&T in mobile video services, speculates UBS analyst John Hodulik.Comcast, a one-time investor in Sprint, has touted its plans to expand public Wi-Fi networks. Comcast also has the option to lease wholesale network capacity from Verizon Wireless under the terms of a radio-spectrum sale. But Hodulik says that Comcast would be better off owning a wireless network.Comcast is seeking regulatory approval to acquire No. 2 cable firm Time Warner Cable (TWC).

1173,DISH,"Sprint's (S) stock plunged amid reports it has dropped plans to acquire T-Mobile US (TMUS), which is 67% owned by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY).Shares in Sprint were down 13% before the market open in the stock market today. T-Mobile's stock fell nearly 9%.Japan's SoftBank, which owns 80% of Sprint, has been pushing for a T-Mobile merger. SoftBank's stock fell in Japan on Wednesday, though the company holds a large stake in Alibaba Group, which plans an initial public offering. Shares in Deutsche Telekom also fell.Sprint also reportedly plans to replace its CEO, Dan Hesse, with Brightstar founder Marcelo Claure. SoftBank acquired control of Brightstar in January.U.S. regulators have signaled they would oppose a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, the third- and fourth-biggest U.S. wireless firms. Sprint has said it needs bigger scale to take on leaders AT&T; (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).The Federal Communications Commission last week said it would not let Sprint and T-Mobile bid jointly to acquire airwaves in an upcoming auction.Sprint's prospects without a T-Mobile deal appear dim. In Q2, it lost postpaid subscribers for the 25th time in 28 quarters. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), which aims to break into the wireless business, looms as a bidder or partner of T-Mobile, analysts say.Dish on Wednesday reported Q2 revenue of $3.69 billion, up 5.8% from a year earlier, in-line with views. It earned 46 cents per share, compared to a 2-cent per-share loss a year earlier. Analysts had estimated profit of 51 cents. Shares were up 2% before the market open.""We see significant challenges for Sprint shares given operational weakness, and now an uncertain future,"" said Mike McCormack, an analyst at Jefferies. ""We see little downside support given the large valuation premium versus peers. For T-Mobile, other bidders, particularly Dish, and standout operations, should soothe nerves. We look for comments from Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen on today's earnings call.""Bernstein analyst Paul de Sa agrees.""Deutsche Telekom still has several exit options, the best strategically being Dish — who would bring a material amount of spectrum, a customer base, the potential for video bundling, and experience in the U.S. market — unlike international buyers (for example, Iliad) who bring nothing except cash and likely overly optimistic assessments of the transferability of their capabilities.""French telecom upstart Iliad last week made a surprise $15 billion bid for a controlling stake in T-Mobile, but Deutsche Telekom has said it's not in talks with Iliad, which has been a price cutter in France.Sprint could cut prices to spark growth.""We expect the wireless space to trade down on this news as it increases the likelihood of additional price cuts,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan in a report.There has been speculation Japan's SoftBank may bid for U.K.-based Vodafone (VOD) if its efforts in the U.S. wireless market stall.

1178,DISH,"While mobile phone companies worldwide continue to upgrade their wireless networks to 4G LTE technology, some are racing ahead with faster 4.5G LTE Advanced networks.ABI Research anticipates that 45 carriers will have commercially launched LTE Advanced by the fourth quarter. North America and Asia Pacific are the leading regions for the next-generation networks, while Western Europe trails slightly.The total number of subscribers for 4G LTE and 4.5G LTE Advanced is expected to grow to nearly 411 million and 22 million, respectively, by year's end, ABI says. The growing appetite for on-the-go, real-time information and mobile entertainment services is fueling the trend, ABI analysts Jake Saunders and Cheri Wong said in a note.About 337 mobile networks worldwide already have deployed 4G LTE.

1196,DISH,"Will the Internet TV ambitions of Dish Network and Verizon Communications dovetail into a merger or network-sharing deal between them?That scenario looms, some analysts say, as both the satellite TV broadcaster and the nation's No. 1 wireless phone company ready Web and mobile TV services.Dish Network (DISH) is expected to launch an Internet TV service — also called over-the-top or OTT service — by year's end. Dish on Sept. 16 added Scripps Network Interactive (SNI) as a content partner for its streaming video service, which might be called NuTV. Dish earlier signed up Walt Disney (DIS) and A+E Network as content providers for its OTT service.Verizon (VZ) executives, at a Goldman Sachs conference this month, said they expect to offer a streaming video service over broadband networks and their own wireless network by mid-2015. Verizon has been in talks with TV broadcasters and major content providers about its OTT offering.Dish and Verizon are expected to shake up the traditional pay-TV business with their Internet TV services. They're targeting millennials, the generation ages 18 to 30, those most likely to ""cut the cord"" and disconnect traditional pay TV in favor of free or lower-cost content they can get via the Internet on multiple devices. Dish might price its Internet TV service at $20 to $30 a month, analysts say.Speculation that Verizon might acquire Dish Network, or at least buy its radio spectrum, picked up after AT&T (T) announced in May that it would buy DirecTV Group (DTV), the No. 1 satellite TV broadcaster, for $48.5 billion.Verizon has said it's not interested in buying a satellite TV firm, but Macquarie Capital analyst Kevin Smithen says Verizon would become more interested if Dish's Internet TV platform succeeds.""Verizon has no interest in acquiring a linear (traditional) TV business with tail risk on cash flows,"" Smithen told IBD via email. ""However, Verizon has discussed the launch of its own Internet TV service in 2015, and we believe the Dish OTT content relationships could help give that product some scale and credibility.""DirecTV has 20.2 million U.S. subscribers, while AT&T's Uverse serves 5.85 million video customers. With so many subscribers, AT&T is well-positioned to negotiate with content providers, analysts say. Dish has 14.1 million pay-TV customers and Verizon has 5.42 million with its FiOS TV.Verizon leads all wireless carriers with more than 98.6 million postpaid subscribers, users who are billed monthly.'Mobile First' Video RightsThe carrier has told some analysts that it expects to be able to negotiate for ""mobile first"" rights to content, using its wireless subscriber base, rather than based on its FiOS TV and broadband services.""Management believes out-of-home content rights will be vastly different than in-home rights given the variability in mobile content consumption — more targeted, shorter duration content,"" Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack said in a report.So while Verizon has the least spectrum per subscriber among the big four national wireless firms, it still aims to expand mobile video services even though that will gobble up a lot of bandwidth.Dish, meanwhile, has cobbled together more than 50 megahertz of radio spectrum. It could buy more in a government auction slated for November. The outcome of that auction could impact Dish's strategic decisions, depending on how much spectrum Verizon or T-Mobile US (TMUS) acquire and what prices are paid for new licenses. Dish is seen as a potential T-Mobile buyer.Regulators likely would approve a Verizon-Dish merger if the combined company agreed to divest some of its radio spectrum, Andrew Lipman, a partner at law firm Bingham McCutchen, told attendees at the Goldman Sachs media and telecom conference.Verizon and Dish, however, could instead partner in a network-sharing deal, JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick said in a research report this summer.""Verizon and Dish could agree to some level of special relationship around selling video and wireless outside of the FiOS territory, which is only around 16% of the country and mostly outside of Dish's core rural markets,"" Cusick wrote.Verizon initially could buy around 20MHz of spectrum from Dish, for around $7 billion to $10 billion, and hold options to buy the rest of Dish's spectrum down the road, he says.Both Seeking GrowthDish Network and Verizon have reasons to jump into Internet TV.Revenue and subscriber growth has slowed in Dish's core pay-TV business. Verizon's wireless revenue growth has slowed as well. Verizon views mobile video as a new growth engine.Verizon in January agreed to buy Intel's (INTC) Media unit and Web-based OnCue cloud TV platform. In December, Verizon acquired EdgeCast, a provider of content delivery services. It has also purchased upLynk and its technology for uploading video.Verizon operates an online video business with Outerwall (OUTR)-owned Redbox. That business has enabled Verizon to study a streaming business model and consumer viewing habits, analysts say.At the Goldman conference, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said a mobile video offering should be ready by mid-2015, as talks with content providers are ongoing. Media firms have warmed up to offering OTT rights, realizing that's what millennials want, analysts say.""That whole ecosystem, I think, is coming together,"" McAdam said. ""It has been primed for a while. But as I say, over the last six months to a year, that dialogue is changing dramatically.""The challenge for OTT providers, analysts say, is getting premium live or first-run content to show with OTT services.Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman says Dish and Verizon both aim to get better terms for programming as they expand into Web- and mobile-video services. Dish has a lot at stake, he added in a research report.""Dish's current business model of providing linear video over a fixed satellite network is mature,"" Feldman wrote. ""Having an OTT service (could) improve Dish's negotiating position with programmers and lead to potential cost savings for content delivered over its satellite network.""

But Q4 broadband revenue for cable leaders Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR), Cablevision Systems (CVC) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) rose from 8.7% to 14%.And total revenue for Comcast, Charter, Cablevision and satellite broadcasters DirecTV Group (DTV) and Dish Network (DISH) rose from 5.5% to 7.2%.""Broadband continues to be a source of strength for the cable companies,"" said UBS analyst John Hodulik in a research report on Q4. ""High-speed data revenue growth accelerated slightly to around 11% (on average) given price increases and sales of higher-speed services.""One sticking point with regulators for Comcast's pending acquisition of TWC is the companies' broadband share. Comcast added 1.3 million broadband Internet subscribers in 2013, to hit a total of 20.7 million, says Leichtman Research. It says TWC gained 211,000 broadband subscribers, to 11.6 million.Phone Upgrades Paying OffPhone companies AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ), meanwhile, are seeing gains after upgrading their copper networks with fiber-optic technology to offer TV and broadband services. Verizon's FiOS revenue rose 15% in Q4, while AT&T's consumer U-verse revenue jumped 20%.Rate hikes, equipment fees and surcharges all contribute to ARPU growth.This year, Verizon has increased monthly FiOS rates by $8 for customers who are in a contract and don't have price guarantees. Analysts, though, say about 80% of Verizon FiOS customers have such guarantees under TV/Internet/phone packages.The company has stepped up marketing of its triple-play bundle, with 50 megabit-per-second Internet service, for $89.99 monthly.AT&T has upped monthly bills for U-verse TV customers by $3, and hiked fees $5 for broadband-only customers. It also increases its monthly broadcast TV surcharge by $1 to $3.Time Warner Cable in February added a $2.25 monthly broadcast TV fee.Comcast added a $1.50 broadcast TV fee in January and raised 2014 monthly bills by 2% on average. Like TWC, Comcast has profited from new cable-modem rental fees.DirecTV has increased its monthly rates by 3.7%, or $2 to $3 on average. Dish has announced a $5 increase to its basic TV package.Amid the industry's apparent pricing power, consumers continue to shift to online video. Industry subscriber losses due to cord-cutting are forecast to continue, as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and others add more original content to their offerings.Morgan Stanley, in a March 13 report, said 19% of existing pay-TV subscribers it polled are interested in canceling service and using online video, up from 15% in 2011.In Q4, 85.6% of U.S. households subscribed to monthly pay-TV service, down from an all-time high of 87.8% in 2010, estimates research firm MoffettNathanson.The total number of U.S. pay-TV subscribers fell 251,000 in 2013, to about 100 million, SNL Kagan said Wednesday.Earlier, UBS had pegged a lower number, saying cable TV system operators lost 1.75 million video subscribers in 2013, with almost half of those at Time Warner Cable. Satellite broadcasters DirecTV and Dish added 170,000 subscribers, down from 288,000 in 2012. AT&T and Verizon combined added 1.46 million new subscribers, up from 1.3 million. That adds up to 130,000 net subscriber loss for the three platforms in 2013.The phone companies now hold nearly 10% of the pay-TV market, though they've lost broadband share to cable.

1281,DISH,"European regulators soon will rule on two wireless-industry mergers that will signal how the EU feels about further wireless consolidation. The pending deals would shrink the number of mobile carriers in two countries from four to three.The European Union has been reviewing Spain-based Telefonica's (TEF) $11.8 billion purchase of Germany's No. 4 wireless firm, E-Plus, from parent KPN. The EU aims to decide whether to clear Telefonica's bid by June 23.If approved, the deal would leave Germany with three carriers: Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), Vodafone (VOD) and Telefonica.The European Commission, the region's antitrust regulator, also is reviewing Hutchison Whampoa's bid for Telefonica's Irish unit. Ireland now has four carriers: Vodafone, Telefonica, Eircom and Hutchison Whampoa.Some U.S. companies, including AT&T (T), have an interest in the outcome of those EU approvals. There has been speculation that AT&T would acquire Vodafone, especially if European regulators allow consolidation in Germany. But such a deal would be unlikely to happen if AT&T goes through with its rumored purchase of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV (DTV).""AT&T must decide whether it wants to pursue domestic acquisitions to buttress a weakening position or go abroad,"" said Robin Bienenstock, a U.K.-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.AT&T might look upon a Vodafone purchase more favorably if the Telefonica deal wins approval. Falling prices in Germany for wireless services have been a big problem for Vodafone. Its service revenue in Germany fell 8% in the December quarter.""I think that AT&T is waiting, among other things, to see what happens in June. Vodafone is uninteresting as a target if German consolidation fails; if it succeeds, it is potentially very interesting,"" Bienenstock said.Europe's regulators are under pressure to wring concessions from Telefonica and Hutchison because prices for wireless services jumped in Austria after the EU allowed its market to consolidate to three national players from four in late 2012, when Hutchison merged with the Orange Austria telecommunications company.One option in Germany, analysts say, is for Telefonica to agree to forge wholesale deals with so-called mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) — companies that rent access to networks and generally sell cheaper mobile plans. Liberty Global (LBTYA) — which sells cable TV services in Germany, Belgium and England — is said to be in talks with Telefonica over access to its network in Germany.However, regulators may insist that Telefonica agree to a broader MVNO structure open to more new entrants in Germany.""I think the deal will be approved with conditions,"" said Stefan Zehle, CEO of U.K.-based Coleago Consulting. ""The likely most important condition is that Telefonica O2/E-Plus will have to commit to a mandated wholesale-price access offer. This will ensure that MVNOs get access to competitive rates. With a low wholesale rate, these MVNOs will limit (the industry's biggest players') ability to increase retail prices following the merger.""""It could be the template for the whole EU,"" added Zehle.Europe's regulators have had setbacks.In Austria, regulators required that radio spectrum be divested to allow a new, fourth industry player to enter the market. But no company stepped up to purchase spectrum in an auction. So a fourth carrier was not created to replace the one eliminated by the Hutchison/Orange merger.Analysts say that of Telefonica wins approval of the E-Plus acquisition, then Italy, Spain and France are among the markets where wireless firms may seek mergers that reduce network operators to three from four.U.S. regulators, like those in Europe, have been reluctant to approve mergers that reduce national players from four to three.In 2011, the Department of Justice blocked AT&T's purchase of Deutsche Telekom-controlled T-Mobile US (TMUS).Japan's SoftBank, which last year acquired 80% of Sprint (S), has been looking to spark a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile US, the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers behind Verizon (VZ) and AT&T. The Federal Communications Commission has signaled that it would likely block a Sprint/T-Mobile merger because it would reduce competition.Some analysts, though, have suggested that a Sprint/T-Mobile deal could be approved if they make it possible for a ""new entrant,"" such as satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), to enter the wireless market. Dish has been cobbling together spectrum licenses and has been testing new data/video services.Or the combined Sprint/T-Mobile could lease network capacity on wholesale terms to Internet or tech companies so those companies can sell their own data services, in competition with telecom and cable ISPs.

1287,DISH,"French telecom upstart Iliad's surprise $15 billion bid for a controlling stake in T-Mobile US gives parent Deutsche Telekom more options amid expected U.S. regulatory opposition to a possible merger between T-Mobile and Sprint.After Europe's stock markets closed on Thursday, Iliad confirmed its $33-per-share bid for a 56.6% stake in T-Mobile (TMUS), whose stock gained 6.5%, closing near Iliad's offer price. U.S. shares of Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), which holds a 67% stake in T-Mobile, were flat. Sprint's (S)stock fell 5.3%. AT&T (T)and Verizon Communications (VZ) both fell more than 2% on worries over steeper price competition with the possible entry of Iliad into the U.S. market.Japan's SoftBank, which owns 80% of Sprint, has been pushing for a T-Mobile merger. But Deutsche Telekom has been reluctant to pull the trigger because of expected U.S. regulatory opposition, though a deal might prevail in a court battle.SoftBank and Sprint reportedly have been working on a $32 billion offer for T-Mobile US, at $40 a share, with half in cash.While Sprint could make a superior offer, Deutsche Telekom might be interested in working out some kind of deal with Iliad to reduce its exposure in case it agrees to a Sprint merger and the deal is blocked by regulators, says Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital. Selling off some of its 67% stake in T-Mobile would be an option for Deutsche Telekom, he says.Could Sell Minority Stake""We do not believe that Deutsche Telekom would sell its entire control stake for $33 a share, nor would minority investors with tag-along rights likely accept such a price,"" Smithen said in a research note. ""(But) Deutsche Telekom could sell 10%-20% of T-Mobile ... . Minority holders in T-Mobile should be prepared for Deutsche Telekom to take some money off the table while it waits for a more attractive long-term exit from the U.S.""U.S. regulators have signaled that they oppose a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, the Nos. 3 and 4 wireless firms behind leaders Verizon and AT&T, because it would reduce competition. An Iliad purchase might fare better with U.S. regulators, but it also might boost competition for AT&T, Verizon and Sprint.Iliad's subsidiary, Free, has been a big price-cutter in France's wireless market.""T-Mobile has already been very aggressive with its Uncarrier strategy,"" said Stephen Sweeney, an analyst at Elevation. ""With Iliad as a new corporate parent, it would theoretically be even more aggressive, which would be bad for all three of the other U.S. carriers.""Some observers have speculated Carlos Slim-controlled America Movil (AMX), Latin America's No. 1 wireless firm and owner of U.S. prepaid firm TracFone, might be eying T-Mobile. And T-Mobile has yet other options.One would be a partnership with U.S. broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), which aims to break into the wireless business.Prior to Iliad's bid surfacing on mid-Thursday, T-Mobile CEO John Legere hinted on the company's Q2 earnings call early Thursday that T-Mobile has options aside from the much-speculated merger with Sprint.Legere says he's confident the Uncarrier-branded wireless phone company will continue prospering, on its own or ""inorganically.""Could Succeed Stand-Alone""We've been very successful and we see a path forward to be highly successful as a stand-alone company,"" Legere said. ""But we also know that we could significantly accelerate that growth and create an even higher level of competition in the U.S. wireless industry by various forms of accelerating this (Uncarrier) platform.""And I would point out that we have multiple versions of things that we can do inorganically with this company, and multiple versions for timing as to when we do them.""T-Mobile said it added 908,000 postpaid wireless subscribers in Q2, more than analysts expected in the wake of strong additions announced earlier by Verizon and AT&T.T-Mobile, which swung to a Q2 profit on a spectrum sale to Verizon, raised its 2014 postpaid addition guidance to a range of 3 million to 3.5 million, up from its earlier outlook of 2.8 million to 3.3 million. The company has already added 2.2 million postpaid subscribers, which are billed monthly, in the first half of 2014.Without the spectrum swap, T-Mobile would have posted a net loss. T-Mobile said Q2 revenue rose by 15.4% to $7.2 billion, above estimates. Analysts had modeled sales of $7.04 billion.T-Mobile shouldn't rush into a deal with Sprint, Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a report released before Iliad's bid.""The longer Deutsche Telekom waits, the better off they will be,"" Moffett said. ""Sure, within another year T-Mobile's Uncarrier momentum will likely have waned — nothing lasts forever. But by waiting, Deutsche Telekom would get a better deal.""T-Mobile's aggressive Uncarrier promotions rekindled subscriber growth in 2013 and early this year.While T-Mobile has momentum, a Sprint turnaround is a work-in-progress.Sprint early Wednesday reported its first quarterly profit in more than six years, but said it lost 245,000 postpaid subscribers, down from 333,000 in the March quarter and from more than 1 million in the year-earlier quarter. Sprint has lost postpaid customers in 25 of 28 quarters since mid-2007.If Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile bide their time, competition in the U.S. wireless industry may intensify.Apple's (AAPL) launch of the iPhone 6, analysts speculate, could come as soon as mid-September.On Sprint's earnings call Wednesday, CEO Dan Hesse confirmed that the struggling carrier is testing new pricing plans. Moffett says Sprint must cut pricing to be more competitive.""Price cuts seem likely as the iPhone refresh approaches,"" UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a report. ""We expect Sprint to come down to AT&T/Verizon levels, if not close the gap with T-Mobile. We could be in a dog fight in Q4, (which is) typically the strongest device-selling season.""Hodulik says AT&T should be in a good position when Apple's iPhone 6 arrives, because it has moved away from subsidizing devices and toward installment plans, like T-Mobile. AT&T wireless margins will be less impacted, he says, because its customers are expected to switch to installment payment plans.IPhone 6 A 'Switching Event'AT&T now has some 55 million smartphone users, with 24 million of those — 44% of its smartphone customers — on no-contract pricing plans. That includes more than 7 million customers that have signed up for AT&T's ""Next"" installment plans. That leaves some 17 million to 18 million that could buy the iPhone 6 and stick with AT&T or switch to another carrier.On his call, T-Mobile's Legere said the iPhone 6's arrival was a likely ""major switching event"" and a ""major upside possibility for us."" He noted that T-Mobile has the fewest iPhone users among the big four wireless firms, because it was the last one to sell Apple's popular device.""So if a switching event is coming, a major one, I think we've got a huge opportunity,"" he said.T-Mobile on Thursday maintained its full-year EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) forecast of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion.T-Mobile's 908,000 postpaid additions included 579,000 mobile phone customers and 329,000 tablet users. Postpaid average monthly revenue per user fell 8.7% to $49.30 vs. a 7.4% drop in Q1.In Q2, Verizon added 270,000 postpaid mobile phone subscribers and 1.15 million tablet users.

1320,DISH,"Accountability often comes with a stigma: You're to blame if something goes wrong. That's not how it should work. It's about making sure that people follow up. ""It's really talking about, 'Can I count on you?'"" said Greg Bustin, a Dallas-based management consultant.Here's how to make sure that you can count on your staff.• Define. Set your firm's values so that staffers are clear about what's important. Then they'll know to always be honest, on time or helpful to customers. Bustin, who wrote the book ""Accountability: The Key to Driving a High-Performance Culture,"" worked with one company that valued integrity, but its meetings started 15 minutes late. ""You can't have values that you don't treat as values,"" he told IBD. ""That's where it all starts.""• Be clear. Tell people exactly what you expect from them. Doing so builds confidence in them, Bustin says, because they know what their goal is and how to get there. The leader's job is to set the expectations. ""It's really hard to hold someone accountable if they don't know what to do,"" he said.• Change your thoughts. Accountability is a way of thinking, says Linda Galindo, a Park City, Utah-based accountability expert who co-wrote ""Where Winners Live: Sell More, Earn More, Achieve More Through Personal Accountability.""Be accountable by taking ownership of the results before you start a task. You'll know that you're responsible for the outcome.• Take charge. You'll always have excuses. Maybe the weather slowed deliveries or your vendors fell behind, but it's still your job to get things done. Think ahead about what can fail; anticipate solutions before you need them. ""Take ownership for all of it, even if you can't control it,"" Galindo said.• Measure. Track your progress, Bustin says. Steel maker Nucor (NUE) stays on top of safety, quality and output metrics, and posts them so workers know where they stand in those areas. ""Tell people, 'We're not tracking to punish you; we're tracking so we can make better decisions,'"" Bustin said.• Set boundaries. You need rules for those who fail to perform up to snuff, Galindo says.If someone is late to a meeting, explain why punctuality is important and say that you'll trust him to make it promptly next time. Take action if it continues. That'll get others to sharpen up.""You absolutely want the culture to be such that people show up on time anyway,"" she said.• Be fair. When you have to dish out punishment, handle the task objectively. Even if your best salesperson is easily beating monthly goals, if he keeps getting reports in late, tell him that you'll reject them next time. If it keeps up, be prepared to let him leave.This approach includes managers. ""You want to get people to not compare themselves to others in how they're punished,"" Galindo said. Treating them all the same will help them avoid comparisons.• Reward. Nudge people toward being accountable for doing what they said by rewarding them. Nucor pays for performance with a system that shows its staff what success looks like, Bustin said: ""Then people understand, 'Here's what it means to me.'""• Find the payoff. Show others how important it is that they live up to what they say, Galindo says. Spell out how much their ability to be accountable adds to results.• Share the power. The boss needn't do all the enforcing. Peers can do it too, Bustin said: ""If someone is in position to hold a colleague accountable, that's a lot more powerful"" than a boss doing it.

1329,DISH,"Speculation that Google (GOOG) could add wireless service to areas where it builds out a superfast fiber-optic broadband network has analysts mulling a wide range of options.The Information, a pay-walled website, on Thursday said Google approached Verizon Wireless (VZ) about a wholesale deal. Under one scenario, Google could lease network capacity from Verizon, which has the biggest 4G LTE network, to offer its own services.Over the years, Google has also been linked to a possible networking leasing deal with Sprint (S), which trails Verizon and AT&T (T) in building out a 4G network. And Google in 2012 reportedly talked with Dish Network (DISH), a satellite broadcaster that has been amassing wireless spectrum.Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan, in a research report Friday, speculated that Google might even acquire T-Mobile US (TMUS), which is 67% owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY).Google said in February that it's in talks with 34 cities in nine U.S. markets to expand its 1 gigabit-per-second Internet service. Google is already building out fiber-optic networks in Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; and Provo, Utah. The company says it's in talks with government officials in Portland, Ore.; San Jose, Calif.; Salt Lake City; Phoenix; San Antonio; Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; and North Carolina's Charlotte and Raleigh/Durham.None of Google's proposed or already built-out markets include areas where East Coast-based Verizon sells its FiOS broadband and TV service via a high-speed broadband network.Another potential partner for Google could be Globalstar Telecommunications, which is seeking regulatory approval to use 2.4GHz spectrum for a large-scale urban Wi-Fi network, says Stephen Sweeney, an analyst at institutional broker-dealer Elevation. Amazon.com (AMZN) has been linked to Globalstar.RELATED: Google, eBay Merger Suggested

It's normally powered by a built-in rechargeable battery. This battery can be charged from an AC supply, a set of built-in solar cells, or a windup crank. One minute of winding can power the radio for about 10 minutes, so you'll always have access to broadcast news and weather alerts.

(You can also use a prepaid SIM card to use it as a normal cellphone, to call anywhere.) The SpareOne can be stored for up to 15 years in its waterproof bag, but then can provide up to 10 hours of talk time when needed. For about $70, it's great to have in your glove compartment or emergency kit.

But for households with a family member who uses a medical device such as an oxygen generator or CPAP machine, having no power can be much more than an annoyance. GoalZero's $360 Escape Adventure kit is primarily marketed for campers and other outdoorsmen, but is suitable for providing power for medical devices long enough to get to someplace with power. It consists of a rechargeable base unit that can be recharged from a solar panel included with the device, and provides 150 watt/hours of 115-volt electricity. This can power a 15-watt machine for 10 hours or a 150-watt device for an hour. The included 15-watt solar panel puts out 12 volts, and when not used for recharging the base unit, it can directly recharge a cellphone or tablet.

1342,DISH,"Comcast gained full ownership of media giant NBCUniversal last year, buying out General Electric (GE).
"
1343,DISH,"Comcast and Time Warner Cable are the nation's two biggest cable TV firms. The combined company's share of the pay-TV market as well as its role in programming distribution have been expected to be part of the merger review by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice.
"
1344,DISH,"For Comcast, the most tricky part of the regulatory review, though, could involve the broadband market, analysts say. Comcast and Time Warner Cable together have nearly 32 million broadband customers, more than 35% of the U.S. total.
"
1345,DISH,"The core pay-TV business of all cable TV firms, meanwhile, is under assault by Internet video providers led by Netflix (NFLX). Video streaming gobbles up big amounts of data. Most consumers now get unlimited data as part of fixed-line Internet service plans.
"
1346,DISH,"Pay To Play
"
1347,DISH,"Comcast, Time Warner Cable and some other cable firms have been slowly expanding consumption-based pricing, also called ""usage-based pricing"" (UBP) in the industry, in U.S. markets.
"
1348,DISH,"It's possible consumer groups and Internet video firms will push regulators to set conditions on the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger that limit the new entity's ability to charge based on consumption.
"
1349,DISH,"""There's no way that UBP won't become a battleground issue,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""By opening up the UBP issue to regulatory intervention, this deal is an absolute gift to Netflix, and the OTT (over-the-top) community.""
"
1350,DISH,"Satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) on Monday acquired rights to content from Walt Disney (DIS) for a possible Web-based subscription TV service. DirecTV (DTV) also is in talks with Disney. Apple (AAPL), Sony (SNE) and others have eyed Web-based pay-TV. Those products, though, rely on broadband services provided by cable TV and phone companies. The big question is whether regulators will take steps to protect emerging ""over-the-top"" services.
"
1351,DISH,"New Rules For Industry?
"
1352,DISH,"Asked if consumption-based pricing could emerge as a key part of the merger review, Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said in an email, ""As a general matter we'll discuss (possible) conditions with the government (and) not negotiate in the press.""
"
1353,DISH,"In a blog posted on Monday, Comcast executive VP David Cohen said the cable TV firm has complied with a wide range of conditions, including some involving broadband, that regulators set on the NBCU acquisition in early 2011. ""We have continued to meet and in many cases exceed our obligations,"" he said.
"
1354,DISH,"Whatever Comcast agrees to get a green light for the Time Warner Cable deal could have industry ramifications, some observers say.
"
1355,DISH,"Comcast's $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable derailed Charter Communications'  (CHTR) hostile bid. Charter's top shareholder is Liberty Media (LMCA), controlled by cable TV industry pioneer John Malone.
"
1356,DISH,"On Liberty's Q4 earnings call Feb. 21, CEO Greg Maffei said: ""I'm neither an SEC specialist or an antitrust lawyer. I assume, under some set of conditions, the (Comcast-Time Warner Cable) deal will be approved. The question is how onerous those conditions are, not only for Comcast but for the industry as a whole.""
"
1357,DISH,"Comcast has consumption-based pricing trials under way in Atlanta; Fresno, Calif.; Tucson, Ariz.; Charleston, S.C., and a few other markets. In the trials, consumers get 300 gigabytes of data per month and pay $10 extra for each incremental 50GB of data consumed. Earlier, Comcast used a 250GB cap.
"
1358,DISH,"All of phone company AT&T's (T) U-verse customers who go beyond 250GB monthly pay $10 extra for every 50GB, though it doesn't call the policy a cap. Cable firms Cox, Mediacom and Suddenlink also have data caps.
"
1359,DISH,"Analysts say 250GB of data is plenty for most Internet users today, even if they download several movies a month. However, as more video is streamed in supersharp high-definition format, which consumes far more gigabytes of data, some U.S. households could exceed data caps, depending on how much video streaming they do. More consumers are also viewing video via multiple devices, such as tablets, in homes.
"
1360,DISH,"From Data Caps To Tiers?
"
1361,DISH,"Moffett says while consumption-based pricing so far has been tied to large data caps, and applies when those caps are exceeded, broadband providers could move to business models in which data consumption is metered from the start, or in tiers, with different combinations of price and volume.
"
1362,DISH,"Time Warner Cable has tried out pricing plans, starting at $35 per month, where consumers get 5GB of data and are charged $1 per gigabyte up to a maximum of $25 extra. Comcast has a similar low-priced opt-in plan.
"
1363,DISH,"Comcast has 21.7 million video subscribers. Time Warner Cable, which lost some 830,000 video subscribers in 2013, has 11.2 million. Comcast's service footprint would span 19 of the 20 largest U.S. cities.
"
1364,DISH,"OK With Net Neutrality
"
1365,DISH,"Comcast says it plans to divest 3 million Time Warner Cable subscribers to keep its share of the overall pay-TV market below 30%, in a bid to ease regulatory approval.
"
1366,DISH,"When Comcast acquired most of NBCU in 2011, it agreed to so-called net neutrality conditions that bar broadband service providers from blocking Internet content. It bought the rest of NBCU from General Electric (GE) last year.
"
1367,DISH,"Moffett calls net neutrality and subscriber divestitures ""table stakes"" in the current Comcast-Time Warner Cable review.
"
1368,DISH,"Paul Gallant, analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said: ""(It's not clear) what consumer groups will push for, although the FCC is likely to do more than just extend the existing (NBCU) conditions. I suppose UBP could be an ask by consumer groups, although I don't think FCC would ever ban it.""
"
1369,DISH,"""I would think conditions on Comcast could include an extension of the NBC deal conditions, net neutrality; not sure it will get to the level of not allowing usage-based billing,"" said Jeffrey Wlodarczak, analyst at Pivotal Research Group.
"
1370,DISH,"""I think the FCC is going to take a close look at Comcast's concentration of power in regards to broadband, but I think if they take those steps they will likely get it by regulatory hurdles, without concessions that will seriously reduce the upside from the merger.""Comcast has opened the door to regulatory scrutiny of the highly charged issue of consumption-based pricing for broadband services by pushing for the acquisition of Time Warner Cable.Federal regulators are reviewing Comcast's (CMCSA) proposed $45 billion all-stock purchase of Time Warner Cable (TWC), announced in February.Comcast gained full ownership of media giant NBCUniversal last year, buying out General Electric (GE).Comcast and Time Warner Cable are the nation's two biggest cable TV firms.

1386,DISH,"A merger between Dish Network (DISH) and T-Mobile USA (TMUS) would easily win regulatory approval, unlike a Sprint (S) purchase of T-Mobile, says JP Morgan, which speculated in a research report Thursday that a Dish bid for T-Mobile could top $35 per share.
"
1387,DISH,"T-Mobile stock popped on Thursday after Reuters reported that satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network could try to acquire Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) -controlled T-Mobile USA in 2014. T-Mobile stock was up 7.5% in late trading in the stock market today, near 29.40. Sprint stock was up nearly 3%, and Dish stock was up 1%.
"
1388,DISH,"Executives of Sprint and T-Mobile have signaled interest in merging, but such a deal would face tough scrutiny at the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission, as IBD has reported, because it would reduce the number of national wireless firms to three from four.

"
1391,DISH,"Sprint, 80% owned by Japan's SoftBank, prevailed over Dish in a takeover battle for Clearwire that ended in June.

"
1417,DISH,"The satellite TV broadcaster is slated to hold its investor day event in New York on Thursday.
"
1418,DISH,"""Latin America is going to be on people's minds,"" David Heger, an analyst with Edward Jones, told IBD. ""It's still a potential growth driver because its pay-TV market is much less penetrated than the U.S.""
"
1419,DISH,"Heger says that even with slower growth, the U.S. business still generates a lot of free cash flow for DirecTV. ""In Latin America, the key is not seeing more margin pressure, which may impact what free cash flow is available to buy back shares,"" he said.
"
1420,DISH,"DirecTV stock repurchases ""may slow a bit,"" Heger said, noting DirecTV says it won't add debt to fund buybacks.
"
1421,DISH,"DirecTV, though, has been on a fast pace for a while. Its shares outstanding are down 57% since Q4 2006, says Standard & Poor's analyst Howard Silverblatt. Fewer shares boost DirecTV's per-share profit and give it stock it can reissue for use in acquisitions.
"
1422,DISH,"Stock Up In 2013, Mostly Early
"
1423,DISH,"The company's stock is up 35% in 2013. But the stock had been up and down the past six months as bears focus on slowing subscriber growth in Latin America and bulls eye speculation of a merger with rival Dish Network (DISH).
"
1424,DISH,"Latin America, especially Brazil, has been an issue. El Segundo, Calif.-based DirecTV's stock rose in March after investor worries that it would buy Brazilian telecom firm GVT, owned by France's Vivendi, eased. Acquiring GVT might have slowed the satellite broadcaster's stock buybacks.
"
1425,DISH,"GVT, however, now looms as a stronger rival for DirecTV.
"
1426,DISH,"Vivendi and Echostar (SATS) have been in talks over forming a joint venture in Brazil.

1427,DISH,"The JV would combine satellite TV and GVT's broadband and phone business. Echostar, like Dish Network, is controlled by Charles Ergen. Echostar's stock has shot up 42% in 2013.
"
1428,DISH,"DirecTV's subscriber growth has slowed in Brazil and the region. DirecTV said in June that its Sky Brazil unit had overstated subscriber numbers, sending the stock falling. In Q3, DirecTV added 260,000 customers in Latin America, down from 543,000 in Q3 2012.
"
1429,DISH,"DirecTV stock has weakened on worries of its exposure to Argentina and Venezuela. Some analysts fret that reduced earnings in Latin America might curtail share repurchases. DirecTV announced a $4 billion stock buyback in February.

1432,DISH,"In Q3, DirecTV said it added 139,000 U.S. subscribers, up from 67,000 net adds in Q3 2012. U.S. revenue rose 7% to $6.2 billion. Average monthly revenue per user (ARPU) in the U.S., fueled by rate hikes and new products, rose 6% to $102.40.
"
1433,DISH,"Revenue in Latin America rose 5% to $1.66 billion but ARPU fell nearly 12% to $49.42, hurt by currency shifts. That pressures DirecTV's buyback program, says Nomura analyst Adam Ilkowitz.
"
1434,DISH,"""While (2013) buyback activity is meaningful, we continue to see it falling as leverage rises and the lack of cash repatriated from Latin America continues,"" he said in a research report.
"
1435,DISH,"DirecTV's challenges in Latin America include ""inflation-driven growth ... and heightening competition in Brazil,"" wrote Ilkowitz. ""We expect net subscriber adds to remain weak, offsetting inflationary pricing, to yield slowing constant-currency revenue growth.""
"
1436,DISH,"John Hodulik, a UBS analyst, says the size of Latin American devaluations will matter. He expects another devaluation in Venezuela after its elections on Sunday.
"
1437,DISH,"""We estimate DirecTV has more than 2 million subscribers in Argentina and over 1.5 million in Venezuela, equating to roughly one-third of total subscribers in Latin America. The revenue contribution is similar, but the OPBDA (operating income before depreciation and amortization) contribution is higher,"" Hodulik said.
"
1438,DISH,"DirecTV is No. 2 in Brazil's pay-TV market. Its market share has dipped to 30.2% from about 31% a year ago. Cable TV firm Net Servicos (NETC), controlled by America Movil's (AMX) Embratel unit, leads with 53% share. Also, America Movil has launched a satellite TV service under its Claro brand.

Under the terms, AT&T can ax the acquisition if DirecTV doesn't get the renewal ""substantially on the terms discussed"" by the two firms.DirecTV's content deals might also help AT&T launch an Internet-based video service, analysts speculate. AT&T and the Chernin Group in April said they would jointly invest $500 million to build an online video service to take on the likes of Netflix (NFLX).AT&T stock slipped 1% on Monday, while Dish stock also fell 1%. Dish has loomed as a merger partner of its satellite-TV rival DirecTV, as well as a possible acquisition target of AT&T. AT&T's forerunner, SBC Communications, invested $500 million in Dish in 2003 but divested its holding in 2008.AT&T is expected to issue 940 million shares as part of the DirecTV deal, increasing shares outstanding by about 18%, estimates Oppenheimer.AT&T plans to divest its 8.3% stake in Mexico-based wireless provider America Movil (AMX), worth an estimated $6 billion, to help finance the DirecTV deal. America Movil's U.S. stock fell 4% on Monday.AT&T will add more than $10 billion in debt, bringing its total debt to more than $115 billion, estimates Wells Fargo.AT&T's annual dividend costs will rise to $11.2 to $11.5 billion, from $9.5 billion, analysts estimate.

1488,DISH,"Renewed speculation over a Sprint (S) takeover bid for T-Mobile USA (TMUS) comes as analysts expect Sprint's large subscriber losses to continue this quarter amid fierce holiday marketing, while T-Mobile's rebound seems on solid footing, analysts say.
"
1489,DISH,"Several analysts published research notes on reacting to a Wall Street Journal report on Friday that Sprint is mulling an offer for T-Mobile in the first half of 2014. The report, which two analysts described as a ""trial balloon,"" follows public comments by Sprint and T-Mobile executives at investor conferences during the fall that signaled their interest in merging.
"
1490,DISH,"The latest reports sent the stocks in opposite directions. Sprint was up 1.5% in early trading in the stock market today. T-Mobile was down 3.5% in early trading Monday.
"
1491,DISH,"Sprint is the No. 3 wireless firm behind Verizon Wireless (VZ) and AT&T (T). Deutsche Telecom (DTEGY)-controlled T-Mobile USA is No. 4.
"
1492,DISH,"In 2011, the Justice Department blocked AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile. Analysts say that the Obama administration prefers four national carriers and is unlikely to allow industry consolidation that reduces the number to three.

1493,DISH,"Here's a sampling of analyst reaction:
"
1494,DISH," ""We believe the DOJ and Federal Communications Commission would likely oppose a possible Sprint takeover of T-Mobile,"" wrote Christopher King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. ""New FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has vowed to protect existing competition and has even made 'competition, competition, competition' his mantra. So we believe Sprint/T-Mobile would struggle to convince Chairman Wheeler that their combination would be in the public interest, especially at this time.""
"
1495,DISH," ""We believe the regulatory hurdles won't be easy to clear, given the industry's pre-existing state of high concentration per DOJ merger guidelines, the absence of carriers being able to currently argue for failing market conditions, recent postpaid subscriber gains at T-Mobile, Sprint's investment plan, recent demonstration of ample access to capital markets, and recent filings and comments from regulators,"" said Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins. ""We would assess a 35% probability that Sprint pursues an unprovoked merger of T-Mobile within the next year, and 65% within the next three years.""
"
1496,DISH," ""If Sprint and T-Mobile do pull the trigger on a merger, part of their calculus may be that they can still challenge any adverse FCC and DOJ decisions in court,"" said Paul Gallant, analyst at Guggenheim Securities. ""We think Sprint/T-Mobile would have a less than 50% chance of beating DOJ in court. Sprint/T-Mobile would have a harder time beating the FCC because it has a broader 'public interest' standard for reviewing mergers. And courts are obliged to give presumptive deference to the FCC.""
"
1497,DISH,"He added: ""We believe regulators are very pleased with T-Mobile's resurgence and its aggressive, innovative moves and would not want to see it disappear via acquisition.""
"
1498,DISH,"T-Mobile's rebound makes it less likely that regulators would approve a merger with Sprint, as IBD has reported.
"
1499,DISH,"Some analysts say Deutsche Telekom plans to exit the U.S. market so it can up investments in Europe. Japan-based SoftBank in July acquired an 80% stake in Sprint, which earlier acquired a huge swath of radio spectrum after outbidding satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) for Clearwire.
"
1500,DISH,"SoftBank may be underestimating the regulatory battle it would face in acquiring T-Mobile, some analysts say. But Sprint may have good reason for seeking a deal. It lags Verizon and AT&T in building out a 4G data network. T-Mobile's ""Uncarrier"" marketing, meanwhile, has caught on with consumers.
"
1501,DISH,"""We conducted our own informal (weekend) canvas of Washington policymakers and other insiders as to whether a Sprint/T-Mobile merger would or wouldn't be approved,"" wrote Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""The bias was clearly against, though no clear consensus emerged. One would assume that there would have to be a high probability of success in order for (Sprint) to move forward. In all likelihood, Sprint will have to wait until 2016 before they float the same trial balloon again.""
"
1502,DISH,"Jonathan Schildkraut, an analyst at Evercore Partners, said: ""We question whether T-Mobile would risk the regulatory process such a short time after the failed AT&T transaction.""
"
1503,DISH,"Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan says Sprint would need to divest significant spectrum to get approval.
"
1504,DISH,"""While we're unsure whether a Sprint-T-Mobile merger would be possible in this administration, we give Sprint a 50/50 chance,"" he wrote. Horan adds that Dish Network could try to acquire T-Mobile USA if Sprint gets serious about a bid.

1509,DISH,"DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) is a leading satellite TV operator in the U.S. The company provides video services under the DISH brand. In addition, the company provides satellite broadband services, and wireline voice and broadband services under the dishNET brand.DISH Network’s top-line growth may remain under pressure as the company’s failure to strike any deal with wireless operators to deploy a nationwide wireless network has been a major headwind. Persistent loss of subscribers remains a potent headwind for DISH Network.  Escalating programming and content expenses as well as retransmission fees may also hurt the company’s margins.We are, however, impressed by DISH Network’s efforts to diversify its business model from being a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet TV streaming service provider. The move should help the company counter competitive threat from low-cost video streaming operators.DISH Network currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1510,DISH,"DISH Network (DISH  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 21.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.54 billion, reflecting year-over-year decline of 4.9%. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 56 cents per share, indicating year-over-year decline of 20%.The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters and surpassed the same in the remaining two quarters, with an average beat of 1.32%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsDISH Network is looking for wireless opportunities with its extensive portfolio of wireless spectrum, valued at around $50 billion. Moreover, we appreciate DISH Network’s efforts to diversify its business model from being a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet TV operator. This should help the company counter competitive threats from low-cost video streaming operators. Launch of the mobile app, DISH Music bodes well.The company has also inked a multi-year program licensing deal with CBS Corp (CBS  -  Free Report), after resolving a three-day blackout. The latest deal not only restores CBS’ local stations but also adds Showtime, CBS Sports Network, Pop, and Smithsonian Channel to the company’s satellite-TV service.Multi-year agreement with Lilly Broadcasting for carriage of the broadcaster's channels in Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and three other markets in Pennsylvania, New York and Hawaii, looks good for DISH Network’s prospects.However, in the past three months, the company’s shares have declined 8.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 4.3%. Moreover, DISH Network continues to lose broadband and pay-TV subscribers due to stiff competition and cord cutting. Notably, online video streaming providers such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., have become a severe threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DISH Network’s broadband subscribers is 419,000 million for fourth-quarter 2017 compared with 459,000 in third-quarter 2017. Pay-TV subscriber estimates of 13.181 million are lower than 13.203 million and 13.671 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.The company’s liquidity position is disappointing. Moreover, regulatory fines, programming and content expenses, retransmission fees, persistent loss of subscribers and failure to strike any deal with wireless operators are other risks. Penalty of $280 million in a telemarketing lawsuit remains a woe.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that DISH Network is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: DISH Network has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 56 cents.

However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.DISH Network Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  DISH Network Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | DISH Network Corporation QuoteStock to ConsiderAMC Entertainment (AMC  -  Free Report) from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017 when it reports on Mar 1.

Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 4.56%Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?

Price and EPS Surprise  CenturyLink, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CenturyLink, Inc.

It continues to invest in fiber-to-the-tower (FTTT) expansion and has expanded its fiber-based backhaul services. Acquisition of Level 3 Communications will increase CenturyLink's network by 200,000 route miles of fiber. The new company will be a formidable force in the fiber-based metro-Ethernet and Internet market. Moreover, thecompany is focused on bringing improved operating efficiencies through a number of methods including network simplification and rationalization. Further, the growing momentum of CenturyLink’s Prism IPTV service has prompted it to unveil a beta version of over-the-top (OTT) TV services. By foraying into the OTT space, the company has joined the likes of DISH Network’s (DISH  -  Free Report) Sling TV and AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) DirecTV Now. We also appreciate CenturyLink’s quarterly dividend payout of 54 cents per share, paid on Dec 11, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Nov 27, 2017.On the flip side, CenturyLink continues to suffer from declining access lines and broadband subscriber losses. This is primarily due to the substitution of traditional wireline telephone services by wireless and other competitive offerings and lower long distance minutes of use.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total access lines in fourth-quarter 2017 is pegged at 10,361 million. The estimate indicates a decline from 10,506 million and 11,090 million reported in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.High-speed broadband customer count estimate for the quarter stands at 5.699 million.

1513,DISH,"The four major national wireless carriers in the United States are focusing on 4G LTE (long-term evolution) Category-M (Cat-M) and narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) as their future network deployment. These are doing so in order to gain maximum benefit from the lucrative IoT market, per a recent report by LightReading.LTE Cat-M is a part of the existing 3GPP LTE standards, which enables reduced power consumption and cost by capping speeds at 10 megabits per second. The idea is to generate lower throughput with low Cost and lower energy consumption. On the other hand, NB-IoT is a standards-based low power wide area (LPWA) technology, which enables a wide range of new IoT devices and services. The power consumption of user devices, system capacity and spectrum efficiency can be improved remarkably using NB-IoT. This technology will be more helpful in deep coverage areas.Internet of Things (IoT): The Next Growth DriverIoT, which enables any physical electronic device with a valid IP-address to transfer data seamlessly over a wireless network, is fast gaining market traction and bringing about fundamental changes in business models. Next-generation superfast wireless networks (4G LTE, LTE-A, upcoming 5G) will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry.In this context, IoT holds the potential to be the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. IoT is a network of physical objects embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity that facilitates it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with other connected devices.Superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.Major U.S. Wireless CarriersAll four major U.S. national wireless carriers are trying hard to gain maximum profit from the IoT space. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has already deployed LTE Cat M and plans to go ahead with NB-IoT LTE trials in 2018. AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) has also deployed Cat M technology nationwide and decided to deploy this network in Mexico in 2018. T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) will start deploying NB-IoT in 2018 together with Cat-M support. Meanwhile, Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) has announced that it will deploy Cat-M in mid-2018 followed by NB-IoT.Moreover, in March 2017, satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) had announced plans of building a NB-IoT network to meet the FCC’s (Federal Communications Commission) buildout requirements. Notably, in the last decade, the company has developed an extremely strong portfolio of lucrative wireless spectrums which are still unutilized. The company spent nearly $21 billion to build this spectrum portfolio, which, according to some estimates, is currently valued at no less than $45 billion.All five stocks mentioned above currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1514,DISH,"Satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) has become the first pay-TV operator to offer a whole-home 4K programming services of Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) via its Hopper 3 DVRs. The company announced that the streaming video-on-demand operator’s content can be viewed throughout the home.Up to seven TVs in the home can stream 4K services of Netflix using DISH Network’s 4K Joey which will be added with Netflix’s apps. Customers should have Hopper 3 DVRs and 4K Joey, and be a subscriber of Netflix’s $11.99-a-month 4K service. They also need 4k-enabled TV set and robust broadband access supporting at least 25 Mbps download speeds.DISH Networks is already streaming Netflix’s programs through its over-the-top (OTT) Sling TV video streaming service. DISH Network has also launched a streaming player called AirTV Player for the same reason.For the last couple of years, the internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have been gradually shifting from cable and satellite TV operators to low-cost over-the-top service providers. The strong presence of online video streaming providers like Netflix and Hulu are posing significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Meanwhile, cord-cutting has become a serious concern for major pay-TV operators.DISH Network intends to check customer churn with its latest Sling TV offering. However, the fast-growing video streaming service industry has attracted telecom and tech giants to this space, which in turn has intensified competition. Consequently, Sling TV is also facing stiff competition from AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) DirecTV Now, Hulu and YouTube TV of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report). Notably, in the second quarter of 2017, DISH Network lost 281,000 linear pay-TV customers.The Bottom LineA number of pay-TV players have adopted Netflix services on their set-top boxes to put a check on customer churn. Meanwhile, DISH Network has been focusing on rich content and media in its services. Netflix has steadily added to its 4K library since introducing the service two years ago. This will help DISH Network to remain competitive in the market.Price Performance of DISH NetworkDISH Network’s shares have lost a massive 15.70%, underperforming the industry’s decline of a mere 0.78% over the past 90 days.

1515,DISH,"AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 6, after the closing bell.The leisure and recreation services company has a positive earnings surprise history. AMC Entertainment beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average of 120.13%. However, in the last reported quarter, the company reported negative earnings surprise of 1.50%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayAMC Entertainment is one of the largest theatrical exhibition companies in the United States, Europe and globally with approximately 1,000 theaters and 11,000 screens. The company successfully operates theaters in 15 European countries and is the market leader in 22 of the 25 largest metropolitan areas of the United States, including the top three markets (New York, Los Angeles and Chicago). The company is also an industry leader in innovation and operational excellence.Further, AMC Entertainment has been actively involved in the renovation and refurbishing of multiplexes through enhancements like reclining seats, improved food and beverages, dine-in theaters as well as advanced sound and digital equipment. To this end, the company has announced its latest addition — AMC Tech Ridge 10 — in alliance with Seritage Growth Properties . The new theatre is scheduled to begin construction later this year and is anticipated to open in 2019 in Austin, TX.Meanwhile, the judgement in favor of AMC Entertainment by Texas District Court marks a victory for the company. Completion of the $130-million sale-leaseback transaction of 7 U.S. theatres should help the company in enhancing overall liquidity position, funding the buyback of  shares, paying its debt and fueling growth through deployment of strategic initiatives.AMC Entertainment’s initiative to identify approximately $400-million non-strategic assets and monetize them strategically and systematically looks impressive. The company sold 12 million shares of National CineMedia, Inc’s (NCMI  -  Free Report) common stock to Standard General, L.P. for approximately $73.1 million. AMC Entertainment also sold 2.8 million shares of National CineMedia, Inc’s common stock to an undisclosed American buyer for approximately $18.2 million.We also appreciate the company’s efforts to offer a quarterly cash dividend of 20 cents on shares of Class A and Class B common stock for the quarter ended Sep 30, 2017. The dividend will be paid in cash on Dec 18, 2017, to shareholders of record as on Dec 4, 2017. It will mark the fifteenth consecutive dividend payout since the company’s initial public offering.Despite such favorable prospects, the price performance of AMC Entertainment looks unimpressive. In the past three months, shares of AMC Entertainment have declined 10.9%, as against the  industry’s increase of 2.3%.  However, the latest strategy adopted by Hollywood studios (film makers) is a major setback to the movie theater (exhibitor) industry. It involves making the latest releases available for home viewing at a premium rate within two weeks of debut. Moreover, being part of the entertainment industry exposes the company to macroeconomic fluctuations. AMC Entertainment competes with major theatrical exhibitors like Cinemark Holdings Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and Regal Entertainment Group.The company also faces threats from alternative movie streaming services such as Netflix, Inc, Time Warner Inc.’s HBO Now and Hulu.  Despite the recent shift in audience preference toward streaming services, film studios seek better bargains with large-screen theater companies. This might hamper  the company’s profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AMC Entertainment is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP:AMC Entertainment has an Earnings ESP of -9.38%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at a loss of 37 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 34 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AMC Entertainment has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.

1517,DISH,"Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) is reportedly planning to launch a theme-based online streaming TV service in 2018.The telecom service provider will offer channels based on themes like news, sports and entertainment. All these channels will be offered as a standalone application. The content is likely to come from Oath properties like TechCrunch, Engadget, Huffington Post and premium content from third-party sources.The news follows the company’s latest initiatives to boost digital media portfolio. Verizon has inked a five-year digital streaming deal with National Football League (NFL). The telco paid approximately $2.25 billion to stream NFL’s content on its digital and mobile media platforms.Additionally, Verizon signed an extended carriage deal with A+E Networks, to broadcast the latter’s programming in its digital media suite. Other than A+E cable networks, games like National Women’s Soccer League will also be streamed on Yahoo Sports and Go90 platforms. The respective contents will be broadcast under Verizon’s Oath brand.Oath, is a digital content and online advertising suite, formed with the combined business of Yahoo and AOL Inc. It is Verizon’s newly-formed company under Media and Telematics organization.With A+E Networks and NFL streaming under Oath, Verizon projects more than $20-billion revenues by 2020. Such important deals are likely to drive Verizon’s advertising revenues. With Oath, the telco has managed to reach more than 200 million mobile and digital viewership in the United States. The company is primarily targeting young viewers and consumers who do not subscribe to traditional pay-TV packages.Meanwhile, Verizon’s plans to launch 5G wireless residential broadband services (in three to five U.S. markets) in 2018 will boost streaming services launch. The first commercial launch is scheduled in Sacramento, CA, in the second half of 2018.However, Verizon’s streaming TV services’ launch has been delayed due to several factors including technological hurdles, problematic negotiations with broadcasters and programmers and media chief Marni Walden’s imminent exit from the company.Similar OTT LauncesInternet-TV streaming service is gaining market traction gradually in the United States. Recently, the legacy pay-TV industry has been facing stiff competition from online video streaming service providers such as Netflix, Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. The low-cost over-the-top (OTT) video streaming service has led to massive cord cutting, which is currently threatening the pay-TV business model. Video offering, which represents the core business function of pay-TV operators, is losing popularity.Consequently, Internet-TV streaming has emerged as a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat.Recently, T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS  -  Free Report) announced plans to launch its own TV streaming service in 2018, after the company inked a deal to acquire Layer3 TV, Inc. Based in Denver, CO, Layer3 TV is a cable company operating in Chicago, Washington DC and Los Angeles. Major pay-TV operators such as AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) and Sony Corp. (SNE  -  Free Report) have already launched Internet-TV streaming services. AT&T’s DirecTV Now includes channels like E!, FX, TBS and TNT. DISH Network’s Sling TV offers channels like ESPN, AMC, Cartoon Network, HBO and Univision. Sony’s PlayStation Vue provides a portfolio of channels like Bravo, Fox News, Nickelodeon and USA.Is Cannibalization a Concern?A major concern for Verizon is that its Internet TV streaming services do not cannibalize other services. The concern is the same for all the pay-TV operators, who have entered into Internet TV streaming. Notably, most of these companies are offering legacy pay-TV services and Internet TV streaming service, with selected channels at lower costs.The operators are yet to find out an appropriate trade-off between these two types of services. Making attractive online ventures are drawing subscribers to the new service at the cost of traditional pay-TV business model. Ultimately, the Internet TV service is yet to stop cord cutting, the biggest threat for pay-TV operators.Zacks Rank & Price Performance Currently, Verizon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1518,DISH,"Frontier Communications Corporation’s (FTR  -  Free Report) FiOS customers in the Seattle area have reportedly lost access to Cox Media Group’s KIRO-TV programming. Per sources, the companies failed to extend a carriage deal, which led to the blackout of CBS, Get TV and Laff TV programming.Frontier Communications is one of the leading telecommunications company in the United States, providing services to urban, suburban and rural communities in 29 states through.KIRO-TV is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Seattle, Washington, United States and Tacoma. Cox operates 14 broadcast television stations and a local cable channel, more than 60 radio stations, six daily newspapers and more than 12 non-daily publications.Frontier Communications claims that Cox was seeking a programming fee hike of more than 80% over the next three years, to broadcast respective content. This was declined by Frontier Communications, as it will increase customers’ monthly bills.Such customer-friendly moves look impressive. Moreover, apprehension about customer loss might have prompted the company to decline the price-hike deal. In third-quarter 2017, Frontier Communications reported declining subscriber statistics. As of Sep 30, 2017, the number of consumer segment customers fell 10.9% year over year to 4,486,000. The average monthly consumer revenues per customer were $80.91, down 1.7% sequentially. Consumer segment customer monthly churn was 2.08%, flat year over year. Commercial segment customers declined 10.3%, year over year to 463,000. The company had 4,000,000 high-speed broadband subscribers, down 8.3% and 981,000 video customers, down 19.7% year over year.However, the company continues with efforts to reach a rational agreement with Cox to regain the programming channels.It seems that 2018 has barely begun and the retransmission and carriage fee blackout problem continues to worsen. Recently, Altice USA Inc (ATUS  -  Free Report) and Starz Inc. have failed to ink a new programming deal on the eve of New Year. This led to the blackout of 17 Starz, StarzEncore and MoviePlex premium channels in Altice USA’s Optimum and Suddenlink cable TV services, since midnight Dec 31.Other Retransmission ConflictsConflict between TV broadcasters and pay-TV operators is not new in the United States.In October 2017, Verizon Communications Inc.

1519,DISH,"Altice USA Inc (ATUS  -  Free Report) and Starz Inc. have reportedly failed to ink a new programming deal on the eve of New Year. This led to the blackout of 17 Starz, StarzEncore and MoviePlex premium channels in Altice USA’s Optimum and Suddenlink cable TV services.Based in Bethpage, NY, Altice USA is one of the largest broadband communications and video services providers. Starz Inc — based in Meridian, CO —is an American entertainment company that owns pay television channels, a media distribution company as well as animated television and movie production.Since midnight Dec 31, Starz or StarzEncore programs were dropped from Altice USA’s cable services. Instead, Altice USA advised Optimum and Suddenlink customers to subscribe to the Starz over-the-top (OTT) streaming service for $8.99 per month.Due to declining viewership and lesser popularity, Altice USA is likely to drop extra charges from customers for Starz programming. Also, the programs are available directly through Starzs' own OTT service. On the other hand, Starz blamed Altice USA of demanding a drastic reduction in carriage price, compared with the market. The failure to ink a new carriage deal implies tense talks between the companies over how much the cable operator should pay to continue offering the premium channels to customers.Per sources, Altice USA launchedalternative entertainment channels that will provide pocket-friendly content experience. The Starz channels will be replaced with Hallmark Drama, Sony Movies, MGM HD, HD Net Movies, Flix and Cowboy Channel.In October 2017, Altice USA reportedly reached an agreement with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) in relation to the dispute over channel carriage and retransmission fees. The retransmission contract between the companies was set to expire on Sep 30.

1520,DISH,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put DISH Network Corporation (DISH  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, DISH Network has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.4. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts DISH Network’ current PE ratio considerably below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 33. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that DISH Network has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 12.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for DISH Network’ stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, DISH Network has a P/S ratio of about 1.2. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is noticeably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, DISH Network currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes DISH a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 6.8, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 8.2. Clearly, DISH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though DISH Network might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B. This gives DISH a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past 30 days, compared to three lower and the next has seen three estimates go higher in the past 30 days, compared to three lower.As a result, the current year consensus estimate has increased nearly 1.6% in the past month, while the next year estimate has inched up 1.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:DISH Network Corporation Price and Consensus DISH Network Corporation Price and Consensus | DISH Network Corporation QuoteEven though DISH Network has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineDISH Network is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 25%), it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Also, over the past year, the broader industry has underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Pay-TV operators have cited various reasons for price increase. Increasing cost of programming content continues to be one of the main reasons of video rates increase. Continuous investment in network, products and services also add to the company’s budget. The move comes at a time when cable companies are reporting video subscriber losses to the online video streaming service providers.

1522,DISH,"Research firm RBC recently predicted that customer churn in the legacy pay TV segment could soon accelerate to around 5 million a year. In June 2017, research firm SNL Kagan had predicted that the U.S. pay-TV industry (consisting of cable, satellite and IPTV operators) will lose approximately 10.8 million customers by 2021. Total pay-TV subscribers will be around 82.3 million at that time, which will be 20% less than the industry’s historical high level.In terms of customer retention, legacy pay-TV operators are yet to cope with the onslaught of low-cost online video streaming service providers. In the last 10 years, the internal dynamics of the pay-TV market have gradually shifted from legacy pay-TV offerings to low-cost over-the-top (OTT) service providers. According to SNL Kagan, in the first half of 2017, the U.S. pay-TV industry lost 1.8 million customers.The strong presence of online video-streaming providers is posing a significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Video offering, which represented the core business function of cable TV operators, seems to be fast slipping out of their hands.In order to remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators stared offering Internet TV with selected TV channels at cheap rate. Technically, Internet TV is similar to pay-TV offerings. Its shows can be viewed using a broadband connection and mobile gadgets like tablets, smartphones, Roku box and smart TV, to name a few.Major pay-TV operators, such as AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) have already launched their Internet TV services. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) are the latest entrants. Most of these companies are offering both legacy pay-TV as well as Internet TV services with selected TV channels at lower costs.Interestingly, in June 2017, another research firm, Strategy Analytics, had estimated that major pay-TV operators, who offer both traditionally managed TV services and next-generation online services, will hold nearly 80% of the market share till 2022. They will continue to do so despite facing intensified competition from low-cost OTT service providers.Nevertheless, pay-TV operators are yet to find out an appropriate trade-off between these two types of services. Making online ventures more attractive is resulting in more subscribers for the new services at the expense of traditional pay-TV business model. Ultimately, the cord cutting due to Internet TV is yet to stop, which is currently the biggest threat for pay-TV operators.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1523,DISH,"Leading cable TV operator, Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), primarily offers three services – video, high-speed data and voice over its broadband cable systems to both residential and business customers.We are concerned about Charter Communications’ operations in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Like other cable operators, the company continues to lose subscribers to online video streaming service providers because of their cheap source of TV programming. Notably, in the second quarter of 2017, the company lost 90,000 video customers in the residential segment.On the other hand, the twin buyouts of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks have strengthened the company’s foothold in hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and fiber networks. The company is also adopting various initiatives to improve its Spectrum products and cloud-based user interfaces. Also, accelerated residential and commercial customer growth, investments in business services division and rollout of several initiatives should aid the upcoming results.Charter Communications currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The company competes with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) in the intensely competitive pay-TV industry. AT&T and DISH Network have Zacks Rank #4 while Comcast carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has generated negative average earnings surprise of 23.47% in the previous four quarters. We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just-revealed announcement below:Earnings:  Charter Communications lags earnings estimate in third-quarter 2017. Our consensus EPS (earnings per share) estimate was $1.04 while the company reported EPS was just 19 cents.  Investors should note that these figures take out stock option expenses.Revenue:  Charter Communications generated total revenues of $10,458 million, which fell below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of approximately $10,485 million.Key Stats to Note:   During the third quarter of 2017, residential high-speed Internet subscribers rose by 249,000 to 22.282 million. Voice subscribers grew 27,000 to 10.405 million. However, video subscribers decreased by 104,000 to 16.542 million.Stock Price:  At the time of writing, the stock price of Charter Communications was down nearly 2% in the pre-market trade on Nasdaq. Clearly the initial reaction to the release is negative. The company lost significant numbers of video customers. Both its top and bottom lines have failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimates.  We believe this unimpressive performance is the primary reasons for this initial negative sentiment.    Charter Communications, Inc.

1524,DISH,"Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues beat the same. Both earnings and revenues improved on a year-over-year basis.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlaySirius XM’s bottom line in the third quarter is likely to be affected by a spike in costs. Also, the company completed the $480 million Pandora (P  -  Free Report) investment in the third quarter. This is likely to further pressurize the bottom line. The slowdown in subscription growth may also hurt results in the third quarter. The company added 0.70 million subscriptions in the first half of 2017, significantly below the number, added a year ago.The company’s high-debt levels are another cause for concern. Increased leverage coupled with stiff competition from rivals may also act as headwinds for the company in the third quarter.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders with dividends and buybacks are impressive.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Las Vegas Sands has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the third quarter. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Sirius XM has an Earnings ESP of +3.17%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though the company’s positive ESP increases confidence about an earnings surprise, its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.Hence, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Sirius XM Holdings Inc.

1525,DISH,"Yesterday, the U.S. media sector saw sell-offson the double whammy of Hurricane Irma (and Harvey to some extent) and downbeat guidance issued by management of Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report). Disney lost about 4.4% on Sep 7, while it added about 0.04% after hours, and Comcast retreated about 6.2% on Sep 7.Behind the Downcast MoodFlorida is bracing up to face Hurricane Irma on Friday and has issued a state of emergency. Since the storm is deemed to be the most powerful to lash out on the U.S. mainland since 1992, Miami is readying for its largest evacuation in almost a decade (read: Hurricane Irma: ETF Winners & Losers).Though Disney remains open, many of its events have been called off. Disney's Blizzard Beach will be shut on Friday and Saturday, “the park's Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground will be closed beginning Saturday 2 P.M.”, as per the source. Disney was shut down in 2016 for Hurricane Matthew.Added to this, Disney CEO Bog Iger cautioned about profits this year which are likely to be similar to last year. The company reported $5.72 in earnings per share for fiscal 2016, which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($5.87) for the current year.On the other hand, Universal Studios of Comcast Corporation also cancelled Saturday's ""Rock the Universe"" concert due to Irma. Comcast’s management warned about a significant drop in subscribers during the third quarter. As many as 150,000 video subscribers could be lost in the quarter.Comcast management attributed the loss in subscribers to stiff competition in the telecom sector, as the industry grapples with pressures from streaming. However, management also held two big hurricanes in the quarter responsible for subscriber loss. “Comcast management said this quarter has been one of the most competitive in recent memory,” going by an article published on MarketWatch.Impact on Industry Such downbeat indications from two industry biggies acted as a cornerstone for the entire space, though some of the players have positions in the streaming market.

1527,DISH,"The third-quarter 2017 earnings seasons is picking up with a few companies having already started reporting their financial numbers. In such a scenario, we have witnessed disappointing share price performance and declining subscriber count reports from some of the major U.S. pay-TV stocks – AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report).Consequently, other stocks like Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report) and DISH Network Corp (DISH  -  Free Report) have also reported a fall in their share price.All the above-mentioned companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On Oct 12, 2017 shares of AT&T declined 6.10% to $35.86, while Verizon’s shares decreased 1.04% to $48.35. Cable companies like Comcast’s shares declined 3.93% to $35.95, share price of Charter moved down 2.58% to $355.71, whereas DISH Network shares plunged 5.07% to $49.03.AT&T and Comcast have already unveiled their subscriber losses. Let’s take a closer look into their recent updates on their financial numbers: -AT&T: In its latest filling with the Securities and Exchange Commission, AT&T has reported a loss of 390,000 subscriber in its traditional pay-TV video service, inclusive of 90,000 net video subscribers’ loss, in third-quarter 2017 results.AT&T blames recent natural calamities such as the multiple hurricanes that hit the U.S. coasts and a devastating earthquake in Mexico for declining subscriber count. Intense competition in traditional pay-TV markets have also affected the count. Subscriber reduction is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as the company is yet to fully restore its operations which were negatively impacted by natural calamities.On a positive note, the company added 300,000 internet video subscribers on its Over-the-top (OTT) DirecTV Now service. Notably, the company will release third-quarter results on Oct 24, after the closing bell.Management stated that the company’s consolidated revenues in the third quarter will be affected by $90 million ($210-million pre-tax). Consequently, earnings per share (EPS) will decline 2 cents. Nevertheless, AT&T has reconfirmed its 2017 financial outlook. In January, management projected that its consolidated revenues will grow in low-single digit in 2017. Adjusted EPS growth will be in the mid-single digit range. Adjusted operating margin will expand in 2017. Full-year capital expenditures and free cash flow will be approximately $22 billion and $18 billion, respectively.Comcast: Comcast is also expected to lose around 100,000-150,000 video subscriber in the third quarter. Comcast is among the few top pay-TV operators with the capaability to expand video base amid an acceleration of cord-cutting in the last 18 months. The operator added 161,000 customers in 2016 and ended the first six months of 2017 adding another 8,000 pay-TV subscribers, despite record industry attrition in the second quarter of 2017Notably, the third quarter of any year is generally known for weak seasonality in the pay-TV segment.Why the Downturn?The major reasons behind the subsequent fall in share price are cord-cutting and increasing competition from online video streaming service providers in the domestic pay-TV industry. Moreover, the industry is currently witnessing massive consolidation.Let’s have a closer look at the current doldrums in the U.S. pay-TV industry.Cord-Cutting: In the last 3-4 years, the internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have been gradually shifting from cable-TV operators to large telecom operators and low-cost OTT service providers. The industry has been losing customers to wireless telecom operators and online streaming service providers. Online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., have become a severe threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming. Moreover, this business model is gaining momentum, even during economic uncertainties.In the second quarter of 2017, Comcast lost34,000 video customers and 22,000 voice customers, while Charter Communications lost 90,000 video customers. DISH Network lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers in the said quarter compared with a loss of 281,000 in the year-ago quarter.The trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to signify an unprecedented annual decline.Saturation: The domestic multi-channel video market has also become extremely saturated, where spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the domestic telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it difficult to manage mobile data traffic, which is growing by leaps and bounds. The situation has become acute with the growing popularity of iPhone and Android smartphones as well as rising online mobile video streaming, cloud computing and video conferencing services.Internet-TV Services’ Failure to Stand against OTT: In order to cope with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering internet TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates.  The Internet TV service, launched by leading pay-TV operators in the United States, has been gaining market traction since 2015. Nevertheless, the pay-TV operators are yet to find out an appropriate trade-off between these two types of services. Making online ventures more attractive is resulting in more subscribers for the new services at the expense of traditional pay-TV business model.Ultimately, cord cutting due to Internet TV is yet to stop, which is currently the biggest threat for pay-TV operators. In terms of customer retention, legacy pay-TV operators are yet to cope with the onslaught of low-cost online video streaming service providers. Hence, how long will they succeed in saving the companies from subscriber loss still remains a question.Telecom Operators & Cable TV Operators - Segment Overlapping: Competition is intense as both basic phone service providers and cable-TV operators are increasingly entering into each other’s territory. While Verizon and AT&T have long been servicing customers with fiber-based video networks, leading cable companies like Comcast and Charter Communications are venturing into wireless arena.Currently, both companies are negotiating with national wireless carrier Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) for a possible MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) deal or an outright purchase of Sprint. Meanwhile, AT&T has strengthened its pay-TV services after the acquisition of largest satellite-TV operator DirecTV.Research Firm Opinions’: Research firm RBC predicted that customer churn in the legacy pay-TV segment could soon accelerate to around 5 million a year. In June 2017, research firm SNL Kagan had predicted that the U.S. pay-TV industry (comprising cable, satellite and IPTV operators) will lose approximately 10.8 million customers by 2021. Total pay-TV subscribers will be around 82.3 million at that time, which will be 20% less than the industry’s historical high level. Last month, Research firm RBC predicted that customer churn in the legacy pay-TV segment could soon accelerate to around 5 million a year.Why Should You Still Hold Onto the Pay-TV Stocks?Despite the dismal picture, pay-TV operators currently enjoy certain positives. The cable multi-service operators (MSOs) in the United States have successfully maintained their lead over telecom operators in the high-speed broadband (Internet) market. Moreover, to stay ahead in the competition, cable companies are introducing latest technologies like DOCSIS 3.1 technology. DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections.Meanwhile, several research firms have estimated that major pay-TV operators who offer both traditionally managed TV services and next-generation online services will hold nearly 80% of the market share till 2022. In June 2017, research firm Strategy Analytics estimated that annual spending on subscription video and TV services in the United States will reach $130.3 billion in 2019.Bottom LineThe presence of online video streaming providers is posing significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Video offering, which represented the core business function of cable-TV operators, is losing popularity. At this juncture, pay-TV operators must revamp their business model otherwise they may gradually lose market share.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1528,DISH,"It is turning out to be disappointing 2017 for the U.S. telecommunications industry. Cut-throat pricing competition resulting in lower ARPU (average revenue per user) and margins, massive investment for upcoming 5G wireless network and fiber optic buildout resulting in low free cash flow and intense competitive pressure shifted investor’s focus toward other growth-oriented industries in an overall bull market in 2017.Year to date, telecom service provider industry has lost 0.73%. Although the telecom equipment manufacturer industry has gained 12.09%, it is still below the bench-mark S&P 500 index gain of 16.91%.   Will the telecom industry turnaround in 2018? The answer to this question depends on a spate of macro-economic and industry specific factors. Irrespective of a few positives and negatives, the industry’s fate will also depends on court verdicts in some major cases.Positive FactorsUpcoming fifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. Verizon plans to launch next-generation 5G wireless residential broadband services in three-five U.S. markets in 2018. However, a full-phased 5G wireless network will be offered only in 2020. 5G wireless networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in Internet-of-Things (IoT). In other words, IoT has the potential of becoming the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space.Accumulation of dark fiber will bolster telecom operator’s cell network density, consequently giving a boost to their mobile backhaul network. The densification of cell network will help carriers install and build 5G network. Adoption of small cells has increased due to the inconvenience of installing large towers in inaccessible areas. Small cells will be used to augment existing 4G LTE and upcoming 5G network and will primarily concentrate on high traffic locations like a business district or a shopping mall.Internet TV streaming service is gradually gaining market traction in the United States. Of late, the legacy pay-TV industry has been facing stiff competition from online video streaming service providers. The low-cost over-the-top video streaming service has resulted in massive cord cutting that is currently threatening the pay-TV business model. Internet TV streaming has emerged as a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat.President Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  We believe the U.S. telecommunications industry is going to be a major beneficiary.The proposal to reduce corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% faced by telecom carriers would be immediately accretive to cash flow. Trump’s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators. The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R&D and its deployment.  The telecom industry is highly capital-intensive in nature. Therefore, the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible, intangible and real property (other than land) would significantly benefit telecom carriers. This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure. Major proposals such as a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above-mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending.Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during his term as the President. We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change. A new Federal Communications Commission (FCC), headed by Ajit Pai, exercising lesser restrictions, certainly augurs well for the ISP (Internet Service Providers) industry.Negative FactorsThe U.S. wireless industry is likely to get competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators). Comcast has already entered this space with its Xfinity Mobile offering. Importantly, the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.Charter Communications has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year. Further, DISH Network has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands which will be utilized to deploy 4G LTE wireless network in the top 100 U.S. markets.Telecom operator’s wireline business is also struggling with persistent losses in access lines as a result of competitive pressure from voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data and video) offerings by cable MSOs (multi service operators). These are weighing on the company’s revenues and margins. Moreover, cord-cutting remains a major problem for all legacy pay-TV operators.Internet TV streaming service market is quickly getting crowded. Moreover, a major concern for pay-TV operators, who recently entered into Internet TV streaming, is that the latter has actually cannibalized the legacy pay-TV service. Most of these companies are offering both legacy pay-TV services as well as Internet TV streaming service, with selected TV channels at lower costs.Two Key Court Verdict is AwaitingOn Dec 14, 2017, in a landmark decision, the U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime. There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality. Nevertheless, Net Neutrality supporters are preparing for a legal battle. The current FCC's less-restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies. We expect this subject to remain a hot cake in the 2018 telecom space.AT&T and media giant Time Warner are finally heading for a battle in court against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2018 over their $85.4 billion big-ticket merger deal. On Nov 20, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against the telecom behemoth over its mega acquisition deal citing that the proposed deal will increase prices for rival pay-TV operators as well as subscribers. It will also act as a stumbling block for the development of online video. Recently, AT&T and DOJ once again engaged in a settlement talk which failed to resolve the issue unanimously.  We believe that the decision will have a strong bearing on the recent convergence trend in the telecom-cable TV-media space. Cable TV and telecom giants are foraying into the media industry with big ticket acquisitions. Technologically, we are moving from triple-play (voice-video-data) bundled services offering to quad play (voice-video-data-mobile) bundled offering.  Video-on-demand is the new norm for telecom, cable TV and media industries. Technological advancements have enabled distributors to come up with different ways of bundling and disseminating content, effective content creation methods and creating new business models. The DOJ’s decision is a major concern for this new business model.Stocks in FocusWe have zeroed in on five companies with strong long-term growth potential as these are poised to benefit the most in 2018 primarily due to their diversified product portfolio, lucrative product pipeline and strong cash flow.

1529,DISH,"Per a recent FierceCable report, cable and satellite television companies are gearing up to hike prices of their packages. Major cable companies like Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report), DISH Network Corp (DISH  -  Free Report) and Cox Communications Inc have notified their customers about increase in programming packages rates, effective from 2018. U.S. telecom behemoth, AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) has also announced monthly price increase for it’s over the top (OTT) online streaming service DirecTV Now.The move comes at a time when cable companies are reporting video subscriber losses to the online video streaming service providers. Online video streaming providers such as Netflix, Inc (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube, etc. pose severe threat because of their cheap source of TV programming.Video offering, which represents the core business function of cable-TV operators, is losing popularity. Per a FierceCable report, traditional pay-TV services, including cable and satellite, lost 1.2 million customers in third-quarter 2017, thanks to cord cutting. (Read more: Pay-TV Subscriber Loss Rises in Q3, Cord Cutting Still a Woe)In the first nine months of 2017, cable companies lost 801,000 video customers — 114% higher year over year. Total U.S. traditional pay-TV subscribers are approximately 91.7 million. The subscriber loss trend is expected to continue in the upcoming fourth-quarter 2017 results.In such a scenario,price hike can negatively impact the companies. This is because viewers always look for cheaper packages.Moreover, people are in festive mood. It is rare for operators to increase prices during this time of the year. Celebrations are always welcomed with offers and attractive discounts, to lure more subscribers.Why the Price Hike?Companies have cited various reasons for price increase. Increasing cost of programming content continues to be one of the main reasons of video rates increase. Continuous investment in network, products and services also add to the company’s budget.In third-quarter 2017, Comcast’s Cable Communications segment witnessed a 5.3% increase in operating expenses due to a 12% increase in video programming costs and a 1.1% increase in non-programming expenses.In the reported quarter, DISH Network’s operating expenses were more than $3,134.40 million. The company, in their press release, stated that programming expenses are increasing and could adversely affect future financial condition and operations.AT&T’s total operating expenses in third-quarter 2017 were $33,265 million compared with $32,514 million and $32,501 million in the previous two quarters of 2017, respectively.Evolution of new technologies have resulted in cutthroat price competition. Expenses related to the upgrades have also increased the company’s overall costs and expenses.Price increase is also a business strategy to recover their monetary losses.Our View & Zacks RankThe justifications for the hike looks satisfactory. However, persistent video subscriber losses coupled with increase in package prices is likely to dent the companies’ video businesses, thus severely affecting margins. We look forward to seeing if these companies rake in profits in 2018.Currently, Comcast, DISH Network and AT&T carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The market landscape is fast changing, as these industries are systematically converging. The latest converged battlefield is the over-the-top (OTT) TV streaming service.Internet TV streaming service is gradually gaining market traction in the United States.

1532,DISH,"Shares of satellite-TV operator DISH Network Corporation (DISH  -  Free Report) tumbled to a 52-week low of $37.75 during the trading session on Mar 22. However, the figure recovered marginally to close at $37.77, down 3.3%.In fact, the stock has not performed well in the past three months. Shares of DISH Network have lost 22.2% compared with the industry’s fall of 11.7% in the said time frame. The stock also looks unattractive when compared with the market at large. The S&P 500 index gained 0.8% in the same time frame.Reasons for the UnderperformanceDISH Network continues to struggle with the persistent loss of subscribers due to stiff competition and cord-cutting in the pay-TV industry. On the one side, it is facing intense competition in the pay-tv market from rival players like AT&T, Comcast Corporation and Charter Communications. On the other side, it is losing video subscribers to online video streaming providers such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube and others because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming.At the end of 2017, DISH Network had 13.242 million pay-TV subscribers (down 3.1% y/y) of which DISH TV subscribers were 11.03 million (down 9.4% y/y). However, Sling TV subscribers were 2.212 million, up 47.4% y/y. This trajectory of subscriber losses in pay-TV is expected to continue in the upcoming quarters.Meanwhile, DISH Network’s top-line growth continues to remain under pressure due to its failure to strike any deal with wireless operators to deploy a nationwide wireless network. The company’s prospects are likely to get affected by its failure to renew long-term programming contracts on favorable pricing and other economic terms. Also, escalating programming and content expenses and retransmission fees may dampen the company’s margins, going forward.Downward Estimate RevisionsWe note that the sales and earnings per share (EPS) estimates for DISH Network have moved down for the current quarter and full-year 2018.Current quarter and full-year 2018 sales are estimated to decline 4.9% and 4%, respectively. Earnings are estimated to decline 7.9% for the current quarter and 3.2% in 2018.The downward estimate revisions reflect pessimism over the prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Bearish ReadingsROC Return on Capital (ROC) of DISH Network is 6.1% compared with 6.4% for the industry. This implies that the company generates a lower return on investment than its industry. Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company. In terms of this metric, DISH Network seems to be a highly leveraged stock with a reading of 218.1% compared with 103.4% for the industry. Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector are Cable One Inc. (CABO  -  Free Report) and AMC Networks Inc. (AMCX  -  Free Report). Both Cable One and AMC Networks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The projected earnings growth rate (3-5 years) for Cable One and AMC Networks is 3% and 7.4%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1535,DISH,"Shares of satellite-TV operator DISH Network Corp (DISH  -  Free Report) have tumbled to a 52-week low of $51.63 during the trading session on Oct 9. However, the figure recovered marginally to close at $51.68, down 3.09%.Over the past 52 weeks, shares of DISH Network have ranged from a low of $51.63 to a high of $66.50. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 1.9 million.Why the Downturn?DISH Network continues to struggle with the persistent loss of subscribers due to cord-cutting. In the last reported second-quarter 2017, DISH Network lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers compared with a loss of 281,000 in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the company lost 46,000 broadband subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 15,000 in the year-ago quarter. This trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to signify an unprecedented annual decline.Over the last 3-4 years, the internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have been gradually shifting from cable-TV operators to large telecom operators and low-cost over-the-top service providers. Extensive network of fiber-based video services from telecom operators and the strong presence of online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., have become a severe threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming.Also, DISH Network faces intense competition in the pay-tv market from players like AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, DISH Network’s top-line growth remains under pressure due to its failure to strike any deal with wireless operators to deploy a nationwide wireless network. The company might be affected after failing to renew long-term programming contracts on favorable pricing and other economic terms. Also, escalating programming and content expenses and retransmission fees may impede the company’s margins.Additionally, penalty of $280 million by the U.S. District Judge of the Central Illinois District, Sue Myerscough, in a telemarketing lawsuit was a major setback. This was possibly the biggest judgment ever related with such a case. We expect DISH Network to quickly resolve all such disputes and focus on growth-based strategies.We believe that stiff pricing competition, stringent regulatory norms along with anti-competitive and unfair business practices charges are reasons behind the decrease in the company’s share pricePrice PerformanceThe price performance of DISH Network fails to impress. Over the past three months, shares of DISH Network have declined 20.2% as against the industry’s gain of 2.2%. Estimates on the DownswingWe note that the sales and earnings per share (EPS) estimates for DISH Network has moved down for the remaining quarters of 2017 and also for full-year 2017.Sales growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to decelerate 4.1% and 4.6%, respectively. For 2017, sales are expected to drop 4.2%.EPS growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to decelerate 4.8% and 13.9%, respectively. For fiscal 2017, EPS is expected to drop 32.2%.The downward estimate revisions reflect pessimism over the prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Certainly Not a Broker’s FavoriteGiven the challenges faced by the company, the stock is not a favorite pick for brokers right now.Over the last 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 earnings has gone down 1.6% to 61 cents per share and 4.8% to 60 cents, respectively. Likewise, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has plummeted 69 cents to $2.07 per share.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by broker’s advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. Notably, the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1536,DISH,"Last week was pretty eventful for the telecom industry despite most major telecom stocks losing value.T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report), the third and fourth-largest wireless carriers in the United States, are reportedly discussing the tentative terms for their proposed stock-for-stock merger. A number of reports have stated that Sprint’s shareholders and its parent company Softbank will own 40-50% of the combined entity. T-Mobile US’ shareholders, including Deutsche Telekom, will own the majority of the stake. T-Mobile US’ CEO John Legere is likely to lead the merged company if the deal falls in place. Both companies expect to reach an agreement by the third week of October.The much-hyped merger between CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) and Level 3 Communications Inc.  received regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), subject to certain outlined conditions, including court approval of certain provisions. However, the pending merger still awaits regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the California Public Utilities Commission, along with other customary closing conditions. The deal is anticipated to be closed in the third quarter of 2017.According to a report by Globo, the Brazilian antitrust agency, CADE, is likely to approve AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) proposed acquisition of Time Warner Inc. . Beside the home country United States, Brazil is the other that is yet to give regulatory nod to this deal.

(CBB  -  Free Report) has completed the $201-million acquisition of OnX Enterprise Solutions. The company took this step to expand its network and enterprise IT services. The takeover will help the company in becoming a hybrid IT solutions provider.U.S. telecom behemoth, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) is reportedly launching customer-friendly prepaid family plans to attract more subscribers. We believe that such a strategy to remain competitive and strengthen foothold in the wireless industry will benefit Verizon.

1537,DISH,"Telecom and pay-TV behemoth AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) DirecTV and Raycom Media — an American television broadcasting company — have agreed for a temporary extension of their current contract till Sep 5, 2017.The deal has been extended to avert the blackout of Raycom’s 54 stations on the satellite TV platform, as well as to provide an uninterrupted coverage of the ongoing Hurricane Harvey relief efforts.Earlier, AT&T had been accused of service disruption of Raycom stations on its U-verse video platform, in order to lure customers to DirecTV. The discontent subscribers were offered a subscription with DirecTV and also pushed to DirecTV Now.In second-quarter 2017, AT&T lost 195,000 U-verse customers and 156,000 satellite TV customers, and gained 152,000 DirecTV Now connections.Nonetheless, more consumers are now willing to switch to free over-the-air reception, in order to fight the escalating subscription costs. Also, the providers, even with a risk of losing add-on fees after cancelling local station packages, are finding different ways to suit their customers.  Recently, DISH Network Corporation (DISH  -  Free Report) and Citadel Communications agreed for a temporary extension of their current contract, thus avoiding an expected cut-off of the signal for the local ABC affiliate (WLNE-TV) in Providence, RI. However, DISH started offering free installation of HD over-the-air antennas to qualified local subscribers to avoid any service disruption.Price Performance & Zacks RankAT&T’s price performance has been dull for the last three months.

1538,DISH,"The U.S. wireless telecommunications industry has been trending down over the past several quarters. The decline continued in the first quarter of 2017 results as well.The domestic wireless industry continues to struggle with some major inherent headwinds like saturation issues, pricing competition, technological changes and marketing costs associated with any kind of promotional offers.Let’s take a closer look at how these factors have impacted the industry negatively.SaturationThe U.S. wireless industry is already saturated, where spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the domestic telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it difficult to manage mobile data traffic, which is growing by leaps and bounds. The situation has become acute with the growing popularity of smartphones, online mobile video streaming, cloud computing and video conferencing services.Intra-Industry CompetitionApart from saturation issues, competition is becoming intense in the United States wireless postpaid and prepaid industry. The gap between prepaid and postpaid average revenue per user (ARPU) has narrowed significantly, forcing telecom biggies to turn their attention to domestic prepaid mobile service business.Stiff pricing competition in the industry is a genuine concern. Few months back, we witnessed four major wireless telecommunications companies, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report), participating in the unlimited postpaid data plan war in order to remain competitive. These wireless operators are now extending their unlimited data plan to the prepaid market as well.Inter-Industry Competition Two major national cable behemoths, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) have agreed to jointly work on their wireless services businesses so as to better explore their opportunities, accelerate and enhance each other’s ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace. Recently, Comcast completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand. Meanwhile, Charter Communications plans to offer wireless service in 2018. The wireless venture is also aimed at retaining customers in this competitive world. Satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report), is also looking for wireless opportunities. It already has a strong portfolio of wireless spectrum.Promotional Liquidity WoesAdditionally, the companies have been continuously trying to lure customers with attractive promotional plans and lucrative discounts, as a counteractive measure against the competition posed by other carriers. This has led to a high cash burn rate and heavy losses for these companies.Price Performance: Jan - Jun, 2017The downfall has been noticed in their price performances. Over the six months span from January-June 2017, the shares of Verizon, Sprint and AT&T have declined 16.3%, 2.5% and 11.3%, respectively while that of T-Mobile US soared 5.4%. When compared with the market at large, the stock’s performance looks miserable, as the S&P 500 index has rallied 9.3%.Big Beat in Second-Quarter 2017Financial results of the national wireless carriers for the quarter ended Jun 30, 2017, was a positive. We witness a stark improvement in terms of their revenue growth and subscriber statistics.Let’s have a closer view on their prospects: -Verizon reported an addition of 614,000 postpaid customers and 19,000 prepaid customers in the last reported second-quarter 2017, compared with a loss of 307,000 postpaid and 17,000 prepaid customers in the first quarter of 2017. Meanwhile, total revenue increased 0.1% year over year to $30,548 million.AT&T had 136.500 million total subscribers, with 196,000 million postpaid wireless additions.T-Mobile US’ innovative network expansion methodologies have lured 1.333 million net customers, signifying the 17th successive quarter of over 1 million net customer additions. The company’s total revenue jumped 10% year over year to $10,213 million in the reported quarter.Sprint registered an impressive number of customer additions for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As of Jun 30, 2017, Sprint had 53.698 million wireless connections (up 0.63% year over year), with net additions of 61,000 wireless customers. Quarterly total revenue amounted $8,157 million, up 1.81% year over year.Notably, backed by such impressive subscriber additions and revenue growth, the management of all these four companies have raised their outlook for full-year 2017.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price Performance: Jul - Aug, 2017We get to see a remarkable improvement in the price performances of the wireless carriers. Over these two months span from July-August 2017, the share price of Verizon, T-Mobile US, Sprint and AT&T has rallied 8.6%, 4.7%, 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. When compared to the market at large, the stock’s performance looks favorable, as the S&P 500 index inched up 2.1%, over the same time span.What to Expect in Second-Half of 2017?On the back of such impressive financial results, we expect the trend to rise further in the coming quarters of 2017. This should likely have a positive influence in the second half of this year.At present, the U.S. telecom industry enjoys several positive attributes. First, the new telecom regulatory body – Federal Communications Commission (FCC) – has given enough indications that it will be less stringent compared with the Obama administration and is likely to roll back several regulations of the previous regime. Second, the less restrictive nature of the FCC will aid mergers and acquisitions which are likely to spur growth in 2017. Third, a growing U.S. economy drives demand for real-time voice, data and video. This escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.

1539,DISH,"Satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report), which also commands a strong portfolio of wireless spectrum, received a shot in the arm yesterday. A federal appeals court ordered the U.S. telecom regulator -- Federal Communications Commission (FCC) -- to review the case of two firms affiliated with DISH in an airwaves auction. The FCC had earlier determined that these two firms were ineligible for small-business discounts.Soon after the news spread in the market, shares of DISH Network jumped 4.6% in Nasdaq, finally settling an increase of nearly 2% at the end of the day. However, the industry researchers have mixed views on the final outcome.In January 2015, the FCC concluded its AWS-3 spectrum auction which registered a record-breaking bid value of $44.89 billion. Notably, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) emerged as the top bidder, spending $18.2 billion followed by DISH’s $13.3 billion, Verizon Communications Inc.’s (VZ  -  Free Report) $10.4 billion and T-Mobile US Inc.’s (TMUS  -  Free Report) $1.8 billion.Interestingly, DISH participated in the auction via three designated entities (DE) – American AWS-3 Wireless, Northstar Wireless LLC., and SNR Wireless LicenseCo LLC. Immediately after the FCC declared the names of the auction winners on Feb 2, 2015, DISH claimed that it is eligible for a 25% discount on the total value of its winning bids, under FCC's “DE” program. This implies that DISH will have to pay just around $10 billion to acquire all licenses it has won.On Aug 17, 2015, the FCC unanimously voted against DISH’s claim of a $3.3 billion discount. The regulatory body argued that the DE program is aimed at encouraging the participation of small wireless operators in the airwave auction which DISH has unduly taken advantage of. This, undoubtedly, was a major setback for the company.Notably, DISH is the second largest satellite TV operator in the U.S. with annual revenues of almost $15 billion. The company already holds a strong portfolio of wireless spectrums and a significant 85% stake in both Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless. Despite this, the two companies have appealed for the small-business discount, which according to the final verdict of the FCC, largely violates the morale of the DE program. Meanwhile, yesterday’s development generated mixed response among industry stalwarts. Some researchers believe that if the FCC reverses its verdict and consequently the AWS-3 bidding credits are reinstated to the two DEs affiliated by DISH, then the company will get around $3.3 billion of incremental value which will boost its bottom line.However, the bigger question is, will the FCC reconsider its earlier decision. Notably, the person who was most vocal against DISH’s argument about DE was Mr. Ajit Pai, who was a commissioner of the regulatory body. After Donald Trump’s presidential win, Pai has become the Chairman of the FCC. A lot will depend on the FCC’s policy on DE practice under Ajit Pai.Price Performance of DISH NetworkDISH Network’s shares have declined 9.41%, underperforming the industry’s loss of a mere 0.58% in the last three months. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1540,DISH,"Premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31, 2017) results on Aug 24, before the market opens.In the trailing four quarters, the company has delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 0.79%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to PlayIn the last three months, Hormel Foods’ shares lost 3.6%, as against 7.9% gain incurred by the industry.Fall in turkey prices, extensive competition and increase in overall operating expenses have weighed on the Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store business segment’s performance in the preceding two quarters. The company perceives these headwinds to persist and in turn depress the top and bottom-line performance even in the second half of the fiscal year.Moreover, other adverse headwinds such as a stronger U.S. currency, price inflation of major inputs (such as beef, pork and poultry) or outbreak of any livestock disease are likely to weigh over its revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarters.However, amid the aforementioned negativities, Hormel Foods is poised to boost its near-term revenues on the back of stronger demand for popular brands like Skippy and Justin's. Moreover, the company’s ongoing $190 million capital expenditure plan for fiscal 2017 is likely to generate benefits moving ahead.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hormel Foods is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

1542,DISH,"CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report), a leading regional wireline service provider in the U.S, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Aug 2, after market closes.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 1.89%. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.79%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe price performance of CenturyLink has been depressing over the last three months. The stock lost 7%, whereas the industry declined 0.2% over the same time frame.The company continues to face persistent losses in its access lines and legacy voice services on an organic basis. This is primarily because, in addition to large telecommunications providers, the company faces intense competition from cable TV operators and other wireless companies that aggressively offer traditional voice service over their networks. Improvements in the quality of VoIP services have enabled cable TV, internet, and telephone companies to offer services at attractive price points.Decline in subsidy payments by the Federal Universal Service Fund, tough competition, federal regulations, labor union issues and the need to upgrade technology remain headwinds. CenturyLink unveiled disappointing guidance for certain important metrics for the second quarter of 2017 compared with the last reported outlook for the first quarter of 2017.However, the company remains focused on establishing itself as a global leader in cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions arena for enterprise customers. Recently, it unveiled a beta version of its over-the-top (OTT) TV service. By foraying into this space, the company has joined the likes of DISH Network Corp.’s (DISH  -  Free Report) Sling TV and AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) DirecTV Now. Moreover, CenturyLink is investing in fiber-to-the-tower (FTTT) expansion and has expanded its fiber-based backhaul services.Earnings Whispers      Our proven model does not conclusively show that CenturyLink is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CenturyLink has an Earnings ESP of -2.04%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 48 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands higher at 49 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CenturyLink has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s -2.04% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CenturyLink, Inc.

1545,DISH,"DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report), the second largest satellite TV operator in the U.S., is expected to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers before the opening bell on Jul 20.In the last reported quarter, DISH Network delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.43%. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 7.79%.Share price of DISH Network has risen 9.51% in the past three months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Cable TV industry’s decline of 0.84%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayWe are impressed with DISH Network’s efforts to diversify its business model from a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet TV operator. This should help the company counter competitive threats from low-cost video streaming operators. The company's flexible cash and liquidity position allows it to invest extensively. We can witness similar flexibility in the upcoming quarterly results. The launch of Air TV Player bodes well for DISH Network’s prospects.Moreover, the company has been trying to lure more customers for its Internet TV service, Sling TV, by offering it at a reasonable rate along with the addition of other premium networks such as Showtime and related channels. Despite such efforts, the company has failed to gain subscribers in the broadband and pay-TV segment.As of Mar 31, DISH Network had approximately 13.528 million pay-TV subscribers compared with 13.874 million at the end of 2016. The company lost 143,000 pay-TV subscribers in first-quarter 2017 compared with a loss of 23,000 at the end of Dec 2016.Moreover, DISH Network lost 25,000 broadband subscribers in first-quarter 2017 compared with a gain of 5,000 in the year-ago quarter. As of Mar 31, the company had 555,000 broadband subscribers compared with 628,000 at the end of 2016. Stiff competition might have resulted in subscriber loss, which is a drag for the company. We expect DISH Network to recover from this subscriber loss in the to-be reported quarter.DISH Network’s top-line growth continues to remain under pressure. The company has failed to strike any deal with wireless operators to deploy a nationwide wireless network which is a major concern. Moreover, the company may be affected by its inability to renew long-term programming contracts on favorable pricing and other economic terms. Escalating programming and content expenses as well as retransmission fees may also hurt the company’s margins.The telemarketing lawsuit which amounted to a fine-cum-damage recovery cost of $280 million, to be paid to the U.S. government and four states, was a major setback for the company.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that DISH Network is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: DISH Network has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 75 cents.

1546,DISH,"Global marketing and corporate communications firm Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 20. In the last reported quarter, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Omnicom’s earnings track record has been quite healthy, having beaten estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.71%.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly results.Key Factors Omnicom remains poised on its strategy of making internal investments and accretive acquisitions to further strengthen its core capabilities.The company maintains a balanced growth model through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and strategic acquisitions. The companyexpects to witness higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of prudent acquisitions and organic growth.In addition, Omnicom is witnessing a healthy performance in developed markets like the U.S. and developing markets like Asia. The measures undertaken by the company to reduce costs helped it boost earnings. It is expanding its global footprint and is moving into new service areas. The company is also building upon its digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology firms in key markets. Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets.However, a significant portion of Omnicom’s revenues comes from Europe. In the present scenario, when the economy in the region is highly unpredictable particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. In addition, the company is susceptible to market risks of losing contracts related to media purchases and production costs. This is likely to affect the bottom line and undermine its organic growth to some extent.Furthermore, a significant portion of the revenues is derived in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This is likely to adversely impact the company’s financial results due to volatility in currency exchange rates. As Omnicom expands its international operations, it exposes itself to risks from foreign exchange barriers and uncertainty from monetary devaluation. The company also faces huge concentration risks as it relies on a few big clients for its businesses. These developments might prove to be a strain on Omnicom in the impending quarter.  For the to-be-reported-quarter, Omnicom’s revenues are anticipated to be affected by the volatility in the market. In addition, client spending patterns in the global markets are likely to be constrained by a challenging macroeconomic environment and geopolitical scenario.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Omnicom is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is  -0.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.38 while the consensus estimate is pegged higher at $1.39.

Price and EPS Surprise | Omnicom Group Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Omnicom has a Zacks Rank #3.

It also stated that the new service will include some innovative features to differentiate its offering from the existing products in the market.Notably, Verizon offers fiber-optic based FiOS TV services to its residential customers. This service is similar to that of cable TV operator’s traditional video offerings. At present, the company is on the verge of carrying out test trial runs for its IPTV upgrade.In 2015, the company launched go90 - a YouTube-like streaming-video service - for teenagers. Nevertheless, the new online streaming video service will be different from the previous two offerings as it will compete with established low-cost streaming video services like Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime video.Meanwhile, Internet TV streaming service seems to gain market traction gradually in the United States. Of late, the legacy pay-TV industry has been facing stiff competition from online video streaming service providers. In fact, the low-cost over-the-top video streaming service has resulted in massive cord cutting that is currently threatening the pay-TV business model.As a result, Internet TV streaming has emerged as a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat.Major pay-TV operators such as AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) and Sony Corp. (SNE  -  Free Report) have already launched their Internet TV streaming services.AT&T’s DirecTV Now include channels like E!, FX, TBS and TNT. DISH Network’s Sling TV offers channels like ESPN, AMC, Cartoon Network, HBO and Univision. Sony’s PlayStation Vue provides a portfolio of channels like Bravo, Fox News, Nickelodeon and USA.Price PerformanceShares of Verizon have gained 14%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2.9% over the last 90 days. Also, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1549,DISH,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal second-quarter 2018 results on Dec 14. Notably, the company has beaten estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 6.76%.Last quarter, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 62 cents, which increased 12.3% on a year-over-year basis and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents.Further, revenues of $9.21 billion increased 7% year over year and surpassed the consensus mark of $9.03 million.Expect What?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 68 cents compared with 61 cents in the year-ago period. The earnings estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.557 billion, up roughly 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing Q2 ResultsOracle is benefiting from significant momentum in its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings. This has also helped in improving the company's competitive position against salesforce.com and Workday. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth. This is further evident from the expanding customer base.Cloud SaaS revenues during the last reported quarter advanced a significant 61.6% (62% in constant currency) year over year to $1.09 billion. Cloud Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) revenues surged 29.2% (28% in constant currency) to $403 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IaaS is pegged at $421 million.Recently, Oracle unveiled its blockchain services on cloud, after around two months of collaborating with Hyperledger, Linux Foundation’s open source underlying technology behind the blockchain build-up. Oracle’s entry in the expanding blockchain market is anticipated to be a positive for its top and bottom line and will also boost shares going forward.Going forward, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (AWS).However, higher investments on IaaS will affect gross margin expansion in the near term. Further, a strong U.S. dollar remains a headwind.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Oracle is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Oracle currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 68 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Oracle has a Zacks Rank #3 that increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.37% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.DISH Network Corporation (DISH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #3.Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1550,DISH,"The U.S. pay-TV industry has been facing competitive threat from the online video streaming providers because of cheap source of TV programming. The industry has been losing subscribers to online video streaming providers such as Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube, etc. Video offering, which represents the core business function of cable-TV operators, is losing popularity.Per a FierceCable report, traditional pay-TV services, including cable and satellite, lost 1.2 million customers in third-quarter 2017, thanks to cord cutting. (Read more: Pay-TV Subscriber Loss Rises in Q3, Cord Cutting Still a Woe)In the first nine months of 2017, cable companies lost 801,000 video customers — 114% higher year over year. Total U.S. traditional pay-TV subscribers are approximately 91.7 million.In such a scenario, major cable operators are integrating Netflix natively on their set-top boxes. Integration of Netflix and select over-the-top (OTT) services has become a common strategy among leading pay-TV operators. Previously, the operators were apprehensive about the increasing adoption of OTT platform.We believe that the companies are trying to leverage the demand of these programming services to enhance their connectivity products. They are trying to reach out to a wider customer base to check churn.Pay-TV Stocks Integrating OTTU.S. telecom behemoth, Verizon Communications, Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) is reportedly making Netflix available on select Fios set-top devices. Per sources, Verizon is currently running a trial of the service with a select group of employees and customers.In November 2017, privately held U.S. cable company — Cox Communications — reportedly announced the integration of Netflix on Cox Contour nationwide.  Customers with a Netflix subscription can access Netflix content, along with Cox's live TV, DVR and On Demand content within the Contour TV guide.On Oct 31, cable-tv giant Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) announced the availability of Netflix Ultra HD (UHD) 4K programming on Xfinity X1. Xfinity customers with a 4K-capable X1 device and a Netflix premium subscription can watch Netflix 4K movies and shows, along with live on demand, DVR and web programming. Prior to this, Comcast also tested the integration of YouTube on its X1 video platform.On Sep 29, Satellite-TV operator DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) became the first pay-TV operator to offer a whole-home 4K programming services of Netflix via Hopper 3 DVRs. The company announced that the streaming video-on-demand operator’s content can be viewed throughout the home.DISH Network was already streaming Netflix’s programs through over-the-top (OTT) Sling TV video streaming service. DISH Network has also launched a streaming player called AirTV Player for similar reasons.In September 2017, T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS  -  Free Report) announced the inclusion of services from Netflix into its unlimited postpaid wireless service, T-Mobile ONE. The company is the national provider of mobile communications services.All the above-mentioned companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LinePay-TV operators are planning to revamp business model to keep their market share intact. In order to cope with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have also started offering Internet-TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates.With the increasing popularity of OTT video services, we keenly wait to see whether offering of Internet-TV services or unity with the opponents (OTT video services), will help retain their position.  If not so, do these companies have an alternative plan to check subscriber losses?Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1551,DISH,"The battle has begun and YouTube has fired the first salvo. On Dec 5, Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google announced it was removing support for its YouTube app on Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Fire TV. The search engine giant cited a number of reasons for this drastic move.Firstly, Amazon has for long refused to sell Chromecast and recently removed Nest products from its website. Further, Amazon has failed to make Prime Video available on any of Google’s streaming devices.But this was only the beginning of a tale which has likely yet to run its course. On Dec 6, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) made the Prime Video app available on its Apple TV devices. The launch of this app clears the way of the resumption of Apple TV sales on Amazon’s website. This little example alone is sufficient to illustrate the level of competition prevailing in the streaming services arena.According to market research firm Park Associates, nearly a third of households in the United States now subscribe to several over the top (OTT) streaming services. With more than 200 OTT video services available within the country, competition is only going to get fiercer. And feeling the heat will be the incumbents of this once small business segment.  Follow the 800-Pound GorillaLeading the streaming services pack is segment pioneer Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report). November data from Park Associates show that Netflix continues to hold the top spot among all OTT video services in the United States, followed by Amazon Video and Hulu. Further the company’s stock is up nearly 50% year to date. So can the 800-pound gorilla of the streaming universe carry its success into 2018 and beyond?Daniel Ives from GBH Insights thinks that those holding Netflix should refrain from cashing in too quickly on the stock’s success. Despite the increasing competition in the space, Ives thinks that Netlfix’s original content, first mover advantage, international growth and franchise appeal will hold it in good stead going forward. Currently, GBH projects that Netflix will touch 60 million subscribers by 2019 and close in on the 100 million mark by 2020. Netflix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Two-Day Delivery plus Much MoreClosing in on Netflix’s success is Amazon’s Prime Video which offers a range of non-streaming benefits to its customers. Two-day delivery of products purchased on Amazon’s portal alone provides it with a significant edge in the competition, especially during the holiday season. The only sticking point for viewers signing on to the Prime Video service is possibly the fact that you can only subscribe for an entire year at $99, unlike say Netflix or Hulu where you can sign up for a month at a time for around $8-$9. Per month costs in these case, are of course marginally higher.And now the online retailer is reportedly considering launching a completely new video streaming service. Unlike Prime Video, this new service would be entirely free and utilize advertising to meet its costs. If Amazon does indeed launch such a service, it could divert significant viewership from Netflix and Hulu, ranked at number three on the list of the United States’ top video streaming services.New Kids on the BlockData from Park Associates also shows that the top four video streaming devices, rounded off by MLB.TV, have remained unchanged from a year ago. According to the research firm’s senior research director Brett Sappington, this means that new and emerging services will find it difficult to break down barriers to entry and create a loyal subscriber base.However, HBO Now currently features at the number five spot on this list, a progression which clearly indicates consumers’ preference for niche streaming options. A host of streaming services was announced around the end of 2016 and all through the current year. Most of these are targeted at fulfilling a very specific need set.For instance, Filmstruck, which features the best of the hallowed Criterion Collection, showcases the best of critically acclaimed cinema. On the other hand, Acorn TV brings the best entertainment produced in the United Kingdom. Yet another dimension has been added by traditional broadcasters, who have launched streaming services in order to effectively compete with the new format. DISH Network Corporation’s (DISH  -  Free Report) Sling TV has 1.7 million subscribers, according to Bloomberg and already features among the top 10 U.S. video streaming services. Meanwhile, AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) DirecTV Now breached the 1 million subscriber barrier earlier this week.  Increasing Fragmentation, Rising Library CostsUltimately, the end of TV subscriptions is approaching at a much faster rate than earlier expected. This process has been hastened by the rising preference for personalized and niche services which focus on the needs of the individual viewer. In the process a highly fragmented space is likely to emerge, especially with the trend to create and develop exclusivity over original content.Of course, this amount of original content will come at a price. Expenditure on original content is likely to jump substantially in 2018. For instance, Netflix is planning to spend almost $8 billion on producing its own content next year. This is a substantial jump from the $6 billion that it spent on content in 2017. Amazon isn’t too far behind, having spent $4.5 billion on content for its Prime Video services. Meanwhile, Hulu and HBO spent $2.5 billion each for the same purpose this year.  Brave New 2018Next year is set to be an even more exciting one for the streaming space. On the one hand, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) is set to launch its streaming service, featuring content from the Marvel and Star Wars stables. During its last earnings call, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the service would be priced “substantially below” Netflix, which is also likely to lose loads of premium content to this new service.Further, social media giants, such as Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) with its Watch service, and YouTube are going to become particularly active in the streaming game. Live TV streaming is another are which is opening up in a big way with Hulu, Sling and DirecTV Now leading the way.Increasing competition, mounting content costs and fragmentation is likely to force industry occupants such as Netflix to become more traditional. For instance, Netflix is increasingly releasing episodes every week, much like old television broadcasting. This is a clear departure from the binge watching trend it created when it began releasing entire seasons at one go. The going is likely to be tough for industry insiders such as Netflix in 2018. And the only likely winner in such a situation would be the consumer.   Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

1552,DISH,"Satellite TV service provider DISH Network Corporation (DISH  -  Free Report) and Citadel Communications -- an American private broadcasting company -- has agreed for a temporary extension of their current contract till Aug 23, 2017.The company expected a cut-off of the signal for the local ABC affiliate (WLNE-TV) in Providence, Rhode Island. However, to avoid any service disruption, it started offering free installation of HD over-the-air antennas to qualified local subscribers.Currently, the company is trying hard to mitigate the dispute with its owner over carriage fees and to keep ABC6 available on DISH Network. But the inflexible approach and appalling demands of Citadel is making it difficult for the company to reach an agreement with the broadcasters.Notably, DISH Network lost a net of 196,000 pay-TV subscribers in the second quarter 2017 due to a rise in programming cost. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had approximately 13.332 million pay-TV subscribers, down 1.9% year over year.In fact, more consumers are now acquiescent to switching to free over the air reception to fight the rising subscription costs. Also, the providers, even with a risk of losing add-on fees after cancelling local station packages, are finding different ways to suit their customers.  Earlier, DISH Network could avert the blackout of 129 Sinclair TV stations on its satellite pay-TV service by reaching a short-term extension agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group too. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) helped them to come to this short-term broadcast retransmission extension.Price Performance and Zacks RankDISH Network’s price performance has been dull for the last six months.

1553,DISH,"Per a recent FierceCable report, traditional pay-TV services, including cable and satellite, lost 976,000 customers in the recently reported second-quarter 2017, due to cord-cutting. Though the figure is below the estimated (by several research firms) loss of 1 million subscribers, it clearly portrays the effects of cord-cutting.Traditional cable, satellite and telco MVPD (multichannel video programming distributor) services have lost a combined 1.8 million users in 2017, with the number of pay-TV homes in the United States dropping to 96.1 million.U.S. Pay-TV Industry Over the last 3-4 years, the internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have been gradually shifting from cable TV operators to large telecom operators and low-cost over-the-top service providers. Extensive network of fiber-based video services from telecom operators and the strong presence of online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., have become a severe threat to cable TV operators.These online video streaming channels provide an extremely cheap source of TV programming unless the customer is eager to view real-time programs like sports events. This business model is gaining momentum, even during economic uncertainties and have proven to be a threat to the pay-tv industry’s business.The industry has been losing customers to wireless telecom operators and online streaming service providers. Leading cable multi service operator and media giant Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) NBC Universal segment fared well, but its Cable business is suffering from subscriber losses. The company added a net of 175,000 high-speed internet customers but lost 34,000 video customers and 22,000 voice customers in the reported quarter.Charter Communications Inc.’s (CHTR  -  Free Report) commercial segment also fared well, which is evident from the revenue and subscriber growth in the reported quarter. However, the company lost 90,000 video customers in the residential segment. It is the second cable MSO after Comcast.The domestic multi-channel video market has also become extremely saturated and intensely competitive. Moreover, the US. pay-TV industry remains affected by the ongoing massive consolidation between telecom and cable TV operators to strengthen their base.In order to cope up with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering internet TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates.Telecom and pay-TV behemoth AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) had 38.8 million video subscribers (inclusive of 491,000 DIRECTV NOW) and 15.7 million broadband connections in the reported quarter. However, in the reported quarter, AT&T lost 195,000 U-verse customers and 156,000 satellite TV customers. DIRECTV NOW is the over the top (OTT) online streaming service of AT&T.DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report), the second largest satellite TV operator in the United States, lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 281,000 in the year-ago quarter.

1554,DISH,"Media giant, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 9. In the previous quarter, the company had registered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%. Moreover, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average earnings beat of 1.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Disney will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. After witnessing a year-over-year decline of 2.5% in the preceding quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the final quarter of fiscal 2017 is currently pegged at $1.12 per share, reflecting an increase of nearly 2% from the prior-year quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has declined by 5 cents in the past 30 days.Per analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $13,149 million, almost flat year over year. This is because gain in Media Networks and Parks and Resorts will be offset by decline in revenues at Studios segment. Let’s delve deeper and find out more.Let’s Delve DeepMedia Networks Likely to GainAfter witnessing a decline of 1% in the preceding quarter, the segment is likely to register a year-over-year increase of 0.8% owing to gain in revenues at Cable Networks. The analyst surveyed by Zacks expects revenues of $5,706 million, up from the prior-year figure of $5,658 million. Meanwhile, Cable Networks and Broadcasting are anticipated to report revenues of $4,009 million and $1,704 million up 1.3% and 0.1%, respectively. However, operating income from the segment is expected to decline 4.5% year over year to $1,597 million due to higher programming costs.Falling subscriber base and higher programming costs at ESPN remain major concerns. Fresh NBA agreement and increase in contractual rate for NFL programming has been driving the overall programming cost higher for ESPN. Disney is striving to bring back ESPN’s golden days. In an effort to attract online viewers, the company has inked a deal with video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech. Disney which had earlier acquired 33% stake in BAMTech announced its intention to acquire another 42% stake in the firm.Parks & Resorts Attracting VisitorsDisney’s Parks & Resorts division are also doing well. Disney is focused on deploying its capital toward expansion of the Parks and Resorts business. Consequently, increasing market share and creating long-term growth opportunities. Disney’s Parks and Resorts segment is once again anticipated to deliver growth in final quarter of fiscal 2017. The consensus mark for revenues from the segment is pegged at $4,559 million, up 3.9% year-over-year. Further, operating income is also anticipated to increase by 4.4% to $730 million.Another Tough Quarter for Studios SegmentThe segment, which impressed investors with blockbuster hits in 2016 has somewhat disappointed in 2017 as the year has been a weaker one for movie industry. The segment revenues declined 16% in the third quarter as the movies released failed to match the prior-year hits of Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book, and Finding Dory. The trendy is likely to continue in the fourth as the analyst polled by Zacks expects revenues of $1,637 million, down 9.6% year over year. However, operating income is projected to register a gain of nearly 5% year over year to $400 million.Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Disney is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1555,DISH,"News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report), the diversified media conglomerate, is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 9. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether the company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, News Corporation outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 25.7%.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has increased by a penny in the last 30 days and is currently pegged at 2 cents. This reflects an improvement over a loss of one cent reported in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenue of $1,978 million compared with $1,965 million reported in the prior-year period.Factors Influencing This QuarterNews Corporation is in a transitionary phase looking to diversify revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement. The company is expanding its digital offerings, along with greater emphasis on real estate businesses and augmenting digital subscriber base. Further, it has been concentrating on cost cutting.However advertising, which forms a major part of total revenue, remains highly vulnerable to the economic conditions. Advertising revenue at the News and Information Services segment tumbled 12% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to sluggishness in the print advertising market, reduced in-store product revenue at News America Marketing and adverse foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, revenue from the News and Information Services segment declined 10% year over year.Analysts surveyed by Zacks now anticipate revenue from News and Information Services division to decline 1.6% during the first quarter but envisions growth of 7.8% and 9.7% across Cable Network Programming and Digital Real Estate Services segments, respectively. Book Publishing division is expected to witness revenue growth of 1%.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that News Corporation is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

1556,DISH,"Strong presence of online video streaming providers is posing significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Video offering, which represented the core business function of cable TV operators, seems to be fast slipping out of their hands.Per a recent report by TDG Research, the traditional pay-TV service, which currently reaches 81% of U.S. households, is likely to shrink to 60% by 2030. At the same time, Internet TV streaming service is expected to gain 14% of U.S. household subscription from a mere 4% today. Similarly, U.S. household subscription for live multi-channel service will come down from the current level of 85% to 79% in 2030.The growing deployment of 4G LTE mobile network and significant adoption of portable mobile devices are the primary reasons propelling the popularity of Internet TV streaming. The Millennials have a strong appetite for new technologies, as they are no longer interested to incur huge bill for a fat pay-TV bundle. Skinny TV bundle in cost-effective manner is the next-generation favourite. (Read: Will Internet TV Streaming Replace Legacy Pay-TV in 2018?)Major pay-TV operators, such as AT&T Inc.

It is expected that DISH Network will include Sling TV rights in its next program licensing deal with CBS.Other Retransmission ConflictsConflict between TV broadcasters and pay-TV operators is not new in the United States. In October 2017, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) dropped Univision Inc.’s Spanish language TV channels from its fiber-based FiOS TV network.

1558,DISH,"Bitcoin is steadily gaining popularity, as reflected by its rising user base. Interestingly, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization of $160.8 billion, per coinmarketcap.com, is nearly double the valuation of Goldman Sachs, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), at a respective $89.2 billion and $88.8 billion.Investors should know that the surge in online retail transactions, especially in the holiday season, is driving bitcoin beyond the $9000 mark. This primarily reflects bitcoin’s growing acceptance in diverse businesses.A Note on BitcoinBitcoin is not a physical coin and no central authority creates the virtual currency. Instead, computers create bitcoin through mining. A special software is being used by the miners for solving critical mathematical problems, and thereby keeps the bitcoin network secure by verifying payments. In exchange, the miners receive a small amount of the digital currency as rewards.Record Customers Open Bitcoin AccountsAround Thanksgiving, the virtual currency market witnessed a record number of accounts for bitcoin traders. From Nov 22 to Nov 24, Coinbase — the United States’ largest bitcoin exchange — added roughly 100,000 new users willing to buy or sell the digital currency.Per Coinbase data and Alistair Milne, the bitcoin exchange currently has as many as 13.1 million users, way higher than the 4.9 million users recorded last November. The digital currency also touched an all-time high of $9,682.10 on Nov 27.It is to be noted that with an increasing number of bitcoin buyers and sellers, we expect more transactions that will need more mining. New businesses associated with mining have emerged and companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) offer digital mining equipment are in high demand. NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Holiday Retail Transaction Drives BitcoinCNBC stated that retail transactions this holiday session supported the cryptocurrency’s year-to-date increase of more than 850%. CME Group Inc.’s (CME  -  Free Report) plan to launch bitcoin futures also supported the rally. CME Group — the operator of the largest options and futures exchange in the world — announced plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the second week of December, media reports claim.Apart from holiday retail-centric growth, many investors prefer bitcoin, given that no more than 21 million of the virtual currency can be mined. The finite resource base of the cryptocurrency could help investors increase their wealth over time.Companies Going the Bitcoin WayMany businesses across countries are opting for bitcoin as a mode of transaction, driving the popularity of the currency. Here we discuss four companies that allow their customers to pay in bitcoin in exchange for goods and services.Headquartered in Bellevue, WA, Expedia, Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) is among the leading online travel players in the world. Per media report, since June 2014, the travel agency has been offering its customers the option to pay in bitcoins for booking hotels.We expect Expedia, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 4.1% in 2017.DISH Network (DISH  -  Free Report), headquartered in Englewood, CO, operates the DISH Network direct broadcast satellite (DBS) subscription television service in the United States. In August 2014, the company received bitcoin payment from customers for the first time.The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.3% for the last four quarters. Presently, DISH carries a Zacks Rank #3.Based in Seattle, WA, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is the leading roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. The company is accepting payments in bitcoin.We expect this Zacks #3 Ranked company to post year-over-year earnings growth of 12.1% in fiscal 2018.Based in Midvale, UT, Overstock.com, Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) is a leading online retail player. Since January 2014, the company has been accepting bitcoin for its wide range of products, including laptops and televisions.Overstock.com carries a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1559,DISH,"Internet TV streaming service is gradually gaining market traction in the U.S. Of late, the legacy pay-TV industry has been facing stiff competition from online video streaming service providers. The low-cost, over-the-top video streaming service has resulted in massive cord cutting that is currently threatening the pay-TV business model. Internet TV streaming has emerged as a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat.Technically, Internet TV streaming is similar to pay-TV offerings. Its shows can be viewed using a broadband connection and mobile gadgets like tablets, smartphones, Roku box and smart TV, to name a few. To sum up, Internet TV streaming offers a TV Everywhere experience to subscribers in a cost-effective manner.The growing deployment of 4G LTE mobile network and significant adoption of portable mobile devices are the primary reasons propelling the popularity of Internet TV streaming. The Millennials have a strong appetite for new technologies, as they are no longer interested in incurring a huge bill for a fat pay-TV bundle. A skinny TV bundle in a cost-effective manner is the next-generation favorite.Presently, the web-based digital media market is growing by leaps and bounds. Digital media brands are becoming immensely popular with the younger generation. With demand for smartphones and tablets on the rise, target customers are increasingly watching videos online, and preferring them over costlier legacy pay-TV connections.Moreover, an increasing number of customers are using the Internet to watch videos and want mobility of content. This has given TV distributors an opportunity to differentiate their products by offering access to select content through their networks. By making deals directly with content developers, service providers are trying to draw customers with bundles of content such as streaming entertainment or sporting events, possibly with no additional data charges.Market is Getting CrowdedMajor pay-TV operators, such as AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) and Sony Corp. (SNE  -  Free Report) have already launched their Internet TV streaming services. AT&T’s DirecTV Now includes channels such as E!, FX, TBS and TNT. DISH Network’s Sling TV offers channels like ESPN, AMC, Cartoon Network, HBO and Univision. Sony’s PlayStation Vue provides a portfolio of channels like Bravo, Fox News, Nickelodeon and USA. Apart from these three companies, YouTube TV of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Hulu Live TV also offer Internet TV streaming facilities.In August 2017, The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report) announced its plan of launching ESPN streaming service in 2018 and a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019. Telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has deferred the launch of its TV streaming service which is likely to be unveiled next spring. In September 2017, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) launched its TV streaming service - Xfinity Instant TV – only to its high-speed Internet subscribers.Each of the above-mentioned stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Is Cannibalization a Concern?A major concern pay-TV operators, who recently entered into Internet TV streaming, is that the latter has actually cannibalized the legacy pay-TV service. Most of these companies are offering both legacy pay-TV services as well as Internet TV streaming service, with selected TV channels at lower costs.The operators are yet to find out an appropriate trade-off between these two types of services. Making attractive online ventures are drawing subscribers to the new service at the cost of traditional pay-TV business model. Ultimately, the Internet TV service is yet to stop cord cutting, the biggest threat for pay-TV operators.Statistics reveal that Netflix has more than 100 million subscribers and Amazon has an estimated 60 million Prime TV customers, whereas AT&T, currently the largest pay-TV operator in the U.S., serves only 25 million subscribers across its legacy pay-TV and Internet TV streaming platforms.Bottom LineIt is to be noted that, exponential growth of mobile data usage supported by flourishing high-end smartphone and tablet devices has changed the entire dynamics of the traditional pay- TV industry. The Internet TV streaming service, launched by leading pay-TV operators in the United States, is yet to cope up with the onslaught of the low-cost online video streaming services. It remains to be seen how major pay-TV operators can survive the competition.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1560,DISH,"AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) is reported to have reached more than 1 million subscribers in DIRECTV NOW, its over-the-top (OTT) online streaming service.AT&T’s subscriber gain marks a major achievement in the intensely competitive industry, amid cord-cutting. The company reported a net gain of approximately 0.213 million DIRECTV NOW connections, since Sep 30, 2017.The news came as a blessing for the company at a time when it is facing strong administrative and political oppositions in relation to the pending $85.4-billion merger with Time Warner Inc . The companies have recently extended the deadline of their deal to Apr 22, 2018 to receive the requisite regulatory approvals pertaining to the closure of the merger.AT&T’s DirecTV Now The U.S. telecom behemoth has been undertaking measures to promote video streaming services.

(AAPL  -  Free Report) TV streaming device for three months of prepaid service. In June 2017, AT&T decided to offer a free Roku Premiere set-top box to customers when they prepay DIRECTV NOW for two months.We believe that the promotional plans have helped the company maintain customer addition momentum, evident from the last two quarterly results. In second-quarter 2017, AT&T reported a total an addition of 152 DIRECT NOW connections, taking the total to 0.491 subscribers. In third-quarter 2017, the company’s DIRECTV NOW connections were 0.787 million with a net addition of296,000 customers.AT&T plans to upgrade DIRECTV NOW in early 2018 with internet video storage, 4K quality video, additional movies and TV titles as well as personalized viewing recommendations.While AT&T continues to benefit from video streaming services, the company is eventually losing hold in the satellite TV and U-verse TV services. In second-quarter 2017, AT&T lost 195,000 U-verse customers and 156 satellite TV customers. In third-quarter 2017, the company lost 251,000 satellite TV and 134,000 U-verse TV customers.Rivals’ PositionDISH Network Corp’s (DISH  -  Free Report) Internet TV service — Sling TV — reported approximately 1.7 million subscribers in third-quarter 2017.  Per sources, net subscriber addition of Sony’s PlayStation Vue was 455,000, YouTube TV’s was at 325,000, Hulu’s live TV service was 150,000 and FuboTV’s was around 100,000.Bottom LineThe U.S. pay-TV industry is facing challenges from online video streaming providers posing significant competitive threat.

1562,DISH,"U.S. telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) is likely to defer the launch of an online TV streaming service, according to a recent report by AdAge. In Mar 2017, Bloomberg reported that this new service will be launched by Sep 2017. However, per the AdAge report, it could be delayed till the end of this year.Initially, Verizon had decided to come up with dozens of channels nationwide for the new service. Management was negotiating with several TV network owners to secure online streaming rights. Management also stated that the new service will include some innovative features to differentiate its offering from the existing products in the market.Nevertheless, AdAge reported that the company is still working on the specifics of the service such as pricing, programming and technology. The delay was primarily due to sudden departure of some important executives of Verizon’s online TV and content division.Notably, Verizon offers fiber-optic based FiOS TV services to its residential customers. This service is similar to that of cable TV operator’s traditional video offerings. At present, the company is on the verge of carrying out test trial runs for its IPTV upgrade.In 2015, the company launched go90, a YouTube-like streaming-video service aimed at teenagers. However, the new online streaming video service will be separate from the previous two offerings as it will compete with established low-cost streaming video services like Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime video.  Internet TV is gradually gaining market traction in the U.S. Of late, the legacy pay-TV industry in the country has been facing stiff competition from online video streaming service providers. The low-cost over-the-top video streaming service has resulted in massive cord cutting that is currently threatening the pay-TV business model. Internet TV has emerged a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat.Last year, Verizon’s closest rival AT&T Inc.

1564,DISH,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 9. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 14.9%.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 16% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Twenty-First Century Fox will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 34 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of over 24%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased by a couple of cents witnessed in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6,734 million compared with $6,646 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterRobust affiliate fees at the company’s broadcast and cable-television divisions are anticipated to drive the revenues higher. In the third quarter, Cable Network Programming revenues increased 2.1% on the back of robust affiliate revenues growth, after increasing 10% and 7.1% in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Affiliate fees are the dominant source of revenue for the Cable Network segment and a major contributor to total revenue.However, increase in cost at Cable Network Programming has been worrying investors. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Cable Network Programming costs have increased 6.3% to $7,687 million. The rise in expenses was mostly due to elevated sports programming costs. We believe that an increase in expenses, due to higher sports programming costs may hurt the margins and affect the bottom line in the coming quarters.Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

1567,DISH,"Per a recent FierceCable report, traditional pay-TV services, including cable and satellite, in the United States lost 1.2 million customers in third-quarter 2017, thanks to cord cutting.Estimates by several research firms like Kagan and Leichtman Research Group have provided us with key findings for the reported quarter.The largest pay-TV providers lost about 405,000 net video subscribers compared with a loss of about 250,000 subscribers in the year-ago quarter. Major cable companies lost about 290,000 video subscribers in the quarter under review compared with a loss of around 90,000 in the prior-year quarter. Satellite-TV services lost approximately 475,000 subscribers in the reported quarter as against the addition of about 5,000 subscribers in third-quarter 2016.In the first nine months of 2017, cable companies lost 801,000 video customers — reflecting a 114% rise year over year.Total U.S. traditional pay-TV subscribers stand at approximately 91.7 million.U.S. Pay-TV IndustryIn the last 3-4 years, the internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have been gradually shifting from cable-TV operators to large telecom operators and low-cost over-the-top (OTT) service providers. Extensive network of fiber-based video services from telecom operators and the strong presence of online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX), Hulu.com and YouTube etc. have become a threat to cable-TV operators. These online video streaming channels provide an extremely cheap source of TV. This business model is gaining momentum, even during economic uncertainties, and has proven to be a risk to the pay-TV industry.The industry has been losing customers to wireless telecom operators and online streaming service providers. Leading cable multi service operator (MSO) and media giant, Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) Cable business is suffering from subscriber loss despite the solid performance of the NBC Universal segment. The company added a net of 214,000 high-speed Internet customers and 51,000 security and automation customers, but lost 94,000 voice customers and 125,000 video customers in the reported quarter.Charter Communications Inc.’s (CHTR  -  Free Report) commercial segment also fared well, which is evident from the revenue and subscriber growth in the reported quarter. However, the company lost 104,000 video customers in the residential segment. It is the second-largest cable MSO after Comcast.The domestic multi-channel video market has also become extremely saturated and intensely competitive. Moreover, the U.S. pay-TV industry is affected by the ongoing massive consolidation between telecom and cable-TV operators.In order to cope up with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering Internet-TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates.Telecom and pay-TV behemoth, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), had 25.083 million video subscribers (down 0.8% year over year) as of Sep 30. Of the total, Satellite connections tallied 20.605 million, down 0.8%. U-verse connections were 3.691 million, down 18.3%. DIRECTV NOW connections were 0.787 million. In the reported quarter, AT&T lost 251,000 satellite-TV customers and 134,000 U-verse TV customers. However, it witnessed an addition of 296,000 DIRECTV NOW connections. DIRECTV NOW is the OTT online streaming service of AT&T.DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report), the second-largest satellite TV operator in the United States, gained a net of 16,000 pay-TV subscribers as against the loss of 116,000 in the year-ago quarter. Total pay-TV subscribers declined to 13.203 million compared with 13.643 million at the end of third-quarter 2016. In the reported quarter, the company also removed approximately 145,000 subscribers from the regions of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, due to the impact of Hurricane Maria. Further, the company activated approximately 638,000 gross new pay-TV subscribers, compared with around 736,000 subscribers in the prior-year quarter.DISH Network lost 50,000 broadband subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 20,000 in the year-ago quarter.The trajectory of subscriber losses in pay-TV signifies an unprecedented annual decline.All the above-mentioned companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Optimistic Pay-TV IndustryDespite the dismal picture, pay-TV operators currently enjoy certain positives. The cable MSOs in the United States have successfully maintained their lead over telecom operators in the high-speed broadband (Internet) market. Moreover, to stay ahead in the competition, cable companies are introducing latest technologies like DOCSIS 3.1 technology. DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections.Meanwhile, several research firms have estimated that major pay-TV operators offering traditionally managed TV services and next-generation online services will hold nearly 80% of the market share till 2022. In June 2017, research firm Strategy Analytics estimated that annual spending on subscription video and TV services in the country will reach $130.3 billion in 2019.Bottom LineThe presence of online video streaming providers is posing significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Video offering, which represents the core business function of cable-TV operators, is losing popularity. At this point, pay-TV operators are planning to revamp their business model to keep their market share intact.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1568,DISH,"Rapid technological advancement is gradually redefining the parameters of the telecommunications, cable TV and media industries. The market landscape is fast changing, as these industries are systematically converging. Will 2018 witness more mergers and acquisitions between telecom, cable TV and media companies?The legacy local and long-distance wireline phone services have largely been replaced by wireless services. This in turn has resulted in massive deployment of airwaves and optic fiber-based networks. Now, Internet TV and online TV streaming services are replacing legacy TV viewing. This has resulted in the merger of content creation and distribution. Emergence of digital media and robust growth of digital advertisement are major catalysts to the coming together of the three industries.Here we will briefly discuss a few factors leading to the convergence of the telecom, cable TV and media industries.Technological Advancement The major thrust to the broader telecom sector is coming from the industry as a result of continuous network and product upgrade, and inventions by industry players. Robust growth of smartphone and tablets along with continuous development of high-speed data-transfer technologies has acted as a key driver of the convergence.A growing economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data and video manifold. Given that cord-cutting is affecting the cable TV industry, it has now become more essential for media companies to join telecom giants.Industry Overlapping Wireless networks are key to the growth of the overall telecom industry. Wireless network standards are continuously evolving worldwide in order to provide faster speed. As wireless networks run on radio frequency, spectrums (airwaves) have become the most sought-after commodity in the industry.Powered with their strong WiFi network, cable TV operators are gradually entering the wireless field through MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreements with incumbent carriers. On the other hand, major telecom operators are entering the pay-TV industry, especially through Internet TV and online TV streaming services.At the same time, cable TV and telecom giants are foraying into the media industry with big ticket acquisitions. Comcast became a media mogul after acquiring NBC Universal in 2011. AT&T is currently awaiting the regulatory approval for its proposed $85.4 billion cash-and-stock deal to acquire media giant Time Warner Inc. Verizon may also follow suit. It has already acquired AOL and the core businesses of Yahoo.Mobile Video Business: Gains GroundInternet TV is gaining a strong foothold in the United States and has emerged as a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat. Presently, the web-based digital media market is growing by leaps and bounds. Digital media brands are becoming immensely popular with the younger generation. With demand for smartphones and tablets on the rise, target customers are increasingly watching videos online, and preferring them over costlier legacy pay- TV connections.Moreover, an increasing number of customers are using the Internet to watch videos and they want mobility of their content. This has given wireless operators an opportunity to differentiate their products by offering access to select content through their networks. By making deals directly with content developers, wireless carriers are trying to draw customers with – bundles – of content such as streaming entertainment or sporting events, possibly with no additional data charges.Online Digital Advertisement: Solid ProspectsAdvertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually shifting from simple selling of banner ads on the mobile web to automated or programmatic ad selling. Pay- TV operators are steadily adopting the data-driven advertising technique that has already become popular in the web-based advertisement arena. To derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform, these companies are aggressively penetrating the advertising technology market. Inclusions of dynamic ad-insertion, targeted audience advertising and data-driven TV advertisements are steps toward the same objective.Quad Play:  Future Growth Path Technologically, we are moving from triple-play (voice-video-data) bundled services offering to quad play (voice-video-data-mobile) bundled offering.  Video-on-demand is the new norm for telecom, cable TV and media industries. Technological changes have enabled distributors to come up with different ways of bundling and disseminating content, effective content creation methods and creating new business models. Companies are innovating newer options to push discovery of their content to consumers or help them discover it to get a competitive edge.It is to be noted that, exponential growth of mobile data usage supported by flourishing high-end smartphone and tablet devices has changed the entire dynamics of the traditional telecom and cable TV industry. Therefore, mergers between telecom or cable TV operators with media giants have become crucial as both the industries are aggressively delivering content on online digital platform.Repeal of Broadband Privacy RuleOn Apr 3, 2017, President Donald Trump signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules. This has given a major boost to the ISP (Internet Service Provider) industry. The broadband privacy rules proposed by former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler required ISPs to get consumers' explicit consent before selling or sharing web browsing data and other private information with advertisers and other companies. Since ISPs have direct access to user database, they used to sell the data to digital marketing firms for targeted advertising. This was a major source of revenues for the ISPs.The digital advertisement market is growing exponentially and ISPs have been increasingly investing resources to cash in on bountiful opportunities. However, the FCC’s previous directive stipulated that the ISP should notify customers before sharing any user data for advertising. This would have marred ISP prospects. Consequently, a new FCC body, headed by Ajit Pai, exercising lesser restrictions, certainly augurs well for the ISP industry.Stocks in FocusWe focus on four companies with strong long-term growth potential as these are poised to benefit the most from the shift in industry dynamics toward a converged telecom-cable TV-media space. Each of this stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Verizon Communications Inc.

Verizon has a long-term (three-five years) EPS (earnings per share) growth estimate of 2.82% and a dividend yield of 5.26%.AT&T Inc.

The wireless venture is also aimed at retaining customers in this competitive world.Moreover, the NBC Universal media division of the company is performing well. Comcast has a long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 9.39% and a dividend yield of 1.71%.DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report): The second largest satellite TV operator has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands which will be utilized to deploy 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U.S. markets.DISH Network’s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal-making to enter the wireless industry. At the same time, Ergen also stated that DISH Network has a clear plan of building a wireless network on its own. DISH Network has a long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 10.33%.Bottom LineBusiness models and the economics of the telecom, cable TV and industries are changing. Content creators and distributors are trying their best to judge the mood of the consumers to derive how to make content and advertisements more personalized. Advertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually shifting from simple selling of banner ads on the mobile web to automated or programmatic ad selling. All these forces are moving towards telecom-cable TV-media convergence.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1569,DISH,"After a six-week trial, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. This will give the pay-TV provider an ownership of cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros. AT&T vowed to close the deal by Jun 20.  This long-awaited decision will change the landscape of the media industry by setting the stage for mergers of media companies and telecom providers. Cable operator, Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has also been eyeing  the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA for as much as $60 billion, should regulators approve AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner.The expected move would create a bidding war for The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets of Fox for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. The acquisition of Fox assets will enhance the streaming and television content of both Comcast and Disney and pose a significant threat to growing digital rivals like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). In fact, Comcast would become the biggest player in Hollywood by acquiring Fox (read: Comcast Might Thwart Disney-Fox Deal: Media ETFs in Focus).Fox’s film production business includes Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight and Fox 2000, and the highest grossing Marvel movies - X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool. Fox TV film studio includes This Is Us, Modern Family, and The Simpsons, regional sports networks and entertainment cable channels like National Geographic, FX Networks, Fox Sports Regional Networks, as well as international networks like Star India, a controlling stake in Hulu, and a 39% stake of European satellite provider, Sky.The ruling has also opened doors for AT&T’s biggest rival Verizon Communication (VZ  -  Free Report) to bid for a media company. The potential target of Verizon is the combined CBS Corp (CBS  -  Free Report) and Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report).

1570,DISH,"DISH Network (DISH  -  Free Report) is expanding integration with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) voice assistant Alexa. The company recently added new Alexa voice control capabilities to its set-top boxes — Hopper, Hopper Duo, Joey and Wally.The latest integration will now allow DISH users to not only play or pause but also to navigate, fast-forward, rewind and search content based on channel, title, actor or genre. Moreover, Alexa can be used to set recordings and launch apps like Game Finder, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Pandora and YouTube.The latest integration bodes well for both Amazon and DISH. While it helps Amazon to sell more Echo devices and Fire TV Cubes (set-top boxes need to be paired with these devices to avail Alexa), the expanded control features are likely to help DISH maintain its subscribers base.DISH TV Losing SubscribersDISH has been losing subscribers in its TV business, primarily due to matured video market in the United States, stiff competition and cord cutting. Growing adoption of streaming services like Netflix has been a major concern.Notably, in the last reported quarter, net Pay-TV subscribers declined approximately 94K compared with a decline of roughly 143K in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, Pay-TV average revenue per user (ARPU) declined from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $86.55 to $84.50. DISH Network Corporation Price and Consensus DISH Network Corporation Price and Consensus | DISH Network Corporation QuoteDISH believes that the additional control features of Alexa will help in improving users’ TV-watching experience and convenience. This will also boost engagement, thereby limiting the increase in churn rate. DISH TV's average monthly subscriber churn rate was 1.47% against the year-ago quarter’s 1.92%.Moreover, we believe that DISH’s focus on acquiring and retaining subscribers that are profitable over the long term is paying off. The company’s excellent customer service has helped it win two J.D. Power awards. Improving retention bodes well for DISH’s top-line growth.Sling TV Holds Promise for DISHDISH’s Internet TV service — Sling TV — allows subscribers to stream on up to three different devices. This, coupled with solid programming content, is helping the company expand its subscriber base, which jumped 36% year over year in the last-reported quarter.Moreover, ad sales almost tripled during March Madness, reflecting the targeted nature of the Sling TV service, which drives advertisers return on investment (ROI).Further, Sling’s focus on attracting and retaining long-term, profitable and economically rational subscribers will continue to drive top-line growth in the long haul.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, DISH has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Cable One (CABO  -  Free Report) is a stock worth considering in the same industry as it carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Long-term earnings growth rate for Cable One is currently pegged at 3%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1571,DISH,"CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Nov 8, after market close.The leading regional wireline service provider has a negative earnings surprise history. The company lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.44%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCenturyLink remains focused on establishing itself as a global leader in cloud infrastructure and hosted-IT solutions arena for enterprise customers. The company is opting for managed Wi-Fi services to cater to the demands of small and mid-sized business (SMBs) and to lure customers from cable-TV operators and Competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC). CenturyLink has also unveiled Dedicated Cloud Compute (DCC) Foundation, which is an updated version of private cloud service. CenturyLink is investing in fiber-to-the-tower (FTTT) expansion and has expanded its fiber-based backhaul services. The company is focused on bringing improved operating efficiencies through a number of methods including network simplification and rationalization.Further, the growing momentum of CenturyLink’s Prism IPTV service has prompted it to unveil a beta version of over the top (OTT) TV services in June 2017. By foraying into the OTT space, the company has joined the likes of DISH Network Corp.’s (DISH  -  Free Report) Sling TV and AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) DirecTV Now. CenturyLink’s efforts to fortify itself in the enterprise-wide business segment and boost its fiber and cloud suite, by inking different deals also look impressive.We also appreciate CenturyLink’s quarterly dividend payout of 54 cents a share on Sep 15, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Sep 5, 2017.However, the company continues to face persistent losses in access lines and legacy voice services, on an organic basis. Further, decline in subsidy payments by the Federal Universal Service Fund, tough competition, federal regulations, labour union issues andIn the past three months, shares of CenturyLink have lost 26.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.0%.  Expected Subscriber Statistics and Segmental RevenuesIn third-quarter 2017, total access lines were 1.567 million compared with 10.7333 million in the last reported quarter.  High-speed broadband customer count is expected around 5.832 million in the to-be reported quarter, down from 5.868 million in the prior-year quarter. Business segment revenues are pegged at $2,199 million in third-quarter 2017 compared with $2,215 million in the year-ago period. Consumer segment revenues are expected at $1,391 million compared with $1,402 million in the previous quarter.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show a beat for CenturyLink this quarter.

1572,DISH,"DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Nov 9, before the opening bell.The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters and missed the same in the remaining two quarters, with an average beat of 0.76%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why Do We Expect a Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that DISH Networkis likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key elements.Zacks ESP: DISH Networkhas an Earnings ESP of +1.68%.

Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of the company’s favorableZacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.DISH Network Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  DISH Network Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | DISH Network Corporation QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?DISH Network has created an extensive portfolio of wireless spectrum worth $50 billion. We are impressed with the company’s efforts to diversify its business model from a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet-TV operator. This should aid the company to counter competitive threats from low-cost video streaming operators. The launch of Air TV Player bodes well for DISH Network’s prospects.Moreover, DISH Network has been trying to lure customers for its Internet-TV service, Sling TV, by offering services at a reasonable rate along with the addition of other premium networks such as Showtime. Despite such efforts, the company has failed to gain subscribers in the broadband and pay-TV segment.In second-quarter 2017, DISH Network lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers compared with a loss of 281,000 in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the company lost 46,000 broadband subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 15,000 in the prior-year quarter. This trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to signify an unprecedented annual decline. DISH Network continues to struggle with the persistent loss of subscribers due to cord cutting. Notably, online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., have become a severe threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming.DISH Network witnesses intense competition in the pay-tv market from players like AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report). The company received a penalty of $280 million in a telemarketing lawsuit, which is a woe. Also, escalating programming and content expenses and retransmission fees may impede the company’s margins. In second-quarter 2017, DISH Network’s performance in certain metrics was disappointing. We hope that the company will recover from the downturns in the to-be-reported quarter.Due to such headwinds, the company’s shares have lost 20.0% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.7%.A Closer View of Subscriber StatisticsIn third-quarter 2017, DISH Network expects to lose 127,000 pay-TV subscribers compared with a loss of 196,000 subscribers reported in the year-ago period. As of Sep 30, 2017, DISH Network’s pay-TV subscriber base totaled 13.209 million, down from 13.332 million in the previous quarter.Moreover, DISH Network anticipates a loss of 38,950 broadband subscribers in the to-be-reported quarter compared with a loss of 46,000 broadband subscribers in the previous quarter. As of Sep 30, the company’s broadband subscriber base is projected at 470,000, down from 509,000 broadband subscribers in second-quarter 2017.

Cable ONE serves more than 800,000 residential and commercial customers in 21 states with high-speed Internet, cable television and telephone service. As of Dec 31, 2016, it served 513,908 data customers, 320,246 video customers and 115,811 voice customers. The company provides consumers with a wide range of products and services, including wireless internet service, high-definition programming and phone service with free, unlimited long-distance calling.Cable ONE made major changes in its channels and their availability to customers. New line-ups were implemented to make news, sports and other channels easily accessible to viewers. We are also impressed with the company’s effort to reward shareholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $1.75 per share, marking an increase of $0.25 in the company’s quarterly cash dividend. The dividend will be paid on Sep 1 to stockholders of record at the closure of business as of Aug 15. The acquisition of cable operator — NewWave Communications — will enable the company to create a leading high-speed data and cable company. Through this buyout, Cable ONE will be able to serve more than 1.2 million primary service units in 21 states. The deal will aid Cable ONE to expand footprint intol non-metropolitan markets and non-urban areas like Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. The company has optimized its strategy and operations for these regions.We are concerned about the company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Moreover, cable companies continue to face stiff competition from online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. Further, gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages.Cable ONE faces immense competition from leading cable multi-service-operators (MSO) like Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report).

1574,DISH,"TEGNA Inc. (TGNA  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the opening bell.The company displays a positive earnings surprise history. TEGNA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with average positive surprise of 7.90%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayTEGNA offers a dynamic portfolio of media and digital businesses in the United States. Currently, the company’s media division owns 46 television stations and is the largest independent television station group of major network affiliates in the top 25 markets. Being more focused on content creation rather than TV broadcasting, the media division shields the company from the prevailing cord-cutting threats in the pay-TV industry.TEGNA has been riding high, following the completion of two strategic business moves. The company plans to utilize gross proceeds of $250 million from the sale of its web portal CareerBuilder, to clear off existing debt. The spin-off of its auto-sales website, Cars.com into two publicly traded companies — TEGNA and Cars.com — is anticipated to increase the company’s prospects and appropriate market valuations. Moreover, TEGNA’s media business is faring well, evident from its revenue growth.We are impressed with TEGNA’s board of directors’ decision to reward stockholders with a dividend of 7 cents per share, payable on Jan 2, 2018 to stockholders of record at the closure of business as of Dec 8, 2017.In the past three months, the stock has lost 6.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 12.4%.  However, TEGNA’s operation in a competitive broadcast-TV industry remains a concern. The U.S. broadcast TV industry has long been grappling with declining advertising revenues and global economic volatility. TEGNA’s major competitors are CBS Corp. (CBS  -  Free Report), Gray Television Inc. and Entercom Communications Corp. (ETM  -  Free Report) to name a few.Soft advertising market is also a near-term headwind for the company. Meanwhile, the media and entertainment industry is one of the rapidly-changing industries in terms of technical improvements in content creation, aggregation and distribution platforms. Such upgrades add to the company’s programming costs and expenses, which are likely to affect the bottom line.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that TEGNA is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for DISH Network shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, DISH Network is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Cable Television industry that ranks in the Bottom 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for DISH in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 61 cents per share for DISH, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for DISH, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.67% heading into earnings season.DISH Network Corporation Price and EPS Surprise DISH Network Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | DISH Network Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

1584,DISH,"The Q3 earnings season is gradually nearing its end with more than 80% of the S&P 500 companies already having announced their results. Per our Earnings Outlook report as of Nov 3, out of the 406 S&P 500 companies that have come up with their quarterly numbers, approximately 73.9% posted positive earnings surprises, while 66.7% beat top-line expectations.According to the report, earnings for the 406 S&P 500 companies that have reported are up 7.5% from the same period last year, while revenues have increased 6.3%. Further, the report projects that earnings for the total S&P 500 companies will improve 6.5% from the year-ago period with total revenues rising 5.6%.Let’s Take a Glance at Consumer Discretionary SectorHowever, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to witness mixed results. Total earnings of the sector are likely to decline 1.2%, while revenues are estimated to increase 2.8% year over year. Media stocks form part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.Turning our focus to the Media industry, we note that few players have reported their results so far. Among media stocks which have reported their quarterly numbers, CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) and AMC Networks Inc. (AMCX  -  Free Report) posted mixed results, wherein earnings of both the companies surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. Meanwhile, Time Warner Inc.  has surpassed both the top and bottom line in the third-quarter 2017.  Among media stocks lined up to report on Nov 9, let’s take a sneak peek at three companies.News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report), the diversified media conglomerate, is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell. The stock has a favorable combination of Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +3.70%. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.News Corporation is in a transitionary phase looking to diversify revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement. The company is expanding its digital offerings, along with greater emphasis on real estate businesses and augmenting digital subscriber base. Further, it has been concentrating on cost cutting.However advertising, which forms a major part of total revenues, remains highly vulnerable to the economic conditions. Advertising revenue at the News and Information Services segment tumbled 12% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to sluggishness in the print advertising market, reduced in-store product revenue at News America Marketing and adverse foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, revenue from the News and Information Services segment declined 10% year over year.Analysts surveyed by Zacks now anticipate revenue from News and Information Services division to decline 1.6% during the first quarter but envisions growth of 7.8% and 9.7% across Cable Network Programming and Digital Real Estate Services segments, respectively. Book Publishing division is expected to witness revenue growth of 1%.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has increased by a penny in the last 30 days and is currently pegged at 2 cents. This reflects an improvement over a loss of one cent reported in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $1,978 million compared with $1,965 million reported in the prior-year period.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We are impressed with the company’s efforts to diversify business model from a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet-TV operator. This should aid the company to counter competitive threats from low-cost video streaming operators. The launch of Air TV Player bodes well for DISH Network’s prospects.Moreover, DISH Network has been trying to lure customers for its Internet-TV service, Sling TV, by offering services at a reasonable rate along with the addition of other premium networks such as Showtime. Despite such efforts, the company has failed to gain subscribers in the broadband and pay-TV segment.In second-quarter 2017, DISH Network lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers compared with a loss of 281,000 in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the company lost 46,000 broadband subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 15,000 in the prior-year quarter. This trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to signify an unprecedented annual decline. DISH Network continues to struggle with the persistent loss of subscribers due to cord cutting. Per the analyst surveyed by Zacks, DISH Network likely to lose 127,000 pay-TV subscribers in third-quarter 2017, compared with a loss of 196,000 subscribers in the preceding quarter.

In the previous quarter, the company had registered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%. Moreover, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average earnings beat of 1.8%. Let’s analyze some of the metrics impacting the company’s performance.Media Networks Likely to GainAfter witnessing a decline of 1% in the preceding quarter, the segment is likely to register a year-over-year increase of 0.8% owing to gain in revenues at Cable Networks. The analyst surveyed by Zacks expects revenues of $5,706 million, up from the prior-year figure of $5,658 million. Meanwhile, Cable Networks and Broadcasting are anticipated to report revenues of $4,009 million and $1,704 million up 1.3% and 0.1%, respectively. However, operating income from the segment is anticipated to decline 4.5% year over year to $1,597 million due to higher programming costs.Falling subscriber base and higher programming costs at ESPN remain major concerns. Fresh NBA agreement and increase in contractual rate for NFL programming has been driving the overall programming cost higher for ESPN. Disney is striving to bring back ESPN’s golden days. In an effort to attract online viewers, the company has inked a deal with video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech. Disney which had earlier acquired 33% stake in BAMTech announced its intention to acquire another 42% stake in the firm.Parks & Resorts Attracting VisitorsDisney’s Parks & Resorts division are also doing well. Disney is focused on deploying its capital toward expansion of the Parks and Resorts business. Consequently, increasing market share and creating long-term growth opportunities. Disney’s Parks and Resorts segment is once again anticipated to deliver growth in final quarter of fiscal 2017. The consensus mark for revenues from the segment is pegged at $4,559 million, up 3.9% year over year. Further, operating income is also anticipated to increase by 4.4% to $730 million.Another Tough Quarter for Studios SegmentThe segment, which impressed investors with blockbuster hits in 2016 has somewhat disappointed in 2017 as the year has been a weaker one for movie industry. The segment revenues declined 16% in the third quarter as the movies released failed to match the prior-year hits of Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book, and Finding Dory. The trendy is likely to continue in the fourth as the analyst polled by Zacks expects revenues of $1,637 million, down 9.6% year over year. However, operating income is projected to register a gain of nearly 5% year over year to $400 million.

1585,DISH,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 8. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 5.9%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Twenty-First Century Fox will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is currently pegged at 49 cents, which reflects a year-over-year decline of nearly 4%. We note that the rate of decline is likely to decelerate from 20% witnessed in the preceding quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $6,868 million compared with $6,506 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterThe performance of Cable Network Programming, which has been magnificent in fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 owing to rising affiliate fees is likely to impress investors in fiscal 2018 too. Management expects domestic affiliate fee to increase at least in high single-digit in all the quarters of fiscal 2018. Affiliate fees are a dominant source of revenues for the Cable Network segment and major contributor to total revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from affiliate fees is currently pegged at $3,140, up 7.4% year over year. Moreover, advertising revenues is also likely to increase 1.5% to $1,615 from the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, analyst surveyed by Zacks expects revenue from both Cable Network Programming and Filmed Entertainment segments to increase 8.5% and 52.7% to $4,133 million and $1,896 million, respectively. However, growth in both Cable Network Programming and Filmed Entertainment is likely to be partially offset by weakness in Television segment, which is expected to report revenues of $1,056 million compared with the prior-year quarter revenues of $1,907 million.However, increase in cost at Cable Network Programming has been worrying investors. In fiscal 2017, Cable Network Programming costs increased 7% to $16,130 million. In fiscal 2018, the company anticipates cable network expenses to rise by approximately mid-single digit. The rise in expenses was mostly due to elevated sports programming costs. We believe that an increase in expenses due to higher sports programming costs may hurt the company’s margins and affect the bottom line.Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

1586,DISH,"Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on Nov 8.In the last reported quarter, the company posted on in-line earnings. The company surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, generating an average beat of 3.6%.We believe that Broadridge’s strategic acquisitions, product launches, share repurchase program and dividend paying initiatives, will continue to boost the company’s top-line. We also believe that its close association with Accenture (ACN) will act as a tailwind.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 41 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 13.9%.  Further, the earnings estimate has trended upward in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $928 million, up roughly 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Aspects to Influence Q1 ResultsQ4 Earnings HighlightBroadridge reported modest fourth-quarter results. Year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were favorable driven by higher recurring revenues, internal growth, contribution from Net New Business, higher distribution revenues and acquisition-related synergies.The company provided 2018 outlook. The company projects revenue growth in the range of 2-3%, while recurring revenue growth is expected in the range of 4-6%. The company anticipates recurring revenues from closed sales to be a key catalyst and range within $170-$210 million.Notably, its shares have surged 30.9% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry’s meager gain of 3.9%.Acquisitions: Key CatalystsThe company has supplemented internal growth with strategic acquisitions. Broadridge acquired many companies like Message Automation Limited, DST Systems Inc.’s  North American Customer Communications (NACC) business. The transaction expands digital communications offerings as well as print communications business. In our opinion, these buyouts have helped Broadridge to evolve as one of the leading financial and outsourcing services providers. We also remain encouraged by its acquisition spree, with the help of which the company is expanding its product portfolio and customer reach. These factors are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter.Strong Business Model & Share Repurchase: Other Positive FactorsThe company generates recurring revenues and a good percentage of its business comes from recurring fee revenues, which include contributions from Net New Business and acquisitions related synergies. Revenue growth is an important metric for any company as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision-making. Further, revenue growth is essential for justifying the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Broadridge’s diversified products and services coupled with strategic acquisitions have provided a boost to top-line growth.In the last reported quarter, recurring fee revenues increased 24% during the quarter that included contribution from Net New Business, internal growth and acquisitions related synergies. Moreover, revenues from the Investor Communication Solutions segment (86% of total revenues) increased 45% from the year-ago quarter to $1.162 billion in the last reported quarter. The improvement was attributable to higher recurring revenues from net new business, internal growth and NACC acquisitions.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for Investor Communication Solutions is pegged at $735 million, up 1.7% year over year.Furthermore, Broadridge has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. In fiscal 2017, repurchased $342.8 million worth of its treasury stock and paid dividend of $152.2 million. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Broadridge is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two important ingredients.Zacks ESP: Broadridge’s Earnings ESPis +4.03%. This is because the company’s Most Accurate estimate is 43 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 41 cents. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Broadridge currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Broadridge’s Zacks Rank #2 and +4.03% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.Other Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #1.

(LGF.A  -  Free Report), producer and distributor of motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video release, is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 9, after the closing bell. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 39.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 13 cents, which has improved by a penny in the last seven days. It also fared far better than the loss of 50 cents reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks, expect revenues of roughly $947.4 million, up 48% from the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing the QuarterFrom abovementioned figures it is quite evident that Lions Gate is likely to report sharp improvement in both the top and bottom lines on a year-over-year basis. The company’s strategic acquisitions and alliances to enhance competitive position and maximize returns, along with building a diversified portfolio bode well for the stock.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, Media Networks’ segment formed after the acquisition of Starz reported revenues growth of 9.2% year over year on account of Starz new series American Gods and The White Princess. Earlier, Lions Gate acquired Summit Entertainment which further expanded its filmed entertainment library, while boosting feature film and home entertainment offerings.  Notably, the addition of Starz is aiding Lions Gate to emerge as a major player in the TV space and helping it regain lost ground in streaming network. Moreover, the company has invested in The Immortals to capitalize on the increasing popularity of eSports. It expects eSports market to grow over $1 billion by the next year.However, fewer movie releases in fiscal 2018 compared with the previous year may hurt Motion Pictures revenue performance. Dismal television production performance in the past few quarters has been also a concern for investors. In first-quarter fiscal 2018 Television Production revenues tumbled 18.6% following a decline of 3.5% in the preceding quarter. Further, the escalating cost of motion picture production and marketing in recent years may jeopardize Lions Gate’s margins.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lions Gate is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1593,DISH,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for DISH Network Corporation (DISH  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 9.5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is DISH due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.DISH Network Q4 Earnings Top, Revenues Miss EstimatesDISH Network reported mixed financial results in the fourth quarter of 2017. While the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line lagged the same.Quarterly net income came in at $1,385.5 million or $2.64 per share compared with $355.5 million or 73 cents in the year-ago quarter.

1594,DISH,"The U.S. telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition, as success to a great extent depends on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability.  Additionally, the U.S. wireless industry is likely to become even more competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi-service operators) in this space.Entry of New Players in the Wireless SpaceComcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has already forayed into this field with its Xfinity Mobile offering. Presently, the company is utilizing its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon to use the latter’s wireless network along with its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Importantly, the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year. Much like Comcast, the company too has an MVNO agreement with Verizon as well as its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. The company has also launched experimental field trials of the 5G wireless network. These trials come on the back of spectrum test licenses granted to it by the FCC. The company is actively testing licensed small-cell technologies and has petitioned the FCC to release 3.5 GHz spectrum, popularly known as the CBRS band, for both licensed and unlicensed use.DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands which will be utilized to deploy 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U.S. markets. DISH Network’s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal-making to enter the wireless industry. At the same time, Ergen also stated that the company has a clear plan of building a wireless network on its own.Additionally, Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) has entered into a new multi-year strategic agreement with Altice USA Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report). Per the terms of the agreement, Altice USA will utilize Sprint’s network to provide mobile voice and data services to customers throughout the country, and Sprint will leverage the Altice USA broadband platform to accelerate the densification of its network.Comcast, Charter Communications and Sprint currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The objective is to offer better service and customer convenience. However, President Trump has already threatened to terminate the previous Obama administration's efforts to normalize US-Cuba relations. All four leading U.S, wireless operators -- AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile US -- have established business links with Cuba's Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba SA (ETECSA). Moreover, Trump may deal a major blow to Mexico as he believes that Mexico is to blame for the lack of jobs for Americans. At present, NAFTA is at turmoil. AT&T has strong business interest in Mexico.WeaknessesIn general, the beleaguered telecommunications companies have high debt levels and large financial leverage ratios. Moreover, they are often unable to cope with recent market trends. Other risks that pose threats are as follows:    •    Potential Business Slowdown: Sales fluctuations of carriers are expected to continue weighing on capital-spending decisions -- a major problem faced by equipment vendors. The companies are expected to retain focus on improving balance sheets, financial discipline and free cash-flow generation.      •    Product Overlapping: We may see more product-sharing deals between telecom, cable TV and satellite TV operators, as each of these players are vying to grab a sizeable share in each other’s territory. Even pay-TV services, offerings to business enterprises, mobile backhaul and metro-Ethernet segments may observe more convergence. Mobile phone makers are now progressively offering tablets and chipset manufacturers are providing chips for personal computers as well as mobile devices, thus frequently interchanging their areas of operations.    •    Intensified Competition: Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition. Product life-cycle and upgrade-cycle have been reduced drastically as several firms are coming up with new products and services within a short span of time. Increasing competition is compelling players to offer heterogeneous and bundled services to retain position in the space. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1595,DISH,"Five9, Inc. (FIVN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 8. Last quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 100%. Five9 beat earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with a negative positive surprise of 100%.Expect What?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 1 cent compared with in-line earnings in the year-ago period. The earnings estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $48 million, up roughly 17.1% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing Q3 Results The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, wherein both the top and bottom line fared better than Zacks Consensus Estimate. Buoyed by stellar results of the quarter, the company also upped fiscal 2017 guidance.Revenues for fiscal 2017 are now expected to be in the range of $193.5-$195.5 million, up from the earlier guidance range of $190.6-$193.6 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are now anticipated in the range of break-even to 3 cents, better than the earlier guided range of a loss of 5 cents per share to earnings of a penny.Five9 offers a virtual contact center cloud platform that acts as a hub for interaction between clients and customers. The company has strong partnerships with industry leaders such as Salesforce, Oracle, Zendesk, and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Dynamics 365.  The partnerships will enable Five9 to offer customers greater flexibility, enhanced experience and cloud-based solution. This is likely to generate incremental revenues through higher customer reach.The cloud-based contact center solution industry has been witnessing growth over the past several quarters as organizations are looking for ways to minimize costs and improve customer support. We believe that Five9’s cloud contact center software along with ongoing execution puts Five9 in a great position to capitalize on this opportunity. Consequently, this should reflect in its to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company’s consistent focus on expanding its product portfolio will aid the top-line performance.Five9, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Five9, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Five9, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Zacks ESP: Five9 currently has an Earnings ESP of +200%.

It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Five9’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1596,DISH,"Leading global car rental company, Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Nov 6.Last quarter, the company witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 84.31%. Avis Budget missed earnings estimates thrice by a wide margin in the last four quarters, with a negative earnings surprise of 24.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model conclusively shows that Avis Budget is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.55%, with the former pegged at $3.02 and latter at $2.95. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Avis Budget Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Avis Budget Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Avis Budget Group, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Avis Budget has a Zacks Rank #2. This combined with a positive ESP make us reasonably confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsDuring the quarter, Avis Budget forayed into the Latin American market by launching Zipcar services in Costa Rica. The strategic move is part of the international expansion plans of the company, whereby it aims to extend its presence in all the premier locations of the world. Zipcar, the leading car-sharing network and subsidiary of Avis Budget, already has significant presence in over 500 cities and towns across Europe, Asia and North America. By expanding footprint in the Latin American countries, it has widened its global network and coverage to almost all the major regions of the world.Avis Budget also entered into the Nordic countries by launching its services in Reykjavik, Iceland. Reykjavik has a high level of car ownership in the world with a car for every 1.5 inhabitant of the city, per the World Health Organization’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015. In order to reduce pollution from such a huge number of cars, the government has set the target of becoming the world’s first carbon-neutral city by 2040 by encouraging people to use more of public transport facilities, cycling or even walking. This gives Avis Budget an ideal platform to capitalize on the huge revenue generating potential of this region.Furthermore, Avis Budget intends to aggressively increase the number of company-operated locations in fast-growing markets. The company is particularly focused on expanding its Budget brand, taking its multi-brand strategy to the next level. We think that its fundamental drivers, such as sustained productivity growth, implementation of pricing initiatives and potential revenue-generating synergies from its various acquisitions bode well for the future.However, Avis Budget continues to face hurdles like high fleet costs and unfavorable currency headwinds. Evidently, the company’s earnings for the earlier quarters were hurt by high fleet costs in both its segments and adverse currency movements in the International segment. The company is progressing well with its disciplined pricing initiatives and expects these to offset the rising fleet costs.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.40% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1599,DISH,"Leading U.S cable TV operator, Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), primarily offers three services – video, high-speed data and voice over its broadband cable systems to both residential and business customers.We are concerned about Charter Communications’ operations in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Like other cable operators, the company continues to lose subscribers to online video streaming service providers because of their cheap source of TV programming. Notably, in the third quarter of 2017, the company lost 1, 04,000 video customers in the residential segment.On the other hand, the twin buyouts of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks have strengthened the company’s foothold in hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and fiber networks. The company is also adopting various initiatives to improve its Spectrum products and cloud-based user interfaces. Also, accelerated residential and commercial customer growth, investments in business services division and rollout of several initiatives should aid the upcoming results.Charter Communications currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1600,DISH,"Internet TV streaming service is gradually gaining market traction worldwide. According to a latest report by consultancy Juniper, the market size of digital TV and video services will reach $119.2 billion in 2022 from $64 billion in 2017. The Americas will take 33.5% of revenues, with Europe taking 31.7%. Advertising spend against online video is set to grow 130% to $37 billion in 2022, increasing from $16 billion in 2017.Notably, exponential growth of mobile data usage supported by flourishing high-end smartphone and tablet devices, has changed the entire dynamics of the traditional pay-TV industry. Presently, the web-based digital media market is growing by leaps and bounds. Digital media brands are becoming immensely popular with the younger generation. With the growing demand for smartphones and tablets, target customers are increasingly watching videos online, and preferring them over costlier legacy pay-TV connections.Competition Intensifies in the OTT TV MarketNetflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) are the two leading Internet TV streaming service providers. Statistics reveal that Netflix has more than 100 million subscribers and Amazon has an estimated 60 million Prime TV customers.Major pay-TV operators, such as AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) and Sony Corp. (SNE  -  Free Report) have already launched their Internet TV streaming services. AT&T’s DirecTV Now includes channels such as E!, FX, TBS and TNT. DISH Network’s Sling TV offers channels like ESPN, AMC, Cartoon Network, HBO and Univision. Sony’s PlayStation Vue provides a portfolio of channels like Bravo, Fox News, Nickelodeon and USA.Apart from these three companies, YouTube TV of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Hulu Live TV also offer Internet TV streaming facilities.  In August 2017, The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report) announced its plans of launching ESPN streaming service in 2018 and a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019. Telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has deferred the launch of its TV streaming service, which is likely to be unveiled next spring.In September 2017, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) launched its TV streaming service, Xfinity Instant TV, only to its high-speed Internet subscribers. The latest entrant into this league is T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report), the third largest wireless carrier. The company is set to unveil its online TV steaming service in 2018 after its acquisition of Denver–based video technology innovator Layer3 TV Inc.Digital Advertising: The Next BattlefieldIn order to derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform, ISPs (Internet Service Provider) are aggressively penetrating the advertising technology market. Inclusion of dynamic ad-insertion, targeted audience advertising and data-driven TV advertisements is a step toward the same objective. The advertising platform is designed to monetize applications for publishers and developers through the use of data-driven ad targeting.Two Favorable Regulatory Verdicts in 2017President Donald Trump stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during his term as the President. A new Federal Communications Commission (FCC), headed by Ajit Pai, exercising lesser restrictions, certainly augurs well for the ISP industry.On Apr 3, Trump signed a repeal of the Obama-era broadband privacy rules. This has given a major boost to the ISPs. The digital advertisement market is growing exponentially and ISPs have been increasingly investing resources to cash in on bountiful opportunities. However, the FCC’s (Federal Communications Commission) previous directive stipulated that the ISP should notify customers before sharing any user data for advertising. This would have marred ISP prospects.More importantly, on Dec 14, FCC repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime. On Feb 26, 2015, the FCC under the chairmanship of Tom Wheeler adopted Net Neutrality implying an open-Internet atmosphere, which would prohibit ISPs from discriminating against applications.So far, these companies were allowed to restrict any device, application, service, or content from running on their respective networks.

1602,DISH,"U.S. wireless tower operators had a dream run in 2017. American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) was certainly one of the major beneficiaries. We believe there are a number of reasons for this stellar show to continue in 2018. We will discuss the reasons in short.Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In September 2017, Moody's Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for U.S. wireless carriers. In this context, Internet-of-Things (IoT) holds the potential of becoming the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.Strong Business ModelWireless services are advancing fast in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Tower operators effectively address this opportunity as more than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless carriers. Tower operators generally have long-term (typically 5 -10 years) tower lease agreements with the U.S. national carriers.Moreover, wireless consumer demand is expected to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, social networking and streaming of video.Importantly, American Tower has a highly diversified business model. Apart from its leadership position in the United States, the company has a strong foothold in Asia (especially in India), Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. In 2016, American Tower generated 41% of its total revenues from outside homeland. Management expects international revenues to top U.S. sales in next three to seven years.American Tower is highly enthusiastic about its India operation where the company already controls over 58,000 towers. In November, 2017, American Tower entered into an agreement to buy about 20,000 towers from Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian business and Idea Cellular Ltd., for approximately $1.2 billion. The tenancy ratio is expected to rise to 2.9 times by March 2020, from about the 1.95 times average for India in 2015.Massive Spectrum Deployment by U.S. CarriersWireless networks will be integral to the future growth of the overall telecom industry. T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low-band airwaves. This year, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low-band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project.Moreover, AT&T will also install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August 2017, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network.Additionally, major U.S. telecom operators are exploring ways to commercialize usage of 3.5 GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum. Notably, the 3.5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard, thus increasing its chances of providing spectrum globally.Entry of New Players in the U.S. Wireless SpaceThe U.S. wireless industry is likely to get competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators) in this space. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has already entered this field with its Xfinity Mobile offering. At present the company is using its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon to use the latter’s wireless network coupled with its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Importantly, the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year. Similar to Comcast, the company also has an MVNO agreement with Verizon as well as its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. It has also launched experimental field trials of the 5G wireless network.DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands, which will be utilized in deploying 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U.S. markets. DISH Network’s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal-making to enter the wireless industry. At the same time, Ergen also stated that DISH Network has plans of building a wireless network on its own.Strong FundamentalsAmerican Tower has strong fundamentals.
