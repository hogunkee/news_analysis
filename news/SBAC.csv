5,SBAC,"AT&T (T) has 48 states in the bag for its FirstNet wireless public safety network, with California and Florida yet to make a decision.Thursday is the final day for states and most U.S. territories to announce whether they're taking part in the project.X California and Florida have not formally opted-in for FirstNet, the federal government's nationwide wireless network for emergency responders.New Hampshire, which had stated it would opt out, on Thursday reversed course and said it would join FirstNet. Mississippi and New York joined the FirstNet project earlier Thursday.AT&T has been awarded a swath of 20 MHz of radio spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the life of the 25-year contract. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, AT&T also will be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services.There could be revenue upside for cell tower operators such as American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) from the FirstNet build-out, analysts say.If states choose not to take part in FirstNet, they need to fund their own network that connects to AT&T's public safety system. No states have announced plans to go with an alternative public safety network planned by Verizon Communications (VZ).  New Hampshire has been studying a network proposal from Rivada Networks. States that don't announce decisions will be included in the FirstNet project.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.AT&T is building a nationwide ground network, with backup generators and a dedicated security operations center.

6,SBAC,"Merger talks that seem to have failed between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) rattled the telecom industry on Monday as investors sent up shares of Charter Communications (CHTR) and Dish Network (DISH) as possible partners for Sprint and T-Mobile — and boosted the fortunes of cellphone tower companies as well — while other telecom firms fell.XCharter gained 3.9% to 348.40 on speculation that Softbank could renew takeover talks with the No. 2 cable TV firm behind Comcast (CMCSA).  Cable industry pioneer John Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBDRA) is the biggest shareholder in Charter. Over the summer, Charter signaled that it's not interested in being acquired by Softbank.Meanwhile, Dish Network, another potential Sprint partner, climbed 5.7% to 50.82 on speculation it could eventually end up as a T-Mobile partner.The on-again, off-again talks between Sprint parent Softbank and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom collapsed over the weekend with both sides saying the deal is finally off. Sprint plunged 11.5% to close at 5.90 on the stock market today. T-Mobile lost 5.7% to finish at 55.54.AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) slipped as investors fretted that wireless competition will re-intensify after a brief lull. A merger combining Sprint and T-Mobile would have reduced the number of national wireless firms to three from four.""With T-Mobile and Sprint officially ending negotiations, we think we are likely back to a more challenging situation than we witnessed pre-election, with four players battling it out for market share,"" UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a note to clients. ""We believe competition will heat up after the recent abnormal lull as the holiday selling season begins, the Apple iPhone X becomes available and cable enters the mix.""IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile had been on the rise until early May, when it slipped into a flat base, where it's remained ever since. It was the top-ranked company in IBD's Telecom Services-Wireless Group but has since slipped to fourth place, behind Shenandoah Telecom, Mitel Networks and Boingo Wireless.

7,SBAC,"Cell-tower operator Crown Castle International (CCI) has bid for broadband-service provider Lightower Fiber Networks in a $7 billion deal that would help Crown Castle provide 5G wireless infrastructure to customers such as Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T), reports said Monday.XPrivately held Lightower's fiber-optic network would mesh with Crown Castle's plans to build out ""small-cell"" radio antennas for 5G services in urban areas. The small-cell antennas — hung on utility poles or building rooftops — will require fiber-optic connections to local hubs, which in turn link to cloud-computing infrastructure as well as long-distance networks.Some analysts, though, view the $7 billion price tag, which includes debt, as pricey.""Crown Castle has not been shy about its desire to acquire more of the right type of fiber assets to bolster its small-cell business. Should reported valuation levels prove true ($7 billion), an equity component to financing a deal is likely,"" Barclays analyst Amir Rozwadowski said in a note to clients.Shares in Crown Castle closed down 4.2% at 96.81 in the stock market today. Shares in Zayo Holdings (ZAYO), a rival of Lightower that has been viewed as a takeover candidate, edged up 1.7% to 30.87.Lightower's network has 33,000 route miles throughout the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic providing connections to service locations and data centers. Meanwhile, Crown Castle has been investing in small-cell technology more than peers American Tower (AMT) and SBA Communications (SBAC).Crown Castle reports earnings on Wednesday.Jennifer Fritzsche, analyst at Wells Fargo, says Verizon and AT&T are already Lightower's top customers.IBD'S TAKE:  Crown Castle stock is up 12% in 2017 but has been outperformed by peers American Tower, up 27%, and SBA Communications, up 31%. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Fritzsche says there may be upside for Zayo if Lightower is acquired.""While Lightower is admittedly growing top-line at a much faster rate than Zayo, it should be noted Zayo covers three times the geography of Lightower — with dense fiber network footprints in many other densely populated U.S. cities,"" she said in a note to clients.The advent of 5G networks is expected to enable faster wireless internet services to homes as well as high-speed connections to drones and self-driving cars.RELATED:Tesla Stock Drops As Autopilot Feature Blamed For CrashAmazon, Dish Wireless Deal Would Target Internet Of Things: CitiWhen Software Mergers Heat Up, These Companies Will Be Buyers

8,SBAC,"The rally in cellphone tower stocks could lose steam, says brokerage Raymond James, which on Monday downgraded American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) on valuation and merger speculation.Ric Prentiss, a Raymond James analyst, downgraded American Tower and SBA Communications to outperform from ""strong buy"" and Crown Castle to market-perform from outperform.""The prospects of an improving U.S. tower leasing environment and lower interest rates have paved the way for an impressive start for tower stocks in 2017 with year-to-date total returns of 19%, 24% and 30% for Crown Castle, American Tower and SBA Communications,"" Prentiss said in a report.Prentiss added that he's ""taking some chips off the table,"" with valuation multiples expanded ""to the upper range of their historical levels.""American Tower lost 0.8% to 129.18, Crown Castle was up marginally to 102.21 and SBA slid 1.4% to 132.42 on the stock market today.Wireless phone companies such as AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) rent tower space to house radio antennas. Most towers house radio antennas from multiple carriers.Prentiss notes speculation that Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) could agree to merge. If approved, a Sprint merger with T-Mobile would eliminate one customer of the tower companies.IBD'S TAKE: Both Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pay dividends. REIT stocks perform well when interest rates are low. IBD's Finance-Property REIT group ranks just No. 80 out of 197 industry groups amid worries that interest rates could rise. Learn about other dividend-paying alternatives at IBD's Income Investor. ""The prospect of such a deal receiving regulatory approval are far from certain but tower stocks have historically traded down on carrier consolidation deal announcements,"" Prentiss added.One long-term wild card for tower stocks is the deployment of 5G wireless services. Verizon has stated that it plans to be a leader in next-generation 5G wireless services, which will require ""small-cell"" technology in urban areas.RELATED:Amazon, Dish Wireless Deal Would Target Internet Of Things: CitiT-Mobile: 'Capital Structure' Would Be Key In Sprint Merger

13,SBAC,"Wireless phone companies aim to improve spotty network coverage and add data capacity by turning to ""small cell"" technology — a strategy that may also enable them to tap unlicensed, Wi-Fi-type radio spectrum in the long run.
"
14,SBAC,"Crown Castle (CCI) is the cell tower operator most likely to benefit, as it aims to play a large role in small cell deployment by wireless firms.
"
15,SBAC,"Crown Castle in April made its second major small-cell-related acquisition, buying Sunesys for $1 billion in cash. In 2011, Crown Castle bought NextG for the same price.
"
16,SBAC,"Verizon Communications (VZ), a Crown Castle customer, is leading the charge to small cell technology as data demand surges on its 4G LTE network. Wireless firms generally use large cell towers across the U.S. to whisk calls, video and email to mobile phone users. Wireless firms also use large radio antennas installed on building rooftops, church steeples, billboards, or even farm silos and fake trees.
"
17,SBAC,"But small cell technology is gaining ground in urban areas. The low-power ""base stations"" are located in shopping malls and outdoor public spaces. They're often mounted on lamp posts or utility poles, and are roughly the size of a suitcase.
"
18,SBAC,"There are about 150,000 full-size cell towers, operated by tower companies Crown Castle, American Tower (AMT), SBA Communications (SBAC) and others.
"
19,SBAC,"The number of small cell base stations is potentially much bigger, depending on whether AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) follow Verizon's lead. Sprint, amid a network upgrade, is expected to deploy small cell technology in 2016.
"
20,SBAC,"""We think there's an opportunity for small cells in most urban environments,"" Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's CEO, told IBD. ""It's a vast geography.
"
21,SBAC,"""When we look at maps that we're working on and the locations we're building out today, you can come to the conclusion that this is going to go in virtually every major suburban and urban area. We're talking about building out block by block.""
"
22,SBAC,"The rub for Crown Castle and its rivals is that rising use of small cells might mean wireless firms will need fewer big towers, which analysts say are highly profitable to operate.
"
23,SBAC,"Moreland, whose company operates 40,000 towers, disagrees.
"
24,SBAC,"""We can find no evidence, nor a carrier customer who is suggesting it's an either/or proposition,"" he said. ""It's complementary and additive.""
"
25,SBAC,"Cell towers aren't going away, but small cell technology is coming on strong, says Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.
"
26,SBAC,"""Carriers are going with small cells because they need to upgrade capacity in a particular spot, like an office building,"" Entner said. ""So instead of building a larger, more expensive tower site, they prefer to do a more topical solution.""
"
27,SBAC,"For smartphone users, small cell deployments should mean fewer dropped calls and faster video downloads. Mobile phone users share radio signals and spectrum capacity, with service degraded as more devices are connected.
"
28,SBAC,"Small cell technology also could help wireless firms tap a new source of airwaves, unlicensed spectrum.
"
29,SBAC,"As for licenses airwaves, AT&T spent $18.2 billion in the recent AWS-3 spectrum auction, the most of any company. Verizon spent $10.4 billion.
"
30,SBAC,"Those additional airwaves, however, won't be enough to meet long-term demand. Verizon is interested in augmenting its licensed spectrum with new airwaves that federal regulators plan to set aside for Wi-Fi-type networks.
"
31,SBAC,"The Federal Communications Commission in April voted to make 150 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz frequency band available for mobile broadband and other commercial uses. The FCC also is studying whether to open up nearly 200 MHz of spectrum in the 5 GHz band.
"
32,SBAC,"Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) are among the cable TV firms interested in using 5 GHz airwaves to expand public Wi-Fi services, analysts say.
"
33,SBAC,"Meanwhile, Verizon is keen on using unlicensed spectrum, and it's been testing a 400-node small cell system in Boston.
"
34,SBAC,"Amir Rozwadowski, a Barclays analyst, says Verizon has focused on its small cell initiative for about 18 months. He says Verizon's interest in small cell systems goes beyond near-term data capacity needs and is related to the ""multiyear evolution of its network.""
"
35,SBAC,"Rozwadowski added in a research report that Verizon is already putting in the foundation for a shift to next-generation 5G mobile networks. Wireless firms globally are expected to deploy 5G networks after 2020.
"
36,SBAC,"To get small cell systems in place in urban areas, Verizon has been working with building owners and local regulators.
"
37,SBAC,"Verizon also has been in talks with suppliers of fiber-optic wiring that connects small cell systems to the Internet and long-distance phone networks, or the so-called backhaul system. The fiber hook-ups speed up mobile data performance.
"
38,SBAC,"Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO), which leases fiber connections to cell tower operators, has told analysts it's interested in the burgeoning small cell market.
"
39,SBAC,"As for Crown Castle, its April 30 acquisition of Sunesys, a unit of Quanta Services, boosted the wireless tower company's ability to provide fiber-optic hook-ups for small cell backhaul services.
"
40,SBAC,"Analysts say Crown Castle made the move in part to meet Verizon's needs. Sunesys owns or has rights to nearly 10,000 miles of fiber in major metro markets. So, Crown Castle now can provide fiber services similar to the likes of Zayo. That's a new business for Crown Castle, notes Rozwadowski.
"
41,SBAC,"Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, likes Crown Castle's investments in small cell technology and its Sunesys acquisition.
"
42,SBAC,"""Small cells will be a central pillar of (4G) network architecture for Verizon and Sprint in the second half of 2015 and especially 2016 and for T-Mobile and AT&T moving forward,"" said Smithen, in a report. ""Sunesys allows Crown Castle to jump-start its business plan by several years by shrinking build-out time and spending for metro fiber networks.""
"
43,SBAC,"In 2014, small cell contracts accounted for 7% of Crown Castle's overall revenue, more than at American Tower and SBA Communications. As in the case of cell towers, Crown Castle expects small cell installations to be share-able among multiple wireless carriers, boosting profits.
"
44,SBAC,"""Crown Castle has the biggest potential for upside to consensus (estimate) forecasts if Verizon and Sprint small cells kick-in,"" Smithen added.Wireless phone companies aim to improve spotty network coverage and add data capacity by turning to ""small cell"" technology — a strategy that may also enable them to tap unlicensed, Wi-Fi-type radio spectrum in the long run.Crown Castle (CCI) is the cell tower operator most likely to benefit, as it aims to play a large role in small cell deployment by wireless firms.Crown Castle in April made its second major small-cell-related acquisition, buying Sunesys for $1 billion in cash.

Wireless firms globally are expected to deploy 5G networks after 2020.To get small cell systems in place in urban areas, Verizon has been working with building owners and local regulators.Verizon also has been in talks with suppliers of fiber-optic wiring that connects small cell systems to the Internet and long-distance phone networks, or the so-called backhaul system. The fiber hook-ups speed up mobile data performance.Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO), which leases fiber connections to cell tower operators, has told analysts it's interested in the burgeoning small cell market.As for Crown Castle, its April 30 acquisition of Sunesys, a unit of Quanta Services, boosted the wireless tower company's ability to provide fiber-optic hook-ups for small cell backhaul services.Analysts say Crown Castle made the move in part to meet Verizon's needs. Sunesys owns or has rights to nearly 10,000 miles of fiber in major metro markets. So, Crown Castle now can provide fiber services similar to the likes of Zayo. That's a new business for Crown Castle, notes Rozwadowski.Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, likes Crown Castle's investments in small cell technology and its Sunesys acquisition.""Small cells will be a central pillar of (4G) network architecture for Verizon and Sprint in the second half of 2015 and especially 2016 and for T-Mobile and AT&T moving forward,"" said Smithen, in a report. ""Sunesys allows Crown Castle to jump-start its business plan by several years by shrinking build-out time and spending for metro fiber networks.""In 2014, small cell contracts accounted for 7% of Crown Castle's overall revenue, more than at American Tower and SBA Communications. As in the case of cell towers, Crown Castle expects small cell installations to be share-able among multiple wireless carriers, boosting profits.""Crown Castle has the biggest potential for upside to consensus (estimate) forecasts if Verizon and Sprint small cells kick-in,"" Smithen added.

New Hampshire, Mississippi and New York also joined the FirstNet project earlier Thursday. Thursday was the deadline for states to opt-in or out.The FirstNet authority is part of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). U.S. territories also are taking part in FirstNet.AT&T was awarded the FirstNet contract in early 2017. AT&T is building a nationwide ground network, with backup generators and a dedicated security operations center.AT&T will gain a swath of 20 MHz of radio spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the life of the 25-year contract. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, AT&T also will be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services.There could be revenue upside for cell tower operators such as American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) from the FirstNet build-out, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Verizon Communications (VZ) and Rivada Networks had proposed alternative networks if states did not take part in FirstNet.As AT&T hits project milestones, it'll get funds from $6.5 billion that Congress has set aside for the project.

Details of the agreement had yet to be ironed out, but AT&T will be the primary contractor responsible for adding towers and antennas to build out the vast network. AT&T said its ""team"" to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions (MSI), General Dynamics (GD), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government.Congress has set aside $6.5 billion for the contract winner to design and build out the network. It's expected that AT&T will spend about $40 billion over the life of the deal to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.As part of the contract, though, AT&T will gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the life of the 25-year contract. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services, considered highly valuable.IBD'S TAKE: Shares in AT&T, which in October agreed to buy media giant Time Warner (TWX), are down about 2% in 2017.

One view is that a Sprint merger with T-Mobile is more likely in a Trump administration and a deal could lower demand for cell towers.On the other hand, the four national wireless firms are rolling out more unlimited-data plans as subscriber growth slows in a mature market. Verizon and AT&T in February reintroduced unlimited plans to counter market share gains by T-Mobile and Sprint.""The unlimited fight taking place among the wireless carriers promises to ensure they keep investing in their networks,"" said Colby Synesael, a Cowen & Co. analyst in an email.Wireless phone companies rent tower space to house radio antennas. Phone companies normally sign leases of 15-20 years with tower firms. Most towers house radio antennas from multiple carriers.SBA Communications stock rose 0.2% to close at 115.41 on the stock market today. Shares in American Tower inched down a penny to 114.70. Crown Castle stock was down marginally to 91.50. American Tower stock has neared a technical buy point of 118.36 while SBA Communications is also close to a 118.67 buy point. Crown Castle has a buy point of 102.92.IBD'S TAKE: Both Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pay dividends. REIT stocks perform well when interest rates are low. But IBD's Finance-Property REIT group ranks just No. 90 out of 197 industry groups amid worries that interest rates could rise. Learn about other dividend-paying alternatives at IBD's Income Investor.Another reason for upbeat views on tower stocks is that AT&T appears likely to win the federal contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless-broadband network dedicated to public safety. As part of the FirstNet contract, AT&T would gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum.""Investors were positive going into (fourth-quarter) earnings and coming out I think investors liked the initial guidance but feel it is still conservative,"" added Cowen's Synesael.One long-term wild card for tower stocks is the deployment of 5G wireless services. Verizon has stated that it plans to be a leader in next-generation 5G wireless services, which will require ""small-cell"" technology in urban areas.Crown Castle has made acquisitions to acquire small-cell technology while rivals American Tower and SBA Communications have been more focused on overseas acquisitions, analysts say.RELATED:Does Verizon Have An Edge On T-Mobile, AT&T In Unlimited War?

""This serendipitously will provide an opportunity for AT&T (T)/Verizon to again distance themselves from Sprint/T-Mobile in terms of network, because they will be able/willing to make the sizable investment to build out this new topology.""South Korea's KT and Verizon are forging ahead in pre-standard deployment of 5G, aiming to drive technical specifications for 5G radio gear. IoT revenue is about 1% of global mobile revenue now but will grow at about 20% annually over the next five years, says market research firm Analysys Mason""5G will be about flexibility and versatility as the network will be software-based, scalable, sliceable, and 'versioned' for different verticals/users. 5G will provide a new level of data coordination and help make sense of data as the Big Data industry takes on a much larger and more meaningful role in our lives,"" Cowen's report said.Of the stocks cited, the only big mover in midday trading in the stock market today was Qualcomm, which plunged 12.7% to close at 54.88 on continued fallout from Apple's (AAPL) suit against the mobile chipmaker on Friday over technology licensing.

Sprint's subscriber growth has more recently rebounded.Shares of cell tower operators American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC), meanwhile, have been hit over worries they could lose business if T-Mobile and Sprint merge.""We think Sprint and T-Mobile are more likely than not to reconsider a merger scenario, but the (TV spectrum) auction, other strategic options, and regulatory complexities may slow down any attempt during 2017,"" Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins said in a research report.Japan's SoftBank owns 83% of Sprint, while Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) owns two-thirds of T-Mobile.T-Mobile stock rose 1% in the stock market today, to 53.46, while Sprint jumped 3.1% to a more than two-year high of 7.74.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock has been trading around a nine-year high after reporting Q3 earnings topped views amid speculation over wireless industry M&A. Sprint stock has doubled in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Amid intensified wireless competition, a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile would be profit-margin-friendly, many analysts say.Such a deal, though, would reduce the number of national wireless firms from four to three. The Obama administration blocked AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying it wanted to retain a four-player national market.T-Mobile in October reported higher-than-expected Q3 profit and raised full-year EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) guidance as its wireless subscriber additions in the September quarter again led the industry. Sprint added 344,000 postpaid subscribers.""We come back to an essential issue that we believe hurt the companies' prospects for consolidation in the last go around -- if it's not broken, why fix it?,"" Rollins wrote. ""We believe these two companies may need more time to build a thoughtful narrative on the needs for further wireless industry consolidation.""AT&T, which bought DirecTV in 2015, in October agreed to buy media giant Time Warner (TWX) for $85 billion. Analysts and industry executives speculate Verizon could acquire Dish Network (DISH) or deepen its alliance with cable TV firms such as Comcast (CMCSA).RELATED:How Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosComcast: Does Trump Win Portend Regulatory Rollback?John Malone Talks Up Apple Buy Of Disney, Likes AT&T Strategy

74,SBAC,"Cellphone tower operators should get a boost in 2017, when capital spending by customers AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Sprint (S) picks up, says SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, which initiated coverage on American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) with buy ratings.""As we look forward to 2017, we believe the outlook is relatively brighter. U.S. carrier activity remains stable at historically low levels, but a number of growth drivers — new spectrum deployments/re-farming, 5G trials and FirstNet, for example — could modestly re-accelerate growth for the group,"" said Greg Miller, a SunTrust analyst, in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Both Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pay dividends. REIT stocks perform well when interest rates are low. But IBD's Finance-Property REIT group ranks just No. 90 out of 197 industry groups amid worries that interest rates could rise. A good place to check on industry group ratings is Stock Checkup. After a big run, dividend-paying AT&T and Verizon are also being pressured by views that the Federal Reserve may hike short-term rates.Verizon has stated it plans to be a leader in next-generation 5G wireless services. The U.S. government, meanwhile, is expected to soon award a contract for FirstNet, a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety.Miller expects intensified wireless competition to drive investments in network capacity. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint have stepped up marketing for unlimited data offers, while AT&T and Verizon are selling bigger data buckets.""In our view, the U.S. wireless industry remains fiercely competitive, and the risk of standing still from a network-quality perspective is just as great if not greater than ever,"" added Miller in the report. ""We believe carriers — particularly AT&T and, to a lesser degree, Verizon — will need to continue to spend on networks in order to maintain long-term competitiveness and, should 2016 play out as we expect, the odds of greater activity next year increase from a historical perspective.""Crown Castle, American Tower and SBA Communications all fell hard in the stock market today. Crown Castle stock fell 2.2%, to 91.87, while American Tower stock dropped 2.8%, to 108.11, and SBA fell 2.3%, to 108.99.

75,SBAC,"Citigroup downgraded Crown Castle (CCI) to neutral on valuation following a dividend-driven rally in cell tower stocks despite a slowdown in AT&T's (T) spending on wireless infrastructure.Owing to low interest rates worldwide, investor demand has been growing for high-dividend-paying stocks. AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) stocks were top performers in the first half of 2016, and cell-tower shares have been on a run recently.Crown Castle stock has jumped 14% in the past two months, and it carries an IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of 88, putting it among the top 12% of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months, with an emphasis on the most recent six months. Shares touched an all-time high of 102.82 on Wednesday.Crown Castle fell 1.6% to 100.54 on the stock market today.American Tower (AMT) and SBA Communications (SBAC) were up 8.6% and 13% in the past two months, respectively, as of Friday.

SBA Communications slid 1% to 113.30.Wireless phone companies rent tower space from Crown Castle, American Tower and SBA to house radio antennas. Phone companies normally sign leases of 15-20 years with tower firms, and most towers house radio antennas from multiple carriers.Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins on Monday downgraded Crown Castle to neutral, but he maintained buy ratings on SBA Communications and American Tower. Crown Castle stock gained nearly 18% this year though July 8, while American Tower was up 17%, and SBA 9%.""Tower stocks have rallied back 9% over the last month and 15% year to date. Lower rates seem to be helping valuations, especially for Crown Castle given its larger dividend yield,"" said Rollins in a research report. ""We believe the time is right to shift the investment strategy for towers to emphasize buying the cheaper assets.""Rollins expects AT&T's spending to boost wireless network capacity to improve in 2017. ""We expect domestic tower site leasing growth to remain in the 4%-to-7% range over the next 12-months,"" Rollins added.Falling bond yields, though, could be a bigger factor than the growth outlook for tower stocks, he says.""We could see further multiple expansion in this low-rate environment, which is a risk to our downgrade of the highest-yielding tower name, Crown Castle,"" Rollins added.

76,SBAC,"The “stand-alone trajectory” of T-Mobile US (TMUS)  “looks very bright” while long-term prospects for a deal with Dish Network (DISH), Sprint, or a cable TV firm are still alive, says Deutsche Bank, which initiated coverage with a buy rating.Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, also started coverage on AT&T (T), rural phone company Frontier Communications (FTR) and cell tower companies American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI) with buy ratings.He initiated Verizon Communications (VZ), Sprint (S), CenturyLink (CTL), Windstream, and SBA Communications (SBAC) with hold ratings. T-Mobile, with its Uncarrier-branded marketing strategy, has gained market share vs. bigger rivals.Controlled by Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile has “strategic appeal to potential industry partners,” wrote Niknam.“With video increasingly going mobile, and reports that Comcast (CMCSA) has recently triggered its (wholesale) agreement with Verizon, we believe cable companies may increasingly view mobile network ownership as a longer-term strategic option.”While Comcast has plenty financial muscle to pull off an acquisition, Dish Networks’ stock has dropped while Sprint holds more than $32 billion in debt.AT&T’s acquisition of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV, meanwhile, has bolstered its competitive position, says Niknam.“We believe AT&T is best positioned strategically, given AT&T’s presence across each of the key distribution platforms (mobile, video, wired broadband/phone), and its leadership position (#1 or #2 share) across each market,” he said.Frontier stock was up about 4.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Sprint and CenturyLink were up more than 2%, and SBA more than 3%.

77,SBAC,"There could be upside for cell tower operator Crown Castle (CCI) in an expected network upgrade announcement by Sprint (S), but how much upside is unclear.The next phase in Sprint's 4G network upgrade will likely use small-cell technology, an approach Verizon Communications (VZ) has also taken. Verizon's plans include tapping unlicensed radio spectrum, as IBD has reported.Wireless firms generally use large cell towers across the U.S. to whisk calls, video and email to mobile phone users. Small-cell technology is most useful in urban areas, including shopping malls and outdoor public spaces. Radio antennas are installed mounted on lamp posts or utility poles, and use fiber-optic hookups to connect to long-distance phone networks for mobile calls.Crown Castle has made acquisitions to acquire small-cell technology, focusing in this area much more than cell tower rivals American Tower (AMT) and SBA Communications (SBAC).""We believe Sprint is pursuing a 70,000 small-cell densification, with the initial phase slated for completion by the end of 2016,"" said Jonathan Atkin, an analyst at RBC Capital, in a research report. ""Absent an accompanying macro-site project, we are unclear on the benefit to tower companies from Sprint's densification, as the new infrastructure could be deployed principally on street-level infrastructure, though CCI could potentially see new tenancies on its small-cell infrastructure.""Kevin Smith, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, also speculates on upside for Crown Castle.""We continue to believe that Sprint's aggressive small-cell build will boost CCI in the second half of 2015 and the stock remains our top pick,"" wrote Smithen in a report Thursday. ""However, since CCI reports (Q2 earnings) well ahead of Sprint, we do not think that CCI will be in a position to include Sprint in its guidance on its earnings call.""Michael Bowen, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, says Sprint likely hasn't firmed up its plans, though he, too, sees potential upside for Crown Castle.""No one really knows what Sprint will do; however, there is speculation that it is contemplating a major network strategy that includes densifying its network in major markets,"" said Bowen in a report Wednesday. ""While CCI is moving heavily into the (small cell) space, American Tower and SBA Communications have stated that the economics of macro tower deployments are still much more favorable.""American Tower and SBA Communications prefer to invest in international tower assets than to deploy small cells in the U.S., while CCI recently sold its remaining international assets in Australia.""Shares of Crown Castle, American Tower and SBA were all up a fraction in early trading in the stock market today.

165,SBAC,"The Obama administration on Thursday stepped up its campaign to free up radio spectrum for wireless broadband services and a new public safety network, but still faces a major hurdle in getting Congress to authorize the auction of airwaves owned by TV broadcasters.
"
166,SBAC,"In a speech in Marquette, Mich., President Obama outlined a plan to expand wireless Internet services in rural America and build a nationwide mobile phone network for emergency workers. Both initiatives would ostensibly be paid for through money raised in a government auction of airwaves now controlled by TV broadcasters.
"
167,SBAC,"The administration last year proposed that broadcasters voluntarily give up the spectrum in return for sharing in the proceeds of an auction, which needs to be authorized by Congress.
"
168,SBAC,"The White House estimates that new auctions would raise $27.8 billion for the government over the next decade — after TV broadcasters and other spectrum holders are paid. It's not clear, however, what assumptions the administration plan makes on how auction proceeds would be divvied up.

Still, it's not clear Congress will pass spectrum-related legislation amid fierce lobbying by the National Association of Broadcasters and wireless trade group CTIA. The NAB contends the government needs to compile a detailed database of unused spectrum by all licensees before requiring an auction. The CTIA favors auctions.
"
172,SBAC,"Asked by IBD if a formula for sharing auction revenue is an issue, Dennis Wharton, NAB executive vice president, said: ""It's premature to talk about that; the administration hasn't put forth a lot of details in its proposals.""

174,SBAC,"As companies jockey over control of spectrum assets, speculation over takeovers is rife. Shares in Dish Network (DISH), which has been maneuvering to cobble together wireless spectrum, jumped 5.9% on Thursday after Credit Suisse said in a report that AT&T (T) could bid for the satellite TV broadcaster if it amasses valuable airwaves. Dish Network, which is controlled by CEO Charlie Ergen, is interested in the spectrum assets held by DBSD, which is in bankruptcy.

175,SBAC,"Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Chaplin, in a research note, says although ""a number of hurdles to an AT&T/Dish deal remain ... if Ergen is able to pair his spectrum assets with his (satellite TV) business of 14 million subscribers, AT&T might find Ergen's creation to be an enticing combination.""

"
180,SBAC,"If spectrum auctions raise the money projected, the White House says $10.7 billion would be earmarked to build a nationwide public safety network. About $5 billion in auction revenue would be directed to expanding wireless broadband services in rural areas. Roughly $9.6 billion would be placed in the federal Treasury, says the White House. About $2.5 billion of the $27.8 billion projected to be raised would be available for other purposes.

193,SBAC,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially but later witnessed a steep rise as U.S.-China trade concerns abated with both parties signaling to put their differences on hold and continue negotiations to bridge the huge trade imbalance.Last week, President Trump revealed that the U.S. administration is mulling a settlement of the trade embargo on ZTE as part of the ongoing trade talks between the two warring countries. This includes a fine of $1.3 billion against ZTE, restructuring of its management and imposition of strict security measures to prevent the theft of U.S. intellectual and national security secrets.In return, China has vouched to reduce tariffs on U.S. agricultural and farm products and has announced to cut tariffs on most imported cars from 25% to 15% from Jul 1. However, various U.S. lawmakers have voiced their concerns and raised their opposition to allow ZTE a re-entry into the market, citing cyber threat.  With heightened concerns for cyber security taking center stage, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a new cyber security strategy that hinges on five pillars – focusing on identifying risks, reducing vulnerability, reducing threats, mitigating consequence and enabling cyber security outcomes. The new framework would help to mitigate risks and strengthen collective defense mechanism to thwart potential cyber threats.  Regarding company-specific news, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership and, technology collaborations ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) collaborated with Japan’s mobile operator company, SoftBank Corp. to improve radio access network design in the Tokai region.

194,SBAC,"American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report) is set to acquire transmission towers from Telkom Kenya. The move comes as part of American Tower’s expansion plans and in fact, the Kenya market will represent the company’s fifth in Africa and the 17th globally.Specifically, up to 723 transmission towers will be purchased for an undisclosed amount, per the Reuters report. Notably, Telkom Kenya is the third biggest telecom company, in term of user count, in Kenya. It is 60% owned by London-based Helios Investment Partners and 40% by the Government of Kenya.  This transaction, which is likely to completed in the second half of 2018, will help Telkom Kenya unleash capital from the sellout, which can be invested in its internet network and enhance service delivery. On the other hand, the move will enable American Tower to capitalize on the expansion of mobile broadband in Kenya and fetch long-term gains.   Notably, there is a rising trend of telecom companies to shrug off the tower infrastructure to wireless infrastructure companies like American Tower, Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). This is because it helps telecom companies to avoid huge outlay of money in maintaining the expensive infrastructure and rather channelize resources on service delivery.And this growing trend is offering ample scope to these infrastructure REITs to prosper. In fact, wireless services are advancing rapidly in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of towers and equipment. Moreover, with the advent of new technologies, especially 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), companies like American Tower and Crown Castle International have higher chances of growth.However, consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell-tower deployments. In fact, take the example of the recent merger news of T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report). If such a deal materializes, then it can be a concern for the tower operators. This is because T-Mobile US and Sprint are being facilitated by the same wireless tower operators to install their cellular networks. However, a merger of these two will result in elimination of many overlapping towers and consequently, tower operators will lose on lease rentals.Nevertheless, American Tower currently continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 4G LTE and 5G networks. Its tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers lend it a competitive edge over rivals.Nevertheless, the company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. Further, high customer concentration is likely to affect the company’s top line. Additionally, the company has been affected by change in rate of foreign currencies, stiff competition and integration risks. Additionally, flaring up operating expenses remain another challenge for American Tower.American Tower currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Moreover, shares of company have gained 7.6% in the past year against 2.4% decline of its industry.

195,SBAC,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks initially witnessed a V-shaped recovery on game-changing merger news but later witnessed a sharp fall as concerns over fresh restrictions against Chinese companies intensified fears of an escalating trade war in the telecom domain.The Trump administration is reportedly mulling to introduce an executive order that could raise the bar for federal agencies to buy or sell products from Chinese technology firms, citing national security issues. The bone of contention stems from an innate desire between the two warring nations to claim dominance in cutting-edge technologies and the next generation of wireless services. The Pentagon has also banned the sale of smartphones from ZTE and Huawei — two of China’s leading technology brands — from all military establishments.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of major telecom companies ruled the roost. The industry’s earnings in general appear to be on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Nokia Corporation’s (NOK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings (non-IFRS) per share of €0.02 or 2 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents.

197,SBAC,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks took an initial beating before witnessing a sharp rise, as healthy earnings surprises seemed to propel the industry.The industry initially received a jolt when antitrust authorities made it clear that a competitive environment was of utmost importance. The Department of Justice initiated a probe related to the alleged collusion between AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers.

The company is likely to report higher revenues in both the operating segments on the back of healthy growth dynamics.Whether this could result in higher earnings for the quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line ExpansionSBA Communications is expanding its tower portfolio while seeking new growth opportunities through enhancement of its scale of operations in international markets. It is offering wireless service providers assistance in developing networks.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Site Leasing segment, which accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues, is currently pegged at $427 million, up from $398 million reported in first-quarter 2017.

199,SBAC,"American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results, before the opening bell on May 1. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to witness a rise year over year.The company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise | American Tower Corporation (REIT) QuoteFactors at PlayAmerican Tower faces fierce competition in the global wireless tower market from large incumbents like Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).The company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. At the end of fourth-quarter 2017, the company had $802.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, and around $19,430.3 million of outstanding long-term debt, compared with $787.2 million and $18,294.7 million, respectively, at the end of December 2016. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation which is needed to meet future debt obligations. Moreover, this may keep the company from accessing the debt market and refinancing at suitable rates.Customer concentration is very high for American Tower and the top four customers account for nearly 65% of its quarterly revenues. Further, American Tower is rapidly expanding in the international markets, especially in the emerging Asian and Latin American markets. Although this geographic diversification will boost revenues, it might jeopardize the bottom line. Tower operations in the emerging markets are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market.Further, American Tower’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of $1.76 for the first quarter remained unchanged over the past month. However, the figure witnessed rise of 11.4% from the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, the company generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Additionally, it provides on-site maintenance and servicing of antennas, amplifiers and base-station equipment. Since moving equipment from one tower to another is cumbersome, carriers normally renew these contracts upon expiration. This generates a strong long-term lease upcycle.Revenues generated from the leasing and management of such networks are remarkable and more than 95% are recurring in nature. Moreover, most of its towers are over 210 feet tall, consequently providing sufficient space for the company's customers to install transmission equipment. The company also owns 29% of the land under its towers in the United States.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.74 billion, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.5%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.14%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: American Tower has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Key PickSimon Property Group, Inc.

200,SBAC,"Wireless tower operators in the United States had a robust 2017. We believe that there are several reasons for this dream run to continue in 2018, the primary being the thrust in the U.S. public safety network.  Recently, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) together revealed that all the 50 states of the nation, as well as two U.S. territories and Washington D.C., have entered the FirstNet project, the first dedicated nationwide wireless network for first responders.Notably, in March 2017, AT&T was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.Per the deal, AT&T will be able to use this highly valuable spectrum for both commercial and consumer purposes. This is why several industry researchers believe that the FirstNet project may come as a boon to cell tower operators such as American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report), Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). SBA Communications became the first tower company to confirm that it has received applications from AT&T for the buildout of the FirstNet network.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August 2017, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network. Additionally, Rivada Networks has also decided to lay out public safety network.Wireless services are advancing fast in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Tower operators effectively address this opportunity as more than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless carriers.Tower operators generally have long-term (typically five - ten year) tower lease agreements with the U.S. national carriers. We believe that a strong business model coupled with growing deployment of public safety networks will give a major boost to wireless tower operators in 2018.Zacks RankCrown Castle has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Verizon, AT&T and SBA Communications carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). American Tower sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

201,SBAC,"According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) have recently expressed renewed interest for a possible merger. Notably, this will be the third instance that the companies are negotiating the merger.Ever since President Trump came to power, the telecom industry circle has been rife with speculations that the Trump regime may pave the way for a merger between the two companies mentioned above. It is to be noted T-Mobile US and Sprint are the third and fourth largest national telecom operators of the United States, respectively.  Change in Regulatory Stance to Aid M&AsThe previous administration under Barack Obama was strictly against further consolidation of the U.S. telecom industry. The U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) firmly stated that it wanted at least four powerful national telecom operators in the country.However, the newly restructured FCC under Trump’s presidency has given enough indications of its leniency compared with the Obama administration. The FCC is most likely to roll back a slew of stringent regulations of the previous regime. The FCC’s stance of being less restrictive will aid mergers and acquisitions.Why did Earlier Attempts to Acquire T-Mobile Fail?In 2011, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) placed the first bid of $39 billion for gaining full control of T-Mobile US. After a close inspection, the FCC thwarted AT&T’s attempt to acquire T-Mobile US, stating that it seeks a minimum of four national carriers in order to maintain competitiveness.In July 2014, Sprint offered $16 billion for a little over 50% stake in T-Mobile US. The deal was thoroughly evaluated by both the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice with the regulators coming to the same conclusion again. Consequently, Sprint opted out of the race. Sprint and T-Mobile US once again negotiated in last year which broke down on November over the leadership dispute of the merged entity.The WinnersBoth T-Mobile US and Sprint will benefit significantly from the proposed merger. At present, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T together control around 68% of the U.S. wireless market. The merged entity with around 32% market share will be a formidable challenger to both Verizon and AT&T. Yesterday, stock prices of Sprint and T-Mobile US jumped 17.1% and 5.7%, respectively.Notably, Verizon and AT&T will also benefit as these two large telecom carriers were facing severe pricing pressure from unlimited data offerings of T-Mobile US and Sprint. If these two companies merge then Verizon and AT&T will face lesser competition and won't have to invest as much in marketing and promotions to retain subscribers. A decrease in promotional expenditure will raise their operating margins. Share prices of Verizon and AT&T increased 2.9% and 1.8%, respectively, following the news.The LosersMajor losers of the proposed merger will be wireless tower operators like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report), Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Yesterday, these three stocks plunged by 4%, 4.8% and 5%, respectively.Consolidation of telecom operators generally results in lower capital spending. T-Mobile US and Sprint being facilitated by the same wireless tower operators to install their cellular networks. However, a merger of these two will result in elimination of many overlapping towers and consequently, tower operators will lose on lease rentals.  The chart below depicts the price performance of T-Mobile US and Sprint year to date.Both Sprint and T-Mobile US currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineThe U.S. telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition, as success to a great extent depends on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. Moreover, the competition is likely to intensify further in the U.S. wireless industry in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators). The proposed merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint will enable the consolidated entity to strengthen its foothold.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

202,SBAC,"Leading international wireless tower operator, American Tower Corp (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Oct 31, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.35%. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.91%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayAmerican Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 5G networks. Next-generation 4G LTE, 5G networks and increased usage of smartphones and tablets are driving demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s increased investments in Asia are paying off. These benefits are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. Further, we believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers should drive top line and lend it a competitive edge over rivals. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth.We are also impressed with American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 66 cents per share of the company’s common stock. The distribution was paid on Oct 17 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Sep 29.However, American Tower has a substantially leveraged balance sheet with around $17,509.9 million of outstanding long-term debt in the last reported quarter. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation, which is rerquired to meet future debt obligations.High-customer concentration is likely to have an adverse impact on the company’s top line. Expansion in the global market increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Stiff competition, integration risks and rising operating expenses are other headwinds. Additionally, the company’s upcoming results face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Also, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp (SBAC  -  Free Report).We believe that such headwinds have led to the company’s disappointing price performance. Over the past three months, the stock has declined 0.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.7%.  A Closer View on Certain Important MetricsAmerican Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will generate $295 million from Asia, $165 million from EMEA, $293 million from Latin America and $904 million from the United States. Meanwhile, total international revenues are estimated at $753 million.As of Sep 30, the company is projected to own 1,48,047 towers, with 39,843 towers in the domestic market and 1,07,911 towers internationally.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Tower has an Earnings ESP of -1.54%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.64, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.67. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Tower has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise  American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise | American Tower Corporation (REIT) Quote Key PickBoston Properties, Inc (BXP  -  Free Report) from the broader Finance sector has the right combination to deliver an earnings beat when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2.

203,SBAC,"On Oct 2, we issued an updated research report on Boston, MA-based, leading international wireless tower operator,American Tower Corp (AMT  -  Free Report). Let’s have a look at the overall performance of the stock.Price PerformanceOver the last three months, the price performance of American Tower has been impressive. The stock has inched up 3.3%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.5% over the same time span. When compared to the market at large, the stock’s performance looks depressing, as the S&P 500 index has rallied 3.6%, over the said time frame.Considering the stable performance of the stock, we expect American Tower to scale higher in the coming quarters.A Broker FavoriteWe note that earnings estimates for American Tower have exhibited a healthy uptrend.Over the last 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 has moved up 0.6% to $1.67 per share and 0.6% to $1.70, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has increased by 10 cents to $6.71.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Estimates Trending UpWe note that the sales and Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimate for American Tower has moved up for the remaining quarters of 2017 and also for full-year 2017.The sales growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to accelerate 10.9% and 10.4%, respectively. For 2017, sales is expected to surge 15.1%.The EPS growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to accelerate 202.9% and 262%, respectively. For fiscal 2017, EPS is expected to soar 238.9%.The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism over prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeAmerican Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 5G networks. Next-generation 4G LTE and 5G networks along with increased usage of smartphones and tablets are boosting demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s increased investments in Asia are paying off.We believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets have driven its top line and lent a competitive edge. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth. Notably, within the Property segment, revenues from the United States totaled $897 million (in second-quarter 2017), up 8.07% year over year. Meanwhile, total international revenues amounted $741 million, up 24.12% year over year. Within this, revenues from Asia totaled $295 million, increasing a whopping 31.11% year over year. EMEA revenues grossed $160 million, up 18.52% year over year. Latin America revenues totaled $287 million, up 21.09% year over year. The company’s total revenue from international business is likely to outperform revenues from the United States in the next three to seven years.American Tower continues to generate most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Further, the company provides on-site maintenance as well as servicing of antennas, amplifiers and base station equipment. The $100-million tower lease agreement with telecom behemoth AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) has helped American Tower to raise 2017 revenue guidance.We are also impressed with American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 66 cents on shares of its common stock. The distribution will be paid on Oct 17, 2017 to stockholders of record at the closure of business on Sep 29, 2017.All these above factors have also played a pivotal role in driving the company’s outlook.Hiked GuidanceFor 2017, American Tower anticipates property revenue to be $6,480-$6,580 million. Net income is expected to be $1,355-$1,405 million. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the range of $4,045-$4,105 million. Consolidated AFFO is expected in the range of $2,835-$2,885 million.DownturnsCustomer concentration is very high for American Tower. The company’s major customers include AT&T, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. They account for nearly 65% of American Tower’s quarterly revenues. The loss of any one of these customers or consolidations will have a significant material impact on the company’s top line. Rapid expansion in the international markets, especially in the emerging Asian and Latin American markets increases revenues. Geographic diversification may jeopardize the bottom line as tower operations in the emerging markets are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market. Also, it increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks.Stiff competition, integration risks, rising operating expenses and a highly leveraged balance sheet act as major dampener to American Tower. In addition, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may lead to serious financial fluctuation for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s upcoming results also face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Moreover, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp (SBAC  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

204,SBAC,"Crown Castle International Corp.’s (CCI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of $1.36 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34. It also compared favorably with the year-ago tally of $1.24 per share.Results reflect increase in site rental revenues. The company continues to benefit from its extensive tower portfolio, high demand for infrastructure and slew of fiber-operator buyouts. Also, the company raised its outlook for 2018.Net revenues for the quarter amounted to $1.29 billion and marked year-over-year growth of 27.9%. However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 billion. Crown Castle International Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Crown Castle International Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteSite rental revenues were $1,153 million, up 34.5% year over year that included organic growth, as well as contributions from acquisitions and other items. Particularly, site rental revenues in the quarter experienced a $12-million benefit due to a long-term agreement signed with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) that includes contracted new leasing activity across towers and small cells.However, network services revenues came in at $146 million, down 8.2% year over year.Operating MetricsQuarterly operating income jumped 36.9% from the prior-year quarter to $349 million. Operating expenses also escalated 24.8% year over year to $950 million. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was approximately $763 million, representing year-over-year increase of 31.3%.Cash Flow and LiquidityCrown Castle exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $220 million, down from $314 million reported at the end of the prior quarter. Further, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company generated $452 million of net cash from operating activities compared with $442 million in the year-ago period.Total debt and other long-term obligations aggregated approximately $15,616 million, down from $16,044 million at the end of 2017.Dividend PayoutDuring the reported quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividend of $1.05 per common share, up approximately 11% from the year-earlier quarter.Q2 OutlookFor second-quarter 2018, Crown Castle expects site rental revenues in the range of $1,153-$1,163 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the band of $348-$358 million. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated in the range of $757-$767 million. Interest expense (inclusive of amortization) is estimated in the $154-$164 million range. Meanwhile, FFO is anticipated in the $496-$506 million band, while AFFO is projected at $539-$549 million.2018 OutlookCrown Castle raised its outlook for full-year 2018. The company expects site rental revenues in the range of $4,639-$4,684 million, denoting a projected increase of $57 million at the mid-point from the prior issued outlook. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the band of $3,097-$3,142 million, reflecting an uptick of $48 million at the mid-point. In addition, AFFO is guided in the band of $2,255-$2,300 million, marking a rise of $36 million at the mid-point.Our TakeCrown Castle is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. Furthermore, the company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. The company is also well on track with the integration of its recent fiber-operator acquisitions. In fact, extensive tower portfolio, increased demand for infrastructure, healthy leasing activity, continued buyout of towers and growing demand for mobile broadband are the key positives.Nevertheless, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell-tower deployments, and consequently, it might impact Crown Castle’s top-line performance. Also, evolution of new technologies may reduce the demand for site leases and flare up expenses.Crown Castle currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

On Nasdaq, a 1.91-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Markets Rally for Third Straight Trading DayAll the key U.S. indexes rebounded and increased for the third consecutive trading day after entering correction territory earlier this month. The movement lacked specific catalysts, but some of the gains came after the Fed released its semi-annual monetary policy report on Friday ahead of the new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s first testimony on monetary policy in the Congress on Tuesday.In the monetary policy report the Fed sees the labor market is “little beyond full employment,” but wage gains will grow moderately. The report indicated that inflation will remain near or lower than Fed’s target rate of 2% this year. However, the semi-annual report did not throw any light on the number of rate hikes this year.Additionally, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Monday that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will “do a lot of rate hikes” provided the Committee has enough data to support such a move. Bullard’s cautious tone was mainly because he argued that the economy is still in a low-inflation, low-growth ""regime.""Meanwhile, the Dow registered an increase of around 400 points. For the S&P 500 index, nine out of 11 sectors increased during the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) jumped 1.6%, becoming the best performing sector among the S&P 500. The FAAMG stocks, Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc.

Consequently, CEO Warren Buffett announced a $29 billion benefit from recent U.S. tax restructuring. Buffett said that in case the company fails to get any market bargains it is expected to return the cash to its shareholders.Gains in Berkshire Hathaway had a positive impact on the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), which rose 1.5% becoming the second biggest gainer among the S&P 500 sectors. Dow components, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) advanced 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively.

208,SBAC,"Proofpoint, Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company reported a loss (including stock based compensation) of 38 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents.The company has a mixed track record of earnings surprises. In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice while missing the same on the other two occasions, delivering an average positive surprise of 8.68%.Proofpoint stock has gained 29.7% year to date, outperforming the 20.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayProofpoint is a leading security-as-a-service provider, which focuses on cloud-based solutions for threat protection, compliance, archiving & governance, and secure communications.According to a Markets and Markets report, the cyber security market will touch $202.36 billion in 2021 from $122.45 billion in 2016, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 10.6%. The favorable trend in the space is likely to aid Proofpoint’s second-quarter results.Although Proofpoint witnessed remarkable top-line growth on the back of consistent focus on launching products, acquisitions and partnerships, the company has failed to deliver on the bottom line.It should be noted that Proofpoint has invested heavily to enhance its sales and marketing capabilities, particularly by expanding the company’s sales force to survive in the highly competitive cyber security market. Notably, the company’s expenses escalated approximately three-fold to $461 million in 2016 from $124 million in 2012. This affected Proofpoint’s bottom-line performance.Since Proofpoint continues to invest in sales and marketing, we anticipate this to remain a drag on the company’s second-quarter bottom line.The company anticipates revenues in the range of $118–120 million and billings between $141 million and $143 million. Further, Proofpoint expects to incur loss in the range of 61–69 cents per share on a GAAP basis, while on a non-GAAP basis, earnings are estimated between 11 cents and 13 cents.Proofpoint, Inc.

209,SBAC,"Leading international wireless tower operator, American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Jul 27, before market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.64%. Moreover, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.78%.The price performance of American Tower has also been impressive over the last six months. The stock returned 31.7%, outshining the industry’s gain of 3.4% over the same time frame.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCustomer concentration is very high for American Tower. The company’s major customers include AT&T, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. They account for nearly 65% of American Tower’s quarterly revenues. The loss of any one of these customers or consolidations will have a significant material impact on the company’s top line. American Tower is rapidly expanding in the international markets. Although this geographic diversification will boost revenues, it may jeopardize the bottom line as tower operations in the emerging markets are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market. Also, it increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks.Moreover, stiff competition, integration risks, rising operating expenses and a highly leveraged balance sheet act as major dampeners to American Tower. In addition, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may lead to serious financial fluctuation for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s upcoming results also face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Moreover, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, American Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 4G LTE and 5G networks. We further believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers have driven its top line and lend it a competitive edge over rivals. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core-revenue growth.Earnings Whispers                                             Our proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Tower has an Earnings ESP of -1.94%.

210,SBAC,"Altice USA (ATUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, after market close. Based in Bethpage, NY, Altice USA is one of the largest broadband communications andvideo services providers in the United States.The company has a negative earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 385%Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsAltice USA operates in a highly competitive, consumer and technology-driven market, which is likely to be affected by rapidly changing businesses and consumer choices. The company’s ability to increase the number of subscribers to its services is highly dependent on penetration rates.Further, higher programming costs and other operating expenses are likely to affect margins going forward. Altice USA’s programming costs increased 3% year over year in third-quarter 2017, primarily due to an increase in contractual programming rates, partially offset by a decrease in video customers. In the reported quarter, Optimum’s programming costs increased 3.5% to $482 million and Suddenlink’s programming costs increased 1.4% to $147 million, both on a year-over-year basis. Programming cost per customer is expected to increase going forward.Additionally, the company’s operations also remain susceptible to foreign currency exchange rate risks and interest rate risks.Due to these headwinds, Altice USA has recorded a disappointing price performance. In the past six months, the stock has declined 39.9% compared with the industry’s loss of 3.6%. Despite such headwinds, the company continues to deploy fiber network in various international markets and ink different content and programming-related deals. Altice USA’s efforts to improve customer services, sales and marketing efficiencies through digitalization are bearing fruit. Though the carriage deal settlement with The Walt Disney Company led to uninterrupted access to some of Disney’s premium channels, pay-TV prices for Optimum customers rose on the back of high-quality video services and faster Internet. Altice USA and Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report) have reportedly reached an agreement to broadcast respective regional cable news networks. Its multi-year deal with Sprint (S  -  Free Report) will help Altice USA provide mobile voice and data services throughout the nation through Sprint’s network.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Altice USA is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Altice USA has an Earnings ESP of -60.00%.

Consequently, it recorded an average miss of 5.93%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that SBA Communications is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key elements.Zacks ESP: SBA Communications has an Earnings ESP of +24.82%.

Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of SBA Communications’ favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat at the company.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We are impressed with SBA Communications’ innovative network expansion methodologies which have helped it to substantially add subscribers and compete against market behemoths like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) in the global wireless tower market.Wireless services are advancing rapidly in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. SBA Communications effectively addresses this opportunity as over 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers.Moreover, wireless consumer demand is anticipated to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, social networking and streaming of video. SBA Communications is a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the United States and internationally, offering wireless customers in-depth management experience, scale and resources.The company offers wireless service providers assistance in developing their own networks. Its services include site identification and acquisition as well as obtaining zoning approvals and permitting networks representing all technologies. SBA Communications also provides a broad range of cell site equipment installation, optimization and integration services. The company’s extensive site development experience includes participation in the development of more than 45,000 communication sites.Buoyed by such tailwinds, SBA Communications’ share price gained 15.9% in the past six months surpassing the industry’s growth of 10.7%.Meanwhile, customer concentration is very high for SBA Communications and the top four among its customers, namely, Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, account for majority of its total quarterly revenues. The loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will lead to a significant material impact on the company’s top line.

212,SBAC,"United States Cellular (USM  -  Free Report), the wireless subsidiary of Telephone & Data Systems (TDS  -  Free Report), is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1 billion, reflecting year-over-year improvement of 0.9%. The consensus estimate for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 8 cents per share, indicating year-over-year decline of 14.3%.However, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 115.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsThe price performance of U.S. Cellular has been unimpressive. Over the past three months, shares of U.S. Cellular have lost 7.2% against the industry’s gain of 3.6%.  U.S. Cellular continues to face a number of headwinds. It operates in a highly competitive wireless market and is significantly challenged by low-cost mobile service providers. Additionally, high costs associated with network integration and construction of cell sites, aggressive pricing by larger rivals and the ongoing consolidation in the wireless industry through mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures are risks to fourth-quarter results. The company’s cash and liquidity scenario in the last quarter was also dismal. It is to be seen whether the company can turn this situation around in the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, U.S. Cellular’s top priority has always been subscriber addition and churn management. Toward this end, the company has taken up different judicious business measures such as introduction of a billing system, continuous rollout of 4G LTE, enhancement of LTE handsets, completion of various spectrum transactions and monetization of non-strategic assets. The company’s decision to upgrade its existing prepaid plans by increasing the amount of data available is likely to drive prepaid subscriber addition. In the last reported quarter, prepaid subscriber base totaled 515,000 compared with 484,000 at the end of 2016.U.S. Cellular is optimistic about the growing demand for smartphones, which enjoy significant market penetration. The company is gearing up to deploy 5G wireless network. It has completed joint testing of various 5G use cases at 28GHz in partnership with U.S. Ericsson. U.S. Cellular has teamed up with Nokia Corp (NOK  -  Free Report) to enhance the wireless experience for business customers. The company is also focused on various cost-cutting initiatives.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that U.S. Cellular is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: U.S. Cellular has an Earnings ESP of -56.52%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 12 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 8 cents.

214,SBAC,"VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 86 cents that were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, the company has a mixed earnings surprise track record for the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.80%.Revenues increased 2.4% year over year to $288.6 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $286.6 million.We believe increasing domain name registrations and strong demand for VeriSign’s cyber security products, following ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya, are key growth drivers.Cyber security companies like VeriSign are doing well because of increasing instances of cybercrimes. Its shares have massively outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock returned 30.1%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names are likely to drive VeriSign’s top line.According to the company’s latest “The Domain Name Industry Brief”, domain name registrations across all top-level domains (TLDs) have signaled a positive trend, with 1.3 million domain name registrations being added in the first quarter, an increase of 0.4% sequentially and 3.7% year over year. Thus, an increase in domain name registrations coupled with price hikes for the .com and .net domain names will drive revenues in our view.The company is also benefiting from strong gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs, investments in intellectual properties as well as growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market. It has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space as well.Moreover, the divestiture of iDefense Security Intelligence Services has helped the company to focus on core operations, which will have a positive impact on results.Going by the sequential decline trend in marketing expenses over the last few quarters, we expect it to remain muted in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Notably, management plans to defer marketing spend to the latter half of the year.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization is a concern.VeriSign, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  VeriSign, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that VeriSign is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: VeriSign’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at earnings of 91 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: VeriSign’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

216,SBAC,"We are in the first full week of the Q1 reporting cycle, and only a handful of the S&P 500 players have released their earnings numbers, so far. Notably, banking giants kicked off the season on an impressive note, courtesy improved earnings and revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for five of the 98 Finance Sector companies on the S&P 500 (accounting 23.7% of the total market cap), that have reported earnings so far, have climbed 20.4% year over year on 6.9% higher revenues.Further, for the first quarter, as a whole, earnings of the finance sector, which includes REITs too, are expected to be up 22.7% year over year on 4.7% higher revenues.While the banking sector is already bustling with activity, we have a handful of REITs reporting earnings this week. Among these are Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) which are scheduled to release results on Apr 18, after the market closes.     Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry, so far, this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind this season.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Crown Castle International Corp.This Houston-based REIT, engaged in the operation of wireless communication towers in the United States, is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. The company’s portfolio of assets is expected to witness decent demand in the quarter to be reported. Also, leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions is likely to remain strong.Moreover, the company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. In 2017, it fortified its portfolio with the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U.S. markets. These markets have been experiencing high demand for network investment from the company’s customers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s site rental revenues for towers is currently pegged at $747 million for the first quarter, reflecting a projected increase of 0.8% sequentially. Site rental revenues for fiber are projected at $392 million, denoting an estimated jump of 26.5%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $1.31 billion, indicating year-over-year projected growth of 29.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.34, reflecting a rise of around 8.1%.However, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services might flare up volatility for Crown Castle’s revenues.Our proven model cannot conclusively predict if Crown Castle will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read more: Crown Castle to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Over the trailing four quarters, Crown Castle delivered an average positive surprise of 5.67% in terms of FFO per share. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteSL Green Realty Corp.The New York City's leading office landlord has been enhancing its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. In addition, its leasing activity is expected to remain decent amid improving economy and job market environment.Nonetheless, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate which curbs its pricing power. Furthermore, elevated supply of office space has been adding to its woes.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter net rental revenues is currently pegged at $262 million, reflecting a 1.1% decline from the previous-quarter figure. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment income is projected at $48.4 million, indicating 7.2% rise sequentially.Finally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $268.7 million, 4.5% lower than the prior-year quarter.  The FFO per share is projected at $1.65, reflecting a 5.1% improvement from the year-earlier quarter.In addition to the above, our quantitative model predicts that the chances of a positive surprise for SL Green are low.

217,SBAC,"Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results, after the closing bell on Apr 18.For this Houston-based REIT, which is engaged in operation of wireless communication towers in the United States, the bottom line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the previous quarter. Results were backed by 28.6% year-over year increase in site rental revenues that included organic growth, as well as contributions from acquisitions and other items.Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 5.67% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCrown Castle is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. The company’s portfolio of assets is expected to witness decent demand in the quarter to be reported and leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions is likely to remain strong.The company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. In 2017, the company fortified its portfolio with the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U.S. markets. These markets have been experiencing high demand for network investment by the company’s customers.For the first quarter of 2018, Crown Castle expects Site Rental revenues of $1,132-$1,142 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $1,138 million, denoting a projected increase of 8.3%, sequentially.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s site rental revenues for towers is currently pegged at $747 million for the first quarter, reflecting a projected increase of 0.8% sequentially. Site rental revenues for fiber are projected at $392 million, denoting an estimated surge of 26.5%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $1.31 billion, indicating year-over-year projected growth of 29.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.34, reflecting a rise of around 8.1%.In addition to the above, the deployment of 5G is expected to drive growth on both the company’s tower and small-cell assets. This is because the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things (IoT), and fixed wireless broadband.Remarkably, the IoT space is touted as the next big thing in the evolution of technology and higher investment by the wireless carriers. It is anticipated to boost the company’s revenues.However, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell-tower deployments and therefore is expected to impact Crown Castle’s top-line performance.Furthermore, customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s revenues. Evolution of new technologies might bring down the demand for site leases as well. Developments of satellite-delivered radio and video services will likely weigh on the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle’s revenues.Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $1.34 over the past 30 days.Crown Castle’s shares have inched up 0.3%, against the industry’s loss of 4.5% in the past three months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Crown Castle has an Earnings ESP of +0.00%.

218,SBAC,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks witnessed a roller-coaster ride as skepticism from fears of a murky trade war was replaced by euphoria surrounding a possible merger that could redefine the dynamics of the industry.The industry also witnessed one of the biggest IT projects ever undertaken in the country as commercial number portability services began in the Southeast with the remaining six regions joining the transition phase in the coming weeks. This involved moving 500 million phone numbers and more than 1 million transactions per day across 1,500 service providers from previous vendor Neustar to new vendor iconectiv, an U.S. subsidiary of Swedish telecommunications firm, Ericsson.Continuous deployment of dynamic and programmable optical network, which can support virtualization and cloud technologies associated with 5G technology gained momentum last week. In order to facilitate thorough research and testing of some big promises of 5G, including applications like VR/AR and autonomous vehicles, the National Science Foundation deployed two Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR).The two PAWR test beds at Salt Lake City, UT, and New York City will further provide hands-on practical training, offering job opportunities to potential employees and supporting overall U.S. economic vitality. This would help revolutionize the wireless ecosystem to maintain its leadership in the sector against its Chinese counterparts.Regarding company-specific news related to telecom, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, technology collaborations and acquisition-related discussions ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Augmenting its market position as a pioneer in the advertising business, Altice USA, Inc.

The new product aims at eliminating any dead zone for seamless Internet connectivity, irrespective of where the device is placed.To overcome common household hindrances like concrete, in-wall piping, appliances and mirrors that typically weakens the signal, Boost Wi-Fi will use a network of a maximum of five ‘boosters’ per household. These ‘boosters’ will seek to create additional hotspots to augment the signal where it is relatively weak, eliminating any location constraints for customers.

The company remains committed about its ViaSat-3 program for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), which is well underway and on track.Once launched, the ViaSat-3 is expected to be the world’s highest capacity communications satellite system.

By acquiring Nokia’s in-flight technology, Alphabet is likely to drive more customers to a faster alternative to facilitate the use of its other entertainment products like YouTube or Play Music.By divesting in-flight Internet technology, Nokia is likely to focus more on its 5G telecom equipment business.

(TMUS  -  Free Report), marking the latest effort to bring the United States’ fourth and third largest wireless carriers together. Their previous round of negotiations ended in November 2017, over valuation disagreements.  Upon successful completion of the deal, the combined company would have more than 127 million customers and might create more formidable competition for Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), the number one and number two players in the wireless industry respectively, amid a race to expand 5G offerings.Sprint is struggling with a long-term debt of more than $32 billion. The company’s majority owner, SoftBank Group Corp, a Japanese conglomerate holding company, is looking to trim the debt, which reached $147 billion at the end of December 2017. It is also planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year. Sprint and T-Mobile decided to resume talks partly because they want to share the financial burden of investing in their networks. The negotiations are, however, at an early stage. (Read more: Sprint Gains on Renewed Talks With T-Mobile & iPhone Offer)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major telecom stocks over the past week and during the last six months.In the last five trading days, Sprint was the major gainer with its share price rising 15.7% while SBA Communications Corporation (SBAC  -  Free Report) was the major loser, with its stock declining 3.6%.Over the past six months, Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) was the best performer with its stock appreciating 16.4%, while Sprint was the major decliner with shares falling 18.7%.Over the past six months, the Telecommunications Services industry underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index with an average loss of 2.1% against a gain of 3.6% for the latter.What’s Next in the Telecom Space?In addition to continued product launches and deployment of 5G technologies, all eyes will remain glued to the developments related to the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile.

219,SBAC,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks witnessed a sharp rise initially as China eased some foreign investment curbs but fell slightly thereafter to maintain a flat trajectory. The stocks regained the lost ground later in the week due to temporary relief to ZTE to resume some business activities.Amid the looming trade war tensions between the United States and China, the communist nation took a positive step toward easing the limits on foreign ownership in some of its closely guarded sectors. The proposed structural changes include a step-by-step increase in foreign ownership in sectors like finance, transportation, professional services and manufacturing of autos, ships and aircraft. China also published a revised ‘negative’ list for investment in free trade zones and promised to ease curbs in the telecommunications sector among others.The move was reciprocated to some extent by the U.S. administration when the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security offered partial respite to ZTE by authorizing it to resume some business activities from Jul 2 until Aug 1. This would allow China’s second biggest telecommunications equipment manufacturer to support existing networks or equipment under contracts signed on or before Apr 15 — the day on which its seven-year ban was imposed. Although ZTE’s fate post the deadline still remains clouded, it is expected to be in compliance with all the demands of the Trump government by the end of this month to evoke a suspension of the ban.      Regarding company-specific news portfolio restructuring, acquisitions and new investments for network expansion ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In less than three years after its launch with much fanfare in October 2015, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has decided to discontinue its mobile video app Go90 from August this year. The strategic decision is largely driven by a lackluster business response from the Millennials, who are the primary target segment for the app.With rich ad formats and appealing video content, Oath has emerged as the prime business division of Verizon in the mobile video market. Accordingly, the company has decided to pull the plug on Go90 on Jul 31 and return shows and content rights to its production partners. (Read more: Verizon to Discontinue Go90 Mobile Video App for Millennials)2.    In order to settle an investigation relating to two call outages in 2017 to emergency number 911, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) has decided to pay a fine of approximately $5.3 million to the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). The company has also pledged to take corrective actions to avoid recurrence of the incidents that have hurt its credibility.The outages pertain to two separate events, one in March 2017 that lasted about five hours and the other in May that lasted 47 minutes. While the first incident affected 12,600 unique users, the second affected 2,600, preventing them from making emergency calls to 911. (Read more: AT&T to Settle '911' Call Outages Investigation With FCC)3.    Adding pressure to the already strained relationship between the United States and China, the Trump administration has sought to block the entry of China Mobile Limited (CHL  -  Free Report) in the country, citing security concerns. China Mobile is reportedly the largest telecom carrier in the world with about 899 million subscribers.The long-pending application is proposed to be summarily rejected as China Mobile Communications Corp, a state-controlled firm, own almost 73% of China Mobile and would provide the Communist government undue access to the U.S. telecom market for economic espionage and intelligence collection. The company likely posed a U.S. security threat and law enforcement risk given its profound influence and control by the Government of China.

The merger takes Cincinnati Bell a step forward toward expanding its portfolio of next-generation fiber offerings and securing fiber density value for customers and shareholders.The combined entity is likely to be a stronger communications and technology company. The strategic move will boost innovation and build scale and fiber density across Cincinnati Bell’s footprint, enabling it to offer more competitive products and services, including continued expansion of Next Generation Fiber Network to customers across Hawai‘i. (Read more: Cincinnati Bell Completes Acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom)5.    TELUS Corporation (TU  -  Free Report) has announced that it is investing $110 million to connect more than 90% of homes and businesses in Richmond and Steveston, directly to its fibre optic network. The construction work is currently progressing well, with the company expecting to connect most of the homes and businesses throughout the region by spring of 2019.With a direct connection to the TELUS PureFibre network, customers will be able to enjoy the fastest symmetrical upload, download speeds and the most reliable network technology, making it the best network available in Richmond. Moreover, this new infrastructure is believed to be the backbone of TELUS’ wireless network as it allows more wireless capacity and faster speeds and lays the groundwork for 5G technologies. (Read more: TELUS Invests $110M for Fibre Optic Network in Richmond)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major telecom stocks over the past week and during the last six months.In the last five trading days, AT&T was the major gainer with its share price increasing 3.2%. SBA Communications Corporation (SBAC  -  Free Report) was the major decliner with its stock losing 0.9%.Over the last six months, Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) was the best performer with its stock appreciating 19.9% while Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) declined the most with its shares falling 19.8%.Over the last six months, the Zacks Telecommunications Services industry has underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 Index with an average fall of 10.1% compared with a decline of 1% for the latter.What’s Next in the Telecom Space?In addition to continued product launches and deployment of 5G technologies, all eyes will remain glued to the proposed $34 billion worth of U.S. tariffs on China set to be imposed by the weekend and the latter’s retaliation to it. Although China has vouched that it will not ‘fire the first shot’ in the impending trade war, it threatened to match the U.S. tariffs dollar by dollar, jeopardizing the global trade equilibrium in the aftermath.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

220,SBAC,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially but recovered steeply thereafter, only to partially lose ground later in the week due to the still looming trade war fears with China.The on-again off-again trade war between the United States and China continued to keep the stocks in hot water as both the warring nations vowed to impose tariffs and retaliatory tariffs on each other. The issue got even murkier as other European Union nations as well as allied countries like India and Canada decided to join in the fray and impose counter tariffs against the United States. The never-ending saga is likely to have no near-term solution as President Trump has threatened ‘reciprocity’ against trade partners who retaliate against it.Meanwhile, some U.S. lawmakers continued to stonewall China’s telecom firm Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. by urging Alphabet Inc.’s Google to reconsider its decision to maintain business relationship with it. Citing national security threats, they pleaded the telecom behemoth to sever ties with Huawei and protect the unlawful use of sensitive client data.        Regarding company-specific news, technology collaborations, acquisitions and new product launches ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Confirming industry grapevines, AT&T Inc.

222,SBAC,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially but gradually picked up pace as U.S.-China trade talks offered some hope of averting a trade war as the Trump administration reportedly gave the finishing touches on a deal with ZTE.Last week, as the ZTE settlement appeared to be on the horizon, another Chinese telecom firm Huawei filed its response to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in a strong rebuttal, denying allegations of being a U.S. security threat. Accusing FCC of being prejudiced due to the location of its domiciled headquarters, Huawei contested the decision of banning it from accessing the $8.5 billion Universal Service Fund (“USF”), which is a key source of funds for the rollout of 5G and gigabit broadband projects in the United States. The beleaguered firm also found support in industry trade group CTIA, which argued that the industry was equipped with effective security and design networks to be safe and reliable, and restricting the access to USF would only hinder competition and harm customers.Amid these conundrums, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”), a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, vouched its support for start-up firms to integrate blockchain technology into their systems. The agency also released a ‘notice of enquiry’ to solicit ideas relating to emerging technologies, cybersecurity and privacy, internet governance and information free-flow. The collated information is likely to be used as a guideline by NTIA’s international Internet policy to create regulations for various sectors.Regarding company-specific news, new business ventures, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, and technology collaborations ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    AT&T (T  -  Free Report) has ventured into the competitive video-gaming arena by collaborating with ESL, the largest esports powerhouse in the world, to stay connected with customers.AT&T will leverage its sports brand image to tap the huge revenue-generating potential of this emerging industry through brand promotions and on-site activations.

224,SBAC,"Windstream (WIN  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 22, before market open. Based in Arkansas, the company is a leading rural local exchange carrier in the United States.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.49 billion, reflecting year-over-year improvement of 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 39 cents per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 23.5%.Meanwhile, the company has a negative earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 57.0%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsWe appreciate Windstream’s focus on improving sales, cutting costs and pricing initiatives, which are expected to boost profitability and check churn. Meanwhile, the company is seeking diversification from legacy telecom services to more business, enterprise, and wholesale opportunities. To meet this end, Windstream has made a significant financial investment to upgrade the company’s network and product portfolio, including significant advances in software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) capabilities and a new Cloud Core architecture. Additionally, the acquisitions of EarthLink and Broadview have also played a major role in boosting the company’s SD-WAN and cloud suite.The launch of a multi-featured SD-WAN solution and its cloud-to-cloud disaster recovery management solutions should rake in considerable profits. Expansion of its metro fiber network business in newer areas and its aim to extend the deployment of G.fast technologies over traditional copper telephone wires bode well.The company announced SDN-enabled multi-vendor services partnerships with Ciena Corporation (CIEN  -  Free Report), Infinera Corporation (INFN  -  Free Report) and Coriant in the MEF17 Proof of Concept showcase. MEF17 focuses on advancing Third-Network connectivity and cloud services for the digital economy & the hyper-connected world.However, in the past three months, Windstream has not performed well.  The stock price has declined 35.5%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 5.3% in the said time frame. Moreover, Windstream has been losing access lines, thanks to pricing pressure and fierce competition. The company is under pressure due to losses in the wholesale business. Being a local exchange carrier, Windstream is exposed to stringent regulatory measures by the Federal Communications Commission as well as state regulations.Further, continuous investments in technology and network upgrades may dent the company’s earnings. Outdated network equipment has been the primary reason for discontinuation of the DSL (digital subscriber line) service in CLEC (competitive local exchange carrier) territories across 25 states.Despite management’s efforts to modify financial profile, we are concerned about Windstream’s highly leveraged balance sheet.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Windstream is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Windstream has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 39 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Windstream has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Windstream Holdings, Inc.

226,SBAC,"On Mar 5, we issued an updated research report on Crown Castle International (CCI  -  Free Report).Crown Castle is a leading wireless communication tower operator in the United States. It owns, operates and leases more than 40,000 cell towers and approximately 60,000 route miles of fiber supporting small cells and fiber solutions in every major U.S. market.Let’s have a look at what’s affecting the tower operator’s performance.UpsidesCrown Castle has been continuously trying to reposition itself from a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity), through the purchase of several fiber operators. Over the last two years, Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators: FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC (in January 2017), Quanta Fiber (called Sunesys, in April 2015) and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network (in September 2014). On Jun 26, 2017, the company gained ownership of more than 28,000 route miles of fiber with the purchase of privately-held Wilcon Holdings LLC. With the buyout of LTS Group Holdings LLC (Lightower) on Nov 1, 2017, Crown Castle attained ownership of more than 60,000 route miles of fiber. Crown Castle aims to leverage the fiber assets to serve two main business lines — small cell network deployments in top metro markets and other enterprise and adjacent wholesale opportunities.Meanwhile, wireless services are rapidly gaining ground based on technological advancements and network upgrades. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Crown Castle successfully addresses this opportunity as more than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers like Verizon, AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile US. The company has acquired 9,700 wireless towers from AT&T and taken over 7,200 wireless towers of T-Mobile US.The deployment of 5G network should also drive growth in the company’s tower and small cell assets as wireless carriers are trying to expand and improve networks. The industry has become a battleground for the 5G race. Notably, completion of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) first implementable 5G New radio (NR) specification has set the stage for the global mobile industry to initiate full-scale development of 5G NR for large-scale trials and commercial deployments in 2019.Dividend PayoutsDuring fourth-quarter 2017, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $427 million in aggregate or $1.05 per common share, up around 11% on a per share basis from the year-ago quarter.We are also impressed with Crown Castle’s board of directors’ decision to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per share, payable on Mar 30, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Mar 16, 2018. Notably, the company portrays an impressive record of dividend payouts.As investors prefer an income-generating stock, a high dividend-yielding one is obviously much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Hiked 2018 OutlookApart from the positives, Crown Castle’s bright outlook for 2018 is encouraging. The company expects Site Rental revenues in the range of $4,582-$4,627 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the $1,360-$1,405 million band. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between $3,049 million and $3,094 million. Interest expense (inclusive of amortization) is estimated in the $642-$687 million range. FFO is expected in the range of $1,965-$2,010 million. AFFO is estimated between $2,219 million and $2,264 million. Net income is anticipated between $511 million and $591 million.Positive Earnings SurpriseCrown Castle has a positive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, the average beat being 5.67%.Estimates Trend UpWe note that sales and earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Crown Castle have moved up for the first two quarters of 2018 as well as full-year 2018. Sales for first and second quarter of 2018 are estimated at $1.31 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, indicating year-over-year growth of 29% and 27.7%. For 2018, sales are projected at $5.34 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 22.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first and second-quarter 2018 EPS is pegged at $1.34 and $1.39, respectively, indicating year-over-year growth of 8.1% and 15.8%. For 2018, EPS is estimated at $5.54, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 14.2%.The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism on prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Shares of Crown Castle have lost 3.0% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.1%. DownturnsCrown Castle continues to compete against behemoths like American Tower (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications (SBAC  -  Free Report) in the global wireless tower market. Moreover, consolidation in the wireless industry has reduced demand for cell tower and is therefore expected to dent Crown Castle’s top line. Further, new technologies are reducing demand for site leases and are driving costs. High customer concentration is also a concern for the company.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

229,SBAC,"American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 27.The company’s bottom-line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAmerican Tower faces fierce competition in the global wireless tower market from large incumbents like Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).  The company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. At the end of third-quarter 2017, it had $799.47 million in cash and cash equivalents and around $18,581.4 million of outstanding long-term debt compared with $787.16 million and $18,294.7 million, respectively, at the end of December 2016. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation, which is needed to meet future debt obligations. Moreover, this may restrain the company from accessing the debt market and refinancing at suitable rates.Customer concentration is very high for American Tower and the top four customers account for nearly 65% of its quarterly revenues. The loss of any of these customers or consolidation    among them will have a significant material impact on the top line. Moreover, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may generate significant financial fluctuations for the company.Buoyed by such headwinds, American Tower’s shares have lost 5.6% in the last three months. However, the stock performance was better than the industry’s decline of 13.3%.Meanwhile, the company generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Additionally, it provides on-site maintenance and servicing of antennas, amplifiers, and base station equipment. Since moving equipment from one tower to another is cumbersome, carriers normally renew these contracts upon expiration. This generates a strong long-term lease up-cycle.The revenues generated from leasing and management of such networks is remarkable and over 95% is recurring in nature. Moreover, most of its towers are over 210 feet tall, consequently providing sufficient space for its customers to install transmission equipment. The company also owns 29% of the land under its towers in the United StatesIndia, EMEA and Latin American markets together have contributed nearly 50% of the organic core revenue growth. Meanwhile, total international revenues amounted to $751 million, up 13.6% year over year. Within this, revenues from Asia totaled $298 million, up 10.4% year over year. EMEA revenues grossed $155 million, up 18.3% year over year. Latin America revenues totaled $298 million, up 14.6% year over year. The company’s total revenues from international business are likely to outperform the U.S. revenues in the next three to seven years.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.15%%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Tower has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company has not witnessed any estimate revisions.American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise  American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise | American Tower Corporation (REIT) QuoteKey PickGetty Realty Corp.

230,SBAC,"AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) had a disappointing 2017. We believe that the U.S. telecom behemoth is currently facing several headwinds. However, the FirstNet Project may appear as a ray of hope for the company in 2018.Recently, AT&T and the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) together revealed that all the 50 states of the nation, as well as two U.S. territories and Washington D.C., have entered the FirstNet project, the first dedicated nationwide wireless network for first responders.Notably, in March 2017, AT&T was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. The network aims to cover all 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including rural communities and tribal lands in those states and territories.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network. AT&T has projected that this contract will create more than 10,000 jobs over the next two years.In October 2017, AT&T and FirstNet introduced a new developer programme focused on public safety innovation. The programme will supply applications to a new FirstNet app store. These apps will be utilized by first responders who will select appropriate solutions to work on the FirstNet network, which AT&T is set to build.The FirstNet project aims to convert every city in the United States as smart cities with state-of-the-art IoT (Internet-of-Things) opportunities. AT&T will deliver a portfolio of IoT devices by March 2018. These gadgets will be used by police, firefighters and other first responders to create monitoring and tracking systems.Importantly, AT&T plans to roll out next generation 5G wireless broadband (Internet) in a dozen U.S. cities by late 2018. It aims at becoming the first U.S. carrier to introduce 5G wireless Internet if the deadline is met. The company will connect FirstNet users to its telecom network assets, valued at more than $180 billion. This contract can be considered a necessary boost to the company’s profile.AT&T’s consortium to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government. Per the deal, AT&T will be able to use this highly valuable spectrum for both commercial and consumer purposes. This is why several industry researchers believe that the FirstNet project may come as a boon to cell tower operators such as American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).Price performance and Zacks Rank  In 2017, AT&T’s shares decreased 9.89%, worse than the industry’s decline of 8.14%. Notably, the benchmark S&P 500 index has gained a whopping 18.25% in the same time period. AT&T carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). General Dynamics also carries the same Zacks Rank.

232,SBAC,"U.S. telecom service providers Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) are collaborating over a cell tower deal. Although, they compete fiercely in the domestic wireless market, their partnership marks a new move in the lucrative wireless-tower industry.AT&T and Verizon have inked a joint deal with Tillman Infrastructure to build cell towers in the United States. Privately held, Tillman is the owner and operator of towers, small cells and smart cities infrastructures. Per the deal, Tillman will construct customized towers and lease it to Verizon and AT&T. Construction work of the towers will begin in the first quarter of 2018. Installation of equipment in the already completed sites will begin as soon as possible.Currently, both Verizon and AT&T carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.These new structures will add to the overall communications infrastructure in the country and will fulfill the availability of towers in newer locations. The build-outs will also help the wireless carriers relocate equipment from their current towers.The companies are focusing on technology innovation, with further investment in the updated software platforms to provide the best customer experience in their network.The MotiveThe partnership implies that the biggest U.S. wireless carriers are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure prices for towers. Moreover, carriers are always looking for alternative partners to reduce their dependence on specific customer base, thanks to the already saturated domestic wireless market.Domestic telcos are moving away from traditional tower leasing model, in order to cut down spending as data consumption continues to rise. Notably, these companies plan to create a diverse community of suppliers and tower operators, to maintain a healthy market competition.Additionally, AT&T and Verizon are striving to expand their network capacity in order to meet consumers’ demand for more cellular data. The companies are also reviewing their long-term contracts for renewal and trying to gain new vendor partners to diversify their infrastructure lineup.The ConsequencesThe U.S. cell tower market is currently dominated by three companies — American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report), SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report).Customer concentration is very high for these tower companies as they heavily depend on the top four wireless carriers — Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile US — for a major part of their quarterly revenues. The loss of any of these customers or consolidation will have a negative impact on the companies’ top line. Moreover, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable-TV operators may generate significant financial fluctuations for the company.In such a scenario, the joint venture move is sure to pose severe competitive threat to established tower companies.Price Performance Despite such positives, the wireless carriers portray a disappointing price performance. In the past month, shares of AT&T and Verizon have lost 4.9% and 10.9%, respectively, compared with the industry’s decline of 8.4%. Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

The merged entity will carry a value of more than $23 billion with 35% market share. The sale of assets is an initiative by the companies to sell their holdings, before the proposed merger.Deal ProspectsAs part of the deal, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular will receive service level and process efficiency benefits. ATC TIPL will secure certain preferential rights of new businesses on existing portfolio and sites acquired in certain Indian markets.American Tower is hopeful that the addition of these two high-quality portfolios will contribute to long-term leasing growth in India. The country’s leading mobile operators are presently focused on accelerating their 4G network deployments.American Tower is optimistic about the expansion of mobile broadband services in India, with participation in the Digital India initiative.Accordingly, the company generates more than 50% of the organic core revenue growth from its Indian, EMEA and Latin American markets.

We believe that geographic diversification will help the company reduce dependence on the highly-saturated wireless market.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

(CCI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell on Jan 24.While the company’s bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, it lagged the same in the remaining two quarters with an average beat of 2.53%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCrown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry may reduce demand for cell tower deployments and therefore is expected to have an adverse effect on Crown Castle’s top line.The merger between AT&T and Leap Wireless had a bearing on Crown Castle as it has 1,300 towers with both the carriers. Likewise, the combined entity of T-Mobile US and MetroPCS negatively impacted Crown Castle that had 1,400 towers jointly shared by these companies. Also, the merger between Sprint and Clearwire served as a hurdle for Crown Castle as both share 2,700 of its towers.Furthermore, customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle. Historically, the top four among its customers, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, accounted for majority of its total revenues, of which AT&T contributes a handful amount of site rental revenues. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s top line.Evolution of new technologies may reduce the demand for site leases as well. Developments of satellite-delivered radio and video services are likely to weigh on the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle’s revenues.On the flip side, Crown Castle’s continuous efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) looks impressive. Over the last two years, Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators - FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC (in January 2017), Quanta Fiber (called Sunesys, in April 2015) and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network (in September 2014).On Jun 26, 2017, Crown Castle International completed the acquisition of privately-held Wilcon Holdings LLC. Notably, Wilcon is the premier service provider of dark fiber, lit transport, Internet access and colocation services in Southern California. Currently, it owns 1,900 route miles of fiber in Los Angeles and San Diego. As a result, Crown Castle gained 28,000 route miles of fiber.On Nov 1, 2017, Crown Castle completed the buyout of LTS Group Holdings LLC (Lightower) from Berkshire Partners, Pamlico Capital and other investors for approximately $7.1 billion in cash (subject to certain limited adjustments). With this buyout, Crown Castle is anticipated to attain ownership over 60,000 route miles of fiber. These deals are expected to increase opportunities for small cell network deployments in top metro markets.Moreover, the deployment of 5G is expected to drive growth on both the company’s tower and small cell assets. This is because the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things (IoT), fixed wireless broadband.Markedly, IoT space is touted as the next big thing in the evolution of technology and higher investment by the wireless carriers. Going forward, it is anticipated to boost the company’s revenues.Buoyed by such tailwinds, Crown Castle’s shares have gained 5.17%, against the industry’s loss of 2.99% in the past three months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen.

237,SBAC,"SBA Communications Corporation (SBAC  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the United States, delivered a negative earnings surprise of 5.00%. Moreover, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 61.93%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why Do We Expect a Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that SBA Communications is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key elements.Zacks ESP: SBA Communications has an Earnings ESP of +12.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 28 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 25 cents. This is a significant indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: SBA Communications has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates.Meanwhile, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of the company’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SBA Communications Corporation QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?SBA Communications is poised to gain from rapid technological improvement in the telecommunication industry. The upcoming 5G wireless network standard is a major positive for wireless tower operators like SBA Communications. Based on its tower operations, the company is optimistic about the global growth of wireless business and thus anticipates international expansion. The company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers should drive top line and lend it a competitive edge.On the back of such tailwinds, the company’s shares have rallied 7.7% as against the industry’s decline of 1.5%.  On the flip side, we remain concerned about SBA Communications’ top line which is likely to get affected by high customer concentration and consolidated wireless industry. The company derives majority of its total quarterly revenues from four major domestic wireless carriers — Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS  -  Free Report). Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will lead to a significant material impact on the top line.Although the company’s operations in the United States and other territories boost its geographic expansion and revenues, it may jeopardize the bottom line. Notably, tower operations in emerging markets are not as profitable in the mature domestic market.Evolution of new technologies may reduce demand for site leases. In addition, frequent changes in demand for network services and infrastructure support will tend to increase volatility in SBA Communications’ revenues.A Closer View of Certain Important MetricsImprovement in revenues holds promise for SBA Communications’ segments. While the revenues for the Site Leasing segment is estimated around $408 million by the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the same for Site Development segment is anticipated at $23.79 million.In the third quarter of 2017, Domestic Site Leasing revenues are expected at $330 million and International Site Leasing revenues are projected at $77 million.Per estimates, the company has plans to construct 114 towers and purchase 211 towers in the to-be-reported quarter. The company will acquire 52 domestic sites and 106 international sites in the said quarter. The increase in the number of towers and sites to be purchased portrays an improvement in the company’s operations.Key PickHere is a company in the broader Computer and Technology sector — which houses SBA Communications — which has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Windstream Holdings Inc (WIN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +18.03% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

238,SBAC,"After a lukewarm first half of 2017, most of the major telecommunications stocks have done well in the third quarter. The new U.S. telecom regulatory body, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has given enough indications of its leniency compared with the Obama administration. The FCC is most likely to roll back a slew of stringent regulations of the previous regime. The FCC’s stance of being less restrictive will aid mergers and acquisitions, which are likely to spur growth in the rest of 2017.2 Major Future Drivers of Telecom IndustryUpcoming 5G Wireless Networks: According to a study commissioned by Qualcomm, fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology could result in real global economic growth by $3 trillion cumulatively from 2020 to 2035. A number of industry researchers are of the opinion that 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps (gigabit per second), which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network.Internet of Things (IoT): Internet of Things, which enables any physical electronic device with a valid IP-address to transfer data seamlessly over a wireless network, is fast gaining market traction and bringing about fundamental changes in business models. Next-generation superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In this context, IoT holds the potential of being the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.Additionally, a major characteristic of the telecommunications industry is that it is immune to international geo-political disturbances even when these lead to economic fluctuations. A growing economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecom industry in an otherwise tough environment.Performance So FarPer the latest Zacks Earnings Trend report, 87 S&P 500 members (accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total membership) have reported third-quarter earnings results as of Oct 20. Total earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the same period last year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating EPS estimates and 70.1% beating revenue estimates.The results thus far provide a positive and reassuring view of corporate earnings, which will most likely get strengthened and reconfirmed through the remainder of this reporting cycle. The above-average proportion of positive surprises that we saw in the preceding period has continued this earnings season as well. (Read: Three Takeaways from the Q3 Earnings Season)In the telecom sector, two major national telecom carriers, Verizon Communications and T-Mobile US, have reported strong results in third-quarter 2017. Both carriers have witnessed significant net addition of post-paid wireless subscribers with reduced churn rate.President Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. Major proposals like a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years, overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax burden and easy regulatory policies, are likely to spur higher consumer spending that may create about 25 million new jobs over a decade. This in turn will fuel long-term economic growth.How to Make a Selection?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings estimates could appear a difficult task, however, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for you. One way to narrow down the list of choices during the earnings season is to look at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our ChoicesRelying on the above methodology, we have zeroed in on seven telecom stocks that are likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this earnings season.Sonus Networks Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +16.28% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here. The company is scheduled to report results on Oct 30.

It has an average positive earnings surprise of 7.77% in the last four quarters and a long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 9.50%.Bottom LineChallenges in the form of competitive product introduction and cut-throat pricing pressure will persist in the telecom sector. However, a number of companies in the space have fared well. Picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, could lead investors to gain this earnings season.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The increase was primarily driven by a benefit of 6 cents per share owing to a pre-tax gain from the divestiture of its iDefense business and lower share count.Revenues marginally increased year over year to $288.6 million from $286.5 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $286.9 million as well. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by increase in domain name registrations in the U.S. as well as in international markets.Shares of VeriSign have gained 34% year to date, slightly underperforming the 39.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Quarter DetailsIn the quarter, domain name registrations for .com and .net together grew 0.8% year over year to 144.3 million. In absolute terms, domain name registrations grew 0.68 million year over year. VeriSign processed 9.2 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net, an increase from 8.6 million processed in the year-ago quarter.For the reported quarter, the exact renewal rate figures will be available after 45 days from Jun 30, 2017. The company estimates it to be 73.9% compared with 73.8% in the year-ago quarter. It provided renewal rate for the first quarter of 2017, which came in at 72.5% compared with 74.4% in the year-ago quarter.MarginsVeriSign reported non-GAAP operating income of $188.3 million compared with $187.4 million in the prior-year quarter.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise VeriSign, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteOther Financial DetailsExiting the quarter, the company’s cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) were approximately $1.81 billion compared with $1.79 billion as of Mar 31, 2016.Operating cash flow in the quarter was approximately $181 million while free cash flow came in at $171 million. Moreover, during the first half of 2017, the company generated $328.9 million of cash flow from operational activities.VeriSign repurchased 1.7 million shares for $150.5 million in the quarter and 3.5 million shares for $300.5 million during the first half of 2017. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had $770 million available under its current share repurchase program.GuidanceBuoyed by the encouraging second-quarter results, VeriSign raised its full-year revenue and capital expenditure guidance. The company now expects revenues in the range of $1.155-$1.165 billion (mid-point $1.16 billion), up from the prior guidance of $1.145-$1.160 billion (mid-point $1.153 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is $1.16 billion.Capital expenditure is now anticipated to increase in the range of $40-$50 million compared with the previous guidance of $35-$45 million.The company reaffirmed its earlier non-GAAP operating margin guidance range of 64.5% to 65.25%.VeriSign also raised its domain name base growth rate guidance for 2017. The company now anticipates the same to grow between 2% and 2.75%, up from its earlier forecast of 1% to 2.5%.Going ahead, for the third quarter, VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase in the range of 0.8 million to 1.3 million.Furthermore, the company announced a new agreement with ICANN under which the annual fee for a .net domain name registration will be increased from $8.20 to $9.02, effective Feb. 1, 2018. However, the other terms of the agreement remained unchanged.Our TakeVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names will continue to drive VeriSign’s top line. Also, we believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results. The company continues to benefit from strong demand in the U.S. as well as in the international markets.Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market. VeriSign also has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space. Strong demand for VeriSign’s cyber security products, following ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya is also a key growth driver. Also an increase in annual fee for a .net domain name registration will drive the company’s top-line results from next year onward.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider VeriSign carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector includeSBA Communications (SBAC  -  Free Report), Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report) and IPG Photonics (IPGP  -  Free Report).

Next-generation 4G LTE, 5G networks and increased usage of smartphones and tablets are driving demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s investments in Asia are paying off. Further, the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers will drive the top line.American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of organic core revenue growth. Toward this end, American Tower is enhancing prospects in India with the acquisition of tower businesses from Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. Vodafone India is the subsidiary of U.K.-based Vodafone Group plc (VOD  -  Free Report).Notably, America Tower’s majority owned subsidiary in India — ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (ATC TIPL, formerly Viom) — plans to add 20,000 communications sites. Per the deal, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular will receive service level and process efficiency benefits. ATC TIPL will secure certain preferential rights of new businesses on existing portfolio and sites acquired in certain Indian markets. The transactions are expected to generate approximately $320 million in property revenues and $120 million in gross margin within a year for American Tower. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals from respective authorities.American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 66 cents per share of the company’s common stock look impressive. The distribution was paid on Oct 17 to stockholders of record at the close of business as of Sep 29.Raised GuidanceFor 2017, American Tower has raised outlook.  The company anticipates property revenues in the range of $6,510-$6,580 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 14.6%. Net income is expected between $1,340 million and $1,380 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 40.2%. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the range of $4,070-$4,110 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 15.1%. Consolidated AFFO is expected in the range of $2,870-$2,910 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 16.0%.Estimates Trending UpWe note that the sales and earnings per share (EPS) estimate for American Tower has moved up for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018.Sales growth for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018 are estimated to increase 9.9% and 8.8%, respectively. For 2018, sales are expected to rise 7.9%.The EPS growth for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018 is estimated to increase 257.7% and 172.8%, respectively. For full-year 2018, EPS is expected to soar 12.9%.Positive Earnings SurpriseAmerican Tower delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.59% in the last reported quarter. Moreover, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, with an average of 3.94%.Despite such positives, the company faces headwinds.The company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. At the end of the third-quarter 2017, the company had $799.47 million in cash and cash equivalents and around $18,581.4 million of outstanding long-term debt compared with $787.16 million and $18,294.7 million, respectively, at the end of Dec 2016. Such high debt levels may impede cash flow generation, which is required to meet future debt obligations. Moreover, this may keep the company from accessing debt market and refinancing at suitable rates.High customer concentration is likely to affect the company’s top line. Expansion in global market increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Stiff competition, integration risks and rising operating expenses are other headwinds. Additionally, the company’s upcoming results face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Also, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp (SBAC  -  Free Report).We believe that such headwinds have led to the company’s disappointing price performance. Over the past three months, the stock has lost 4.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.7%. ConclusionIn view of the above write-up, we advise investors to wait for a better entry point before accumulating shares.

241,SBAC,"Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 31, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings per share. Notably, Harris Corporation has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of approximately 3%.The scenario appears to be rosy for Harris Corporation in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as well. Its strong product portfolio is likely to boost results. In fact, the positive sentiment surrounding this Melbourne, FL- based company ahead of its earnings release can be gauged from the fact that the stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first-quarter earnings being revised 1.5% upward over the last 60 days.Also, the stock has moved north in the last six months outperforming the Zacks Wireless- Equipment industry in the period. Shares of Harris rallied 21.4%, as against the industry’s loss of 3%. The possibility of greater military spending by the United States, owing to tensions with North Korea has boosted the stock.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on Harris Corporation’s fiscal first-quarter results.We expect the company’s Communication Systems unit to perform well in the to-be-reported quarter. Increased sales of legacy international tactical radios and operational efficiencies should buoy segmental results.The Electronic Systems unit is also anticipated to perform well driven by the strength in strength in electronic warfare, among others.  Of late, the company has also won multiple contracts, which is likely to boost the top line further in the quarter.Additionally, Harris Corporation announced a 8% dividend hike in the fiscal first quarter. We believe that the dividend hike not only indicates the company's commitment to create value for shareholders but also underlines its confidence regarding growth.Markedly, the company’s efforts to reduce its debt levels also raise optimism in the stock. We expect an update on the issue on the fiscal first-quarter conference call.On the flip side, the company’s Space and Intelligence Systems unit is anticipated to perform poorly in the quarter. Lower revenues from environmental and space programs might weigh on the segmental results as well.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too shows that Harris Corporation is likely to beat earnings in the soon-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Harris Corporation has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a penny above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Harris Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHarris Corporation is not the only company in the broader Computer and Technology sector that islooking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the same space, which according to our model also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:AMTEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.18% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. The company will report third-quarter earnings numbers on Nov 2.Arrow Electronics, Inc. (ARW  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.05% and holds a Zacks Rank #2. The company will also report third-quarter earnings numbers on Nov 2.

244,SBAC,"U.S. national wireless carrier, Sprint Corporation (S  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 financial numbers on Aug 1, before market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 75%. Moreover, the company’s earnings failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 14.29%.The price performance of Sprint was not quite impressive over the past three months. The stock lost 5.3% whereas the industry declined 6.7% over the same time frame.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at Play                                                                       The U.S. wireless industry has become intensely competitive because of the presence of spectrum crunch, the growing popularity of iPhone and Android smartphones as well as threats from online mobile video streaming, cloud computing and video conferencing services.As the U.S. boasts a high rate (95%) of wireless penetration, competition in this space is intense, with participants like Verizon Communications, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report). This, in turn, may pressurize Sprint’s top and bottom lines.Sprint has been continually making efforts to lure customers from rival carriers by offering attractive promotional plans and lucrative discounts. The marketing costs of such promotions raises concern by causing high cash burn and heavy losses for the company and may even impede margins in the coming quarters.Moreover, the company has a debt-laden balance sheet and has been witnessing losses each year since 2007.However, Sprint is on track with its network modernization and integration efforts, which should fortify its position in the wireless industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Sprint is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Sprint has an Earnings ESP of -200%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 3 cents, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of a penny. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Sprinthas a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s -200% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Sprint Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sprint Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sprint Corporation QuoteWe caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Key PickSBA Communications Corporation (SBAC  -  Free Report) from the broader sector has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat when it expectedly reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 31.

245,SBAC,"Telecom service provider stocks have not performed well in the second quarter of 2017.  The industry has declined 3.09%, underperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 16.53%. Several near-term headwinds continue to persist. The chief ones include growing price competition for wireless services, which are likely to reduce carriers' revenue growth in 2017. Leading cable MSOs (multi service operators) have decided to enter the wireless field in 2017. This is likely to intensify competition in an already saturated market. Furthermore, capital spending by the U.S. telecom carriers may be muted in 2017.On the positive side, the new U.S. telecom regulatory body – Federal Communications Commission (FCC) – has given enough indications that it will be less stringent compared with the Obama administration. It is also likely to roll back several stringent regulations of the previous regime. The lesser restrictive nature of the FCC will aid mergers and acquisitions, which are likely to spur growth in 2017.Performance So FarPer the latest Zacks Earnings Preview report, 128 S&P 500 members (accounting for 36.1% of the index’s total membership) have reported second-quarter earnings results as of Jul 25. Total earnings for these companies are up 7% from the same period last year on 4.2% higher revenues, with 77.3% beating EPS estimates and 70.3% beating revenue estimates.The above mentioned figures indicate that the growth pace is likely to be lower-than what we had seen in the first quarter, but will mostly be in-line with the four-quarter average. It also presents a notable improvement over the last 12-quarter average. Total second-quarter earnings are expected to be up 8.6% from the same period last year on 4.7% higher revenues. This would follow 13.3% earnings growth in the first-quarter 2017 on 7.0% rise in revenues, the highest growth pace in almost two years.How to Make the Right Pick?Given the large number of industry participants, selecting stocks that have the potential to beat estimates appears to be a daunting task. Nonetheless, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple.One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology to determine which stocks have the best chance to surprise in their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. Earnings beat boosts investor’s confidence in the stock, which is reflected in its rapid price appreciation. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our choicesWith the aid of the above methodology, we have zeroed in on three telecom stocks that are likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this earnings season.SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.00% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.  The company is scheduled to report results on Jul, 31.

It has an average positive earnings surprise of a massive 83.30% in the last four quarters and a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.Comcast Corp.

It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.11% in the last four quarters and a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.1%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

247,SBAC,"The U.S. telecom industry continues to witness intense pricing competition as success depends largely on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition.Nevertheless, one sub-segment of the telecom industry, wireless tower operators, has had a strong showing in the last one year. We believe there are several reasons for this dream run to continue in 2018. We will discuss the reasons in short.Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In September 2017, Moody's Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for U.S. wireless carriers. In this context, Internet-of-Things (IoT) holds the potential of becoming the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.Massive Spectrum Deployment by CarriersWireless networks will be key to the future growth of the overall telecom industry. As wireless networks run on radio frequency, spectrums (airwaves) have become the most sought-after commodity in the industry. T-Mobile US has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low-band airwaves. In 2018, AT&T will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low-band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project.Furthermore, AT&T will also install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August 2017, Verizon announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network.Additionally, major U.S. telecom operators are currently exploring ways to commercialize usage of 3.5 GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum. Notably, the 3.5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard, thus increasing its chances of providing spectrum globally.The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) at its next open meeting on Nov 16 will discuss on the proposal of making available 1,700 MHz of high-frequency spectrum for flexible terrestrial wireless use and providing 4 GHz for core satellite use. Entry of New Players in the Wireless SpaceThe U.S. wireless industry is likely to become get competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators) in this space. Comcast has already entered this field with its Xfinity Mobile offering. At present the company is using its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon to use the latter’s wireless network coupled with its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Importantly, the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.Charter Communications has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year. Similar to Comcast, the company also has an MVNO agreement with Verizon as well as its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Charter Communications has also launched experimental field trials of the 5G wireless network.These trials come on the back of spectrum test licenses granted to the company by the FCC. The company is actively testing licensed small-cell technologies and has petitioned the FCC to release 3.5 GHz spectrum, popularly known as the CBRS band, for both licensed and unlicensed use.DISH Network, the second largest satellite TV operator, has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands which will be utilized to deploy 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U.S. markets. DISH Network’s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal-making to enter the wireless industry. At the same time, Ergen also stated that DISH Network has a clear plan to build a wireless network on its own.Strong Business ModelWireless services are advancing fast in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Tower operators effectively address this opportunity as over 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless carriers. Tower operators generally have long-term (typically five - ten year) tower lease agreements with the U.S. national carriers.Moreover, wireless consumer demand is expected to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, social networking and streaming of video.Recent trend of tower operators diversifying as fiber providers (focused on the small cell opportunity) looks impressive. Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super-fast wireless networks such as 4G and 5G. Dark fiber based wireless backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management. This will eventually lead the company to significantly reduce its backhaul costs.Our ChoiceWe believe all three wireless tower operators, American Tower, Crown Castle and SBA Communications will maintain their ongoing momentum in 2018. Currently all the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Tower Corp.

248,SBAC,"The third-quarter 2017 earnings seasons is picking pace with results from 229 S&P 500 members, accounting for 48.1% of the index’s total market capitalization (based on our latest Earnings Outlook). Total earnings for these companies are up 7.7% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues, with 75.5% beating EPS and 65.1% beating revenue estimates.Notably, 271 companies are yet to release their quarterly numbers. Total third-quarter earnings are expected to be up 4.1% from the prior-year quarter on 5.2% higher revenues.With this overview of the third-quarter 2017 earnings season, let’s look at the ongoing trends in the telecommunications industry. So far, we have results from four major telecommunication companies — Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report), Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS  -  Free Report).Verizon and Sprint delivered mixed third-quarter financial results, with a massive gain of postpaid and prepaid wireless subscribers. T-Mobile US delivered strong third-quarter 2017 financial results with 1.329 million net customer addition, signifying the 18th successive quarter of over 1 million net customer additions. We believe that the company’s network modernization and integration efforts, unlimited data plans, promotional offers in both postpaid and prepaid plans have paid off in terms of the huge subscriber gain in the reported quarter.However, AT&T posted weak third-quarter 2017 financial results with 44.8% year-over-year fall in the net gain of postpaid wireless subscribers. The company also lost 89,000 video customers in the reported quarter due to cord-cutting.We appreciate the companies’ success in maintaining their subscriber gain momentum despite operating in a competitive and saturated domestic wireless market. But, we are concerned about the increasing competition from the online video streaming service providers, which have become a direct threat to the pay-TV businesses of these stocks.With such mixed thoughts, we keenly await results from other telecommunication stocks on Oct 30. We will study the fundamentals (both financial and non-financial metrics) of these stocks to aid investment decision.Stocks to Watch for Q3 Earnings on Oct 30Our quantitative model offers some insight into stocks that are about to report their earnings. Per the model, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to deliver earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Meanwhile, we also caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Investors interested in the telecommunication stocks can watch out for the three companies that are expected to report their third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 30.SBA Communications (SBAC  -  Free Report), a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the United States, is slated to report after the closing bell.Improvement in revenues holds promise for SBA Communications’ segments. While revenues for the Site Leasing segment is estimated around $408 million by the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the same for Site Development segment is anticipated at $23.79 million. In the third quarter of 2017, Domestic Site Leasing revenues are expected at $330 million and International Site Leasing revenues are projected at $77 million.Per estimates, the company has plans to construct 114 towers and purchase 211 towers in the to-be-reported quarter. The company will acquire 52 domestic sites and 106 international sites in the said quarter. The increase in the number of towers and sites to be purchased portrays an improvement in the company’s operations.Moreover, the chances of this company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter under review are high. The company has an Earnings ESP of +12.00% (as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 28 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents). A favorable Earnings ESP indicates a positive earnings surprise. Moreover, SBA Communications currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, a positive Earnings ESP along with a Zacks Rank #3, makes us confident of an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter (read more: Can SBA Communications Deliver a Beat in Q3 Earnings?)CenturyLink Inc.’s (CTL  -  Free Report) Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Business Segment - Data Integration revenues is pegged at $145 million, which is above $123 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. The same for Legacy Services revenues is pegged at $1,087 million, below the figure of $1,107 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Strategic Services revenues are pegged at $972 million which is also below the $985 million reported in second-quarter 2017.Under the Consumer segment, the Legacy Services revenues are pegged at $623 million, below the figure of $633 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Strategic Services revenues are at $769 million compared with the $768 million reported in second-quarter 2017.This leading U.S. regional wireline service provider displays a negative earnings surprise history, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 2.44%. Moreover, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 45 cents.Despite a favorable Zacks Rank #3, the company’s 0.00% ESP dims the possibility of an earnings beat in the to-be reported quarter.For Level 3 Communications Inc. , improvement in revenues from different regions marks a major positive in terms of geographic expansion. The company’s North America, EMEA and Latin American operations account for a major portion of its organic core revenue growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will generate $147 million from the Enterprise segment and $35.75 million from the Wholesale segment of Latin America.Meanwhile, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) revenues are estimated at $176 million, with $108 million from the Wholesale channel, $13.95 million from the U.K. Government channel and $55 million from the Wholesale channel. Estimated revenues from Latin America and EMEA have been consistent with what was reported in the last quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter North American Enterprise segment revenues is pegged at $1,210 million as against $1,192 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. The same for the Wholesale segment is at $405 million compared with $415 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.In the last quarter, Level 3 Communications delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.53%. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 6.86%.Despite such favorable revenue growth, positive earnings surprise history and a favorable Zacks Rank #3, the chances of this company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are low. This is because the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP (as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 38 cents) acts as a spoiler.All the above-mentioned telecommunications stocks are grouped under the broader Computer and Technology sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).Irrespective of an earnings beat or miss, investors should focus on companies’ fundamentals to make investment decisions. Therefore, don’t forget to check our full write up on earnings releases of these stocks later.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.
