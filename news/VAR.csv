2,VAR,"Rare market gyrations keep cropping up, presenting a challenge to the risk models at financial institutions.From Italian debt to emerging-market currencies, extreme market moves are taking hold, raising the prospect of forced selling as portfolios adjust to maintain a steady level of risk.It's a potential wake-up call for traders lulled by the successive record lows seen across volatility gauges in 2017, and threatens to crimp risk-adjusted returns in unhedged portfolios.""Things are changing,"" said Victor Haghani, founder and chief executive of Elm Partners Management and a founding partner of Long-Term Capital Management. ""Vigilance is important here. This is a big move in Italy, and big moves in isolated emerging markets.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe probability measures used from investment banks to algorithmic firms are more complicated than simple deviation calculations. But traditional value-at-risk (or VaR) models — which provide a rough measure of expected losses in a given day — help illustrate the extent to which an investor can be caught off-guard.Take the surge in yields on two-year Italian bonds to 2.8% from 0.9% on Tuesday. Spurred by Rome's political upheaval, to say the move fell on the fringes of the asset's normal distribution curve would be an understatement — it was unprecedented.That kind of gyration tests the outer edges of risk-management parameters. Using a historical simulation, the London-listed iShares Italy Government Bond ETF has a VaR of 0.5% within a 95% confidence. In English, that means losses are unlikely to be greater than 0.5% on any given day. On Tuesday, it dropped 4.9%.Meanwhile, developing markets have delivered more than their share of unlikely swings. The Turkish lira's 2.9% surge on Monday was more than three standard deviations outside the one-year average daily move, for example.As investment in developing-nation assets has increased in the past few years, so has the likelihood of a VaR shock for overseas investors, according to analysts at Nomura Holdings.""While the probability of such a shock remains low, it's important to consider the extent to which positioning and foreign ownership in some of these markets has grown substantially,"" said David Wagner, a strategist at the firm. ""Our most recent estimates for both FX and geographical real money allocations in Mexico and Brazil reflect high, and growing, exposures.""The Brazilian real slumped 2.2% on Monday — almost three standard deviations from the norm.And it's not only peripheral European debt and volatile emerging currencies toying with risk models. Equity market declines also looked extreme on Tuesday. Amid European political tumult, Italy's benchmark stock gauge fell 2.7%, while Spain's main index dropped 2.5%.Both moves were nearly three standard deviations outside of the one-year average.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Best Bond Funds Win 2018 Awards Using Riskier StylesWant To Invest In Bonds Issued By S&P 500's Apple, Others?How Investors Can Play High-Yield Sector Led By 3 Dow Stocks

14,VAR,"Cloud platform vendor VMware (VMW) saw its shares climb to a 17-month high Friday, after the company late Thursday posted Q4 earnings that comfortably beat on the top and bottom lines — boosted by a product that won't come out until at least the summer.VMware, majority owned by Dell, in October announced a partnership with Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, the No. 1 provider of cloud services infrastructure. VMware On AWS is slated for release later this year, but the anticipation of its release is already helping, says VMware executives and analysts alike.The AWS partnership ""assures customers we will remain leaders"" in the shift to the public cloud, VMware COO Sanjay Poonen told IBD in a phone interview Friday.In the public cloud, companies and enterprises are putting most of their operations into data centers not on-site but in the data centers of cloud services providers led by, in order, AWS, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, Alphabet's (GOOGL) and IBM (IBM).IBD'S TAKE: VMware was trading in above average volume Friday following its earnings, but it didn't make IBD's Stocks on the Move, the place to go to find top stocks being bought, or sold, in especially heavy volume.As the No. 1 maker of virtualization software, which lets servers run multiple operating systems and thus increases flexibility and lowers costs, VMware is a longtime leader in private cloud computing. But its focus has quickly shifted to helping companies with their hybrid — public and private — cloud computing environments.VMware also has a hybrid cloud partnership with IBM. ""We had nothing and now we have major partnerships with Nos. 1 and 4 (in public cloud services), and likely will be doing more with Nos. 2 and 3 in due course,"" Poonen said.VMware does have smaller partnerships with Microsoft and Google, companies that at times can also be rivals. But in the era of ""co-opetition"" it's seldom a ""case of black-and-white"" in looking at rivals and potential rivals, says the COO, who joined VMware in 2013. ""Almost all the (big tech companies) are potential partners,"" he said.Microsoft is a good example of a frenemy relationship, he says. VMware has security products and more for Microsoft's Office 365 software as a service. ""We have a very good partnership,"" Poonen saidThe world is moving to the public cloud, he said, and points out VMware has been building its portfolio of public cloud-focused products. But he says bigger companies, VMware's main customers, might not complete the transition for another decade, assuming they do move all operations to the public cloud.Analysts are bullish on the AWS partnership.""Consistent with our recent VAR(value added reseller) survey, the AWS partnership has prompted customers to view VMware in a more strategic light when it comes to public/hybrid cloud capabilities, which according to management has already been an accelerant to VMware's business even though the VMware Cloud on AWS service does not go live until the summer,"" Jason Ader, an analyst for William Blair, said in his research report, maintaining an outperform rating on the stock.""The strategic alliance with AWS has been a major catalyst in terms of customer perception, and ... it is already paying dividends in the form of a strengthening near-term business,"" Ader wrote.At least five investment banks hiked their price targets on VMware stock following the earnings report, which included a slight beat in Q1 sales guidance and slight miss on EPS guidance. And the company announced a $1.2 billion share buyback program, added to its ongoing $500 million buyback program.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Ben McFadden maintained a sector weight, or neutral, rating on VMware stock, but he said the share buybacks were a big plus. He also wrote, in a research note, that ""improved results have brought optimism back into the story."" But he also said ""we look for a sign of inflection in results or successful data points around the AWS partnership before becoming more positive on shares.""VMware stock ended Friday trading up 3.5% to 87.16 on the stock market today, and shares have doubled in the past 52 weeks. It sports a solid IBD Relative Strength Rating, meaning the stock has been among the top 15% in performance over the past year, with an emphasis on the most recent six months.VMware also is changing its fiscal year, which in 2016 coincided with the calendar year. Its new year's, fiscal 2018, ends Feb. 2, 2018. Its guidance is for the year that ends on that date. In May, besides reporting its fiscal Q1 results, it will separately report results for what it calls the current ""stub"" period of Jan. 1-Feb. 4.RELATED:Roundup Of Late-Thursday EarningsCould Microsoft Join Cisco In Hunt For Security Firms

16,VAR,"Varian Medical Systems (VAR) got a mostly favorable reception from Wall Street Tuesday after it announced late Monday that it's spinning off its imaging-components business into a separate company.Varian said that it will complete the spinoff by year's end through a tax-free distribution that will turn the imaging unit into a stand-alone company. The business is ""fundamentally different"" from Varian's core business in radiation oncology, Varian CEO Dow Wilson said in a statement, so the two will be better off apart. Varian said that it will incur $35 million in charges but financial guidance for this year is otherwise unchanged.Varian's management said the spinoff will bring $20 million in ""dis-synergies"" for the remaining company, mostly through increased general and administrative expenses, but that after a couple of years this should be offset by a combination of cost-cutting and service agreements between the two companies.RBC Capital Markets analyst Brandon Henry gave a thumb's up and raised his price target on Varian stock to 88 from 85, while affirming a sector-perform rating.""Varian's Imaging Components business has weighed on the company's topline growth for the last five quarters,"" Henry wrote in a research note, citing slowing customer demand along with competitive and pricing pressures. ""However, we expect Imaging Components to return to low-single-digit year-over-year growth in fiscal year 2017.""Varian's revenue growth has been stuck in single digits for the last four years, and in the most recent quarter was flat. Henry sees the spinoff as an opportunity for the remaining company to broaden its reach in the cancer market.""We do not expect any transformational M&A, as management likes to keep a relatively conservative balance sheet,"" he wrote. ""However, we expect slightly more topline growth going forward to be from tuck-in M&A than in the past.""Varian stock finished trading up a fraction to 83.37 on the stock market today. The stock holds a decent IBD Composite Rating of 76, helped partly by being in the highest-ranked of all the medical groups, Systems & Equipment, which currently stands at No. 19 in IBD's ranking of 197 industry groups. Top stocks in the group include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Masimo (MASI) and Cantel Medical (CMN).

Perhaps never is that more true than when a fundamentally healthy stock forms a base-on-base pattern. Base-on-base patterns take a large number of forms. Most commonly, a stock will climb out of a cup or a flat base, advance less than 20% — often much less — then stall and build another cup or flat base.The result often sends investors looking elsewhere, forgetting about the stock until it roars past the base-on-base buy point and moves on to new highs.Take TwoIn ""How to Make Money In Stocks,"" IBD founder William O'Neil says base-on-base patterns often form near the end of bear markets, when a top stock is fighting a negative trend in the overall market.When the market turns and launches a follow-through day , stocks in base-on-base patterns are often the first to emerge.""It's like a spring that's being held down by the pressure of a heavy object,"" O'Neil wrote.A textbook base-on-base pattern forms with the low point in the second base above or just even with the high point in the lower base.

40,VAR,"Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2018 results are scheduled for release on Jul 24, after market close. The company’s acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth by expanding product offerings across all segments.We expect the company to witness steady growth in sales from Orthopaedic Implant — one of its major revenue-generating components. While this is projected to drive second-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments, especially MedSurg, will help the company drive impressive results.Notably, in the last reported quarter, Stryker posted earnings of $1.68, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5%.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.32 billion, reflecting a rise of 10.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at $1.73, indicating a year-over-year increase of 13.1%.Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Stryker Corporation QuoteOrthopaedic Implant in FocusOrthopaedic Implant contributed 37.7% to net revenues in the last reported quarter. In the last reported quarter, revenues at the segment were up 5% organically. The upside can be attributed to a significant year-over-year increase in Mako robot installations. The coveted Mako platform also recorded strong performances in Japan, South Pacific and Canada. Globally, Stryker installed 28 Mako robots, of which 24 were in the United States.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orthopaedic Implant for the quarter to be reported is at $1.23 billion, reflecting a rise of 8.1% year over year.Other Factors at PlayMedSurg Unit to Drive GrowthMedSurg Equipment products include surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.In the last reported quarter, the segment accounted for 44.1% of the company’s net sales. Revenues in the segment grew 9.1% at constant currency (cc) to $1.43 billion.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MedSurg equipment revenues is pegged at $1.48 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.4%.Domestic & International RevenuesStryker is well balanced on its high domestic and international revenues.In the last reported quarter, domestic revenues accounted for a significant 71.3% of net sales. Meanwhile, international sales accounted for 28.6% of total revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stryker’s domestic sales is pinned at $2.39 billion, up 8.7% year over year. The same for international revenues stands at $920 million, up 13.4% year over year.AcquisitionsStryker completed the buyout of Entellus Medical for $662 million. Entellus is integrated within Stryker’s core Neurotechnology & Spine segment. This will enable physicians to conveniently perform a broad range of ENT procedures. However, the acquisition is expected be dilutive initially to Stryker’s 2018 adjusted earnings per share by approximately 4 cents. This is likely to affect the top line in the quarter to be reported. (Read More: Stryker Closes Entellus Buyout, Bolsters Neurotechnology Line)Stryker was lately in news for making an offer to take over Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report). However, no further terms of the deal have been revealed by Stryker. Stryker also signed an agreement to acquire SafeAir AG, a Swiss medical device company recently.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

41,VAR,"With a market capitalization of approximately $10.61 billion, Varian Medical Systems Inc (VAR  -  Free Report) has been riding high on revenue opportunity from the growing adoption of Proton Therapy and strong overseas presence in emerging countries.However, cutthroat competition in the niche spaceis a major headwind.For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $2.85 million, reflecting an increase of 0.9% year over year. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $4.48 per share, showing an increase of 24.4% year over year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a quick look at the major factors that have been plaguing Varian Medicaland discuss the prospects that ensure near-term recovery.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteFactors Plaguing Varian MedicalIntensifying competition is expected to increase R&D expenditures in the growing proton therapy market, which will keep margins under pressure.Further, Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies along withsmaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers.Thus, cutthroat competition in the niche space is likely to raise the company’s expenditure in the near term. The oncology business in North America is witnessing a drop in capital expenditure on account of uncertainty emanating from health care reform and anticipated changes in reimbursement.Although international sales, as percentage of revenues,areincreasing, higher demand for lower-margin products from China, India and Brazil is expected to keep margins under pressure over the next several quarters.Why Should You Hold The Stock?Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe proton therapy also holds significant promise for Varian Medical. Proton therapy falls under the Particle Therapy business.Recently, the company announced the installation of a Varian Medical ProBeam cyclotron at the proton beam therapy center at University College Hospitals London NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) in London, England. The cyclotron is a core piece of equipment of the ProBeam proton therapy system. Its installation is a key milestone for every new proton therapy center.Varian Medical’s ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors, thereby causing lesser side-effects to surrounding tissues. Proton therapy system hasthe same interface used in theTrueBeam platform.Recently, Varian Medical has upgraded its ProBeam system software to ProBeam version 2.5 to enhance workflow at the site and provide better images generated by the system's integrated imager. The upgraded product will drive the company’s market share going forward.In Mar 2018, Varian Medical announced the first patient treatment at the St. Petersburg Proton Therapy Center in Russia, an important step in expanding access to proton therapy around the world.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the current quarter.

43,VAR,"Wright Medical Group N.V. (WMGI  -  Free Report) recently announced the premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA for its AUGMENT Injectable Bone Graft platform. The company will initiate the marketing of the product shortly in the United States and complete the rollout process within the next four to six weeks.AUGMENT Injectable is the first clinically proven injectable protein therapeutic in the U.S. orthopaedic market. It already has a strong foothold in the Canadian and Australian markets. With the latest development, Wright Medical will expand its AUGMENT franchise in the United States.Following the news, the company announced plans to update 2018 annual guidance on its second-quarter earnings call scheduled in August. Per management, the latest development will deliver sustained growth for the U.S. AUGMENT Regenerative Solutions platform over the next several years.Shares UpShares of Wright Medical inched up 1.2% to close at $26.10 following the announcement. In fact, the stock has returned almost 7.9% compared with the industry’s rally of 5.7%. The current level also compares favorably with S&P 500 index’s rise of 2.1%.The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Why is a PMA Required for AUGMENT Injectable?PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review of a Class III medical device. Class III medical devices provide quick recovery but present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.For investor’s notice, AUGMENT Injectable Bone Graft is a Class III medical device, which makes it highly unique in comparison with the traditional autologous bone grafts, allograft and synthetic bone growth substitutes that are already available in the market.The PMA approval for the AUGMENT Injectable has provided Wright Medical with a competitive edge in the niche MedTech space in the United States.Wright Medical’s AUGMENT PlatformNotably, the AUGMENT Injectable Bone Graft platform has same clinical indications as the company’s flagship AUGMENT Bone Graft. AUGMENT Bone Graft received FDA approval in 2015.In fact, AUGMENT Bone Graft is the first and only alternative to autograft in hindfoot and ankle arthrodesis.

44,VAR,"The global medical device industry has demonstrated strong and sustainable growth in the recent past. Banking on an aging population, increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases, increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector appears to be in the pink of health.Going by KPMG data, the medical device industry’s global annual sales is forecast to rise more than 5% a year to reach nearly $800 billion by 2030.A CISION report says that the United States is the largest medical device market in the world at present, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. Despite several socio-political hazards and economic dips, U.S. medical device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, emerging market expansion and tax cuts.Undoubtedly, it has been a very profitable investment space of late.Here are a few major developments:Abolition of MedTech Tax The bipartisan two-year suspension of the Medical Device tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, marks a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect from Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment at 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, thus instilling investor optimism.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.M&A Uptrend ContinuesApart from the tax relief, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact, various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst driving the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.Some of the major acquisitions in the recent past include Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) buyout of Actelion.PBM-Health Insurers ConsolidationLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key medical device players have expanded customer bases, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. These have also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts by Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which comes just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) announcement to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer, Aetna, is important.Digital Revolution and MedTechLatest trends like robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space are gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits at medical device companies of late.Trade War Fears Grip MedTechThe 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors, likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute.Going by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billion in medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus. Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products, Medical - Dental Supplies and Medical Info Systems.We rank all 250-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each.The Zacks Industry Rank is #70 (top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries) for Medical Info Systems, #84 (top 33%) for Medical - Dental Supplies, #108 (top 42%) for Medical - Instruments and #189 (bottom 26%) for Medical - Products. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Upon analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments, it can be said that apart for certain medical product stocks, the near-term outlook for the aforementioned Medical device subsectors is overall positive.Price PerformanceThe price performance of two major Zacks categorized sub industries, are as follows:Over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.2%, the med instruments space has risen 3.6%. Some of the stocks within this space that have been trading above the S&P are Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report), STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report).While the Medical Product subsector’s industry rank indicated a bearish tone, the sector has increased 2.9% in this period. Some players from this space are Haemonetics Corp. (HAE  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report).Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

45,VAR,"Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (MDRX  -  Free Report) recently partnered with Singapore’s largest public healthcare group, SingHealth, with a view to implement iPro Anesthesia. iPro Anesthesia is a cloud-based, mobile Anesthesia Information Management System (AIMS) designed by practicing anesthesiologists to produce a complete, compliant and legible anesthesia record. Its multi-modular platform is designed to fit the needs of any hospital size or specialty center.Notably, following the announcement, the company’s shares have inched up 0.8% to eventually close at $12.60. In the past year, Allscripts’ shares have rallied 10.4%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 5.4%. We believe such developments will provide Allscripts a competitive edge in the healthcare IT (HCIT) space.SingHealth is a healthcare group with more than 40 clinical specialties, a network of community hospitals and primary care clinics.Lately, in a bid to significantly expand its coveted FollowMyHealth platform, Allscripts acquired Florida-based HealthGrid Holding Company. (Read more: Allscripts Acquires HealthGrid to Improve Patient Outcome).Per management, using APIs to exchange data with an electronic health record (EHR) is a good step toward better interoperability.Allscripts’ EHR CollaborationsThe Singapore-based comprehensive medical care provider, SingHealth, had earlier selected Allscripts’ flagship Sunrise suite of solutions, and successfully leveraged the company’s open platform and application programming interfaces (APIs). Moreover, even in the past, hospitals in Singapore had experienced success in using Allscripts Open APIs with Allscripts Sunrise.Allscripts Sunrise is a fully integrated platform that connects all clinical and financial aspects of a hospital or health system for inpatient and outpatient care.For instance, Integrated Health Information Systems started using Allscripts Open APIs with Sunrise, while California-based NantHealth uses Allscripts’ API that validates and saves the data directly to the Sunrise patient record.Furthermore, Allscripts eyes further expansion of its footprint with the Singapore Ministry of Health later in 2018, implementing Allscripts Sunrise clinicals at the 14,000-bed SengKang General and Community Hospitals system.Moreover, in the last reported quarter, Allscripts announced that it is joining forces with the California-based rideshare company, Lyft, to incorporate non-emergency transportation directly into the physician's workflow. The integration of Lyft's proprietary APIs and Allscripts' open platform into Allscripts Sunrise EHR will enable clinicians to order the Lyft services for patients.Market ProspectsPer a research by MarketsandMarkets, the HCIT market is expected to reach $280.25 billion by 2021 from $134.25 billion in 2016, at a CAGR of 15.9%. Factors such as the growing need to manage regulatory compliance through healthcare IT solutions, government support for healthcare IT solutions and rising need to curtail escalating healthcare costs drive the market.Zacks Ranks & Key PicksAllscripts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 71 cents, indicating an increase of 12.7%.Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteStrong International Presence Likely to Drive ResultsBaxter has a strong presence in foreign markets which helps the company gain traction.In the last reported quarter, the company’s international sales accounted for an impressive 46.3% of total revenues.Baxter’s advanced surgery team recently launched TISSEEL Prima in Europe. Furthermore, in Japan, the company’s renal care team launched the KAGUYA peritoneal dialysis technology.In the last reported quarter, Baxter saw higher volumes of shipments of IV solutions from Mexico to the United States. The company looks forward to reallocating additional IV solutions from select South America manufacturing facilities. Per management, this will help revamp production processes at manufacturing facilities in both the United States and Puerto Rico.Other Factors at PlayRaised GuidanceBaxter has raised its guidance for 2018.The company expects sales growth of 5% at constant currency (cc). It projects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.85-$2.93 for the full year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.89, within the guided range.For the second quarter of 2018, the company expects sales growth of approximately 5% at cc. Baxter expects adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 69-71 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pinned at 71 cents, at the high end of the guided range.Strategic BuyoutsBaxter has been banking on strategic acquisitions and collaborations to enhance its existing product portfolio.Recently, Baxter completed the acquisition of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK from Mallinckrodt, with a view to boost its surgical portfolio of hemostats and sealants. Notably, the company bought RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt.Though the buyout did not prove accretive in the last reported quarter, management expects the deal to be modestly rewarding in 2018.From the acquisition of Claris Injectables Limited, Baxter expects revenues worth $145 million in 2018.Lately, Baxter announced a partnership with International Society of Nephrology (ISN) to spread awareness on chronic kidney disease awareness and its therapy in emerging markets. This reflects Baxter’s focus on specializing in renal care.Cyclophosphamide CompetitionCyclophosphamide is part of Baxter's Hospital Products segment, which has been underperforming over the last five years. For 2018, Baxter expects U.S. cyclophosphamide sales of around $120 million, up from the previous guidance of $95 million. However, the guided figure is much lower than $185 million in 2017.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Baxter this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

48,VAR,"The U.S. Medical Device industry trend in 2018 is reflective of extensive discovery and innovation in the life sciences industry over the past few years.Per a study published by CNBC, medical device companies have gained importance in the healthcare world on improved research and development (R&D) of technology. Far-reaching innovation like gene therapy, newer drug combinations, patient monitoring with the help of big data this year will shape up the medical fraternity of the United States.Tax Suspension to Fuel R&DThe Medical Device market has further gained momentum owing to the recent two-year suspension of the controversial 2.3% Medical Device tax. The 2.3% excise tax was implemented in 2013 as part of Obamacare on MedTech manufacturers, significantly restricting R&D activities.According to an article published in Xtalks, the Medical Device tax was responsible for a $34-million reduction in R&D spending along with a $188-million decline in overall sales.However, it is to be seen whether the tax will be fully eliminated or resumed after the two-year period. For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activity in this space, which bodes well for MedTech companies.Notably, in the past month, the medical instruments industry has rallied 3.8% against the S&P 500 index’s return of 1.5%.R&D Leads to Revolution in MedTechThe MedTech space currently offers unprecedented opportunities for growth and market share expansion. Solid investment in R&D has helped manufacturers use the benefits from big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and medical mechatronics.The industry is also catching up with the digital-data age. Enormous size of data can be captured through technology for arriving at business insights. This helps the healthcare sector provide better care and reduce wastage. The latest trend of adopting electronic health record (EHR) services in the U.S. MedTech space has also been gaining popularity.Some of the major HCIT (Healthcare I.T.) bigwigs, which have carved out a niche in the big-data domain, are Cerner Corporation and athenahealth, Inc. These companies are making significant investments in R&D to boost up their EHR platforms.Meanwhile, medical Mechatronics is a much-awaited digital evolution in the global healthcare industry, providing innovation to the healthcare industry through reduction in the size of the age-old medical devices and development of low-cost disposable devices.Engineering concern eInfochips believes that mechatronics is the future of medical devices. The benefits of Mechatronics have been seen in the form of 3D printing, cancer study and development of better medication for deadly diseases.Notably, Intuitive Surgical’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) minimally-invasive da Vinci surgical system and Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) robotic-arm assisted surgery platform, Mako, deserve a mention here.Choosing the Winning StocksGiven the favorable scenario, investment in Medical Device stocks with strong potential seems to be a wise choice. Stocks with strong fundamentals and solid R&D prospects might make rewarding additions to your portfolio.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to select favorable stocks.

50,VAR,"On Jun 5, we issued an updated research report on STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report). The company has been actively trying to expand into the adjacent markets and strengthen its core business through acquisitions and dilutions. However, the company operates in a tough competitive landscape, which is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of this developer, manufacturer and marketer of infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction plus surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services have outperformed the industry over the past three months. The stock has rallied 13.4% against its industry’s 13.1% decline.We are encouraged by STERIS witnessing favorable underlying market trends along with new product and service offerings. The company's strong organic growth across specialty services, life sciences and applied sterilization segments also buoys optimism. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. The company has also made certain divestments and organizational changes, expected to better align with its operations.  Over the recent past, STERIS has been pursuing growth of its footprint into adjacent markets via acquisitions and dilutions. Following the Synergy Health buyout, the company sold the Synergy Health Healthcare Consumable Solutions (HCS) business to Vernacare in November 2017. The HCS business used to generate roughly $40.0 million of annual revenues.This apart, the company made six consolidations in fiscal 2018. Through these transactions, the company aims at strengthening the Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services and the Applied Sterilization Technologies businesses. We believe that STERIS can chase back-to-back acquisitions in the long run in order to widen its business and customer base, courtesy of its solid financial position.Meanwhile, STERIS competes for pharmaceutical, research and industrial customers against several large companies with extensive product portfolios and a global reach as well as small entities with limited product offerings and operations in one or a few countries.The company worries over facing fierce competition as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. This might hamper STERIS’ growth considerably.Moreover, multiple STERIS’ clients are undergoing consolidation, partly due to healthcare cost-reduction measures, initiated by competitive pressures as well as legislators, regulators and third-party payors. We think that if the company fails to check its customer consolidation rate now, it will adversely impact its business as well as the financial condition.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical and Illumina sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Varian Medical carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Intuitive Surgical has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 12.1%.Illumina expects long-term earnings growth of 20%.Varian Medical’s expected earnings growth rate is pegged at 25% for the current year.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

51,VAR,"With the suspension of the controversial 2.3% medical device tax for another two years, the medical device industry is currently riding high on optimism. AdvaMed, the medical device industry’s lobbying group, which strongly advocated for this relief, noted that the tax repeal will provide a huge impetus to the companies to channelize their turnovers into strategic consolidations, research and developments and also help in creating new job opportunities.According to an article published in Daily News, the tax before going into effect from January 2020 will save the device companies as much as $3.7 billion during the two-year suspension.The U.S. medical device market is undergoing substantial transformation. An aging population, longer expectancy for life, growing healthcare awareness in emerging economies combined with powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions (M&As) and product innovation, have been contributing to growth of the sector.M&A Boom Continues It is yet to be seen how far the benefits of the tax repeal have been redirected to M&As till now. Meanwhile, according to Mark Bonifacio, President of Bonifacio Consulting Services, private equity and strategic OEM (Original equipment manufacturer) buyers are competing for assets in all sectors of medical contract manufacturing and broadening their portfolios or investing in new technologies.He strongly stated that although the start of 2018 was sluggish with respect to M&As, it was due to uncertainties over changes in the global healthcare market and the fate of Obamacare’s medical device tax. Now that the doubts are gradually getting cleared, the industry is once again heading toward another year of significant M&A activity.This year’s biggest M&A deal seems to be in the cards with the Wall Street Journal’s latest rumored news related to two mammoths of MedTech space, Boston Scientific BSX and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). The report says that both the rivals may consider a bid for consolidation.The analysts seem to be optimistic about the rumored deal and believe that after the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT)-St. Jude Medical in the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needs to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.Following the company’s $25 billion consolidation with St. Jude Medical in January, Abbott ABT recently closed the $5.3-billion acquisition of Alere. With the successful wrap up of this transaction, the combined company is anticipated to emerge as a leading player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space.Another mega consolidation in the recent times was that of medical device major, Becton, Dickinson and Co. and medical, surgical, diagnostic, and patient care devices provider C. R. Bard, for $24 billion. After the completion of the deal in January, Becton, Dickinson is on its way to expand to new areas like vascular access segments – PICCs (peripherally inserted central catheters), midlines and drug delivery ports.Baxter International BAX purchased RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant from specialty pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report).Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report) also inked a major M&A deal. The company recently signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based global life sciences company, Sirtex Medical Limited for a total deal value of $1.28 billion. The investment will strengthen the company’s position in interventional oncology therapies. This apart, in its effort to gain foothold in the emerging economy, the company recently acquired Cooperative CL Enterprises, a leading distributor of radiotherapy equipment in Taiwan.Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary DePuy Synthes inked a deal to acquire Medical Enterprises Distribution in May.This apart, in 2018, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational growth.Divestments Medical device majors continue to offload their non-core business lines and assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers to focus on the main segments. These divestures have been mandated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other international anti-trust regulators. This restricts chances of monopoly in the market.Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson got a $2.7 billion offer from Fortive Corporation to sell its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc.’s Advanced Sterilization Products business units to Fortive. If JNJ accepts the proposal, it will be a step toward streamlining of its business per its strategic roadmap for better resource utilization and higher shareholders’ return.This apart, according to a MASSDEVICE report, Medtronic recently divested its stake in LifeTech Scientific to China Everbright Ltd. and another unnamed investor. BD also divested its soft tissue core needle biopsy line and Aspira product line to Merit Medical for $100 million. The divestment is related to its acquisition of C.R. Bard.In April, Henry Schein HSIC announced its decision to spin off the company’s major segment global Animal Health business. We believe this initiative remains part of Henry Schein's 2018-2020 Strategic Plans to focus more on dental and medical businesses. According to the company, this transaction will enable it to make the most of the opportunities in the dental space in order to deliver quality clinical care and advanced wellness and prevention.Apprehending that China’s drug distribution reform may slow down the company’s growth in the region (according to a Reuters report), Cardinal Health sold off its China business to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding for $1.2 billion.Following the announcement of its two major buyouts, Abbott divested its eye care business Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) to Johnson & Johnson for about $4.33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines.A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems, Cynosure, sold itself to Hologic. Notably, Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately $1.65 billion.Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Bright A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December 2017, a Gallup poll revealed that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Per a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth. At this pace, India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In the recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, businesses in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Eastern Europe and China showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic’s long-term outlook on emerging markets is encouraging.Boston Scientific’s emerging markets’ business registered 17% growth in first-quarter 2018, reflecting a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year).Key Picks from the SpaceIn the medical instrument space, we are positive on ABIOMED, Inc. ABMD and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

56,VAR,"The United States boasts being the biggest MedTech market to date and is highly regarded for its innovation and technologically-advanced products across the world. A Kaloroma Information article validates the country’s dominance in the field, thanks to its more than $180 billion in revenues generated from all over the world.Medical Device Tax SuspensionThe medical device industry is booming with possibilities, courtesy of the two-year suspension of the infamous 2.3% Medical Device tax.

64,VAR,"On Mar 2, we issued an updated research report on Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report). While the company has delivered strong performances driven by solid product line, slow capital spending is likely to mar prospects. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In 2017, Varian Medical saw a significant product launch in the form of Halcyon Therapy System. The company unveiled the Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system recently. Since its inception in 2017 till the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Halcyon platform witnessed 62 total orders. It received both 510(k) clearance and CE Mark from the European directive, allowing the company to start selling the system in the United States.Apart from radiotherapy, Varian Medical also holds significant promise in proton therapy market. The company’s ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors, consequently reducing side-effects to surrounding tissues.In the recent past, Varian Medical has upgraded its ProBeam system software to ProBeam version 2.5. Moreover, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company booked two new proton orders for ProBeam Compact single-room systems.It also has a strong overseas presence. The company’s sales in Europe, Africa and particularly Asia, are growing at a faster rate than in the domestic market. In December 2017, Varian Medical announced that Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, Australia selected the company’s Eclipse treatment planning to replace its existing systems across all five of its sites.In the past year, Varian has outperformed the industry. The stock has returned 39.9%, compared with the industry’s rally of 22.4%.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteHowever, due to stiff competition, Varian Medical’s research and development expenses are expected to increase which are likely to keep the margins under pressure. Although international sales as percentage of revenues is increasing, the higher demand for lower-margin products from China, India and Brazil is anticipated to keep margins strained over the next several quarters.Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies such as Siemens and Philips as well as with smaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers like Elekta and Accuray. Such intense competition is also likely to slow down the company’s expenditures in the near term and increase R&D expenditures in the nascent proton therapy market.Zacks Rank and Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and Mednax, Inc. (MD  -  Free Report). All of these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The bottom line improved from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 65 cents. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Revenues improved 8.3% to $213 million from $196.6 million in the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $206 million.Segmental AnalysisProduct Revenues Product revenues delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth. Product revenues were $204.4 million for the quarter, up 12% year over year.Product revenues also witnessed impressive growth in overseas markets. New products, including NomoLine capnography, rainbow noninvasive blood constituents monitoring, SedLine Brain Function Monitoring and O3 organ oximetry, contributed to the result.The company’s worldwide direct product revenues (87.5% of total product revenues) increased to $178.9 million in the first quarter of 2018.OEM sales (12.5% of total product revenues) increased to $25.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.Notably, in January, Masimo received CE mark for its RD rainbow Lite SET sensors, which enables the use of Oxygen Reserve Index and RPVi.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 adjusted earnings at $2.81, significantly lower than the guided estimate.In ConclusionMasimo exited the first quarter on a strong note beating the consensus mark on both counts. A solid guidance for 2018 raises investors’ optimism on the stock. The company has been gaining on strong segmental revenues and improving product revenue margins. An expanding product portfolio and wider adoption of its non-invasive patient monitoring technology are major catalysts. Masimo’s SET pulse oximetry business represents considerable growth opportunities in international markets. Moreover, Masimo received some noteworthy CE and FDA clearances during the quarter, including a clearance for domestic use of the new Rad-97 telehealth monitor with two-way audio and video capabilities.On the flip side, lackluster performance in royalties and other revenue unit is a concern. Furthermore, the company faces fierce competition from OEM distributors and medical devices bigwigs that might mar the top line over the long haul.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Solid contribution from Sensor revenues, Transmitter revenues and Receiver revenues are key catalysts at the moment. The glucose monitoring market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom. DexCom's opportunities in alternative markets such as the non-intensive diabetes management space, the hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide the company a competitive edge in the MedTech space. Further, the company’s next-generation fully-disposable CGM systems is also in progressOn the flip side, cutthroat competition in the market for blood & glucose monitoring devices is a headwind for DexCom at the moment. We believe the company’s margins will continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters, owing to high product development costs and rising expenditures on research & development. Lower expected margins on transmitter sales are also a cause of concern.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season, are Baxter International Inc.

Smith.However, lower sales in the PharMEDium and the operating loss in the Profarma unit partially offset growth. AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation Quote Other SegmentThis segment includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (“ABCS”), World Courier and MWI Veterinary Supply.Revenues in the segment came in at $1.6 billion, up 12.6% year over year. Growth in the segment was driven by consolidation of the specialty joint venture in Brazil and revenues from MWI, ABCS's growth in its Canadian operations and World Courier business.However, operating income in the segment was $97.1 million in the quarter, down 6.3% year over year. The downside was primarily caused by lackluster performance at ABCS’s Lash Group.Margin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, AmerisourceBergen registered gross profit of $1.3 billion, up 9.2% on a year-over-year basis. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin was 2.8%, down 4 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter.

Further, the recent takeover of H.D. Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States, is also a positive.On the flip side, sluggishness in ABCS’s Lash Group is a concern. AmerisourceBergen faces headwinds, thanks to the slowdown in hepatitis C revenues and conversion of branded drugs to the lower price generics.Further, a temporary slowdown in PharMEDium's growth is expected to mar the company’s bottom line.

The upside was driven by major gains in Water, Food & Beverage and Life Sciences unit.Europe, North America and Latin America led the Global Industrial regional growth.However, acquisition-adjusted fixed currency operating income in the segment decreased 5% on a year-over-year basis due to higher delivered product costs and massive investments in the business.Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus  Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus | Ecolab Inc. QuoteGlobal InstitutionalSales increased 9% to $1.22 billion, led by strong growth in the Specialty business line. The segment witnessed solid growth in North America and Asia Pacific.Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 4% year over year.Global Energy Sales rose 9% to $847.1 million owing to strong growth in the well stimulation business and modest gains in the downstream business.Acquisition-adjusted fixed currency operating income remained flat year over year.Other Sales declined 11% year over year to $197.4 million. However, sales in this segment witnessed robust growth in North America.Notably, the Other segment now has Ecolab’s Colloidal Technologies unit. The unit was previously part of the Global Industrial Reportable segment.Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales rose 8% year over year, as the Pest Elimination unit within the segment registered solid growth in North America and Europe.Margin AnalysisThe company’s margins in the quarter under review remained under pressure owing to higher delivered-product costs.As a percentage of revenues, Ecolab registered adjusted gross margin of 40% in the first quarter, down 150 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter contracted 60 bps to 10.9% of net revenues.However, Ecolab remains hopeful of the latest pricing initiatives that it has undertaken.

The current outlook reflects an increase of 10-15% year over year.Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter of 2018 is expected to be 42% of net revenues.In ConclusionEcolab ended the first quarter on a favorable note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Despite strength in the Pest Elimination business, the Other segment declined year over year on a reported basis. Ecolab operates in highly competitive markets, which might mar prospects over the long haul.We believe that volatility in foreign currency exchange rates will remain a significant headwind for the company. Ecolab faces pricing pressure in the Energy segment, which is likely to hurt profits.On the brighter side, a strong guidance instills optimism on the stock. Further, Europe, North America and Latin America led Global Industrial regional growth in the quarter. Strength in the Global Institutional segment led by growth in the Specialty and Healthcare business lines is also a positive. A robust product portfolio and an expanding customer base are likely to drive organic sales over the long haul.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are, Baxter International Inc.

Management expects a 70- 90 bps margin expansion in 2018.In ConclusionPerkinElmer exited the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note with strong performance in the DAS segment. Growth in DAS was bolstered by strength in the lifesciences end markets, informatics profile and OneSource offering. The company experienced healthy growth across all major geographies in Asia, Americas, Europe and the BRIC nations. Solid prospects in the elemental-analysis product line hold promise. Furthermore, a positive guidance and a solid long-term outlook for 2020 boosts investors’ confidence in the stock.On the flipside, despite having a diversified portfolio, unfavorable foreign exchange is a primary concern. Softness in the industrial end markets due to unfavorable timing of instrument orders has been a major dampener for PerkinElmer.

72,VAR,"On Mar 23, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). We are currently looking forward to the company’s modified Rite Aid contract, which is expected to benefit the company over the long run. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).This leading pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing company has outperformed the broader industry over the last 30 days. The stock has declined 5.4% compared with the broader industry’s 7.3% decrease.  Ahead of Walgreens Boots’ second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, scheduled for release on Mar 28, 2018, we are upbeat about the company’s strength in its Retail Pharmacy USA division and the continued prescription growth on account of Medicare Part D growth and volume expansion from the previously announced strategic pharmacy collaborations.We are also particularly encouraged by the revised Rite Aid store deal, which has received a regulatory approval last September. Per Walgreens Boots, the modified buyout contract will help it boost the top line and gain operational benefits. It will also aid the company to expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in the key U.S. markets including the Northeast. Notably, a chain of stores and three distribution centers are on the company’s purchase list. While the stores are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States, the distribution centers are founded in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA and Spartanburg, SC. Post the transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years.Moreover, increase in Retail Pharmacy International sales buoys optimism. Additionally, we are hopeful about the company’s decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores in China. This should in fact provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Also, the company’s acceptance of the proposal to sell a portion of its investment in the Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation for a huge amount of cash is a major positive.However, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of fierce competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to gain traction from its growth initiatives, major mass merchants are flourishing pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Notably, a slowdown in generic introduction over the last few years has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. An escalated reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation too have been hampering Walgreens Boots’ margins significantly.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

The upside was also driven by an increase in revenues from genomic testing of beef and dairy cattle, swine, poultry, and companion animals at the other existing locations.Margin DetailsAdjusted gross margin expanded 120 basis points (bps) to 47.5% in the quarter, largely driven by cost improvement in the genomics service business and favorable product mix in its animal safety product lines.Adjusted operating income was $15.9 million or 16.6% of sales in the third quarter, compared with $14.4 million or 16.2% a year ago.Our TakeNeogen exited the third quarter on a solid note. We are encouraged by the year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues as well. We believe that Neogen is steadily progressing on the back of its four-pronged strategy. Also, we are encouraged by the accretive acquisitions and expanding international footprint which will drive overall results in fiscal 2018.The market is looking forward to the company’s recent launch of BetaStar Advanced tests for beta-lactam and tetracycline antibiotics in milk.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNeogen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

76,VAR,"AngioDynamicsInc (ANGO  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 11, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25% and improved 31.6% year over year. Net sales fell almost 2% year over year to $83.9 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $86 million. The company delivered a average positive earnings surprise of 9.79% in the trailing four quarters.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 21 cents, reflecting a rise of10.5% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales isat $89 million, showing an increase of 2.4% year over yearLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and Consensus  AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and Consensus | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteFactors to Drive Q4 ResultsAngioDynamics’ expanding product pipeline, international market expansion and cost saving initiatives will provide considerable growth opportunities in the fourth quarter.AngioDynamics is a leading provider of minimally invasive medical devices used for vascular access, surgery, peripheral vascular disease and oncology. The company’s product lines include ablation systems, fluid management systems, vascular access products, angiographic products and accessories, angioplasty products, drainage products, thrombolytic products and venous products. These are expected to boost the company’s sales in the quarter to be reported.Further, the company continues to witness healthy demand for its coveted NanoKnife system for treating tumors. Increased penetration of the device contributed to revenues in the company’s Oncology division.  In fact, the recent regulatory approval of VOLTA, a radiofrequency ablation device in Japan, is also a significant positive for the quarter to be reported.The company is already looking to broaden its commercial opportunities. Along with Germany and Denmark, the company is also looking forward to achieve the same in Europe and the United Kingdom.The DeterrentsHowever, in the third quarter, growth in the Fluid and Thrombus Management product lines was offset by declines in the Venous Insufficiency and Angiographic Catheter businesses. Further, declines in PICCs product line and lower sales related to the discontinued RFA product line dampened sales growth. We believe that these headwinds will persist in the fourth quarter.What Our Model Predicts?However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show earnings beat for AngioDynamics in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AngioDynamics currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 21 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.Wright Medical Group N.V. (WMGI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +60.2% and a Zacks Rank #3.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.08% and a Zacks Rank #3.DexCom, Inc.

77,VAR,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24, after the market closes. In the previous quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. Further, adjusted earnings declined from $1.38 in the year-ago quarter.On an average, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6.6% in the trailing four quarters. Also, a lackluster price performance is a woe. Over the last year, the stock has returned 22.6% compared with the industry’s rally of 33.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayDeclining Financials:Varian Medical experienced declining revenues in fourth-quarter of 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the quarter-to-be-reported as well. Lackluster performance by the company’s Halcyon cancer-treatment device will hamper sales in Latin America. In fact, sales in the Halcyon platform declined 46% in Latin America in the fourth quarter, thanks to several tenders pushing out, mainly from public-sector deals. Revenues from Asia-Pacific and Japan are also expected to decline significantly due to plummeting orders of Halcyon.Further, softness in the market for freestanding clinics is a headwind for Varian Medical in the to-be-reported quarter.Performance in the proton-therapy unit has been dampened due to intense competition in the niche space. This is anticipated to be a major concern for Varian Medical.Narrowing Customer Base:The majority of Varian Medical's X-Ray tube and flat panel detector sales cater to a small number of (large imaging system) original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. The equipment manufacturing majors incorporate these X-Ray products into their own medical diagnostic imaging systems and industrial imaging systems. Due to the pattern of client concentration, a loss of any one of these clients may have an adverse effect on Varian Medical’s operating results.Earnings WhispersBuoyed by the above factors, our proven model does not conclusively indicate earnings beat for Varian Medical in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Varian Medical currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.76%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 99 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 98 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Varian Medical currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

81,VAR,"The Medical Instrument industry within the broader Medical universe has been gaining on R&D innovation, higher consolidation, focus on emerging market and tax abolition. The industry increased 3.6% in a month’s time, higher than the S&P 500 index’s rise of 2%.Fundamentally, the industry has benefited by a massive change in consumer behavior as well. This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests as well as use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.It will be interesting to analyze the best Medical Instrument stocks that are likely to yield solid returns in the days to come. But first, let us glance at the latest headlines from the space. Latest Medical Instrument Headlines at a Glance Stryker’s Takeover Plans of Boston ScientificThe Medical Instrument fraternity has been riding on the current merger and acquisition (M&A) trends.Per a recent report by the Reuters, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is likely to take over Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), creating a market value of more than $110 billion. However, the possibility of the deal is uncertain. Thre are no confirmatory statements or press releases from the company representatives.In fact, investors should never forget about Stryker’s highly-rumored acquisition plans of Smith & Nephew in 2015, which never materialized. On the brighter side, this is not the first time Stryker has been tied up with Boston Scientific. The company acquired Boston Scientific's neurovascular unit in 2010 for $1.5 billion, which indicates probability of a second collaboration (read more: Stryker Likely to Acquire Boston Scientific).Stryker has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).If the deal materializes, the combined entity will have one of the MedTech’s broadest spectrums of product offerings that include cardiology, orthopaedics, surgical supplies and neuroscience. This will reduce pricing pressure and competition. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy will gain from rapidly-expanding customer base, moderate leverage and enhanced cash flow.Glancing at major acquisitions in the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s takeover of C. R. Bard for $24 billion and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Covidien for about $43 billion deserve a mention.Abiomed Reserves Slot in the S&P 500 Leading Medical Instrument player Abiomed Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report) replaced Wyndham Worldwide Corp and entered the S&P 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Health Care Supplies Sub-Industry index.Per a research report by The Globe and Mail, Abiomed is following the trend of medical device and technology companies reserving the top slot in the S&P 500 index. To remind investors, Align Technology Inc (ALGN  -  Free Report) topped the index in 2017.Abiomed currently has a market capitalization of $18.6 billion. Further, the company’s financial viability, adequate liquidity, reasonable price and sector representation has lent it a competitive edge in the U.S. Medical Instrument industry (read more: Abiomed to Replace Wyndham in the S&P 500 Benchmark).Tax Abolition Boosting R&DA bipartisan two-year suspension of a ‘Medical Device’ tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, has been a temporary relief. This tax took a toll on the entire medical device industry since its enactment. Per the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, this tax had a negative impact on medical innovation resulting in loss or deferred creation of jobs.For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activities in this space. The repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor’s optimism. The ratification of the Tax-repeal amendment has invoked massive investment in the sector.3 Top Medical Instrument StocksConsidering the existence of the number of players in the Medical Instruments industry, choosing the right stocks with the potential to yield returns might be a daunting task.Our proprietary Zacks methodology makes it fairly simple for you.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to select favorable stocks.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings is currently pegged at $4.50, up 25% year over year.In June, Varian Medical Systems demonstrated its comprehensive portfolio of advanced brachytherapy solutions in the American Brachytherapy Society Annual Meeting. The development is likely to boost Varian's Oncology Systems segment.

Notably, the company also launched Halcyon 2.0 with kilovoltage imaging. Solid revenues from Oncology, growing adoption of Particle Therapy and strong overseas presence, particularly in the emerging countries are positives.Varian has also been going global in acquisitions and agreements.

The company has a multi-year plan for long-term developments. An impressive guidance, declining operating expenses and the clearing of debt are other major positives. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Solid performance in Subscription revenues has been a key catalyst. Further, in a bid to replace the simple custom-made data warehouses with a unique industry-specific data model, Veeva Systems recently introduced Veeva Nitro — a new model of commercial data warehouse for Life Sciences. We are encouraged by Veeva Systems’ consistent efforts in product innovation and launches through R&D. Growing global demand for cloud-based vault applications also boost opportunities.On the flip side, high expenses on the operational side are causing a drag on the company’s margins, partially dampening its revenues. Furthermore, intense competition and a saturating life sciences market are key concerns. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rate is a headwind.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which reported solid earnings this season are Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), Varian Medical Systems, Inc (VAR  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc (ISRG  -  Free Report).Intuitive Surgical reported adjusted earnings of $2.44 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.6%.

89,VAR,"In a bid to enhance food safety and deliver world-class warewashing results in restaurants, Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) recently launched the SMARTPOWER Program. Notably, the platform’s focus is on warewashing — a process of collecting dirty kitchen ware and cutlery, washing and rinsing them.The dynamic SMARTPOWER platform reduces labor, water and energy costs. Per management, the program will be rolled out this year in the United States and later in Europe.We believe, the latest development is likely to help Ecolab fortify its position in the food-hygiene space. In fact, the company recently launched a dynamic Health Department Intelligence (HDI) platform as well, to focus on food safety. The HDI platform retrieves and manages health department inspection data for foodservice operators and provides insights to help address food safety risks. This will help the company improve health inspection performance and manage food safety risks efficiently (read more: Ecolab Rolls Out HDI for Improved Food Surveillance).Supported by developments like these, Ecolab’s shares have rallied 14.4% compared with the industry’s rise of 2.4% in a year’s time.Why SMARTPOWER?SMARTPOWER is a complete warewashing program that uses proprietary chemistry and advanced cloud computing to provide skilled service, resulting in cost-effective operations, especially for restaurateurs. Per management, the advanced new chemistry helps in decomposing the buildup on wares and prevents soils from reattaching.Moreover, real-time insights on warewashing performance and personalized service will help customers identify the trends in operations. This can reduce customers’ daily dish racks up to 10%, thereby lowering the total cost.The positive results followed extensive testing across 300 foodservice environments in 21 countries. Per management, users of SMARTPOWER have reported a significant increase in wares usable for guests after the first wash, which eliminates the need to rewash them.According to bizfluent, labor is the single largest expense category for majority of restaurants. The average labor cost for a financially sustainable restaurant is 30-35% of gross sales, with 20% going to pay wage-earning staff such as servers and an additional 10-15% going to pay salaried workers such as managers. The use of real-time data in its applications has helped the company bolster its footprint in the Healthcare IT space.Market ProspectsPer Orbis Research, industry analysts forecast that the Commercial Food services Equipment market in the United States will witness a CAGR of 5.51% during the period 2017-2021.On the other hand, ResearchAndMarkets opines that the global healthcare IT solutions market is expected to reach $223.16 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 13.7% during the period of 2018 to 2023.Thus, it can be concluded that Ecolab’s move has been timely and strategic.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEcolab currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc.

The stock has a market cap of $51.51 billion.Let’s find out whether the company can maintain the positive trend.Robot-based da Vinci Unit Driving GrowthThe growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and shift of the payment system to a value-based model indicate higher adoption of Artificial Intelligence in the MedTech space.Intuitive Surgical’s flagship da Vinci surgical system is powered by robotic technology.

Notably, the minimally invasive surgical instruments market is projected to reach a worth of $18.14 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 10.2% (per Markets & Markets).Although high price of the da Vinci system may hinder widespread adoption, we believe that the overwhelming benefits of minimally invasive surgery will compel surgeons and patients to use the system.

In fact, the company has received orders from Australia, Belgium, India, Morocco, Romania, Russia, Turkey and the United Kingdom in the last quarter.In this regard, Varian’s proton therapy unit had sealed a deal with Bangkok-based King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital earlier this year.

106,VAR,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Palo Alto, CA-based Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report). The company is the world’s leading provider of radiotherapy, radiosurgery, proton therapy and brachytherapy for treating cancer and other medical conditions.Varian Medical had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one month, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the share price movement reveals that Varian Medical’s shares have lost 6.4%, comparing unfavorably with 3.0% decline of the industry.Looking forward, Varian Medical's oncology and Proton therapy business' growth prospects remain impressive. The company is addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam, Halcyon products. The company is winning contracts, not only in the Americas but also in the emerging international markets, which is a huge positive. We believe that China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunity in the near term. The company is opening new offices in Africa and the Middle East, which will provide growth opportunities in the region.Varian Medical operates in a technology-driven environment where success depends on innovation and frequent product updates. The company has been successful on the R&D front as evident from year-over-year growth in its top line. The company has approximately $1 billion revenue opportunity from its various Oncology and Imaging Component products over the next five years.  The varied offerings include TrueBeam and Edge platforms, InSightive Analytics, Qumulate QA and RapidPlan knowledge-based treatment planning. We believe that Varian Medical’s innovative product pipeline will continue to drive growth over the long term.Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe that proton therapy also holds significant promise for Varian Medical. This is because ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors and causes lesser side effects to surrounding tissues. Proton therapy system uses the same interface used by the company in its TrueBeam platform.Finally the company’s strong overseas presence is expected to enable it to leverage this opportunity in emerging markets. In line with growing demand for cancer treatment in overseas markets, Varian Medical’s sales, in Europe, Africa and particularly Asia, are growing at a faster rate than in the domestic market.On the flip side, unfavorable currency translation continues to be a major dampener for the stock. Management fears that further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies will lead to deteriorating operating results.Intense competition as well as the possibility that Varian Medical’s new test might not generate meaningful profits to outweigh the costs associated with its development, continues to raise concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksVarian Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

107,VAR,"Palo Alto, CA-based manufacturer of medical devices and software, Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report), announced that it has signed a distribution agreement with Toledo, OH-based Bionix Radiation Therapy. Per the agreement, Varian Medical would distribute Bionix’s propreitory brachytherapy applicators. Varian will market the Bionix Esophageal Applicator (E-App) and the Anorectal Applicator (AR-1) in North America.Of the above two applicators, E-App is a disposable brachytherapy applicator. It is designed specifically for the treatment of cancers. The E-App features five independently operable balloons that maintain the central position of the source catheter in both straight and curved anatomy. This allows for closer proximity of the target to the source while maintaining distance from healthy tissue.The second applicator, AR-1 is a disposable brachytherapy applicator. It is designed specifically for the treatment of anal and rectal cancers. The dual balloon design of the AR-1 allows exophytic tumors to press closer to the source catheter. This creates the ability to deliver a very high dose to the tumor, while sparing healthy tissue.Future TrendWe note that the global radiotherapy market is expected to reach a worth of $7,544.8 million by 2020, at a CAGR of 6.2%. Taking the bountiful prospects in the global niche space into consideration, the latest development should boost investor’s confidence.Share Price PerformanceA promising portfolio combined with robust initiatives has been favoring this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, which has delivered positive earnings surprise in 12 of the last 14 quarters. We note that shares of Varian Medical have declined 0.2% over the past three months against the broader industry, which grew 0.5% in the same time frame.Our TakeVarian Medical operates in a technology-driven environment where success depends on innovation and frequent product updates. The company has been successful on the R&D front as evident from year-over-year expansion in its top line. The company has approximately $1 billion revenue opportunity from its various Oncology and Imaging Component products over the next five years.Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe that proton therapy holds significant promise for Varian Medical.

110,VAR,"Mechatronics, a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering, has been in vogue, of late. With growing prominence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotic companies, organizations with significant exposure to Mechatronics have been raking in huge profits. A research by the Business Wire deciphers that the global Mechatronics and Robotics market is projected to witness a CAGR of 15.02% during the 2017-2021 period.Considering the strong exposure of Mechatronics in almost all spheres like technology, automobile, telecom and more, the evolution of Medical Mechatronics has been the most fascinating.The growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of Information Technology (IT) for quick and improved patient care as well as a shift of the payment system to a value-based model indicate the predominance of Mechatronics in the MedTech space.So, let’s delve into details on how Medical Mechatronics has been creating new opportunities in MedTech and raising investors’ confidence to put money in the healthcare space for long-term gains.How is Mechatronics Shaping Up the Healthcare Paradigm?Medical Mechatronics is a much-awaited digital evolution in the global healthcare industry.Medical Mechatronics has provided innovation to the healthcare industry through reduction in the size of the age-old medical devices, development of low cost disposable devices, portability of devices and error free results.Per Hindawi, a renowned Healthcare Engineering journal, the Medical Mechatronics revolution has been one of the most important drivers of the global knowledge-based economies like the United States.Here we take a look at the two major aspects of Medical Mechatronics that have been doing rounds in the global headlines.3D printing & Medical MechatronicsThe best example of Mechatronics in the healthcare industry is 3D printing, which has changed the face of the medical devices industry.Also known as additive manufacturing, 3D printing is the process of turning a digital model into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer (per an article on 3D Hubs). 3D printing has also received a warm response from the MedTech space within healthcare. Notably, research firm Future Market Insights expects the global 3D printed medical devices market to see a CAGR of 18.1% between 2017 and 2027.Of the major companies, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has been one of the early adopters of the 3D printing technology. The company’s FDA-approved Tritanium TL Curved Posterior Lumbar Cage is a 3D-printed interbody fusion cage intended for use as an aid in lumbar fixation.Robotics Boosting Medical Mechatronics The rise of Mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new robotic solutions to mitigate age-old problems for the MedTech companies. These solutions are pain less, error free and inexpensive. So MedTech companies that are using Mechatronic-based robots to cure diseases have a competitive edge with a strong customer base, solid revenues and handsome profits.Of the major companies, MedTech giant Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) is a notable mention.Intuitive Surgical designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This Mechatronic-based platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery.The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair in the days to come.Let us take a look at three other MedTech stocks that have been hogging the limelight based on the growing prevalence of Mechatronics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector.3 Best MedTech Stocks Riding High on MechatronicsIn this backdrop, three MedTech stocks are well positioned on strong fundamentals and solid exposure to Mechatronics.We have used the Zacks Stock Screener to pick them. These companies have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) along with a Growth Score of A or B.Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 are better picks than most.Abiomed Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report)The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Shares of Abiomed have surged 204.6% in a year’s time comparing favorably with the industry’s decline of 2.3%.Impella, ABIOMED’s flagship product line has continued to be a growth driver. Impella is the world's smallest heart pump. It is a support system of percutaneous, catheter-based devices offering hemodynamic support to the heart.To expand the flagship Impella heart pumps portfolio, Abiomed recently announced the receipt of FDA Pre-Market Approval (PMA) for its Impella CP heart pump with SmartAssist in April 2018. The technology also features an optical sensor. This development has provided the company with significant exposure to Medical Mechatronics.The company plans a controlled roll-out of the technologically advanced heart pump at hospital sites with developed heart recovery protocols over the next fiscal year. Varian Medical Systems Inc (VAR  -  Free Report)The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. Shares of Varian Medical have gained 17.1% in a year’s time.Varian Medical has received significant exposure to Medical Mechatronic trends on its Halcyon and HyperArc platforms.The Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system has been designed to offer cost-effective cancer care worldwide. The system streamlines every aspect of image-guided volumetric intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The HyperArc platform is Varian Medical’s high definition radiotherapy technology. In Apr 2018, Varian Medical launched Halcyon 2.0 with kilovoltage imaging (Kv). The first human kV cone-beam CT images on a Halcyon were acquired at Washington University with positive feedback on image quality, speed of image acquisition, and processing.Further, Varian Medical’s HyperArc platform is designed to treat multiple metastases brain cancer cases and continues to witness strong demand. STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report)The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. Shares of STERIS have gained 31.4% in a year’s time.The company manufactures and markets infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction, and surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services.STERIS’s acquisition of U.K.-based outsourced sterilization services provider Synergy Health plc is a significant achievement. The buyout enabled the combination of STERIS' Infection Prevention and Services businesses with Synergy's Hospital Sterilization Services. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

111,VAR,"Patterson Companies, Inc (PDCO  -  Free Report) underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The company’s shares have lost 52.4% versus the industry’s increase of 10.2%. The current return is also lower than S&P 500 index’s rise of 14.4%.A rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States, unfavorable price movements, declining dental revenues and integration risks pose significant challenges for Patterson Companies.Further, management expects headwinds in the technology equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018 as Patterson Companies has been shifting to the new go-to market strategy with an expanded technology-based product portfolio. Currently, the company is also grappling with legal issues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 bottom line declined 2.4% in the last three months to $1.68. This shows a year-over-year decline of 28.2%. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line declined 9.7% in the last three months to 31 cents. This indicates a fall of 55.1% on a year-over-year basis.Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus  Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus | Patterson Companies, Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Here we take a peek at the major issues plaguing Patterson Companies.The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and majorly consists of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies faces competition from another national, full-service firm, Henry Schein Dental — a unit of Henry Schein.In addition, there are at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level and hundreds of small local distributors. It’s mandatory for the company to constantly introduce products in the market to tide over competitive pressures. Failure to do so will dilute the company’s market share.Dwindling dental sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected constant disruption of the company’s augmentation goals. Sales in this segment fell 8.1% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. Additionally, Patterson Companies’ sales of consumable dental supplies fell 7.4% on a year-over-year basis. Dental equipment sales also declined 10.6% on a constant-currency (cc) basis.The recent loss of exclusive distribution rights with Dentsply Sirona has compelled the company to shift to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to efficiently manage inventory. However, the system is creating short-term challenges.Undoubtedly, the termination of the contract presents new opportunities for Patterson Companies to expand distribution platform to a wider range of product offerings. However, the company also witnesses a heavy initial impact from the loss of this deal.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report), Genomic Health Inc (GHDX  -  Free Report) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc (VAR  -  Free Report).Abiomed has a long-term earnings growth rate of 27%.

112,VAR,"In a bid to strengthen its Medical Management Solutions (MMS) segment, Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), popularly known as BD, recently collaborated with Indiana-based Helmer Scientific to introduce a refrigerated solution using BD’s new Pyxis ES refrigerator. Notably, the solution is the first of its kind that has been integrated into an automated dispensing system.Post the announcement, the New Jersey-based medical technology company’s share price dropped a marginal 0.3% to $227.72. However, in the past three months, BD rallied an impressive 3.9%, significantly outperforming the industry’s decline of 0.6%. We believe such favorable developments will provide cushion to the stock.Notably, Helmer Scientific offers secure medical grade refrigerator, freezer and blood bank storage for clinics, labs, pharmacies, hospitals, research centers and universities.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).MMS in FocusThe Pyxis ES system is a significant contributor to MMS. The platform provides automated medication dispensing systems supporting decentralized medication management.Revenues in the last reported quarter grew 0.5% at the MMS unit. Per management, the upside was driven by strong Pyxis ES adoption in the United States as well as international growth.Coming back to the news, notifications from the BD Pyxis ES can be seen on the BD HealthSight viewer platform, a unique combination of connective technologies, analytics and expert services.The Helmer Access Technology along with the new BD Pyxis ES refrigerator provides storage for refrigerated medications that require temperature monitoring.MMS ProspectsPer research by MarketsandMarkets, the global medication management systems market, which was expected to reach a value of $845.1 million by 2014, is poised see a CAGR of 13% to 15% in the 2014 to 2019 period.Hence it can be concluded that BD’s move has been a timely and strategic one.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc.

This time around, we are bullish about the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.What’s in Store for the Medical Space?While overall growth is steadily accelerating from the few preceding quarters’ performances, the investors are concerned about the healthcare space, a sector that has been seen to struggle a lot during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.Whether President Donald Trump finally amends its earlier proposed American Health Care Act (AHCA) or totally repeals and replaces Obamacare, uncertainty within the medical space is towering high. Investors are currently adopting a wait-and-see policy about the space.This lack of visibility befuddles the bullish trend the Medical sector (one of the 16 broader Zacks sectors) was maintaining over the past few quarters. Accordingly, for the second quarter, expected earnings growth rate stands at 0.00%, a break-even level on 3.8% revenue growth projection. This compares unfavorably with the first-quarter 2017’s reported earnings growth rate of 5.6% on 5.7% revenue growth.Let’s take a sneak peek at the performance of four major Medical - Instruments companies within the broader Medical space expected on Jul 26.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report): This leading cardiovascular product maker is scheduled to report its second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 26. Edwards Lifesciences posted strong global sales in the last reported quarter, primarily buoyed by strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve (TAVR). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S., the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.Edwards Lifesciences currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are on par at 88 cents. We note that, while a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP.(Read More: Edwards Lifesciences Q2 Earnings: A Surprise in Store?)Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteThermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report): This MA-based medical instruments manufacturer’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and strengthening of its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post solid results in the second quarter. The company has already spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is expected through this year too.Thermo Fisher is expected to beat expectations when it reports its second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +0.44%.That is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $2.27, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at $2.26.

115,VAR,"Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Jul 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 89 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, adjusted earnings declined 18.3% on a year-over-year basis.Factors at PlayWe are particularly upbeat about Varian’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenue in second-quarter 2017. Notably, the company has been addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has also been winning international contracts in the oncology space. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Varian expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 92 cents–96 cents and revenues are expected to increase about 3% on a year-over-year basis.Further, strengthening its foothold in the oncology business, the company launched its FDA approved product Halcyon in May. Also, in June, the company signed an agreement with Vijametech and UPMC to establish radiation oncology centers in Vietnam.We are also upbeat about Varian’s prospects internationally where it primarily banks on proton therapy as an advanced treatment option for cancer patients. In this regard, we note that Varian Medical recently received Shonin approval in Japan to market the ProBeam system for proton therapy.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteThis apart, Varian Medical recently entered into two international agreements concerning its Proton therapy platform. Bangkok-based King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital has selected its ProBeam Compact single-room proton therapy system for cancer treatment in Thailand along with Delray Medical Center in Florida.We believe Western Europe, China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunities in the near term. The company is opening new offices in Africa and the Middle East, which shows that it is aware of the opportunities in the region. Moreover, Varian’s strong product pipeline is a key catalyst.Nevertheless, increasing local competition is a primary headwind. Unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations and higher operating expenses pertaining to increased investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Varian Medical this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Varian Medical currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 94 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Varian Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The current return also compares unfavorably with the S&P 500 index’s rise of 0.3%. Regulatory issues regarding Onrad, intense competition in the radiation oncology market, sluggish macro economic conditions and unfavorable foreign exchange rate are significant challenges for the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 bottom line is pegged at a loss of 29 cents. Notably, this has widened by 10 cents in the last two months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pegged at a loss of 2 cents.The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Here we take a peek at the major issues plaguing Accuray.Accuray Incorporated Price and Consensus  Accuray Incorporated Price and Consensus | Accuray Incorporated QuoteIssues Regarding OnradOnrad is Accuray’s flagship product for the value segment of the MedTech market. In fact, the company has been trying to build a solid sales channel for this important segment since long.However, the order uptake for Onrad is somewhat dampened by lack of regulatory movement in China recently. The company has been facing headwinds in the orders perspective due to continued Class A license delay in the region.By the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Accuray announced that its distributors have been working hard to position Onrad in the value segment within a year.Cutthroat Competition in the Niche MarketsAccuray is exposed to significant competition in the radiation oncology market, which is characterized by rapid technological changes.The company competes head-to-head with Varian Medical Systems, Inc (VAR  -  Free Report), Elekta AB, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, ViewRay and BrainLAB AG in the market. The CyberKnife System faces stiff challenge from Varian Medical’s Trilogysystem, while TomoTherapy systems face competition from the RapidArc technology and the TrueBeam systems.Forex WoesAs percentage of total sales, international sales have increased significantly over the last five years.

SRDX hit a new 52-week high of $47.05 in the previous session. Surmodics has gained 66.8% since the start of the year compared to the -0.4% move for the Medical sector and the 7.8% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 2, 2018, Surmodics reported EPS of $0.07 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $-0.01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 6.33%.For the current fiscal year, Surmodics is expected to post earnings of $-0.02 per share on $78.42 million in revenues. This represents a -103.92% change in EPS on a 7.26% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $-0.04 per share on $90.38 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -100% and 15.25%, respectively.Valuation MetricsSurmodics may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for SRDX? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Surmodics has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Surmodics, Inc. Price and Consensus Surmodics, Inc. Price and Consensus | Surmodics, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Surmodics currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Surmodics fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though SRDX shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Surmodics Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Surmodics have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report), STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report), and Varian Medical Systems (VAR  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Surmodics. Still, the fundamentals for SRDX are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week-high.

The stock has lost 23.6% comparing unfavorably with the industry’s rise of 7.9%.Net sales (Excluding Precious-Metal Impact)Net sales of the company’s precious-metal dental alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials, are subject to risks from fluctuations of precious metal prices.To avoid the impact of fluctuating prices, DENTSPLY reports net sales with and without precious metal content to show actual performance, independent of precious metal price volatility.Net sales in the segment were $945.8 million, up 6.3% year over year.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

QuoteSegmental DetailsThe business is organized into two reporting segments — Dental & Healthcare Consumables and Technologies.Dental & Healthcare ConsumablesThe segment comprises preventive, restorative, instruments, endodontic and laboratory dental products as well as consumable medical device products.Net sales improved 6.2% to $447.8 million in the segment, while it declined 0.4% at cc.Technologies & Equipment segmentTechnologies consist of dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic products.The metric increased 6.1% to $508.3 million in the segment on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues were down 5.8% at cc.Geographic DetailsIn the quarter, sales in the United States fell 6.9% to $291.8 million year over year.

Robust performance by the company’s flagship dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic product platforms hold considerable promise over the long haul. Emerging markets like Asia-Pacific & the Middle East offer healthy growth opportunities on a long-term basis, as they remain vastly untapped with low dental products penetration. The company’s agreements with MedTech bigwig Patterson Companies in Canada are likely to drive sales. DENTSPLY recently witnessed a rebound in sales in Asia, particularly Japan, and strong growth in Russia.On the flip side, a lowered guidance is indicative of looming concerns. The company's higher capital expenditure on product development and tough competition are expected to exert pressure on margins. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate and integration risks are major headwinds for the near term.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season, are Baxter International Inc.

QuoteMargin AnalysisGross Profit increased 10.7% year over year to $1.91 billion.As a percentage of revenues, gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) to 5.7% of net revenues.GuidanceThe company slashed guidance for fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share to $4.85-$4.95. The current range is significantly lower than the previous estimate of $5.25-$5.50. The downside was caused by the company's effective tax rate associated with the Cordis business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $136.11 billion.   Our TakeCardinal Health exited the quarter on a tepid note with adjusted earnings missing the consensus mark. The company witnessed encouraging performance in the Medical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment registered strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. Further, the company is banking on strategic buyouts, joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth.Despite growth in business, profits in the Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing. Huge investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics performance are likely to mar Cardinal Health’s operational efficiencies in the upcoming quarters. Intense competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks.

Per management, strong performance in the segment is likely to enhance  revenue cycle position.Managed services segment revenues were $268.3 million, up 3.3% year over year.Support and maintenance revenues were $284.6 million, up 8.6% year over year.Reimbursed Travel sales amounted to $23.9 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.MarginsGross margin in the first quarter was 82.1%, almost flat year over year.Operating margin for the reported quarter was 15.1%, which contracted 427 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.The downside was caused by surge in operating expenses, which rose 6% year over year. The growth was driven by personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates and non-cash items.Financial PositionCerner exited the first quarter with free cash flow of $255.7 million. Operating cash flow totaled $409 million.Long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, was $527 million, down slightly on a sequential basis.View DownbeatCerner expects second-quarter 2018 revenues between $1.31 billion and $1.36 billion.

Additionally, Cerner has been facing macroeconomic challenges along with cutthroat competition in niche space. Surging operating expenses also add to the woes.International growth is likely to boost with the company’s prospects in Australia, Canada, Middle East, U.K., Ireland and Germany.

131,VAR,"Abiomed Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to join the coveted S&P 500 benchmark before the market opens on May 31. The company is currently part of the S&P MidCap 400 index.The S&P 500 index is periodically maneuvered to remove stocks that have been acquired by other companies, delisted from the stock exchange or failed to meet the mandatory criteria of the index. Consequently, other companies that meet the criteria are added to the list as replacement to the deleted stocks.Notably, Abiomed will be replacing Wyndham Worldwide Corp.  in the S&P 500 index. The company will be added to the S&P 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Health Care Supplies Sub-Industry index.Benefits for Abiomed With a portfolio of 500 leading companies that have approximately 80% coverage of the available market capitalization, the S&P 500 index is an important metric for the U.S. equities.Any company reserving its forte in the S&P 500 stature should have a market capitalization of more than $4 billion. Abiomed currently has a market capitalization of $17.46 billion. Further, the company’s financial viability, adequate liquidity, reasonable price and sector representation has lent it a competitive edge in the U.S. MedTech industry.We believe that the news should provide a solid boost for Abiomed’s shareholders, which has successfully met all inclusion criterias to join the S&P 500 list. The company’s shares have outperformed the S&P 500 index in a year’s time. The stock has returned 182.2%, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s rise of 12.6%.Shares are expected to move higher as Abiomed's latest developments indicate probabilities of the company's penetration into the prophylactic high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock patient market.Key Factors Driving AbiomedImpella, Abiomed’s flagship product line, has continued to be the key growth driver. Impella is the world's smallest heart pump. It is a support system of percutaneous, catheter-based devices offering hemodynamic support to the heart.Recently, the Impella 2.5 was used successfully to treat a 68-year old cardiac patient at Mitsui Memorial Hospital, one of the leading cardiovascular centers in Japan. Such incidents elucidate strong clinical demand for Impella overseas.Additionally, the installed customer base for Impella CP heart pumps grew by 41 new U.S. hospitals, taking the total count of Impella CP sites to 1,134. The installed customer base for Impella 5.0 heart pumps grew by 14 new U.S. hospitals, taking the total number of Impella 5.0 sites to 498. Further, Abiomed opened 36 new sites of Impella RP for a total of 222 hospitals, which set a record for patients supported.

The company plans a controlled roll-out of the technologically advanced heart pump at hospital sites with developed heart recovery protocols over the next fiscal year.The recent CE mark for the Impella 5.5 in Europe enhanced the product line significantly and enabled the company to advance in the field of heart recovery.In the recently reported fourth quarter, Impella heart pumps garnered worldwide revenues worth $198.3 million, up 42% year over year. In the United States, Impella raked in $146.2 million, up 35% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Internationally, revenues generated from Impella heart pumps were $22.1 million, up a whopping 107%.Lucrative Market Trends for Coronary Heart DiseasesWe believe that Abiomed will continue to benefit from the rising number of patients suffering from coronary heart diseases (CHD) in the United States.Per data available from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CHD is the most common type of heart disease that claims approximately 380,000 lives annually. Importantly, the United States bears $108.9 billion each year for CHD, which includes the cost of health care services, medications and lost productivity.Abiomed’s product line focuses on procedures, offers devices which are minimally invasive and help patients overcome the trauma of open surgeries. The company’s products are becoming increasingly popular in lowering patient recovery time and saving hospitalization costs.Estimates Moving UpBuoyed by the these favorable tidings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter earnings have inched up 1.3% to 80 cents per share in a month’s time.

Price and EPS Surprise  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Quote Let’s delve into factors which are likely to impact Varian Medical’s upcoming quarterly results.Factors at PlayOncology to Drive Growth:We are upbeat about Varian Medical’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenues in the last quarter. Notably, the company has been addressing the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has been winning international contracts in the oncology space.In a bid to overhaul its Oncology Systems segment, Varian Medical recently acquired Montreal-based privately-held Evinance Innovation, Inc. — a clinical decision support (CDS) software company. The deal was initiated in September 2017. The company had stated that it will utilize Evinance’s patented technology to offer better services to clients.On Mar 20, Varian Medical announced that St. Petersburg Center of Nuclear Medicine successfully completed its first pediatric patient treatment with the Varian ProBeam proton therapy system.Product Launch: The successful launch of Halcyon Therapy System deserves a mention in this regard.

Intense competition is anticipated to increase R&D expenditures in the nascent proton therapy market, which will dent margins.

136,VAR,"There is no sign of respite from the ongoing market uncertainty due to apprehensions of a trade war. On the one hand, Asian stocks have started to revive on improvement in U.S-North Korea relationship while on the other hand, investors are restraining themselves on possibilities of trade loss due to the proposed China trade restrictions.Medical Device Caught in the Trade War StormGoing by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billionin medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus.Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade. MedTech trade group AdvaMed made a more specific comment claiming that the Chinese tariffs account for more than half of all MedTech imports from the region (in a MassDevice article). The trade group stated that, “for our industry, the proposed additional tariff of 25% on imports of nearly $3bn of medical technology products is the wrong action at the wrong time.""AdvaMed countered United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) claim of China’s unfair trade practices in medical devices harming U.S. exports significantly. The group argued that the U.S. trades with China on medical devices on the USTR list are in fact in slight surplus. Accordingly, if the proposed tariffs on diagnostic products and other medical devices made in both the United States and China are not dropped, it may result in trade imbalance.Per RBC Capital Markets estimates, if the proposed 25% tariffs get implemented, this could cost the medical device industry up to $1.5 billion each year.Going by the latest update, per a Financial Express report, a bipartisan group of 40 lawmakers has urged US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer to remove $3 billion worth of medical devices from the list of Chinese products proposed by the Trump administration for additional tariff.Investors in Trouble?With the risk of a trade war between the two largest economies heightening, investment in medical device stocks is taking a backseat.The proposed imposition of additional tariff on Chinese products and China’s retaliatory efforts have resulted in widespread share losses so far in the Medical device sector. Bearish emerging market trade outlook has dealt severe blows to the bigwigs. We note that the sector has gained significantly from profits earned by a number of medical device companies from the BRIC nations.In this regard, we note that stocks like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), GE Healthcare (GE  -  Free Report) and others are witnessing considerable weakness since Mar 23, when talks of a U.S.-China trade war started doing the rounds. We note that Medtronic earlier bought orthopedic devices maker, China Kanghui Holdings and since then has been consistently shipping products to the United States from this operation. If these shipments are now subject to additional tariff, it will definitely hamper the company’s China business.GE Healthcare has also urged the administration to remove certain parts from the list of Chinese products for additional tariff. Going by a Mass Device report, China produced parts are essential for a number of GE’s devices, including ultrasound machines, patient monitors, MRI machines, CT machines and X-ray machines, some of which are produced by GE owned facilities in China while others are produced by local Chinese companies.3 MedTech Stocks to Counter the Trade Restriction HazardConcerns about the implementation of the trade tariffs on MedTech products have been weighing on stocks lately. Even though the market has not yet shown any steady plunge, such fears are likely to dampen investor sentiment going forward.We have shortlisted three MedTech stocks, which, in spite of the tumultuous market conditions, are well poised on strong fundamentals and timely strategic developments. Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Growth Score and Zacks Rank.We have narrowed down our choices with the help of our new Style Score system.Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report): Although, the company has a strong presence in overseas markets, it has no such business relation with China. Hence, in spite of considering international diversification as a core component of the company’s strategy, the company can very well sidestep the volatility of the U.S.-China trade war and continue to enjoy the bountiful scope offered by emerging markets. The company, in fact, is benefiting from developing countries' incremental investments in health care systems.Baxter has a Growth Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2. The company has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 16.3%, higher than the industry’s 10.3%.Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report): In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Varian Medical’s global market share growth was driven by orders-based share gains in EMEA. In fact, Varian Medical was awarded a contract for eight TrueBeam systems in Stockholm, Sweden. Further, the company signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based, Sirtex, which focused on interventional oncology therapies. This apart, Varian Medical has recently announced the opening of a new facility in Jundiaí, Brazil, which extends its global manufacturing and training footprint in the region. Although Varian Medical has business in Greater China, the company’s huge global base outside the country shields it from severe damage that may occur as a result of the trade restriction.Varian Medical has a Growth Score of B and a Zacks Rank #2.ABIOMED, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report): Just like Baxter, despite having strong international foothold, ABIOMED does not have any significant presence in China. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Germany and Japan witnessed strong adoption of the exclusive Impella product line. In Germany, revenues grew 95% in the fourth quarter and 70% in fiscal 2018. In Japan, Abiomed exceeded expectations and expects to add $10 million in revenues in fiscal 2019.ABIOMED has a Growth Score of B and a Zacks Rank #1.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

137,VAR,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3.6% over the past month. BAX hit a new 52-week high of $73.04 in the previous session. Baxter International has gained 12.2% since the start of the year compared to the -0.8% move for the Medical sector and the 9% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 26, 2018, Baxter International reported EPS of $0.7 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.62 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.13%.For the current fiscal year, Baxter International is expected to post earnings of $2.89 per share on $11.37 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.53% change in EPS on a 7.65% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.22 per share on $11.89 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.51% and 4.61%, respectively.Valuation MetricsBaxter International may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for BAX? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Baxter International has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 25.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.5X versus its peer group's average of 19.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.87. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus | Baxter International Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Baxter International currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Baxter International meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though BAX shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Baxter International Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Baxter International have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including BioLife Solutions (BLFS  -  Free Report), Surmodics (SRDX  -  Free Report), and Varian Medical Systems (VAR  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Baxter International. Still, the fundamentals for BAX are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.

138,VAR,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) recently launched Velocity 4.0, a new version of its flagship Velocity cancer imaging platform. The system will enhance patient-specific 3D imaging and radiation dosimetry for targeted cancer therapy.Velocity 4.0 is designed for patients with liver malignancies and includes Rapidsphere — a module for Y90 Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) dosimetry analysis.We believe that Varian Medical’s strategy to target the radiation-dosimetry market is a timely one, considering higher profits in the niche space. Per a report by the Business Wire, the global market for radiation dosimeters is projected to witness a CAGR of 5-5.5% by 2022.Notably, Velocity 4.0 and the Rapidsphere module have received 510(k) clearances from the FDA, earlier.Shares UpVarian Medical’s shares have rallied 1.5% following the announcement and closed at $119.93.In fact, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company outperformed its industry in a year’s time. Precisely, the stock has returned 48.9%, comparing favorably with the industry’s rally of 26.8%. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500’s Index’s gain of 23.5%.Varian Medical’s Velocity Unit Driving GrowthVarian Medical’s Velocity platform is a major contributor of revenues, growing strong double-digits in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  Velocity oncology imaging informatics system is a vendor neutral software solution that collects and integrates oncology data pertaining to medical imaging, treatment and metadata helping the patient for ready data access.The system allows clinicians to measure changes over time, enable tumor delineation and evaluate cancer treatments using medical imaging data.After the inclusion of Rapidsphere software, Velocity will now provide the ability for cancer care teams to study tumor response and normal-tissue toxicity for individual patients receiving SIRT.Market Prospects BrightWhile the latest development focusses specifically on the liver-cancer space, Varian Medical has been a global leader in developing and delivering cancer care solutions of all types.A research report by Mordor Intelligence projects that the global liver cancer therapeutics market is expected to register a CAGR of 7- 12% from 2018 to 2023.However, aggressive rivalry in the niche markets is a headwind. Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies such as Siemens and Philips as well as with smaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers like Accuray.Key PicksA few better-ranked players in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Abaxis, Inc.

139,VAR,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is a prospective name in the global MedTech space. The stock has returned 30.7%, comparing favorably with the industry’s gain of 11.2% in a year’s time. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500 Index’s rally of 10.9%.With a market capitalization of approximately $10.7 billion, the stock has met earnings expectations in each of the past four trailing quarters. However, the company has been grappling with a few issues at the moment. Cutthroat competition and persistent softness in the markets for freestanding clinics are likely to hamper the company’s prospects. Thanks to this somewhat mixed trend, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a detailed look on the company’s performance and operations to analyze why investors should hold on to this stock.What’s Favoring Varian Medical?Varian Medical’s impressive performance in the Oncology business, improving margins and the launch of Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system are the key highlights at the moment.Favorable revenue opportunity from various Oncology and Imaging Component products, growing adoption of Proton Therapy, strong overseas presence, particularly in emerging countries, as well as new partnership deals are positives.The company has been a strong player in Latin America. Varian Medical announced the opening of a new facility in Jundiaí, Brazil, which extends its global manufacturing and training footprint in the region. Through the partnership with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, Varian Medical aims to bring greater access to advanced radiotherapy treatment in that country and to greater Latin America.We believe that the Brazil-based facility will provide access to advanced radiotherapy treatment in Latin America. In this regard, a research report by Market Data Forecast shows that the radiotherapy market in Latin America was worth $654 million in 2016 and is estimated to witness a CAGR of 6.5% to reach $897.7 million by 2021.Considering the bountiful prospects, Varian Medical is likely to grow manifolds, leveraging on its Oncology segment. Per an estimate by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization, annual cancer rates around the world are projected to increase from 14.1 million in 2012 to 20 million by 2025.We believe that higher demand for Varian Medical’s products from China, India and Brazil will continue to drive international revenues in the long run.For 2018, the company expects revenues in the range of 4-7%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the band of $4.24-$ 4.36, while cash flow from operations are projected in the range of $475-$550 million.What Are the Probable Headwinds?Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies such as Siemens and Philips as well as with smaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers like Elekta and Accuray.In the emerging proton therapy market, the company faces competition from Hitachi, Ion Beam Applications, Mevion Medical Systems and Sumitomo. Intense competition is anticipated to increase R&D expenditures in the nascent proton therapy market, which will keep margins under pressure. Moreover, pricing pressure in traditional radiotherapy is a major concern.Further, lackluster performance by the particle therapy segment has been a concern. Revenues in this segment declined 4% on a year-over-year basis to $29 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Why Should You Still Hold?Unhindered by the persistent issues, analysts are optimistic about Varian Medical.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is pegged at $4.31 per share, showing an increase of 1.2% in the last three months. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at $1.03, reflecting a rise of 5.1%.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Varian Medical Systems, Inc.

143,VAR,"Fortifying the Extremity Fixation portfolio, Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of FDA 510(k) clearance for the G-Beam Fusion Beaming System. This is in line with the company’s strategy to gain traction in the Charcot and Diabetic foot market segments.G-Beam system, an internal fixation system, aids in treating the Charcot foot condition. The G-Beam devices provide proper alignment, fixation and stabilization, when implanted in the medial and lateral columns of the foot and hence, reduce chances of an amputation.Per management, leveraging on the existing product lines, like TrueLok and the TL-HEX, the FDA approval for G-Beam devices will boost the internal fixation segment for Charcot foot treatment, as well as the top-line contributions from the Extremity Fixation SBU.Extremity Fixation SBU at a GlanceOrthofix’s Extremity Fixation strategic business unit (SBU) manufactures and distributes orthopedic products for treating fracture deformity correction, repair and bone reconstruction conditions. The company continues to witness impressive top-line contributions from this unit. In 2017, the segment accounted for 24% of total net sales.  The strength in the pediatric, and foot and ankle strategic product areas, along with solid performance in the business in the United States, drove the segment’s performance.Furthermore, management believes improving instrument set and inventory management in the Spine and Extremity Fixation SBU will expand the company’s gross margins in 2018.Market PotentialPer the company,severe neuropathy or nerve damage can cause Charcot foot. Moreover, it is a common diabetic foot complication with as many as 0.08-7.5% diabetic patients suffering from the condition.

Also, the company’s sale to assets ratio of 1.19 compared with the industry’s 0.64 signifies it as a sturdy growth pick.Let’s find out whether the recent positive momentum is a sustainable one.The company is a leading manufacturer of products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry. It exited the fourth quarter on a promising note. Stable year-over-year growth in organic revenues is also encouraging.The stock’s stellar performance was driven by robust sales at the CAG (Companion Animal Group)business. In the fourth quarter of 2017, CAG organic revenues rose low double digits on the back of strong CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth and VetLab consumables organic revenue growth. Additionally, we are upbeat about the company’s expanding premium instrument base in the United States and the international markets including improved competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and continued customer retention.In this regard, we are also optimistic about gains from the commercial launch of Catalyst SDMA Test in North America in January 2018. With this breakthrough, the company’s point-of-care customers will be able to add SDMA as an essential element to the routine chemistry panel.Continuing with a slew of developments, IDEXX Laboratories entered into a global agreement this January with the diagnostic company Applied BioCode.

145,VAR,"Leading its way through the growing market of Urology, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) has recently entered into an agreement to buy Minnesota-based NxThera for a deal value of up to $406 million. Privately-held NxThera is the developer and marketer of the Rezum system in the United States and Europe. The transaction is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.Financial Terms of the DealThe transaction consists of an upfront payment of $306 million in cash and up to an additional $100 million in potential commercial milestone payments over the next four years. Notably, the company has an existing minority investment in NxThera, expected to result in a net upfront payment of approximately $240 million upon closing and milestone fees of nearly $85 million.NxThera, Rezum and BPH: A Strategic Deal for BSX?For patients with symptoms arising from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), the Rezum system of NxThera comes as a minimally invasive therapy option. BPH or non-cancerous prostate gland enlargement is quite common among aged males, creating an attractive market. While the disease affects 110 million men worldwide, more than 12 million symptomatic men alone in the United States are undergoing treatment for the condition with medications or procedural approaches. Notably, BPH may cause symptoms affecting a patient's qualify of life such as pain and a frequent need to urinate. Among the many positives about the Rezum system of NxThera, we are impressed by its hassle-free procedure, which can be performed at a physician's clinic without general anesthesia, thereby reducing the cost of a BPH therapy to the core. Moreover, the treatment applies water vapor to remove excess prostate tissue, alleviating obstructions to urine flow. This further helps mitigating BPH-related symptoms and also prevents unwanted side effects that come along with the intake of maintenance medications to control BPH.Boston Scientific mentioned about two favorable clinical studies related to the Rezum system. Management stated that “A study published in the March issue of the Journal of Urology demonstrated that over a three-year period, patients treated with the Rezum system had clinical progression rates that were five times lower than the reported rates of patients treated with daily, long-term medications. Additional clinical data from a randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients treated with the Rezum system had a 51% reduction in their symptoms at 24 months post-treatment and maintained a 50 percent reduction in BPH symptoms at three years’ post-treatment.”Projected Synergies From the DealPost the deal’s closure, the buyout of NxThera is expected to remain immaterial to Boston Scientific’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) through 2020 and be only accretive afterwards. The consolidation is likely to be dilutive or less beneficial on a reported basis due to amortization and transaction and integration costs.We reckon that the Boston Scientific’s Urology Pelvic Health arm is one of its highest operating margin businesses. Per the company, acquisition of the AMS urology portfolio has burgeoned its urology business size to almost double at a value of $1 billion.Significantly, urology represents a $4-billion attractive global market potential with large unmet patient needs and considerable international expansion opportunities. We believe, this NxThera buyout post completion, will enable the company to capitalize on this opportunity.Share Price Performance Boston Scientific has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Last month, shares of the company have outperformed its broader industry. The stock has rallied 1.7% compared with the industry’s 1.5% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

146,VAR,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of two hemostat and sealant products from Mallinckrodt plc to widen its existing surgical portfolio of hemostats and sealants, especially for intraoperative bleeding. Notably, the company bought RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt.Baxter expects the deal to be modestly accretive to its 2018 adjusted earnings. Thereafter, the transaction deal will increasingly add capabilities to Baxter’s portfolio, driving its bottom line in turn.The Deal in DetailBaxter is buying RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK for an upfront payment of approximately $153 million and potential contingent payments in the near future. The deal was announced earlier in January. Baxter now gains major traction from RECOTHROM’s (only stand-alone recombinant thrombin) buyout, providing more options of innovative hemostatic products to surgeons for dealing with severities of bleeding. PREVELEAK (used in vascular reconstruction) complements the company’s existing portfolio of advanced surgical sealants.Baxter’s Surgical PortfolioBaxter’s surgical portfolio includes products like FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix, TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant, COSEAL Surgical Sealant and VASCU-GUARD Patch among others. The portfolio is composed of hemostasis (addressing bleeding), tissue sealing and hard tissue regeneration as well as soft tissue repair and microsurgery with products available in nearly 60 countries.The company consistently endeavors to improve its Advanced Surgery business. For 2018, the company expects advanced surgery business to increase 3-4% on constant currency basis.Baxter has also announced plans to focus on launching advanced surgery products in Japan in the coming days.Market PotentialPer a CISION report, the Global Surgical and Medical device market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 5.93% over the forecast period of 2017-2026, reaching a worth of $828.6 billion by 2026.

147,VAR,"Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report) recently announced its partnership with Penn Medicine to develop and launch a comprehensive proton therapy training and education program. Management at Varian confirmed that training and online courses will be available from January 2018.The latest development is likely to enhance the knowledge and skills of clinicians and therapists in the global proton therapy space. In fact, continued education and training are likely to boost the availability of proton therapy products in the niche markets.The Proton Therapy Space at a GlanceProton therapy or proton beam therapy is a type of particle therapy that uses a beam of protons to treat diseased tissue, most often in the cases of cancer. A research report by the CISION PR Newswire suggests that the global proton therapy systems market is expected to reach $2.88 billion by 2025.Favorable reimbursement policies in the United States and Europe and rising awareness in cancer-related healthcare policies along with expenditures in emerging nations are likely to propel the proton therapy space in the long haul. In fact, various reports suggest that this proton therapy space will be dominated by the United States, thanks to its massive investment in the development of therapy centers.Now coming to the leading players in the space, Hitachi, Ion Beam Applications, Mevion Medical Systems and Sumitomo also deserve a mention. Meanwhile, proton therapy market is growing in manifolds and expects to witness a stellar demand in the coming days.Varian’s Strong FootholdApart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe proton therapy also holds significant promise for Varian. This is because the company’s flagship — ProBeam Compact Proton Therapy System — is superior to other external beam radiotherapies available in the markets.ProBeam precisely locates cancerous tumors, thereby causing lesser side-effects to surrounding tissues. In this regard, Varian’s proton therapy portfolio has products like ProBeam Proton Therapy System, ProBeam Compact Single-Room Proton Therapy Solution, ProBeam Multi-Room Proton Therapy Solution.However, the company has seen lackluster performance at the proton therapy segment recently. In the last quarter, revenues at the segment were $52 million, down 23% on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, Varian booked two orders including the Concord Medical Proton Center in Guangzhou, China for $52 million and HCG in India for $19 million. Yet, proton therapy orders grew 94% in the same period, on a year-over year basis.We believe such developments might help Varian to gain traction in the niche space.Shares Shine BrightOver the past six months, Varian outperformed the broader industry in terms of price performance. The company returned 15.1% comparing favorably with the broader industry’s gain of just 6.7%. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500’s gain of 7.2% over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderVarian has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report).Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The stock has a Zacks Rank #1.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20.4%.

148,VAR,"Varian Medical Systems (VAR  -  Free Report) recently announced plans of opening a new facility in Jundiai, Brazil, reflecting its long-term commitment and partnership with the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The facility has been fully-equipped to provide Varian Trilogy linear accelerator for hands-on training to physicians. Notably, the manufacturing and warehousing areas of the facility are expected to be operational by 2018-end.The latest development closely follows the receipt of Shonin approval from the Japan Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to market the Varian Halcyon system, an exclusive platform for cancer treatment through image-guided volumetric intensity modulated radiotherapy.Varian has been continuously focusing on boosting its global education and training department. The latest facility is located in the Multivias Industrial Park and has a demonstration room and two training classrooms.Management at Varian expects to provide training to up to 300 clinicians and therapists on the use of radiotherapy equipment, treatment plans and techniques.Global Growth in FocusWe believe the facility will provide access to advanced radiotherapy treatment across Latin America, particularly in the Brazilian oncology market. In this regard, a research report by Market Data Forecast shows that the radiotherapy market in Latin America was worth $654 million in 2016 and is estimated to see a CAGR of 6.5% to reach $897.7 million by 2021. Considering the bountiful prospects, Varian is likely to grow manifolds, leveraging on its Oncology segment.Notably, Varian received regulatory clearances to market Halcyon in the United States and Europe recently.In Italy, the company recently announced the initiation of treatment using its HyperArc High Definition Radiotherapy (HDRT), a new type of radiosurgery treatment, at Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Cancer Care Center in Negrar-Verona.In Algeria, Varian conducted a three-day workshop for radiotherapy practitioners in September. Varian has 30 systems operating in Algeria at the moment.The company’s strong overseas presence is expected to enable it to cash in on this opportunity in emerging markets.Share Price Moves UpOver the past six months, Varian has outperformed the broader industry in terms of price. The company has returned 13%, comparing favorably with the sub-industry’s gain of just 7.9%. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500’s gain of 8.5%.Our TakeVarian’s expanding international presence is likely to be the only factor boosting investor sentiments, given the company’s lackluster results in the just-reported fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. In fact, the company’s oncology gross orders declined 9% year over year at constant currency in the APAC region. We believe Varian’s recent initiative to boost its presence in Latin America will lead to growth in the APAC region.However, Varian competes with large electronic companies as well as smaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers like Accuray Incorporated (ARAY  -  Free Report) and C. R. Bard, Inc. . Thus, cutthroat competition in the niche space is likely to impede the company’s sales growth.Zacks Rank and Key PickVarian has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

151,VAR,"The third-quarter earnings season has commenced on an encouraging note for most sectors, with releases from 87 S&P 500 participants (24.7% of the total market cap) till October 20.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these members rose 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues. With 180 S&P 500 members lined up for releasing their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to put up an impressive show in the quarter. For Q3, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 2.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate during the second-quarter of 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Medical Products Amid Political UncertaintiesHowever, the Medical Product space, within the broader Medical universe, has been a precarious game for the Republicans since day one, courtesy of President Trump’s repeated failure to repeal and replace Obamacare.However, major MedTech players have been pinning their hopes on the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though the elimination of this tax is far from being achieved.Considering these tax issues, investors interested in the Medical Product space will likely keenly await earnings reports from MedTech bigwigs like Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report), Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., (TMO  -  Free Report) and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report). Notably, all the companies are expected to release their earnings results on Oct. 25.For the third quarter, Baxter anticipates sales growth of about 4% at constant currency (cc). Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 58-60 cents versus the year-ago figure of 56 cents. We believe the company’s solid sales in the Medical Products segment will be a key driver in the third quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment stands at $1,648 million, up 4.2% on a year-over-year basis (read more: Baxter International Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?).Despite the solid prospects, our quantitative model does not conclusively show a beat for the company, given the combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of -0.34%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LabCorp’s third-quarter revenues stands at $2.56 billion, up 6.2% year-over-year.LabCorp is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA).

152,VAR,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) recently presented favorable real-world data from the TRUE-HD study at the annual congress of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA). This latest move is in line with the company’s strategy to gain traction in the global Electrophysiology (EP) market, which is poised to reach a value of around $4.73 billion by 2019 (as per data by Markets and Markets).Study Results in DetailThe observational, prospective, non-randomized study — TRUE-HD study — covered 572 patients suitable for cardiac mapping and ablation for treating arrhythmia. However, the patients diagnosed with de novo atrial fibrillation were not enrolled under the study.Notably, the TRUE-HD study evaluated the procedural process, acute success and safety for the mapping and ablation of various clinical arrhythmias.Per the company, the study results displayed the safety and efficacy of RHYTHMIA Mapping System when used with INTELLAMAP ORION Mapping Catheter for mapping and supporting the treatment of different types of arrhythmias. Also, it included the cases where ablation of atrial fibrillation based on other techniques was a failure. RHYTHMIA Mapping Systemis a catheter-based, 3D cardiac mapping and navigation solution for helping in diagnosing and treating different types of arrhythmias.  A Glimpse of the EP BusinessBoston Scientific’s EP business develops less-invasive medical technologies to diagnose and treat disorders of heart rate and rhythm.Revenues at this division in fourth-quarter 2017 improved 20.7% year over year to $77 million (up 17.7% at CER). The upside was driven by higher uptake of the new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. Management continues to roll out the HDx platform in Europe and recently launched it in the United States as well as Japan.Overall, the company continues to expand the toolkit that supports RHYTHMIA HDx, providing ablation technologies that match the excellence of its Mapping System. Additionally, it focuses on adding tools that expand the reach and utility of RHYTHMIA HDx in different procedures. In this regard, Boston Scientific expects the full-fledged commercialization of DirectSense technology in Europe and the United States in 2018 followed by a successful initial launch in Europe.Moreover, in order to expand its EP business, Boston Scientific acquired Apama Medical Inc in October 2017. The company also intends to integrate its RHYTHMIA HDx Mapping System with Apama RF balloon system to improve the visualization of the heart during ablation processes.Market PotentialBoston Scientific’s strategy to boost the EP business seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiac Rhythm Management market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.6% from 2016 to 2022 to reach a value of $32,216 million.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in aging population should continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular disease market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019, and within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%.Share Price PerformanceBoston Scientific has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Last month, shares of the company have outperformed its broader industry. The stock has rallied 10.2% compared with the industry’s 3.8% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

153,VAR,"On Mar 19, we issued an updated research report on Wright Medical Group N.V. (WMGI  -  Free Report). Wright Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company is focusing on strategic acquisitions and divestitures. However, foreign currency fluctuation remains a woe.The company recently completed the acquisition of IMASCAP SAS, a leader in the development of software-based solutions for preoperative planning of shoulder replacement surgery. Management is also quite optimistic about its recent acquisition of BLUEPRINT. Also, Wright Medical’s decision to sell off its OrthoRecon unit to MicroPort Medical B.V., a subsidiary of MicroPort Scientific Corp, bodes well for the company. The company recently reported fourth-quarter results, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company witnessed growth in all business segments. Also, the expansion in gross margin buoys optimism.  Wright Medical is focusing on product innovation through research and development. The company recently launched INVISION Total Ankle Revision System — the first system developed for total ankle revision arthroplasty.Wright Medical derives significant part of its total revenues from international operations, which is being adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A strong U.S. dollar is denting the company’s international revenues and subsequently putting pressure on its gross margin.Also, a lackluster international performance of the lower extremities segment is raising concerns. Also, pricing pressure continues to trouble Wright Medical. Increased costs related to product launch and re-building infrastructure are expected to put pressure on margins. Problems associated with distributors are major headwinds.In the past six months, Wright Medical has underperformed the industry. The company’s shares have lost 19.9% as against the industry’s rally of almost 10.8%.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

154,VAR,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) announced positive results from two analyses conducted on AdaptivCRT algorithm at the European Heart Rhythm Association (“EHRA”) Scientific Sessions 2018 in Barcelona, Spain.The study demonstrated that AdaptivCRT algorithm reduces atrial fibrillation (""AF"") episodes, along with higher patient activity levels. The results were based on 408 heart failure patients with Medtronic cardiac resynchronization therapy (""CRT"") device at 26 centers in Italy.The ResultsThe first study showed a significant reduction in the occurrence of AF episodes of all measured durations in 210 patients with AdaptivCRT ON compared to 198 patients with traditional CRT.  The second study revealed AdaptivCRT was linked with a higher daily activity level for patients with the feature ON compared to patients with conventional CRT.Per the company, CRT is an established treatment for patients with heart failure who use an implantable defibrillator (CRT-D) or pacemaker (CRT-P) to enhance the heart’s pumping efficiency.The AdaptivCRT Platform at a GlanceIn medicine, a CRT resynchronizes the contractions of heart's ventricles by sending electrical impulses to the heart muscle. Thus, CRT helps the heart pump blood throughout the body more efficiently and is a very promising technique in the markets of cardiac rhythm management and heart failure.Medtronic’s AdaptivCRT platform minutely evaluates cardiac rhythms on the back of two pacing operations, namely, Adaptive LV and Adaptive Bi-V.Of the major CRT platforms of Medtronic, Claria MRI CRT-D SureScan and Percepta CRT-P MRI SureScan deserve a mention.Developments in Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure DivisionThe company is consistently trying to improve its Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division — part of Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG). In line with this, Medtronic recently announced the receipt of FDA approval and commercial launch of its portfolio of Azure pacemakers with BlueSync technology. In May 2017, Medtronic received the FDA’s approval for quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-Ps) that improve therapy delivery for patients with heart failure.Market PotentialPer a GlobalData report, the global heart failure market is set to reach a worth of $11.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 13.7%. Considering the bullish market sentiments, we believe that the latest development is a timely one.Stock Performance & Estimate RevisionOver the past month, shares of Medtronic have underperformed the industry. The stock has dipped 0.6% as against the industry’s 2.5% and the S&P 500 index’s 0.2% gain.Also, the estimate revision trend for the current year is unfavorable with 12 estimates moving south over the last two months compared with one in the opposite direction.

155,VAR,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings of $1.04 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents. However, adjusted earnings declined from $1.22 in the year-ago period.Factors at PlayWe are upbeat about Varian Medical’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenue in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the company has been addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has also been winning international contracts in the oncology space. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Varian expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.15-$1.23. Revenues are expected to increase about 3% on a year-over-year basis.The company recently launched its FDA-approved product Halcyon, to strengthen foothold in the oncology business. Varian Medical also signed an agreement with Vijametech and UPMC to establish radiation oncology centers in Vietnam. We are also upbeat about Varian’s prospects internationally, where it primarily banks on proton therapy as an advanced treatment option for cancer patients. In this regard, we note that Varian Medical recently received Shonin approval in Japan to market the ProBeam system for proton therapy.Varian Medical recently entered into two international agreements concerning its Proton therapy platform. Bangkok-based King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital has selected its ProBeam Compact single-room proton therapy system for cancer treatment in Thailand along with Delray Medical Center in Florida.We believe Western Europe, China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunities in the near term. The company is opening offices in Africa and the Middle East, which depicts that it is aware of opportunities in the region. Moreover, Varian Medical’s strong product pipeline is a key catalyst.Nevertheless, increasing local competition is a primary headwind. Unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations and higher operating expenses pertaining to increased investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Varian Medical this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Varian Medical currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.19. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Varian Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision. Varian Medical Systems, Inc.
