0,RJF,"The stock market closed near session highs, making some hefty gains as Nasdaq heavyweights Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) seemed to find a second wind.X The S&P 500 climbed 0.9%. Mining, steel and coal were the best-performing industry groups of the day, rallying as much as 4.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.7%. Small caps sprung back to life as the Russell 2000 leaped 1.4%. Volume fell, according to unconfirmed figures.The Nasdaq increased 1.4% also. Of importance to chart readers, the composite bounced after pulling back to its 50-day moving average. A few of the Nasdaq's top components made similarly positive moves at that key price indicator.Google parent Alphabet made a bullish price reversal, closing with a gain of 1.3% and slightly back above the 50-day moving average. That line has continued to trend higher despite Alphabet's sell-off two weeks ago. Facebook found support at the 50-day line much the same way the Nasdaq did. Microsoft (MSFT) reversed higher after a brief dip below its 50-day line.Financials continued the week's advance, and several high-rated stocks in the sector topped buy points. But in most cases, volume was insufficient to believe institutional investors were buying heavily.Raymond James Financial (RJF) broke out of a cup-with-handle base, clearing the 79.65 buy point. Volume rose 40% above average, a good indication of institutional buying. The financial services firm ramped up earnings 45%, 66% and 42% the past three quarters.Fair Isaac (FICO) rose above the 139.10 buy point of a base-on-base pattern. Shares closed above the entry, but volume was about just average. The consumer credit-rating agency has a mediocre EPS Rating, but its chart shows constructive action.Guaranty Bancorp (GBNK) moved past the 26.60 buy point of a cup with handle, but volume in this move was about half the stock's normal volume. Lazard (LAZ) tried to break out past the 47.19 buy point of a flat base, but closed below the entry. Volume was 27% below average, which only added to doubts about the breakout attempt.Only a dozen stocks fell in Stocks On The Move, an unusually low number. On that list, Gildan Activewear (GIL) broke a productive streak as it tumbled 2% in active trading. The stock is still 5% above its 29.34 buy point. The company announced late Tuesday the resignation of Patrik Frisk from its board to become chief operating officer at Under Armour.RELATED:JPMorgan, Bank Of America Lead Bank Rally Amid Strong Payout HopesGoldman: TrumpCare Is Toast, S&P 500 Falling To Here By Year's EndFacebook: 2 Billion Served And Counting As Milestone Reached

That decision was effective Friday.Urban Outfitters, Frontier and First Solar will be replaced by chip company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Raymond James Financial (RJF) and REIT Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE).Urban Outfitters fell more than 1% in late trading on the stock market today, while Frontier edged lower and First Solar lost 2%.AMD, one of the hottest stocks over the past year as its chips benefit from booming new markets, rose more than 5% late after surging almost 7% during the past week.

It replaces Harman International (HAR), a company bought by Samsung on Friday that makes car audio systems and connected-car technology.The swap-out comes after S&P Dow Jones Indices on Friday said that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose chips and graphics processors lifted its stock last year, investment firm Raymond James Financial (RJF) and real estate investment trust Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) would be added to the S&P 500 on March 20.The decision to add those stocks was the result of higher minimum market-cap guidelines for the index that took hold Friday. The new guidelines call for a market cap of at least $6.1 billion, up from $5.3 billion.Those guidelines were raised following a 5.5% rise in the index year to date and a 19% jump over the past 12 months, and were intended to reflect the index's market-cap range, S&P Dow Jones Indices said  Friday.The addition of AMD, Raymond James and Alexandria Real Estate came at the expense of apparel retailer Urban Outfitters (URBN), communications outfit Frontier Communications (FTR) and solar-energy company First Solar (FSLR), which will all be removed from the S&P 500 on March 20.Shares of Synopsys, which has a Composite Rating of 97, were up 0.4% in late trading on the stock market today, after closing 0.4% higher at 72.09.

4,RJF,"The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite will look to bounce back after snapping multi-week win streaks. All three indexes did enjoy slim gains on Thursday and Friday.But futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index fell 0.2% vs. fair value as of early Monday morning in New York. Nasdaq 100 futures edged down less than 0.1%.Advanced Micro Devices[ticker symb=AMD] is likely to see further gains on Monday, while First Solar (FSLR) and Urban Outfitters (URBN) should fall as the S&P 500 index is reshuffled. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) and U.S. Steel (X) will try to regain key support levels?Crude oil futures slipped to about $48 a barrel overnight.Last week U.S. crude oil futures prices crashed 9% to $43.49 amid booming U.S. production and stockpiles, pressuring Dow components Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as a slew of other energy stocks. Meanwhile, Treasury yields tested recent peaks ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting, with policymakers expected to raise rates by a quarter-point on March 15.AMD, Raymond James Financial (RJF) and REIT Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) will join the benchmark S&P 500 index before the open on March 20, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday. Meanwhile, Urban Outfitters, First Solar and Frontier Communications (FTR) will be removed.AMD shares jumped 5% in late trade Friday following news of the S&P 500 changes. That follows last week's near-7% rebound as the chipmaker found support just above its 50-day line. AMD has surged 515% in the 12 months ended Friday.Raymond James Financial and Alexandria Real Estate showed more modest moves late Friday. Meanwhile, First Solar, Urban Outfitters and Frontier Communications retreated.Tesla and U.S. Steel fell every day last week, with both slipping below their 50-day lines.The 50-day moving average is technically important, because it's an area where mutual funds and other big institutions often step to support a stock and add to holdings. But it can also act as a ceiling.Tesla has pulled back since its mixed earnings report and CEO Elon Musk's admission that his company may raise fresh capital because he said Model 3 spending will push cash levels ""close to the edge."" Tesla also recently disclosed that it does not have a final Model 3 ""prototype B"" with factory parts, even as production is supposed to start in July and rapidly pick up steam.U.S. Steel and other steel makers such as Nucor (NUE) have been making moves above and below their 50-day for several weeks. Steel stocks soared after the election as investors saw the sector benefiting from President Trump's proposed tax cuts, infrastructure spending and trade protectionism. But it's unclear when or if such policies will be enacted.China's short-message social network Weibo (WB), which has fallen from highs following its latest earnings report in late February, also undercut its 50-day line last week.Japan's Nikkei index rose 0.2% Monday intraday, China's Shanghai composite advanced 0.6% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.25%.RELATED:These Three Companies Will Get Yanked From The S&P 500 IndexTesla Goes Into Reverse After Q4 Loss; Musk Says Cash 'Close To The Edge'What You Need To Know As An Investor This Week: Investing Action PlanU.S. Oil Rig Count Highest September 2015 As Crude Caps 9% Weekly Loss

5,RJF,"Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities Fund's (FIGWX) recent surge since the elections and since the Federal Reserve's December rate hike has given retirement-account and other investors reason to cheer.In the trailing three months going into Thursday, the $300 million fund's 10.45% gain topped 93% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged an 8.66% advance. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, gained 8.33%.For the Nuveen fund, that's way better than the mere 34% of direct rivals it outpaced in the past 12 months with a not-so-shabby 24.20% return.The difference between now and the earlier period? Within their overall investment approach, fund managers Harold Goldstein and David Chalupnik favored stocks likely to get an extra tailwind from the elections and from rising rates. Those had to be stocks that fit their basic approach, which is the pursuit of stocks they think will have faster earnings growth than the market expects.They paid for that by cutting stable and defensive consumer staples stocks by 7% in the fourth quarter and consumer discretionary stocks by 6%, the fund's fourth-quarter commentary notes.The managers pumped up their financials by 7%, mostly the day after the elections. They boosted technology by about 3% and energy by 2%.They began positions in Signature Bank (SBNY), SVB Financial (SIVB), Raymond James (RJF) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).All of those newcomers have very strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the high 80s or 90s. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.In addition to a sterling 96 Comp Rating, SVB Financial is the No. 3-ranked bank in IBD's superregional industry group, thanks to growth metrics like four years in a row of earnings per share (EPS) growth and a 39.7% annual pretax margin.IBD'S TAKE: SVB Financial is ranked No. 3 in the No. 1-rated Banks-Super Regional group. See which superregional bank is No. 1, and how these financials stack up on easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.The bank is headquartered in Silicon Valley, a hotbed of innovation. Its nonbanking businesses include asset management, private wealth management, brokerage and investment services, funds management, and business valuation services.Raymond James is No. 2 in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank-Bankers group. It is propelled by factors like its fourth-quarter 47% EPS growth and eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds.In tech, the fund opened a position in Broadcom (AVGO), a chipmaking company whose EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters. On IBD's Leaderboard, the company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and broadband communications.Goldstein and Chalupnik like the semiconductor space's economic sensitivity. And they like Broadcom's role among leaders of consolidation within its industry.In energy, the fund added new positions in Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE), and added to its stake in Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).""(We) added exposure to several growth-oriented exploration and production firms as a result of the generally improved outlook for oil pricing and supply,"" the managers wrote.In health care, the fund's overall weight stayed basically unchanged in the immediate postelection period. But the fund made individual stock moves.It started a stake in Incyte (INCY), which the managers call a fast-growing young biotech firm with an exciting pipeline of cancer-fighting treatments.To pay for Incyte, the fund used proceeds from the sale of two drugmakers, Allergan (AGN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which it had owned a long time.The managers think Allergan has grown so large that it can no longer grow much faster than its industry. They sold Bristol-Meyers because test results dimmed the outlook for a lung cancer therapy it was developing.The managers summarized their approach this way: ""The portfolio continues to be reasonably balanced from a sector standpoint as well as measured by other factors. The fund's largest overweight is in the area of companies with high growth potential that we believe can perform well somewhat independent of the economic cycle. We are always looking for exceptional growth companies that we believe have solid and/or improving fundamentals, a reasonable valuation and an approaching catalyst.""RELATED:Why This Victory Munder Fund Likes Semiconductor Gear Makers And Non-ObamaCare Health StocksWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

6,RJF,"Now that President Trump has ordered a delay of the Labor Department's controversial new fiduciary rule, which industry groups potentially stand to gain the most?The rule, which is slated to take effect April 10, requires financial advisors and brokers to recommend investments in the best interests of clients instead of those merely suitable. That would force advisors and brokers to put clients' interest ahead of their own profit.Financial firms have been deeply concerned about the potential effects of the new rule since it was approved last year. They fear it will hike advisory costs, making it less affordable for lower-income clients. That's why the delay has sharply boosted major banks and investment brokers.As of Thursday, 10 financial-related industry groups made the top 20 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD. Life insurance, investment bankers and brokers, and money center banks have seen big recent gains.The life insurance group includes highly rated stocks such as Primerica (PRI), which bears a 98 Composite Rating but is extended from a 73.15 flat-base buy point. The Duluth, Ga.-based insurer is a Leaderboard member. Lincoln National (LNC), with a 91 Composite, is near the top of its buy range from a 69.69 flat-base entry. New issue Athene Holdings (ATH) (95) is extended from a 48.82 buy point of a flat base. Shares have rallied nearly 30% from a 40 offering price at the Dec. 9 debut.The investment bank group includes asset managers such as Raymond James Financial (RJF), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Piper Jaffray (PJC). Raymond James is trading near all-time highs as shares ride the 50-day moving average higher. The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based company shares the top Composite Rating, 99, in the 30-stock group.The money center banks group, which includes Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS),  jumped 3% Feb. 3 on the news of the delay. The group remains near highs, following a 24% rally from its close on Nov. 8, election day, to its Jan. 13 peak.All the above stocks (except Athene) have posted 28% or better gains since Trump was elected Nov. 8, amid views that he would loosen regulation in the financial market.IBD'S TAKE: Primerica and Lincoln National are among financial and insurance stocks enjoying a ""Trump Bump."" Find out who some others are in this recent Sector Leaders article.Morgan Stanley owns the top Composite, 98, in the group. Shares are far extended from a 32.47 cup-with-handle buy point first cleared in October. The stock triggered the 20% to 25% profit-taking rule in November and has been making new highs. Bank of America's 95 Composite is second best in the group. Shares of the Charlotte, N.C.-based banking giant have bounced off the 50-day line after consolidating sideways the past two months. They tripped the profit-taking rule in late November.Goldman Sachs (also 95), which entered the profit-taking zone in mid-November, also has found support at its 50-day moving average. It's now extended from a bounce off the line near 232.Proponents of Trump's delay action include the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade organization. ""ICI supports a delay in implementation of the current DOL fiduciary rule,"" ICI President and CEO Paul Schott Stevens said in a statement. ""The Administration should use this time to address flaws in the rule and pursue a harmonized standard across the retail and retirement marketplace, coordinating with the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure investors' best interests are paramount.""The Financial Planning Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, issued a statement saying it ""strongly opposes"" Trump's delay: ""By issuing this memorandum, the President is directing the Department of Labor to produce an outcome that will likely lead to either a complete gutting of this thoroughly vetted consumer protection or lead to its outright demise. Either one is a bad outcome for American retirement savers.""RELATED:Trump Orders Delay Of Labor Department Fiduciary RuleJPMorgan, Charles Schwab, Goldman Jump On Trump's Regulatory Rollback

8,RJF,"The postelection stock market euphoria got a slight damper at the end of November as mutual fund investors realized global economies were still facing a lot of uncertainties, which could spur further volatility.The S&P 500 soared to its high of 2213.35 on Nov. 25. It then gave back a small portion of its gains to end the month up 3.4%. Friday's positive job-market report helped equities tick back up as unemployment came in at a surprise 4.6%, the lowest level in nine years. With that, a Fed rate hike in December is nearly a certainty.U.S. diversified equity mutual funds on average surged 5.19% in November, bringing their yearly return to 9.1%, according to Lipper Inc. By far, the winners were small-cap value funds, scoring an impressive 12.19% and boosting their 2016 gains to 22.47%. Their growth counterparts also did well, jumping 7.91% for a yearly gain of 9.18%.  Large-cap value funds rose 6.25%, while their growth counterparts only scored 0.72%. Equity income funds surged 4.13% in November and 11.49% year to date.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersBond mutual funds continued their downward slide with the 10-year Treasury yield surging 56 basis points and ending the month at 2.37%. Taxable fixed-income funds shed 1.68% on average, while municipal bond funds fell 3.37%.""Everything that we're analyzing — including taxes, trade, fiscal spending, deficits, interest rates, monetary policy, the dollar — all of these are very fluid situations,"" said Brian Flanagan, senior equity portfolio manager at Thrivent Asset Management and lead manager of the Thrivent Mid-Cap Stock Fund Class A (AASCX).Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance On top of these, there were a number of conflicts present around the world before the election, he pointed out. Events such as Brexit, as well as the French and German elections, could rattle the markets even further. Just recently, European Central Bank's Mario Draghi warned of the risks to innovation, competition and productivity in the U.K. and to a lesser extend in Europe if the U.K. were to adopt a protectionist stance in the areas of trade, migration and foreign direct investment.That said, Bill Nygren — partner and portfolio manager at Harris Associates and manager of the Oakmark Select Fund (OAKLX), Oakmark Fund (OAKMX) and Oakmark Global Select Fund (OAKWX) — believes that equities represent the most attractive asset class: ""P/Es are very slightly higher than historical averages, but when you compare that to other choices like cash, that's yielding almost zero, or long-term bonds that are yielding only a couple percent, that small premium to historical averages seems like a good deal for equities relative to bonds or cash.""Nygren warns against loading up on high-dividend-paying names in the equity market that have been used as a substitute for low yields in fixed income. Those include the relatively stable businesses such as utilities, telecom and consumer packaged goods. He points out that these companies ""typically haven't traded at a premium to the market multiple and multiples on these stocks today are quite high. So . . . the business models that have a little more volatility, like the financial service companies, that have very low valuations relative to their historical valuations, are not only more attractive, but potentially safer investments than the overpriced low-risk businesses.""A name he likes in his $15 billion Oakmark Fund is Ally Financial (ALLY), one of the largest auto financing companies. He likes the fact that Ally is highly profitable, meets its capital requirements, and is expected to aggressively buy back shares. ""Like the other financials, one of the reasons Ally is priced cheaply is investors overweight the memory of the financial collapse in 2007-08.""Despite Oakmark Fund's value tilt, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) is its largest holding besides the financials. Not only does he expect Google to grow faster than an average company in the S&P 500, but Nygren believes you get YouTube, AI and autonomous driving businesses nearly for free.OAKMX is up 16.57% year to date through Dec. 1, comfortably outpacing the S&P 500 by over 7% and ranking first among 1,369 of its Morningstar peers.Thrivent's Flanagan finds that regional banks provide a lot of value. The $1.5 billion Thrivent Mid-Cap fund holds financial names such as Zions Bancorp (ZION), First Republic Bank (FRC), Raymond James Financial (RJF) and KeyCorp (KEY). Their stocks have all made strong runs higher this year.The fund's largest holding is NVIDIA (NVDA). ""Their core market was gaming, which continues to do incredibly well. And they've created a common platform across a number of industries where they can use their graphic-processing units to accelerate development,"" said Thrivent's Flanagan. Those markets include autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and data centers.The stock slipped from new highs in the past week amid a broad chip pullback.Thrivent Mid-Cap Stock Fund has surged 24.76% in 2016, impressively ahead of gains by its peers and the S&P 500 of 9.41 and 12.13%, respectively. The fund's average three- and five-year returns are also solid, at 13.09% and 16.25%.Jeremy Javidi, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments and co-manager of $612 million Columbia Small-Cap Value Fund I (CSMIX), has an overweight in financial services, accounting for more than 33% of the fund's assets.""We're very positively inclined to insurance stocks. They benefit as interest rates rise,"" said Javidi. He purchased American Equity Investment Life (AEL) in April. The stock had sold off in an overreaction to the unveiling of the Department of Labor fiduciary rule. ""Our longtime horizon has allowed us to pull the trigger fast when we saw the market misinterpret what the future outlook would be for a stock like AEL,"" he said.He also bought UMB Financial (UMBF) in December 2015 at $47. ""A little-known fact is they're actually the sixth-largest HSA depository in the country. Those HSA deposits have grown 40% each of the last three years,"" Javidi said.He believes utilities and REITs are no longer attractive. Instead, he looks at dividend growth rather than dividend yield. Other sectors he's constructive on are health care and energy. His microcap value fund is up 27.55% year to date.Craig Hodges, CEO and CIO at Hodges Capital and manager of $356 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX), picks industries and companies that have high barriers of entry, such as cement, steel, corrugated paper and even airlines. The midcap stock fund holds names such as United States Steel (X), U.S. Concrete (USCR), Matador Resources (MTDR), American Airlines (AAL), Adidas (ADDYY) and Duluth Holdings (DLTH).

9,RJF,"The spike in borrowing costs in response to President-elect Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda is causing some heartburn in America's housing industry. San Diego mortgage broker Shanne Sleder said a third of his clients, many of whom were already stretching budgets to buy homes in pricey Southern California, are having to reconsider what they can afford as rates soar.""With a number of the people we were in the middle of preapproving, as rates are going up, it's getting tighter and tighter qualifying them,"" Sleder said. He's urging them to lock in rates. ""In some cases, the higher rates are making it so they are not as comfortable with the payment.""With investors anticipating faster expansion and inflation from Trump's policies, the yield on the U.S. 10-year note — a bellwether of changes in mortgage rates — has jumped more than 35 basis points since the Nov. 8 presidential election, the biggest three-day increase since 2009. Home loans may be beginning to follow suit: The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.94%, up from 3.57% last week and the highest since January, Freddie Mac (FMCC) said in a statement Thursday. The average 15-year rate rose to 3.14% from 2.88%, the McLean, Va.-based mortgage-finance company said.A sustained surge in borrowing costs could further hinder first-time purchases at a time when rising values are already hurting affordability and pricing out buyers in many markets. What's more, the backup in rates would leave the economy wanting of a boost from residential construction that's failed to contribute to growth for two consecutive quarters.""It's not helpful at all for the housing market, and it also bears watching in terms of how bad it gets,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James Financial (RJF) in St. Petersburg, Fla. The housing rebound ""could be even more moderate than it has been.""Larry Seay, who retired in March as chief financial officer of builder Meritage Homes (MTH), said rising rates will also limit the ability of developers to raise prices, pinching margins. Buyers will look for smaller, cheaper homes and builders will probably look for opportunities to accommodate them, he said.""It's going to be incumbent on builders to manage cost better because they won't be able to pass on the cost increases with higher home prices,"" Seay said.While mortgage rates remain near historic lows, action in funding markets is reminiscent of the so-called ""taper tantrum"" in 2013. That's when yields surged after then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that the central bank would soon start slowing the pace of bond purchases.In August 2013, after mortgage rates climbed above 4.5%, sales of previously owned homes proceeded to fall nearly 8% by year-end. Existing-home purchases are tallied a month or two after a contract has been signed.An increase in mortgage rates may prove temporary, though, because ""we still have a backdrop of slow global growth, low inflation and an aging populace in most developed markets,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at financial services company Bankrate. ""Those are factors that brought about low rates and kept rates low.""The nation's housing market has been grinding higher, helped by sturdy employment gains, nascent wage growth and attractive borrowing costs. A potential next leg up was first-time buyers. Higher mortgage rates that are sustained, however, would mean less buyer traffic of that segment of the market.""First-time buyers look at the monthly total, at what they can afford, so if the mortgage is eaten up by a higher interest expense then there's less left over for price, for the principal,"" said Tom Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies. ""Buyers will be shopping in a lower price bracket, thus demand could shift a bit.""Home prices are currently rising about 5% on a year-over-year basis. That's kept an index of housing affordability hovering near the lowest level since the end of 2008, according to the National Association of Realtors.Many buyers ""are already stretching to begin with,"" said Sleder, the San Diego broker, who works at West Coast Mortgage.

10,RJF,"Ahead of a busy week of earnings in the financial sector next week, several financials scored new highs Wednesday as major stock indexes ended with decent gains.After a low-volume breakout over a 35.21 cup-with-handle buy point, Western Alliance (WAL) cleared an alternate buy point of 38.65 Wednesday as shares added 0.99 to 39.04 in solid volume. It's in the early stages of breaking out of a long consolidation that started nearly one year ago when the stock hit an all-time high of 39.11.Raymond James Financial (RJF) picked up 0.92 to 59.48 in light trade. It's just above a 58.60 entry of a big cup-with-handle base.Small-cap FB Financial (FBK) cleared a short IPO base Wednesday, rising 0.91 to 21.85 in good volume. The buy point was 21.37.Several other thinly traded names in the financial sector scored new highs and could be in the early stages of bona fide breakouts. They included Wintrust Financial (WTFC), Stonegate Bank (SGBK), Pacific Continental (PCBK) and Bank of Hawaii (BOH).Constellation Brands (STZ) gapped up out of a flat base with a 168.78 entry on better-than-expected earnings. Shares of the wine, beer and spirits firm rose 2.75 to 168.60 but ended near session lows after trading as high as 173.55 . Constellation entered the high-end whiskey market this week with its $160 million acquisition of High West Distillery.Little-known Kar Auction Services (KAR) is no small potatoes with a market capitalization of just over $6 billion and an average daily volume of around 1.2 million shares. Shares rose 0.44 to 43.88 in decent turnover. It's still well within buy range from a 43.77 cup-with-handle buy point.Usana Health Sciences (USNA) picked up 0.62 to 143.72 in light volume. It closed just above a 143.06 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base.Oil prices rose sharply Wednesday, helping the cause of many domestic oil and gas producers. Parsley Energy (PE) added 1.40 to 35.42 in good volume, but it's extended. Wednesday's strong move might've looked like a breakout over a 35.10 buy point, but the pattern was too short to qualify as a flat base. A flat base takes a minimum of five weeks to form.RELATED:Citigroup, Bank Of America Join JPMorgan As Bank Breakouts

15,RJF,"A new Labor Department rule seeks to keep conflicts of interest out of the financial industry, but will it actually benefit you and other investors?The idea is to save each investor thousands of dollars -- perhaps every year -- by lowering fees, making investors' investment choices clearer, helping them avoid unnecessary costs by making their expenses clearer and by forcing brokers and financial advisors to guide them to potentially more productive investments even if they are less profitable for the broker or advisor.Brokers and financial advisors are scrambling to figure out what they must do to comply with the so-called fiduciary rule, which is due to take effect next April -- unless derailed by pending industry lawsuits. Firms are putting their own new rules in place for how to interact with clients -- what sorts of advice they'll be allowed to offer to investors like you, and what sorts they won't. They're updating software. And they're sorting out how to charge customers for service, with an earthquake tilt toward fees for service and fees on assets and away from commissions on transactions.The new rule will impact mainly brokers and financial advisors who help clients invest for retirement. About $1.9 trillion in investors' assets will be affected by 2020, according to a new study by global management consultant A.T. Kearney. It expects the asset shifts will involve about $23 billion in revenue, creating big winners and losers.Mutual fund complexes alone will see investors yank out $1 trillion in assets, Kearney says, costing them $14 billion in revenue. That tectonic shift is expected to result from investors fleeing fund fees that they perceive as too high or are steered into other investments by brokers and advisors, newly leery of violating the fiduciary rule.A swarm of pending lawsuits by players in the securities industry shows the industry's concern.Key plaintiffs include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Financial Services Institute, Financial Services Roundtable, Insured Retirement Institute, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), National Association of Fixed Annuities, American Council of Life Insurers and National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors.Individual investors should also be concerned. Sure, they should benefit from the new rule's prohibition against certain conflicts of interest.IBD'S TAKE: Wondering how to play the fiduciary rule fallout? See which publicly traded financial firms stand to benefit and which stand to lose in this IBD report.The rule will require brokers and advisors to put their clients' best interest before their own profit. Under the current standard, brokers and advisors can recommend investments so long as they are merely suitable for a client. That lets brokers and advisors recommend investments that are more profitable for them due to, say, commissions, even if other lower-cost investments would suit a client's need better.But the new rule will also have negative effects. ""Anything that has an impact of a reduction in personal touch, a potential increase in cost and/or a loss of continuity with professional advice could be characterized as negative,"" said Jason Grantz, managing sales director for the Eastern U.S. at Unified Trust Co. ""Several (effects) impact small accounts in particular."" The negatives include:To cope with changes your broker or advisor wants to implement, you might want to move assets to a firm that is prepared to deal with you in a manner more to your liking, Grantz says.On the other hand, individual investors may see benefits beyond just fewer conflicts of interest.You may see a decline in average expense ratios for funds offered to a firm's clients. That is the most frequently cited impact expected by asset managers polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, according to Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research for GMI.""Actively managed funds charge a premium for their efforts to outperform a benchmark, even though the majority of the survey respondents think that passive funds provide comparable returns to active investing,"" Rosenbluth writes in a new report.He added, ""Asset managers will need to be cognizant that advisors will be questioning whether their clients' best interest is being served by active funds that are more expensive than their peers.""Also, pricing transparency will increase, A.T. Kearney partner Uday Singh said.And simplified investment menus, the possible demise of high-fee funds with relatively poor track records and greater focus on low-cost passive funds will help investors meet their retirement savings goals, Rosenbluth says.As brokers and advisors seek to comply with the new rule, trillions in assets will shift among various types of financial firms between 2017 and 2020. Firms gaining assets will generally also gain revenue.Wirehouses -- big, full-service brokerages -- should see assets under management (AUM) decline by a net $300 billion, with a $4 billion decline in revenue, Kearney says. Their smaller competitors, known as independent broker-dealers in the industry, will likely be hurt by lower sales of high-commission products. They should lose $350 billion in AUM, causing a $3 billion loss in revenue.Also, costs of compliance will force smaller broker-dealers to consolidate.The ranks of winners should include registered investment advisors (RIAs), who already operate as fiduciaries, and robo-advisors. Relentless publicity about high fees and costs will prompt many self-directed individual investors to take their business away from brokers and advisors. Instead, Kearney forecasts, they will shift $150 billion in assets into funds they buy directly from mutual fund firms and into ETFs. Direct sellers of funds and ETFs stand to gain $1 billion in revenue, Kearney says.Wirehouses in the line of fire, Kearney says, include Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).Independent broker-dealers facing asset withdrawals include Raymond James (RJF) and Ameriprise (AMP).Vanguard, Betterment and Wealthfront offer robo-advisory services that stand to benefit from the shifts in assets. Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) are seen gaining inflow from self-directed investors.Retirement plan distributors like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price (TROW) could see a decline in revenue from 12b-1 fees -- annual marketing and distribution fees that are part of a fund's expense ratio. But they should benefit from assets staying inside 401(k) plans longer as fewer brokers and advisors urge workers and retirees to roll over money from company-sponsored retirement plans into IRAs, Kearney says.Fidelity is expanding its menu of ETFs and low-cost funds and its robo-advisory capacity. ""Fidelity is responding to what customers want with low-cost solutions and increasing its digital offerings,"" Singh said.""Digital offerings"" include not just robo-advisory services but also easier mobile and online service. ""That creates a frictionless user experience,"" Singh said. ""The question is, will Fidelity move far enough, quickly enough?""That same question applies to many financial firms in many categories, Singh adds.As for lawsuits by financial firms and organizations, which generally charge that the DOL overstepped its authority in creating the new rule, Chicago securities-fraud attorney Andrew Stoltmann, who is not involved in any of the cases, predicts that none will derail the new rule.""Because the DOL capitulated on so many issues that were so important to the securities industry in the final draft of the rule, I think that has made the rule relatively bulletproof in terms of judicial review,"" he said.RELATED:New, Tighter Retirement-Advice Rule Raises Industry ConcernsTips For Advisors Who Are Considering Partnering With A Broker-DealerThese Investors Will Soon Get More Robo-Advisors

16,RJF,"When longtime advisors reflect on their experience building their firm, they often focus on the first year. That's when they make crucial decisions that largely affect their future.In the first 12 months on their own, advisors race to land clients while controlling costs, engaging in community outreach and addressing administrative issues. The work can leave little time for sleep -- or friends and family.Yet the long-term rewards of persevering through Year One can more than offset the short-term sacrifice. By thinking strategically and tracking cash flow with care, advisors can set the stage for decades of career success as a financial advisor.""The first year taught me to have a really tough skin,"" said Helen Ngo, a certified financial planner in Atlanta. ""The first three to four months were grueling, but after that, people started coming around and I got clients.""Ngo, who launched her firm in 2014, says she grossed about $30,000 in her first year. Her firm has grown considerably since then, and she credits her resilience and her ability to apply lessons learned.When she established her firm, Ngo was hardly new to financial planning. She had spent six years at Raymond James (RJF).On her own, however, she started from scratch. For the first few months, she says her priority was ""sustaining myself financially.""That meant going door to door in search of potential prospects. She estimates that she was shooed away about 30% of the time. She also made cold calls and introduced herself to clusters of businesses in industrial parks.A low point of Ngo's first year involved a scheduled appointment at a prospect's home. Ngo showed up on time and rang the doorbell, but no one answered.""I could hear that they were home but they weren't opening the door,"" Ngo recalled. ""So I called and they wouldn't answer the phone. That was upsetting, and a very humbling experience.""But Ngo gained confidence as she built her practice. She found that ""emotionally preparing"" for setbacks made her stronger and more determined to succeed at cold calling.""This business is a numbers game,"" she said. ""I eventually did get clients that way.""She also tested new approaches to win business. She gave informative talks to graduating medical and dental students, and she attended medical seminars to mingle with young physicians.Rather than spend her first year seeking to accumulate assets under management, she started charging a monthly retainer. That altered the dynamic of her client relationships.""Changing my fee structure really helped,"" she said. ""People pay me for actual advice, even if they don't have a lot of money to invest.""Another change involved shifting from a physical office to a virtual one. She uses a rental service that provides her with a live person to answer phone calls, a mailing address for business correspondence and a conference room she can use as needed.""I went from paying $500 a month in rent to $100 a month,"" she said. ""I tell clients, 'You can meet me at my office or I can come to you.'""For many advisors, the first year of managing their independent practice becomes an exercise in self-discovery. Just as Ngo realized she needed a thick skin to withstand rejection, Vid Ponnapalli learned to modify his communication skills.Initially, Ponnapalli's passion for financial planning worked against him. In the months after he launched his practice in 2014, he found himself talking too much when meeting with prospects.""I'd give free consultations, but I went beyond (the scheduled) 30 minutes overselling myself,"" said Ponnapalli, a certified financial planner in Red Bank, N.J. ""I did more than an hour, telling prospects more than they wanted to know.""Eventually, he started listening more attentively to prospects' concerns. He trained himself to empathize and let them steer the conversation.""Instead of telling them too much about me, I'd listen for the problem that the prospect wanted to solve,"" he said. ""And I was more careful of their time. I didn't go over 30 minutes.""In terms of budgeting, Ponnapalli braced for cash-flow challenges before opening his practice. He set aside savings for his first year, using conservative assumptions about the number of clients he'd bring aboard.Ponnapalli, 52, devoted much of his first year to burnishing his credentials after working for two decades supporting technology and operations for Wall Street companies. He earned his CFP and then a Master of Science degree in personal financial planning.""I'm a firm believer that education is critical,"" he said. ""I was so motivated. I planned to go very slow during my first year while I was beefing up my education. Now my confidence comes from my education.""

17,RJF,"Earlier this year, a new federal law changed how married couples can file for Social Security. It affects how couples can claim retirement and spousal benefits.The new rules reflect the ever-changing nature of Social Security claiming strategies. The stakes are high for many professionals approaching retirement.""There are so many assumptions and moving parts,"" said Adam Nugent, managing partner at Foresight Wealth Management in Sandy, Utah. ""It's daunting without the right tools.""Like many advisors, Nugent uses software to run various scenarios that illustrate different Social Security claiming options. He inputs a client's age, earnings data and other factors, and then he analyzes the results.For Nugent, one of the biggest challenges is working with clients to guess their longevity. He says that individuals nearing retirement tend to underestimate how long they might live.""A lot of people say, 'I'll be dead by 80,' "" Nugent said. ""They don't think they'll live longer than that, but many do.""Nugent notes that Social Security planning is usually complicated. And enlisting the U.S. Social Security Administration's help may add to the vexation.""If you call the Social Security office, you can get three different people tell you three different things to verify certain information,"" he said. ""Some people, such as those who are Social Security-eligible with minor children, may be entitled to an additional benefit. So there are lots of nuances and loopholes.""For Nugent, the issue of Social Security planning hits close to home. When his father turned 67 more than six years ago, he told his son that he intended to wait until he turned 70 to take Social Security.Nugent urged his dad to run the numbers to determine his break-even age -- when total Social Security benefits collected would be equal if started at two different times. This calculation matters because benefits claimed later pay more than benefits claimed earlier.After crunching the numbers, Nugent's father decided to start taking benefits at age 67.""He had looked at his Social Security statement and said, 'I'll wait till I'm 70,' "" Nugent recalled. ""He didn't think to go through it (and run different scenarios). Many people are like that.""Like Nugent, Nina O'Neal finds that some clients make misguided decisions about Social Security if left to their own devices. They may harbor strong feelings about when to take the benefit and whether the program will even survive in its current form.""A lot of people come to us with preconceived notions about what they should do,"" said O'Neal, an advisor in Raleigh, N.C. ""They might say, 'I'm going to take it at 62. I don't want it taken away from me.' There's a general distrust of politicians. But that's an emotional way to look at it.""O'Neal starts by analyzing a client's Social Security statement. That may lead to correcting errors in the statement with the Social Security Administration.From there, she enters a client's data into a Social Security benefits estimator available to financial professionals on the website of BlackRock (BLK), an investment management firm. The tool produces what she calls ""an easy-to-read break-even point"" that she can use to help clients evaluate their claiming options.""Some clients want a lot of Social Security information, and others just want us to tell them what to do,"" she said. ""So I'll say to a client, 'I'm going to give you an overview. Stop me if I'm giving you too much detail.' Or I'll start by asking, 'What's your level of familiarity with Social Security?' ""Seasoned advisors often find that engaging clients about Social Security works better than lecturing them. The more that clients can drive the conversation, the better.Carla Masselink, a certified financial planner and senior vice president at Raymond James (RJF) in Holland, Mich., likes to educate clients to make the best choice. She uses the firm's customized ""Goal Planning and Monitoring"" software to spark a discussion.She guides clients through the software on a TV screen, letting them pose ""what if"" questions along the way. Typical client queries include, ""What if I delay taking benefits until I reach full retirement age?"" and ""What if I have a part-time job?""Based on their questions, Masselink will print different scenarios and give it to clients to take home and absorb. This way, they're more informed about their options and feel more involved in decision-making.""We talk about how important a choice it is, how it's a one-time choice and it's fixed,"" she said. ""It's all about educating them. Otherwise, we find somebody will say, 'My co-worker did this ...' or 'My neighbor did this ...' without really knowing what's the best choice for them.""RELATED:Turning Your Hobbies Into Business-Building Opportunities Requires SensitivityConquering Your Investment Biases Can Deliver Better ResultsWhat You Can Learn From The Toughest Catch For Financial ExpertsSocial Security Benefits Will Be Cut In 2017.

18,RJF,"Men may have long dominated the financial advisory field. But increasingly, signs show women are finally getting their shot.Amid a growing awareness of the “female market” for financial advice -- some data show women now controlling 51% of America’s personal wealth -- and the aftermath of some bias lawsuits, evidently more financial advisory firms are inviting women to be advisors as well as clients.“It’s a big deal,” said Michelle Lynch, vice president of Raymond James Financial’s (RJF) Network for Women Advisors. She added, “All the firms have some initiative now around women.”To be sure, female advisors are still comparatively few. Although women comprise more than half the population, they account for only 31% of financial advisors and 23% of certified financial planners (CFPs), according to a 2014 CFP Board report. And experts say that many women still aren’t even aware of the profession.But these days, programs in colleges, professional groups and company recruitment aim to boost the ranks of women advisors. Indeed, at Prudential Advisors, “our goal is to reflect the marketplace,” said Catalina Camoscio, the firm’s vice president of recruiting and development. Reflecting the marketplace would eventually mean “50% of (our) advisors” would be women.At big advisory firms, strategies to attract women -- often part of a firm’s broader “diversity” initiatives -- can include mentoring programs, college recruitment, hiring women returning to work after an extended leave, and the use of team advising.An example of the latter: A year and a half ago, Merrill Lynch Wealth Management (MLWM) expanded its training and development lineup with a Team Financial Advisor (TFA) offering. Participants take on one of five specific roles within an existing advisory team and receive 31 months of training.TFA recruits might include those starting a second career or new college graduates. Among TFA's attractions for women: It allows them “to work collaboratively with other advisors while contributing their expertise to the group,” said Linda Houston, division executive for New England at MLWM.Apprenticeships appear to be among the draws at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management (MSWM). For a year, apprentices work with a team of wealth advisors to broaden their skills before starting their own advisory practice within Morgan Stanley (MS). Results so far: about half the apprenticeship program’s hires have been women, reports Kara Underwood, MSWM’s head of diversity. (Morgan Stanley did not provide specific numbers of hires.)This year, Prudential (PRU) hopes to launch its team approach to financial advising and include recruitment as part of it. While this initiative could involve anyone, “we expect it to attract women because of the mentorship and collaboration it offers,” Prudential's Camoscio said.So how can women learn of, and tap, such opportunities? Experts cite key steps to consider:

19,RJF,"Individual investors won some but not all of what was hoped from a sweeping new rule that tightens conflict-of-interest standards for brokers. Those brokers manage trillions of dollars in retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs, creating compliance headaches and liability issues for the financial industry.Still, the new rules are more lenient than the financial industry had feared they would be. And that leniency led investors to bid up stocks on Wednesday of many asset managers, brokers and insurers.Life insurer Primerica (PRI) soared nearly 7%. Broker and financial adviser Ameriprise Financial (AMP) rose 1.5%. T. Rowe Price (TROW) rose 1.4%. ""Several of these stocks are trading up today,"" said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. ""The rule impact is being seen as not as onerous as feared.""Despite industry relief, overall the rule is seen as a victory for individual investors.The final Labor Department (DOL) fiduciary rule, which follows months of public and industry views on its proposal, requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients when providing retirement advice. The Obama administration claims that will lower costs and boost returns for investors.""Today’s rule ensures that putting clients first is no longer a marketing slogan,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a conference with reporters. ""It is the law.""The fiduciary standard of behavior creates new grounds for complaints by investors who feel they have been short-changed by their broker. At the outset of a brokerage relationship, a broker can still require a client to agree to take any disputes to arbitration rather than to court. But now the broker has to meet a higher standard of professional behavior, says Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago securities-fraud attorney.""(The new rule) creates a strengthened cause of action for those suing their brokers,"" Stoltmann said. The new rule does not mean that DOL itself will become more active as a securities cop, Stoltmann added.The government made some concessions in its final rule after months of criticism from the financial industry.The Investment Company Institute, a group representing mutual funds, last summer called the proposal so complicated that it is unworkable. Brokerages charged that the requirement would add costs that make retirement advice unaffordable for many lower- and middle-income investors.Some financial firms will probably benefit, while others are expected to be hurt.Discount brokerages such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stand to be helped, Morningstar predicted. So are companies that sell a lot of index and exchange traded products, like State Street (STT), BlackRock (BLK) and Vanguard. And robo-advisors are also likely to gain business. Brokers would be compelled to use their low-cost products and services rather than high cost alternatives.T. Rowe Price stock was up because its funds are relatively good performers, meaning they are more likely to be acceptable investment recommendations by brokers, Warren said. Also, the firm has been bolstering its sales staff in recent months, to boost its IRA business, he added.In its new rule, the Labor Department addressed some industry concerns. The originally proposed eight-month deadline for compliance is gone, replaced by a longer, ""phased"" implementation timetable.Also modified is a requirement for new clients to sign a contract in which any broker conflicts are disclosed. These would include the broker disclosing that high-commission products might be offered even though lower-cost alternatives are available. The final rule says the contract does not have to be signed until a client actually opens an account. The proposed rule called for the contract to be signed when the client first had contact with a broker.Another item dropped from the final rule: a proposed list of acceptable assets that advisors can recommend instead of certain high-risk investments. And a widely expected prohibition of in-house investment products has been dropped.""I'm a little disappointed the DOL has caved on the issue of whether firms can recommend proprietary products like annuities,"" Stoltmann said. ""No real fiduciary could do this. I think the DOL caved on a very crucial issue.""The new rule basically extends a fiduciary standard mainly to brokers when they provide investment advice for retirement accounts. A fiduciary standard requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients. Registered investment advisors (RIAs) are already subject to the fiduciary standard, but a stricter version than imposed by the new rule on brokers, said Stoltmann.The new rule takes aim at IRAs -- particularly on money that is transferred or rolled over into IRAs from workplace retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, says Skip Schweiss, TD Ameritrade head of investor advocacy.Under the old rule, brokers could recommend investments that were merely suitable for clients. The DOL says that the old standard allowed brokers to base recommendations on what would generate commissions for them, even if a better-performing, lower-cost investment was available.The White House -- which supports the tighter standard -- said in February 2015 that investments made on the basis of conflicted advice under the old rule returned roughly 1 percentage point less a year on average than investments made on the advice of fiduciaries.With an estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets invested in the type of products that generate conflicts of interest, the White House estimated that the aggregate annual cost of conflicted advice is about $17 billion.""A retiree who receives conflicted advice when rolling over a 401(k) balance to an IRA at retirement will lose an estimated 12% of the value of his or her savings if drawn down over 30 years,"" read the White House report. ""If a retiree receiving conflicted advice takes withdrawals at the rate possible absent conflicted advice, his or her savings would run out more than five years earlier.""With a $100,000 rollover for people age 55 to 64 in 2012, a 12% loss would cost the average investor $12,000.Morningstar forecast a mixed impact for active asset managers, including AllianceBernstein (AB), Cohen & Steers (CNS), Eaton Vance (EV), Federated (FII), Janus Capital Group (JNS) and Legg Mason (LM). The same applies to full-service wealth managers, including Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Raymond James (RJF) and Wells Fargo (WFC).These companies have product lineups that include both higher and lower cost products.And some impact could differ from what's expected. Many full-service brokerages could replace commission-based IRA fund sales with IRAs that generate fees on assets. ""As fee-based accounts can have a revenue yield upwards of 60% higher than commission-based, this could translate to as much as an additional $13 billion of revenue for the industry,"" Morningstar reported.Also, full-service wealth managers could stop serving clients with low IRA account balances. Those clients could take an estimated $250 billion to $600 billion in assets to robo-advisors. That could push a number of robo-advisors above the $16 billion to $40 billion asset base that Morningstar estimated they need to become profitable.Even within groups that could be hurt by the new rule, like active asset managers and insurers, some companies could benefit. ""(Firms) with moats will gain market share from their less competitively advantaged peers or ... will be able to adjust their business model to offset the negative financial effects of the rule,"" Morningstar reported.

46,RJF,"The stockbrokerage and investment bank industry group is rich with stocks carrying solid profit margins.Five stockbrokers' stocks posted quarterly after-tax margins of 15% or higher in recent quarters. Two of them are among the top five stock brokers in IBD's Best Online Brokers 2015 survey:• MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading platform provider, delivered after-tax margins of 26% to 30% in the past dozen quarters.• TD Ameritrade (AMTD), a brokerage and financial services provider, pegged margins in a range of 24% to 28% in the past six quarters.• Charles Schwab (SCHW), a brokerage and financial services provider, served up after-tax margins of 21% to 22% in the past six quarters.• E-Trade Financial (ETFC), an online brokerage and banking services provider, turned in after-tax margins of 14% to 17% in the past four quarters.• Lazard (LAZ), an asset manager and merger adviser, posted after-tax margins of 15% to 17% in the past four quarters.All percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number. Results for the quarter ended in December were not yet available.How do these stocks stack up on other growth-stock criteria?• Revenue growth: MarketAxess takes the pole position with five- and three-year sales growth rates of 18% and 15%, respectively. Schwab is second at 8% and 10%.• Earnings growth: MarketAxess is No. 1 here too. The five- and three-year EPS growth rates are 35% and 18%. Lazard split the leadership with a lower five-year rate of 16% and a higher three-year rate of 28%.• Return on equity: This figure measures financial efficiency. Historically, elite stocks have scored 17% or better on the ROE gauge. Among the five stocks, Lazard leads with an ROE of 48%. MarketAxess is second at 24%.• Supply and demand: MarketAxess and Ameritrade were tops early this month. MarketAxess has an A- in Accumulation and 1.1 in up-down volume. Ameritrade has a B in Accumulation and 1.0 in up-down volume.• Institutional support: Fund activity isn't especially high right now in either a positive or negative direction. All five showed small changes or stand-pat numbers from Q3 to Q4.Three of the five stocks sport youthful base counts. The current or most recent base for MarketAxess, TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab are first stage. E-Trade and Lazard are consolidating in third-stage patterns.As a stock advances, it pauses to form consolidations or bases. Breakouts are less likely to work after the first two stages.Many investors restrict their buys to first- and second-stage breakouts.Income InvestingAnother way of looking at the brokerage industry group is from the perspective of income investors.First, a qualifier: The best strategy for culling income from stocks is to use CAN SLIM to buy the best stocks and then take income from the profits. Yes, like farming, some years will be plentiful and others not. But over time, investors will have more profits to slice than if they rely on dividends from conservative stocks.Realistically, though, some conservative investors have no interest in learning CAN SLIM and can't handle the uncertainty and close monitoring associated with growth stocks.So for those investors, let's look at which brokerage stocks are suitable for a more traditional dividend strategy. Stocks listed are only those trading at $12 or more per share.• Top dividend yields: Calamos Asset Management (CLMS), 4.5%; Greenhill (GHL), 4.6%; Credit Suisse (CS), 3.5%.• Top dividend growth rate: TD Ameritrade, 53%; Ameriprise Financial ([STOCK[AMP]]), 34%; and MarketAxess, 33%. The percentage is calculated over a three-to five-year period.• Five-year earnings Stability Factor: Ameritrade, 7; LPL Financial (LPLA), 12; and Raymond James (RJF), 12.The scale for earnings Stability runs from 0 (calm) to 99 (wild).
