0,KMB,"Some investors building equity income portfolios seek out ETFs holding big dividend payers. Others focus on exchange traded funds that consistently grow dividends. But what's more important than high yields or dividend growth?A stable income stream, says a leading ETF expert.""After all, investors looking to these funds as a source of cash flow would be disappointed to find that their income stream is volatile,"" said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar.Johnson recently studied 11 dividend ETF strategies that focus on U.S. large caps.Of these, the five that screened stocks for steadily paying or growing dividends also generated stable income vs. their peers. Their ""dividend drawdown"" — the year-on-year decline in annual dividend payment — was relatively muted even in 2009, post-financial crisis.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), the $20.71 billion bellwether ETF, counts IBM (IBM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) among its top three holdings. The stocks are classic income plays. J&J earns the most stable possible IBD Dividend Stability Factor: 0. IBM has a DSF of 1. The score shows how stable a firm's dividend history is over a five-year period. A lower number means a more stable history.First Trust Value Line Dividend (FVD), with $1.2 billion in assets, holds furniture maker Leggett & Platt (LEG). The stock has a DSF of 0.PowerShares Dividend Achievers (PFM) has $343.5 million in assets and big stakes in J&J and IBM, as well as Altria Group (MO). The tobacco firm has a DSF of 1.SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), with $13.62 billion in assets, holds Johnson & Johnson, Leggett & Platt and Kimberly-Clark (KMB) among its top 25 holdings. The Huggies maker has a DSF of 1.The 12-month yield of these four ETFs ranges from 1.95% for PFM to 2.25% for SDY. But when comparing dividend funds, investors who look at yield in isolation may be running a risk.Yield can be volatile over time. WisdomTree Equity Income (DHS) yielded roughly 10.3% in February 2008. It yields 2.9% today.""Some ETPs (exchange traded products) are clearly taking on more risk than others when they go about building an income-oriented portfolio,"" Johnson said.For less volatile yields, he said, ""It's important to look for funds that track benchmarks which incorporate some sort of (dividend) sustainability screen.""He added: ""Investors should place a premium on income stability, particularly in bear markets .""Dividend Yield Vs. GrowthDividend growth provides a historical context for yields. Investors in ETFs with growing dividends have a better shot at a cash stream that beats the rate of inflation over time.VIG screens for stocks that have increased their dividend for at least 10 consecutive years. It has an 0.1% expense ratio, the lowest among dividend-focused ETFs.SDY looks for stocks that have raised their dividends for the past 20 consecutive years. It has a 0.35% expense ratio, or $35 in fees for every $10,000 invested.VIG was up 1.4% year to date as of Wednesday. It produced an annual average 14.3% gain in the past five years, as opposed to 0.8% and 15% for SDY over those same periods.

Kimberly-Clark will also close or sell about 10 factories while expanding production at other sites, according to a statement.The cutbacks threaten American factory jobs at a time when the Trump administration is trying to reinvigorate the manufacturing economy. The company didn't lay out where the jobs would be eliminated, other than saying they would hit every major region where it does business.Chief Executive Officer Tom Falk said the changes will make the company ""leaner, stronger and faster."" He pledged better results in 2018, even as market conditions will remain ""challenging in the near-term.""Kimberly-Clark sees the job cuts and restructuring creating annual cost savings of $500 million to $550 million by the end of 2021.

So which companies may Kraft target next?""Kraft Heinz's interest was made public at an extremely early stage,"" spokesman Michael Mullen said Sunday in an e-mailed statement. ""Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis, but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction. It is best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value.""Unilever said Friday that the $50-a-share offer undervalued it, with management quietly concerned about Kraft Heinz's cost-cutting culture.Shares of Unilever rose 15.3% to 48.79 in Friday stock market trading.

"
40,KMB,"Dancing to the Federal Reserve's familiar rate-hike-is-coming tune in August, the major stock market indexes did little more than tread water near multiyear if not all-time highs.A pullback by defensive sectors largely offset an advance by cyclical sectors as the S&P 500 inched up 0.14%. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged ahead 0.48%, according to Lipper Inc.General domestic taxable bond funds rose 0.74% to be up 8.53% for the year.At an economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in late August, Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other Fed officials said the economy is strong enough for a rate hike.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders""The fact that the market saw an opportunity for a rate increase at the Sept. 21 (Fed) meeting was an indication that the U.S. economy was actually moving in the right direction,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer, equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management. ""So the market reacted to that.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceThat reaction took the form of a rotation out of high-dividend stocks and stable sectors into more economically cyclical sectors, Aguilar said. Investors pulled money out of utilities, consumer staples and telecom, he added. They shifted much of it into technology, health care, consumer discretionary and financials.Sector funds reflected some of that. Financial services funds gained 4.25% last month on average. Tech funds gained 2.33%. Health/biotech and consumer-goods funds lost ground.The mood shifted again early this month when the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the count of its July jobs gains upward to 275,000, but reported August jobs gains of only 151,000. That was less than the 180,000 jobs forecast by economists polled by Reuters. The relatively weak employment growth increased the odds that the Fed would delay its rate hike until November or even December, and the stock market rallied modestly and rotated back toward dividend stocks.""There isn't a lot of market leadership now,"" Aguilar said last week. ""Bottom line: We're going to have to wait until the Fed's September meeting to know what comes next.""IBD's TAKE: How will investors react once the Fed finally hikes rates? Understanding the stock market's prevailing trend is a key factor when you are choosing between growth and defensive stock buys. For pointers, visit IBD University.Chip Rewey, lead manager of Third Avenue's $1.2 billion Value (TVFVX) and $317 million Small Cap Value (TVSVX) funds, said ""the market is confused by the Fed, the way Charlie Brown is confused by Lucy.""Rewey added that whenever the Fed does raise rates, sustained, aggressive hikes are unlikely. ""Still, why allocate (money) to yield-oriented sectors when you see a raise coming off generational low rates?"" he asked.Instead, Rewey has added to stocks that should not be hurt by a hike. He recently increased his stake in Johnson Controls (JCI), which makes building-efficiency systems and just completed its combination with Tyco, which makes fire and security systems.""We like the merger with Tyco,"" Rewey said. ""There's a lot of misunderstanding about what type of company Johnson is. Many people still think of it as an auto company (because of its history as a maker of car seats and interiors). But the majority post-Tyco merger is a building services company.""Rewey also added to Amgen (AMGN), which has a dividend yield of 2.3%. ""We saw it as a leading pharmaceuticals (company) that had been caught in the generic fears about (drugmakers because of political calls for intervention over pricing).""Rewey bought shares under 150. They're now trading near 170. ""At that price, we're getting its pipeline for free,"" he said. The company has 31 potential treatments in preclinical and clinical targets development, including 12 in phase three tests, which are closer to market. Another nine biosimilars are in development, including three in later stages, nearing the point where they might go on sale.Rewey also likes Comerica (CMA), a bank with most of its operations in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona and Florida. ""It's trading around 1.1 times tangible book value,"" he said. ""We think it's undervalued. They're cutting costs. If rates and loan growth go up, their return on equity will go up.""And Rewey likes media giant CBS (CBS), which is controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements, which also controls Viacom (VIA). Some family members and company executives have been jockeying for power over the company once Redstone ceases to exercise control.""Investor overreaction to the noise over Viacom has weighed on the value of CBS stock,"" Rewey said. ""They are taking an advertising driven model and taking it to more fee-driven (which should generate revenue and earnings that are more visible and stable). They should be almost 60% fee-driven by 2018 once they spin out their radio business. And they're in a stock buyback program. And we like the management team, led by Les Moonves.""James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds and manager of its $156 million Select Equity (DHAMX), says it's possible the Fed won't raise rates in the wake of disappointing recent economic data.In this environment, he likes consumer staples names PepsiCo (PEP) and Kimberly Clark (KMB) for their aggressive cost cutting. He likes the outlook for Coach (COH), whose rising sales per employee show that its restructuring is on track, he says. And he likes Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), whose innovations provide them with a competitive moat.RELATED:The August Jobs Report Was The Weakest Since 2010As Companies Step Up Wage Hikes, Tax Receipts Get A LiftMutual Fund Strategists Like U.S. Stocks, Led By Tech, Health Care In A Sluggish Market

41,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark (KMB) topped second-quarter forecasts, but shares fell as the consumer products giant cut its organic sales outlook even as it sees foreign exchange headwinds easing over the full year.Earnings per share rose 8.5% to $1.53, above estimates for $1.48. Sales fell 1% to $4.588 billion, edging past expectations for $4.564 billion.An unfavorable foreign exchange environment, with the dollar strong against other currencies, weighed on revenue for the company, best known for such brands as Kleenex and Huggies diapers.Organic sales, which factor out currency fluctuations, rose 3%.Shares fell 1.5% by the closing bell to 132.59 on the stock market today, trying to find support at their 50-day line. The stock tried to break out from a cup base early this month, but shares have since struggled.Kimberly Clark expects forex to weigh on full-year net sales and operating profits by 4%-5%, down from an earlier forecast for ""the low end of the 5 to 6 percent range"".However, Kimberly-Clark expects organic sales growth to be at the low end of its forecast for 3%-5%, reflecting ""lower expected benefits from selling price increases, primarily due to the improved currency outlook.""Procter & Gamble (PG), which edged up to 85.80, holds its fourth-quarter earnings call on Aug. 2.

42,KMB,"Amazon.com (AMZN) on Tuesday said it added more than 50 more brands to its lineup of wireless Dash Buttons, and it said the frequency of Dash orders rose 70% in the past three months.Amazon said Prime members are increasingly using Dash Button to order everyday essentials and that order frequency doubled in the past three months among Prime member who use the service.Research firm Slice Intelligence, however, recently released a study showing that fewer than half the people who have ordered Dash Buttons have actually made an order via the device.Amazon launched the Wi-Fi connected, thumbnail-sized Dash Button in 2015, with 29 brands. There is a separate button for each product. Amazon says it now has more than 150 buttons, across dozens of retail categories from household goods and toys to guitar strings. Brands include Proctor & Gamble (PG), Kimberly-Clark (KMB) and Clorox (CLX). Products include Maxwell House coffee, Tide detergent, Gatorade and Gerber baby food.Dash Buttons are available to Prime members for $4.99, but they're essentially free, since users get a $4.99 credit on their first order. The press of a Dash Button leads to an automatic reorder at Amazon, with free shipping for Prime customers.Amazon stock closed up 2.4% at 707.95 in the stock market today. Amazon appears to have found support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out April 29 on a favorable Q1 earnings report. But there are also signs of heavy institutional selling, as revealed in several recent days when the stock was down and volume spiked for the IBD Leaderboard company.

43,KMB,"Amazon (AMZN) has gotten a lot of publicity for its Amazon Dash Buttons, small Wi-Fi-connected devices (that is, actual buttons) that let Prime members order staples like Tide detergent, Charmin toilet paper and Doritos chips with the push of that product's button. But it doesn't appear that customers are using the thumb-drive-sized buttons very much.A study by Slice Intelligence has found that fewer than half of people who have a Dash Button have actually made an order using it.The top-selling button is for Tide laundry detergent. The Procter & Gamble (PG) product has accounted for 21% of button orders, followed by Bounty paper towels (18%), also from P&G. Cottonelle toilet paper from Kimberly-Clark (KMB) came in third with 17%, followed by Glad plastic bags (12%) from Glad Products, which is majority owned by Clorox (CLX).The top Dash Button for consumer spending is Gatorade, owned by PepsiCo (PEP). The average shopper has spent $120 on Gatorade since they purchased a Gatorade Dash Button.Other top Dash Buttons for average consumer purchases include Smartwater ($82.52), Bounty ($74.37), Cottonelle ($61.95), Tide ($58.13) and Charmin ($52.11)Slice Intelligence, an e-commerce analytics firm, based its study on data generated from its panel of over 4 million online consumers between March 31, 2015, and June 18, 2016.E-commerce leader Amazon now sells over 100 Dash Buttons for everyday household items, from coffee and snacks to condoms and feminine care products.Dash Buttons are available to Prime members for $4.99 each, and they're essentially free because members get a $4.99 credit to their Amazon account with their first order using the button.When customers are running low on an item, they can simply press a Dash Button to automatically reorder the item and have it delivered with free Prime shipping.Amazon stock fell 1.1%, to 691.36, in the stock market today, on another Brexit beatdown day for stocks. Amazon stock is testing its 50-day line for the first time in three months.

44,KMB,"Mkts went into reverse yesterday.....as earnings seasons moves on and investors/traders struggle with how overvalued/overbought the mkt is based on broader macro economic conditions and very mixed earnings reports - ...the dollar ended the day higher sending oil and other commodities lower as investors reconsider the prospect of higher rates here in the US when the FED meets next week. Once again - many are left asking - Could the FED surprise the mkts and hike in April? Let me be clear - in the words of Luis Enrique - ""Yo no se manana..."" (I don't know about tomorrow)...but I do know that today - the answer to that question is NO WAY!Once again - you got some of the talking heads suggesting that the US economy is so strong that rates need to rise sooner rather than later - the most recent Hawk is Eric Rosengren - Boston's Fed President as he re-iterated 'his' opinion on Monday that the FED'was closer to raising rates than many investors anticipate.... and that the mkt may be underestimating the FED's pace of tightening'Ok sports fans - here we go again.....all the talk of the next FED move just days ahead of their meeting and the end of the month..... Now while I believe that we won't get a move in April - I do expect the FED to leave the door wide open for the June hike (as expected). To add fuel to that fire we heard from Peter Gorra - head of FX trading at BNP Paribas......(Forex - FX - trading is defined as the global decentralized mkt for the trading of currencies - buying, selling and exchanging them at current prices). Currencies are very sensitive to any move in rates so - Peter does sit at the center of speculation.....and he thinks that""U.S. data has actually been pretty good, and there is very little chance of a June move by the Fed priced in,""Ok - first - US data has been pretty good? Really? Let me count thy ways:Yesterday's Philly Fed report - big disappointment, Earlier in this month alone we learned that ISM NY - disappointed, Empire State Manf - disappointed, labor mkt conditions - disappointed, Factory orders - disappointed, Factory orders ex Transports - disappointed, Durable Goods - disappointed, Durables Ex transports -disappointed, Wholesale inventories - disappointed, Wholesale trade - disappointed, Retail Sales - a big disappointment, PPI - oh right - negative, PPI ex food and energy - negative, Construction Spending - negative, Industrial production - another negative.....but so much for the negatives...lets accentuate the positives shall we?Non Farm payrolls - met expectations in terms of 'jobs created' - never mind that they are low wage, temporary (let's ignore that fact), and forget the fact that layoffs hit a 6 month high in January with daily headlines of more 'restructurings' (layoffs) as we move thru earnings season.... US Markit ISM met expectations (positive), ISM Manf -beat, ISM Prices Paid - beat, Oh and the Univ of Mich sentiment survey was 'better than expected', and Earnings reports - yeah - they are missing top line organic growth, yet still beating embarrassingly low earnings estimates - but hey - a beat is a beat and that is positive...so maybe Pete is on the right track.....But as far as the mkt NOT pricing in a June hike - I would disagree - the FED has been quite clear on that point...she has left the June door wide open - if investors have not heard that call of the wild - then they are living under a rock.....Now the real question is not if they have heard the call - the question is Do they believe the call? And that is up for discussion - because here is where I do agree with Peter.....if investors do not believe her and ignore the calls for higher rates and then she in fact moves on rates - then he is right - investors will scream - what the ...?Given Yellen's clear dovish stance, the mkts are not looking for any rate hike this month at all, but we are seeing a small pullback - which reflects just a bit of 'uncertainty' as some investors/traders recede to the sidelines.....but then I expect that next week we will get the usual ramp up when it is clear that rates will go nowhere. Look - the Fed is worried about the both the US and the global economies and feels a bit trapped...... So - next week expect more 'nothing done'.Yesterday's ECB press conference doesn't help.....He (Mario Draghi) did nothing in terms of another policy move but did leave the door open to further negative interest-rate cuts....oh...and that is another sure sign of 'strength'! This morning we wake up to the latest Japanese headline - Hold on this one is good.....""BoJ Officials Are Said to Eye Possible Negative Rates on Loans"" - Yes - you read that correctly.....the headline suggests that the BoJ may consider offering NEGATIVE rates on some loans (in addition the negative rates on deposits) in order to stimulate their economy....... So the bank will pay YOU to borrow money to invest......Does the word 'desperation' come to mind at all?This morning US futures are once again hovering around the unchanged line...initially lower by 3 pts in early trading - but have now recovered a bit and are slightly positive at 7 am. There are no economic reports today to speak of , but we will get another slew of earnings....Caterpillar (CAT)and McDonald's (MCD) will hit the tape prior to the opening while Alcoa (AA), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), Sun Trust (STI) report post close. Traders will now get a chance to react to last nights announcements from Alphabet (GOOGL) and General Electric (GE)...Alphabet missed on both the top and the bottom line (that was surprising) - the stock sold off 5% in the moments after the announcement and are trading at $722/sh right now.GE on the other hand beat the estimates but is also seeing some profit taking in their stock in early morning trading. Trading at $30.65 down 0.30 cts.As we approach the end of April you would expect to see is a narrowing of market breadth and this is exactly what we are currently seeing. The S&P is testing the November 2015 highs (just over 2100) and hitting a wall......Relative Strength (RSI) which began to roll over in March is suggesting market breadth is narrowing or that fewer and fewer stocks are holding up the indexes as money moves into the largest blue chip companies (think safety) typical of what you would see ahead of an expected correction.Now that being said - there are so many other things to consider......The Fed and the fact that we are in a Presidential election year.....and we are in the 8th year of the current presidency... and historically, the mkts tend to peak in April and then suffer for the rest of the year.Since 1900, the S&P has on average, fallen by 1.2% in the 8th year of a presidential term, with the market rising only 44 percent of the time. This summer will be very interesting.....History shows us (82% if the time) that if stocks rise between July 31 and October 31, then we can expect the incumbent party to win in November (Think Hillary).....BUT If stocks fall, (86% of the time) then the thinking is that a new party will take over. (Think Trump) ....so will history repeat itself or not?I expect the mkt to continue to churn and challenge resistance right here at 2100........I do not expect any major move in either direction until next week's FED announcement. Remember - it is also month end - so expect some window dressing as we move thru next week.

77,KMB,"Genpact (G) has made its mark helping companies operate more efficiently, but over the last two years the business processing firm has invested heavily to make its own firm run more effectively.The company, once an India-based arm of General Electric (GE), had gone through some growing pains. The outsourcer for hundreds of companies worldwide -- handling non-core functions such as accounting and finance -- decided it was time to be more selective in the businesses it pursued.Out of the loop went telecom, utilities and government, among other lackluster sectors. More attention was paid to financial services, manufacturing, consumer products, pharma and high tech -- and in finding new ways to service those customers.""We’ve spent about $100 million-plus across a range of new capabilities to take the company to the next level, such as building out mobile and analytical solutions,"" Chief Executive N.V. ""Tiger"" Tyagarajan told IBD.Making such a move came with a price, though. Margins and earnings took a hit initially. In 2014, per-share earnings fell 9%. And as part of that, business from its largest client and former parent, GE, has shrunk to a fraction of what it was.But it’s a different picture now. The strategy to invest in client sectors with the best growth potential and dial back on smaller, less lucrative areas is starting to pay off.""They basically decided to take down their profitability to strategically drive revenue in specific areas,"" analyst Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald told IBD. ""You’ve seen growth rates pick up and positive data points in bookings’ numbers.""Genpact's total revenue in 2015 rose 8% over 2014 to $2.46 billion, but new bookings jumped 20%. Earnings for the year climbed 22% to $1.26 a share. In the fourth quarter, earnings grew 31% to 34 cents a share on revenue of $646.5 million, up 7% from the prior year.Revenue would have been higher had it not been negatively impacted by GE’s business divestitures. In the fourth quarter, GE revenue fell 1% year-over-year to $117 million, accounting for 18% of the total. Non-GE revenue from other global clients rose 10% to $529 million.For the full year, revenue from GE was down 1% to $460 million, representing 19% of total revenue. Global-client revenue grew 10% to $2 billion, or up 13% in constant currency.GE once accounted for 100% of Genpact’s revenue, when it was still an India-based business process management and information technology services arm of the massive U.S. conglomerate. In 2005, Genpact started providing services to non-GE clients, too, as an independent company. It went public in 2007.“As GE continues to change its portfolio, our relationship changes,” Tyagarajan said.About 60% of Genpact’s work is still performed in India. The rest is done in 18 other countries, including Romania, the Philippines, China, Mexico and Hungary. The company is headquartered in New York.The shrinking of GE’s contributions has been especially apparent since last March, when GE announced it would divest its financial services arm, GE Capital. Accelerated GE divestitures will weigh on 2016 results: Genpact expects GE revenue to fall 8% to 10% this year. But it forecasts that revenue from non-GE global clients will rise by 12.5% to 14%.Analysts expect total revenue this year to grow 7% to $2.64 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Earnings are seen rising 12% to $1.42 a share.Tyagarajan doesn’t seem worried about lost business from GE.“As GE sells those businesses, it’s natural for us to enter into new relationships with the buyers. The work has to continue,” he said.Of the 12 GE Capital businesses sold so far, Genpact has already entered into contracts with four buyers, including Bank of Montreal (BMO). Tyagarajan says it’s in talks with the eight others.Meanwhile, the outsourcing of business and technology services is a market with a lot of growth left in it, he says.“So much change and disruption in technology is very good for us,” he said. “Our role is to help our clients think about change and help them change.”As Genpact has changed its focus, its client roster has fallen from more than 800 to roughly 700, though Tyagarajan says the value of its contracts has been growing.Clients range from drug-store retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to manufacturers such as Boeing (BA), Nissan Motor (NSANY) and Honeywell (HON). Consumer products customers include Mondelez (MDLZ) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB). In pharma, it counts AstraZeneca (AZN) and others among its clients.The company’s ties with GE are a ""competitive advantage,"" noted analyst Frank Atkins of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey in a recent note to clients, which came with a buy rating and price target of 30.Among those advantages are GE’s culture of lean principles and systems. What’s more, he noted, many GE execs go on to management roles at other firms, creating an expanded network of potential new client wins for Genpact.""Its relationship with GE and recent investments give it solid positioning versus competitors,"" Atkins wrote. The company also addresses more industry verticals than many of its peers, he said.Genpact competes with pure-play business process management providers WNS (WNS) and ExlService Holdings (EXLS), as well as business processing units of larger global consultancies such as Accenture (ACN) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH).Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro (WIT) and Infosys (INFY) are also rivals in certain areas.""Genpact has a longer sales cycle than typical outsourcing companies,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald's Foresi, meaning it takes longer to land a sale and start servicing clients once a deal is signed. ""So the business is potentially stickier.""

Furthermore, the company's annual dividend of $3.52 a share yields 2.7%, above the S&P 500 average of 2.3%.Volatility in the stock market has sent investors scurrying to the safety of stable, big-cap dividend stocks in recent months. Kimberly-Clark (KMB) has increased its dividend for 43 straight years.  The stock is just out of buying range, 5.3% above a 122.83 entry.On Jan. 25, Kimberly-Clark reported that Q4 sales declined 6% from the same period a year earlier to $4.54 billion, due in part to the strong dollar. But sales volume increased in its personal care and consumer tissue segments, which are the biggest of the company's three business units.Profit rose 5%  to $1.42 a share thanks to a cost-cutting program that has helped to boost annual pretax margin for four straight years, to 15.8% in 2015.""We believe there has been true structural change at Kimberly-Clark whereby earnings growth is proving more predictable and stronger than that of its bellwether trading peers,"" Barclays said Jan. 26. It maintained its outperform rating on the stock.In late 2014, Kimberly-Clark spun off its health care business, now known as Halyard Health (HYH), to improve operating efficiency and focus on its core businesses.Profit for this year is expected to rise 6% to $6.12 a share, followed by an 8% gain in 2017, well above the company's five-year earnings growth rate of 4%.  Meanwhile, the company's earnings have shown remarkable stability over the years, which bodes well for future dividend increases.

81,KMB,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) may well become more attractive to the millennial crowd going for a healthy lifestyle with the addition of the eco-friendly and safe Honest Beauty makeup and skin-care line in select stores starting this month.That's one of the points that Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen made in a report this week on Ulta, a one-stop shop for beauty and salon products at a variety of prices.The report follows Ulta's announcement that Honest Beauty's makeup and skin-care collection will be available in 250 Ulta Beauty stores as well as on its Ulta.com website starting this month. The 250 stores comprise around 29% of Ulta's store base, Chen noted.The company describes the Honest Beauty line, created by healthy lifestyle brand The Honest Company, as a collection of ""safe, high-performance"" products that feature naturally derived botanical ingredients such as chamomile, calendula, aloe vera and barbary fig.""We like Ulta's announcement to carry Honest Beauty in select stores and online,"" Chen noted in his report. ""Honest is a growing brand (with) a unique, healthy lifestyle proposition. We believe Honest is a well-known brand with broad appeal to millennials, given the strong brand proposition (and) emphasis on transparency, responsibility and effectiveness. This likely will resonate with both the millennial and post-millennial's personalized, authentic lifestyle.""Chen notes that the near-term upside to same-store sales stemming from the addition of the Honest Beauty line in select Ulta stores will be small at first.He expects Honest Beauty to likely be less than 1% of Ulta's sales, given that Ulta carries 500-plus brands and more than 20,000 products vs. Honest Beauty’s roughly 80-piece collection.""We believe Honest will be a positive traffic driver and underscores Ulta's commitment to carrying the most compelling brands,"" Chen added.Prior to the Ulta launch, the Honest Beauty makeup and skin-care collection was only available on honestbeauty.com and in one retail outlet at The Grove, a Los Angeles shopping venue.""We believe Honest Beauty and The Honest Company could take share from bigger players, as their niche brand proposition continues to gain loyal customers,"" Chen added.He cites those ""bigger players"" as Proctor & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB).Ulta offers products ranging from high-priced so-called prestige brands sold in department stores and specialty stores to lower-priced labels sold via the mass channel, including drugstores and discounters.""Securing the initial distribution of Honest Beauty is one more way we believe Ulta can gain market share through their unique balance of prestige, mass and private-label brands,"" Chen added.

82,KMB,"When the stock markets are as rattled as they have been lately, there’s a certain comfort in putting your money into companies with consumer-friendly products, iconic brand names and steady dividend payments.Clorox (CLX) is a case in point. The maker of cleaning and household products set a record stock high in December and continues to show resilience even as the broader markets falter.It’s easy to overplay the “defensive” nature of defensive stocks -- those that investors gravitate toward in down markets or rocky economies. But in the case of Clorox, “it’s not overplayed at all,” said Linda Bolton Weiser, analyst at B. Riley & Co.“They produce very strong free cash flow, their dividends are bulletproof, and their earnings don’t vary significantly in a recession,"" she said.Clorox is one of four “true” consumer staple stocks in her coverage universe. The others are Proctor & Gamble (PG), Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB). Clorox is the least risky of the four, partly because it has much less exposure to markets outside the U.S., Weiser says.Clorox gets less than 20% of its sales from its international segment, in contrast to 80% for Colgate-Palmolive, 60% for P&G and 53% for Kimberly-Clark.“Clorox has a relatively small international exposure, so you’re not getting as much currency risk as you are from the other companies,” Weiser said. At the same time, she says, Clorox has gotten a boost from falling prices of commodities used to make, package and distribute its products. They include resin, cardboard and soybean oil.“They’re benefiting from commodity tailwinds and are not as badly hurt by unfavorable currency exchange rates,” Weiser said. “They’re really in a sweet spot right now.”Clorox’s share price reflects that sweet spot. The stock hit a high of 131.78 on Dec. 17, currently trades near 132 and has risen more than 15% over the last year.How much higher can it push? Probably not much, analysts say.“While we believe Clorox is one of the best managed companies under our coverage, we believe the stock is already trading at fair value,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi noted in a report.Weiser has a similar take.“Everything that is going well for Clorox is fully reflected in its stock price. It’s a very expensive stock right now,” she said.Clorox has delivered steady if unspectacular growth through the years. It hasn’t grown quarterly sales more than 4% since the December 2012 quarter. With few exceptions, its earnings growth rarely ventures into double digits.But the company does produce solid profits and more often than not ekes out annual sales gains. Much of the credit goes to the strong brand recognition of its products, including its namesake cleaning products as well as Glad wraps and trash bags, Liquid Plumr drain cleaner, Kingsford charcoal briquets, Pine-Sol cleaners, Hidden Valley salad dressings, KC Masterpiece barbecue sauces, Brita water filters and Burt’s Bees personal care products.Clorox operates in four segments: cleaning, household, lifestyle and international. It mainly sells its products to supermarkets and grocery stores. Discount chain Wal-Mart (WMT) is its biggest client, accounting for about 26% of sales.The cleaning and household segments -- encompassing everything from its iconic laundry bleach to garbage bags -- each contributed 32% of overall revenue during fiscal year 2015, which ended in June. The lifestyle segment, including salad dressings and lip treatments, contributed 17%. The international segment pitched in 19%.Clorox’s performance during this year’s first fiscal quarter was one of its best in years. It posted earnings of $1.32 a share, up 20% from the prior year and well ahead of consensus estimates for $1.18. Revenue climbed 3% to $1.39 billion, slightly above views.On Nov. 17, Clorox’s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 77 cents a share, payable Feb. 12 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on Jan. 27. The company benefited from price increases and higher volumes during the first quarter, which helped offset currency headwinds.The overall volume of products sold increased 3% from the prior year. Gross margin climbed 220 basis points to 45% from 42.8% a year earlier, thanks mainly to cost savings, higher sales and favorable commodity costs.“Clorox’s volumes have now been positive for five straight quarters, and the company’s focus on investing additional gross margin savings into (advertising and promotions) should keep this metric in the black for the foreseeable future,” Modi noted.Revenue in Clorox’s cleaning segment rose 5% during the quarter, driven by a strong performance from home care brands such as Clorox disinfecting wipes. The household segment posted 5% revenue growth, while the lifestyle segment logged a 7% gain.The international segment reported an 8% revenue decline because of unfavorable exchange rates. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenue rose 5%.To help deal with challenges in foreign markets, Clorox has adopted a “go lean” strategy that includes cutting costs and reducing infrastructure.“Strong execution of our go-lean strategy in international is particularly important as we look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year,” Clorox spokesman Steven Austenfeld said on a conference call with analysts. “(We recognize) the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, which would put additional pressure on profitability in our international business.”Clorox is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results before the open on Feb. 4. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $1.05 a share, up from 97 cents the previous year. Revenue should remain about flat at $1.35 billion.

The deal requires Greece's government to put in place by Wednesday pension reforms and tax increases, both of which were refused by Greek voters in a July 5 referendum. The deal also makes $10 billion available immediately to shore up Greece's faltering banks, but requires the government to privatize a $55 billion portfolio of assets — most of the proceeds from which will go to repay debt and recapitalize weakened banks.

144,KMB,"Soft spending due to sluggish job growth in recent months has taken its toll on the consumer staples sector in recent quarters. Kimberly-Clark (KMB) hasn't been immune, but overseas growth and global cost-cutting have offset challenges elsewhere. On Tuesday, shares gapped up 4% in heavy volume after the maker of Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue said third-quarter profit rose 7%…
"
145,KMB,"At World War I's end in 1918, Frank Sensenbrenner had a problem.
"
146,KMB,"As vice president at Kimberly-Clark Corp., he was looking at a large surplus of Cellucotton, a substitute cotton used in sanitary bandages for wounded soldiers.
"
147,KMB,"Now he had no new customers.
"
148,KMB,"""The Army had canceled all the contracts, and the Red Cross was giving away all the sanitary wound dressings free to hospitals,"" Thomas Heinrich, author of ""Kotex, Kleenex, Huggies: Kimberly-Clark and the Consumer Revolution in American Business,"" told IBD. ""There was no market.""
"
149,KMB,"Until Sensenbrenner made one.
"
150,KMB,"In 1920, Kimberly-Clark introduced Kotex, the first disposable feminine hygiene product.
"
151,KMB,"Four years later, they rolled out Kleenex, the first disposable paper handkerchief.
"
152,KMB,"By finding a peacetime use for Cellucotton, Sensenbrenner helped Kimberly-Clark become a pioneer of personal hygiene products in the 20th century.
"
153,KMB,"It Took Some Nerve
"
154,KMB,"When Kotex hit the market, stores wouldn't carry the product, magazines wouldn't advertise it, and sales were poor.
"
155,KMB,"Yet Sensenbrenner persevered, overcoming the cultural taboos that made marketing the product so difficult. Within a decade, women considered Kotex a basic necessity of life.
"
156,KMB,"When Kleenex landed on the shelves in 1924, it was targeted as a makeup remover for adult women. Sales were sluggish.
"
157,KMB,"When it dawned on Sensenbrenner that people were wiping their noses with his paper tissues, he repositioned it as a disposable handkerchief. Kleenex quickly became an iconic brand and the company's most reliable profit maker.
"
158,KMB,"""His background isn't that of someone you'd expect to evolve into a brilliant CEO,"" Heinrich said. ""He finished eighth grade, and that was it. He was a bookkeeper. He looked like a bookkeeper — a good, solid Victorian bookkeeper. But beneath it, he was a bit of a gambler. ... The guy was just a really good strategic thinker. He could figure out where opportunities were.""
"
159,KMB,"Despite his feats, Sensenbrenner was known for his modesty.
"
160,KMB,"Although John A. Kimberly, one of the company's four founders, retained the title of president until his death in 1928, Sensenbrenner ran things from about 1914 and was officially elected president in 1928. He refused the title of president out of respect for Kimberly, whose health was failing.
"
161,KMB,"""Sensenbrenner was the guy in charge,"" Heinrich said.
"
162,KMB,"Born in Menasha, Wis., Sensenbrenner (1864-1952) found work as a grocery store clerk after dropping out of junior high school.
"
163,KMB,"He was only 16 when he found his niche as a bookkeeper, and 19 when he started keeping books for Kimberly-Clark, a paper company headquartered in Neenah, Wis. The firm would move to Irving, Texas, in 1985.
"
164,KMB,"He became a stockholder after the company reorganized in 1907 and quickly rose through the ranks, thanks to his insight.
"
165,KMB,"American paper makers predicted doom when a 1911 North America treaty let Canada ship newsprint into the U.S. duty-free.
"
166,KMB,"Sensenbrenner saw the light. He grasped that Kimberly-Clark could profit from the new tariff opening if it shifted from newsprint to books and magazines.
"
167,KMB,"He quickly beefed up research and development, hiring top German and Austrian scientists.
"
168,KMB,"The Kimberly mill began using sulfite and bleached groundwood pulp to make book paper — the first mill in America to do so.
"
169,KMB,"K-C's R&D department also fine-tuned rotogravure printing, which enabled newspapers to reproduce photographs and artwork on a mass scale. For years, almost all of the rotogravure printing in America was done by Kimberly-Clark..
"
170,KMB,"""The guy was really prescient,"" Heinrich said. ""They built up an organization that they (later) used for Kotex and Kleenex.""
"
171,KMB,"After two years of extensive experiments and market tests, the first sanitary napkin was introduced in October 1920.
"
172,KMB,"Many publications declined to run advertisements for the product, and some drug and department stores refused to stock it.
"
173,KMB,"""My sales for the month are ABSOLUTELY ROTTEN, as you will learn at the end of the month,"" a sales rep wrote his boss, as reported in Heinrich's book. ""I have suffered more abuse at the hands of the trade than ever before in my life.""
"
174,KMB,"Sensenbrenner, worried about the company's image, organized a separate firm called Cellucotton Products Co. to market the product. That outfit invented the word Kotex to make it easier for women to ask pharmacists for it.
"
175,KMB,"In another marketing innovation, K-C suggested that stores place boxes of Kotex on the counter where women could help themselves without embarrassing conversation. Women took a box and put their money into a container — a pioneering shot at self-service.
"
176,KMB,"Yet K-C executives were divided over whether to continue with Kotex. ""In the beginning, they couldn't even utter the words 'sanitary napkin' in board meetings,'' Heinrich said. ""They called it 'the product.' They were 100% Victorian.""
"
177,KMB,"Yet when Montgomery Ward advertised Kotex in its 1926 catalog, millions of American women started using it. ""In a matter of 10 years, Kimberly-Clark had Kotex so entrenched that women were going to pay serious money for Kotex in the Great Depression,"" Heinrich said. ""They were willing to do without a lot of things in the Depression, but not Kotex and lipstick.""
"
178,KMB,"It was the boom in cosmetics after World War I that prompted Sensenbrenner to think about Kleenex as a niche product for women. In 1924, Kimberly-Clark began to market Cellucotton sheets as disposable cloth for removing lipstick and cold cream.
"
179,KMB,"In glamorous print ads targeting women, movie stars such as Helen Hayes and Ronald Colman touted Kleenex as a disposable substitute for facial towels.
"
180,KMB,"Kleenex, though, didn't sell well at the start. So in 1930 Sensenbrenner sent a marketing team to Peoria, Ill., to investigate. The K-C group learned that two-thirds of the people there who bought Kleenex used the tissues as hankies, not as makeup removers.
"
181,KMB,"Sensenbrenner and his staff quickly repositioned Kleenex as a disposable handkerchief, highlighted by an ad campaign: ""Don't put a cold in your pocket.""
"
182,KMB,"In The Face Of The Depression
"
183,KMB,"Approximately half of Kimberly-Clark's sizable 1930 and 1931 net earnings came from profitable Kleenex and Kotex sales.
"
184,KMB,"""(Kotex and Kleenex) led to a generation of constant expansion, a growth so compulsive that the company's workforce ... actually expanded during the Great Depression,"" John. R. Kimberly, grandson of John A., said in an interview during his 1953-67 tenure as CEO.
"
185,KMB,"Sensenbrenner, who had four children with his wife, Margaret, was chairman of the board from 1942 to 1944 and remained a director until 1952, when he died at age 88.
"
186,KMB,"Today Kimberly-Clark (KMB) manufactures products for its personal care, consumer tissue, K-C professional and health care brands, employs 58,000 and has factories in 36 countries. Its sales last year totaled $21 billion, and its stock has doubled since 2009.
"
187,KMB,"The company says Kleenex — which, like Coke with soda, is synonymous with its product — controls roughly 45% of the $1.5 billion tissue market. Kotex is the No. 4 sanitary napkin, and Kimberly-Clark is the No. 2 vendor for all sanitary napkin/liner products.

The company’s shares inched up 0.3%, against the industry’s decline of 9.8%.Factors at PlayBed Bath & Beyond is gaining from its focus on transformation plan to deliver a seamless customer experience. The transformation plan focuses on improving operational efficiency through the overhaul of IT and business processes, as well as adopting customer-centric plans like enriching product assortment and enhancing services.In this regard, it adopted a new model to better recognize and prioritize technology-related needs. It has also set up a strategic portfolio management office (“SPMO”) to allocate resources toward more profitable areas. Through the SPMO, the company is creating an integrated portfolio of strategies to improve gross margin, optimize inventory levels, enhance supply chain and implement customer service transformation.Further, the company's capital initiatives and constant shareholder-friendly moves bode well. Additionally, the company is progressing well with its strategic store expansion plans. It also targets increasing the productivity of existing stores by adjusting the breadth and depth of its merchandise offerings to suit customer preferences. Consequently, it remains focused on expanding, renovating and relocating stores to adapt to the changing market conditions. We believe these initiatives will go a long way in retaining the company's existing customers while attracting new ones.However, Bed Bath & Beyond has been grappling with soft gross and operating margins for the past six quarters now. Management expects this trend to continue in fiscal 2017 due to higher shipping and coupon expenses as well as rise in SG&A expense.Additionally, the company’s dismal comparable store sales (comps) trend remains a concern. Driven by initial comps performance in the fiscal fourth quarter, it projects comps to decline in the low-single-digit percentage range. Further, it envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share of roughly $3.00, which reflects a decline of more than 30% from the year-ago period.Though Bed Bath & Beyond is striving hard to spark a turnaround, the current dismal trends cannot simply be overlooked. So, let’s see what is in store for the company in the upcoming release.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Bed Bath & Beyond is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.07%. This, along with the company’s Zacks Rank #3, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

215,KMB,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 27, before the opening bell. We note that the company’s bottom-line results outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the preceding four quarters, with an average surprise of 4.3%. Incidentally, the company’s well-chalked buyouts, product innovations and efficiency enhancing initiatives have been yielding well.With these in mind, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement and see if his leading distributor of spices, seasonings and other specialty food products can maintain its positive earnings surprise streak.Expansion Efforts Aid Consumer & Industrial BusinessesAcquisitions have long been favoring McCormick’s performance, aiding the company to develop a robust product portfolio and strengthen its base business. To this end, McCormick’s buyout of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc in August 2017 deserves special mention. Apart from adding iconic brands to McCormick’s portfolio, the deal has been aiding sales growth in the company’s industrial and consumer business segments for a while.Looking back, the company’s past acquisitions have played a significant role in bolstering its performance. Some of the noteworthy buyouts of the company include Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA (Dec 2016) and Australia-based Botanical Food Company (April 2016). Markedly, additional sales from buyouts of RB Foods, Giotti and Gourmet Garden contributed 6% to the company’s constant currency sales growth in fiscal 2017. Also, management expects additional sales from RB Foods to contribute 8% to fiscal 2018 sales growth.Apart from acquisitions, McCormick regularly undertakes innovations to add new products to its portfolio, stay competitive and tap the evolving demand for new flavors, spices and herbs.  Notably, the company’s innovation agenda is primarily based on the health and wellness of consumers at large. The company is planning to offer innovative flavors in breakfast platform and ready-to-serve gravies. McCormick is also shaping up portfolio with gluten-free, non-GMO and organic products to cater to the evolving needs of consumers. In 2016, the company renovated its core products with non-GMO labeling on everyday spices and seasonings.Such constant growth endeavors have indeed aided in radically expanding and bolstering the company’s consumer and industrial business segments. To top it, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales related to consumer and industrial business segments for the first quarter i currently pegged at $762 and $480 million, respectively. The consensus mark depicts a growth of approximately 19.2% and 18.5% from the prior-year reported figures.Enhancing Savings Via the CCI ProgramMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. The program has enabled the company to increase investments, which has been leading to higher sales and profits. Notably, cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $117 million in fiscal 2017, up from $109 million in fiscal 2016. McCormick is on track with its four-year targeted savings of around $400 million by November 2019.Notably, cost savings from CCI helped the company deliver double-digit adjusted operating income growth in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. The adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points (bps), marking the eighth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Further, gross margin increased 180 bps in the fourth quarter and is likely to expand in the range of 150-20 bps in fiscal 2018. The company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, with plans to achieve cost savings of $100 million.  Hurdles Yet to Be CrossedAlthough the company has been progressing well with savings and business expansion plans, higher input costs have been hurting McCormick’s performance of late. In fact, higher raw material costs, along with increased brand marketing and freight expenses also affected the company’s performance in the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits. Nevertheless, we expect these downsides to adequately be cushioned by the company’s CCI program and efficient pricing strategies.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteWhat Picture Do Estimates Provide?    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter has been stable over the past thirty days at 91 cents. Expected earnings for the quarter under review depicts a rise of 19.7%, from the prior-year reported figures.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,235 million for the first quarter, reflecting an improvement of 18.3% from the year-ago period sales figure.A Look at the Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although McCormick carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

216,KMB,"Shares of Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) have lost 4.4% in the past three months, while the industry declined 1.2%. The consumer goods company has been battling input cost inflation as well as strained gross margins. However, Kimberly-Clark is strongly concentrating on its Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE program, as well as its 2018 Global Restructuring plan.These solid efforts should help the company offset the aforementioned hurdles, and revive the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Cost Hurdles AaWorryKimberly-Clark is battling higher input costs, which have been troubling the company for a while now. Evidently, commodity cost inflation of $175 million, stemming from greater costs of pulp and other raw materials, caused Kimberly-Clark’s adjusted operating profit to fall 3% in the first quarter of 2018.  For 2018, management now expects input cost inflation of about $400-$550 million, higher than the previously projected range of $300-$400 million.Moreover, the company is struggling with strained gross margin, which has been declining year-over-year for quite some time now. In first-quarter 2018, gross margin contracted roughly 890 bps to 28% on account of commodity cost inflation and lower selling prices.Will 2018 Global Restructuring & FORCE Programs Help?Kimberly-Clark has been taking robust steps to lower costs. This is highlighted by its recently unveiled 2018 Global Restructuring Program and its ongoing FORCE Program. Management remains encouraged about its 2018 Global Restructuring Program, which marks the company’s biggest restructuring in a long time now. This plan is likely to enhance the company’s underlying profitability, help it compete better and provide greater flexibility to undertake growth-oriented investments. Delving deeper, we note that the program is expected to simplify Kimberly-Clark’s overhead organization and manufacturing supply chain structures.Notably, management expects cost savings of $50-$70 million from this program in 2018. Further, the company expects pre-tax savings of $500 million to $550 million from this program by the end of 2021, backed by production supply chain efficiencies and reduction in workforce. Further, the program will benefit all segments of the company, alongside being gainful for each major geographical region. Moreover, management originally announced plans to shut or divest nearly 10 manufacturing facilities, as well as expand production capacity at various other facilities to enhance scale and curtail costs.In this regard, the company revealed its intentions to sell or exit some low-margin businesses that deliver about 1% of net sales, mainly concentrated in the consumer tissue unit. Progressing on these lines, management recently announced plans to close its Consumer Tissue facility in California, while it also revealed intentions to shut down its nonwovens facility in Wisconsin.Also, Kimberly-Clark is aggressively cutting costs through its FORCE Program. In the first quarter, Kimberly-Clark generated savings of $90 million from this program and anticipates cost savings of $400 million in 2018. The company also expects to generate more than $1.5 billion over the four-year period, from 2018 to 2021. This will stem from management’s focus on enriching productivity at manufacturing facilities, optimizing design and raw material expenses, and attaining distribution efficiencies.On a combined basis, Kimberly-Clark expects cost savings of more than $2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program, over the next four years. It looks like these robust endeavors along with Kimberly-Clark’s key growth initiatives will likely bring the stock out of the woods.Don’t Miss These Solid Consumer Staples StocksOllie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 23%.

217,KMB,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is KMB due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Kimberly-Clark Posts In-Line Q1 Earnings, Sales BeatKimberly-Clark reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein quarterly earnings of $1.71 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased almost 9% year over year.Notably, adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 22% compared with 27.5% in the year-ago quarter.Kimberly-Clark’s sales advanced 5% to $4,731 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,599 million. Favorable currency movements benefitted sales by 3%. Additionally, organic sales improved 2%, driven by a 3% increase in volumes and marginally offset by a 1% decline in net selling prices.Within North America, organic sales in consumer products increased 3%, while it climbed 2% at K-C Professional. Internationally, organic sales advanced 2% across the developed market locations, while it rose 1% in developing and emerging markets.Adjusted operating profit inched-up 0.7% to $824 million. Results were aided by higher volumes, favorable currency translations worth close to $20 million as well as reduced spending on marketing, research and general spending.  Further, operating results also gained from cost savings of $90 million from the Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) program. These upsides were partially offset by lower net selling prices as well as increased input costs on account of greater costs of pulp and other raw materials.Segment DetailsPersonal Care Products: The segment includes products like disposable diapers, training/ youth/swim pants, baby wipes, feminine and incontinence care products.Segment sales of $2,307 million went up 3% during the quarter, courtesy of improved product mix and volumes, benefits from currency and buyout of the company’s joint venture in India, somewhat countered by lower net selling prices. Sales improved across North America, developing and emerging markets as well as the developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit fell 3% to $470 million in the quarter due to input cost inflation and lower selling prices, partly offset by cost savings, increased volumes, favorable currency rates and reduced expenditure on market research and general spending.Consumer Tissue: The segment includes bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products for household use.Segment sales gained 9% to $1,579 million in the quarter owing to volume growth and favorable currency rates, which were partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Segment sales gained year over year across all market regions, which include North America, developed regions outside North America as well as the developing and emerging markets.Segment operating profit plunged 11% to $249 million in the quarter on account of unfavorable product mix and input cost inflation, somewhat cushioned by cost savings, increased volumes, favorable currency rates as well as lower marketing, research and general costs.K-C Professional (KCP) & Other: The segment consists of facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers and a range of safety products.Segment sales grew 5% from the prior-year to $832 million in the quarter, backed by growth in volumes, improved net selling prices and product mix as well as positive impacts from currency rates. Sales improved in North America and developing and emerging markets. Sales also improved in the developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit rose 6% to $158 million, gaining from organic sales rise, cost savings, lower market research and general costs as well as positive impacts from currency rates. These were partially countered by input cost inflation.Other Financial UpdatesThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $626 million, long-term debt of $6,081 million and stockholders' equity of $555 million.Further, Kimberly-Clark generated cash flow of $542 million from operating activities during first-quarter 2018. During the same time frame, management incurred capital expenditures of $189 million.During the quarter, the company bought back 1.8 million shares for $204 million.Restructuring ProgramManagement is encouraged about its 2018 Global Restructuring Program, which marks the biggest restructuring in a long time. This plan is likely to enhance the company’s underlying profitability, help it compete better and provide greater flexibility to undertake growth-oriented investments. Delving deeper, we note that the program is expected to simplify Kimberly-Clark’s overhead organization and manufacturing supply chain structuresManagement continues to envision pre-tax savings worth approximately $500-550 million from this program by 2021 end, backed by production supply chain efficiencies and reduction in workforce. As part of this restructuring initiative, the company expects to sell or exit some low-margin businesses that deliver about 1% of net sales, mainly concentrated in the consumer tissue unit. The company expects pre-tax restructuring charges worth $1,700-$1,900 million by 2020 end, to execute this program.During the first quarter pre-tax restructuring charges under this initiative amounted to $577 million. Further, the company is on track with its $50-70 million savings targets from this initiative for 2018.Ups Sales Guidance for 2018Net sales are now expected to rise in a range of 2-3% compared with the previous band of 1-2%.On the flip side, the company expects input costs to rise even further, owing to a hike in the cost of pulp and other raw materials. Input cost inflation in now expected in the band of $400-550 million compared with the previous view of $300-$400 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.

218,KMB,"Wall Street is off to a disastrous start in the second quarter. Major bourses tumbled into correction for the second time this year and closed below key technical levels. Elevated trade tensions between the United States and China along with weakness in large-cap tech stocks are cited to be the reasons for the free fall. The prospect of rising interest rates and lofty valuations are expected to trigger another stock market correction in the near term.Given the turmoil, investing in defensive companies seems prudent. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns, consistent dividend and steady earnings growth regardless of the state of the equity market.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The S&P 500 finished 2.2% lower at 2,581.88 on Apr 2, down 10.1% from its record high in Jan 26. The broader index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since the U.K.’s vote for Brexit in June 2016. The Dow Jones also closed below the aforesaid technical level, indicating further downtrend in the near future.Unlike the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq somehow managed to avoid a correction but it did lose more than 10% from its record high attained in March. This leaves all the three major indices in negative territory for the year, while the CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index slipped further into “extreme fear” territory.Global Trade WarSelling in stocks intensified after China decided to impose tariffs on about 130 U.S. goods, including a 25% charge on U.S. pork and 15% on fruits. The world’s second largest economy retaliated against Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum shipments.All these have not only weighed on U.S. meat producers as well as industrial stocks, investors panicked as a full-fledged trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment. It may also dent first-quarter corporate earnings results slated to release this month.Big Tech SelloffAdding to the downbeat tone is a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), in the meantime, slipped after Trump lashed out at the e-commerce company on its tax policy and subsequent effect on bricks-and-mortar retailers. Another tech major Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) took a beating after Apple Inc. decided to break away from the chip maker and make its own chips in its Mac computers as early as 2020.Electric car maker Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) is also sinking after one of its driverless technology vehicles was involved in a fatal crash, while it recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles because of an issue related to a power steering component.Rate Hike FearsAmid all these, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve has hiked rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020.This hasn’t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy.How to Prepare for the SetbackAs the markets seem to be plagued with widespread uncertainty, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option. Such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors.Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity, gas and water are essentials. Food, beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations.5 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).UtilitiesCenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) operates as a public utility holding company in the United States. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a dividend yield of 4.2%.

219,KMB,"President Trump called for tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports that could hurt corporations as well as consumers. Such tariffs also stirred fears of a trade dispute between the United States and China. This in turn propelled Wall Street’s fear gauge index above its historic average and dragged the broader markets down.Inflation scare leading to rate hikes had already triggered a sudden panic among investors. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy. Amid such uncertainty, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as these provide higher total returns with lower volatility and are undoubtedly the holy grail of investing.Tariffs to Affect U.S. CorporationsWall Street began March on a sour note after Trump said that the United States will impose steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump said that the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. Such a protectionist trade policy may be one of the widest-reaching trade action he has taken to date, but it has triggered a lot of concern among corporations and consumers.Tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on aluminum and steel, like auto and plane makers. Needless to say, shares of Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) dipped around 3%. In fact, Corporate America has cautioned Trump that tariffs could backfire. After all, imports make up for about a third of the steel American business houses use every year.Higher prices on steel and aluminum, furthermore, will compel companies that rely on such products to pass on some of the costs to consumers. Increased consumer prices may in the long run hamper sales growth and affect the company, leading to job losses.Wall Street is Worried About a Trade WarTrump’s contentious tariff announcement has raised apprehensions about retaliation from China and other major U.S. trading partners. China cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy. We shouldn’t forget that China is the world’s dominant steel producer and Trump’s tariff moves could easily start a trade war between them.Li Xinchuang, vice secretary general of the China Iron and Steel Association, added that imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is an “extremely stupid move.” This will make U.S. industries fall behind globally during a period when “China is in its prime.”Tariffs also raise threats of a trade war with America’s closest allies, Canada. And why not? Canada is the top exporter of both steel and aluminum to the United States. Canada is solely responsible for manufacturing 17% of all the U.S. steel imports and 43% of all aluminum imports. Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, in the meantime, has announced that “should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers.”Rate Hike Fears LoomConcerns about trade came at a time when the broader market is already on a roller-coaster ride. The broader S&P 500 and the Dow tanked nearly 4% in February. Both the bourses had their worst month in two years. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) soared 15% on Mar 1, indicating that turbulence has picked up as well.Investors remain worried that rise in inflation in the near term will prompt the Fed to hike short-term interest rates at a faster pace than expected. This in turn will increase borrowing costs for business and consumers, which will eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy. It’s important to also note that an easy monetary policy helped the equity market notch a nearly nine-year bull run.Inflation to RiseRecent hike in pay levels raised worries about higher commodity prices. Wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years, according to the Labor Department. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Americans are now getting fatter paychecks mostly due to a tighter labor market, tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states.Consumers have also been ramping up their spending levels of late as they are largely benefiting from a rise in income. Traders predict that such upbeat consumer outlays will fuel inflation (read more: US Consumers Most Confident in 17 Years: Top 4 Picks).Minutes of the Jan 30-31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting has already shown that several officials expect inflation to move up this year and touch the Fed’s 2% target. Only a small number of them forecast inflation to fall short of 2%.Why Dividend Aristocrats? 5 Solid ChoicesGiven the aforesaid concerns, investing in dividend aristocrats seems judicious. Such companies have tremendous financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. They reflect solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals. They have also raked in excellent risk-adjusted returns over the last decade.We have, thus, selected five such dividend aristocrats to boost your returns. Such stocks also possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The favorable Zacks Rank should help these stocks to gain further this year.

220,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s (KMB  -  Free Report) savings initiatives have been an aspect of cheer lately. Further, the company is focused on making investments as well as undertaking effective restructuring plans to induce efficiency and enhance market share.However, softness in North American consumer products and the diaper segment as well as rising input costs have been posing concerns for a while. These factors have caused the company’s shares to drop 4.7% in the past six months, while it fared better than the industry's fall of 9%.Nevertheless, lets weigh both the sides and see if the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth initiatives can help it uplift the stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereEnsuring Fuller Pockets With Savings & RestructuringKimberly-Clark is aggressively cutting costs through its Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere, or FORCE Program. The program has successfully generated higher cost savings each year with record amount of $450 million in 2017.The company projects savings of $400 million in 2018 and more than $1.5 billion over the four-year period from 2018 to 2021. This will be achieved, courtesy of management’s focus on enriching productivity at manufacturing facilities, optimizing design and raw material expenses as well as attaining distribution efficiencies.Further, the company’s adherence toward maximizing savings and inducing operating efficiencies is evident from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program. In fact, the program is considered as one of the largest restructuring initiatives undertaken by the company. It primarily focuses on enhancing underlying profitability for better competition and provides greater flexibility to undertake growth-oriented investments.Delving deeper, we note that the program is expected to simplify Kimberly-Clark’s overhead organization and manufacturing supply chain structures. Notably, management expects cost savings of $50-$70 million from this program in 2018.Further, as part of enhancing efficiency, Kimberly-Clark plans to divest some low-margin businesses, mainly concentrated in the consumer tissue unit. On a combined basis, Kimberly-Clark expects cost savings of more than $2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program, over the next four years. Focus on Innovation Being a popular name in several consumer product categories, Kimberly-Clark regularly undertakes innovation to sustain its brand positions and market share. Over the near term, the company has a number of innovations lined up for launch in North America, including upgrades on Huggies diapers and baby wipes, Pull-Ups training pants, Depend and Poise in adult care and new Kleenex wet wipes.Hurdles to Be Crossed Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing rising input costs of late. Evidently, increased input costs on account of hiked rates of pulp and other raw materials caused adjusted operating profit to fall 2.7% in the fourth quarter.  In 2018, management expects input cost inflation of about $300-$400 million, primarily in international markets. Additionally, softness in North American consumer products and high competition in the diaper segment have been posing concerns. Final Thoughts  Wrapping up, Kimberly-Clark’s continued emphasis on reducing costs and making growth-oriented investments are expected to offset the aforementioned challenges. Also, management expects tax reforms to favorably impact its bottom-line and cash flows during 2018. Banking on such positives, management envisions adjusted earnings per share to grow roughly 11-16% year over year in 2018.All said, we expect the company’s robust initiatives and a positive outlook to help it overcome persistent challenges in the forthcoming periods.Looking for More?

221,KMB,"Wall Street should be rejoicing right now, with investors getting the much-wished-for corporate and income tax cuts. Moreover, the economy has been growing at a healthy annual pace of 3% for three straight quarters now. On the contrary, there is widespread panic in Wall Street, with all the major indices officially entering the correction territory that has extinguished the nearly nine-year bull run.Rising treasury yields has diminished the appeal of stocks, especially with valuations hovering at historically high levels. Bond yields moved north on expectations of an interest rate hike, courtesy of a possible uptick in inflation on stronger wage growth.Investors also pointed that stocks suffered a bloodbath from the unwinding of trades linked to bets on volatility staying low. Add to this the political worries emanating from issues related to a second government shutdown, and stocks are likely to continue their free fall.Given the turbulence, investing in low beta defensive companies seems prudent. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns, consistent dividend and steady earnings regardless of the state of the equity market.Bears Rip Stocks As the Market Enters CorrectionBears dominated the market on Feb 8, as it showed more signs of institutional selling. The broader S&P 500 slumped 100.66 points, or 3.8%, to 2,581, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,032.89 points, or 4.2%, to close at 23,860.46, its second worst point decline in history. Both the indices are now officially into the correction territory, down more than 10% from the recent all-time high reached in January.In fact, the equity market is witnessing its first genuine bout of gyration in years, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge registering its largest percentage jump in history. VIX rose 14.4% to close the day at 31.72. Any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market, but a reading of greater than 30 shows a high level of investor fear.Here’s What Usually Happens After a CorrectionThe equity market was on a confirmed uptrend until this week. Stocks were in such a free fall that on Feb 5, major indices undercut important support areas. All of them fell through their 50-day moving averages, including many leading stocks, Apple APPL for instance, undercutting its 200-day line.The key indices are now “officially” into correction territory, with things getting worse. According to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), if this is a bull market correction then volatility is expected to persist for another four months. But, if the loss deepens into a bear market, or a drop of 20% from the recent all-time high, it could be 22 months of pain for investors.Why Did the Stock Market Crash?Continuous rise in bond yields rattled the equity market, resulting in a downturn. Investors pulled money out of stocks as an uptick in bond yields made equities less attractive by increasing their opportunity cost.Record rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Fed will hike rates more times than anticipated. Wages grew at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009.Wages grew at the fastest pace since the end of the last decade on a tighter labor market, tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute.How to Prepare for the PullbackAs the markets seem to be plagued with widespread uncertainty, including stretched valuations, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option. Such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors.Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity, gas and water are essentials. Food, beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations.5 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Further, only low-beta stocks from such defensive companies have been selected. After all, low-beta stocks are the ones that are less correlated to the index and tend to be less volatile. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.UtilitiesBT Group (BT  -  Free Report) provides communications services worldwide, including the United States. It has a beta of 0.97. The company has a dividend yield of 5.9%, while its five-year average dividend yield is 7.2%. The stock, which is part of the Diversified Communication Services industry, is expected to give a solid return of 11.5% and 3.2% in the current quarter and year, respectively.National Fuel Gas Company (NFG  -  Free Report) operates as a diversified energy company. It has a beta of 0.88. The company has a dividend yield of 3.3%, while its five-year average dividend yield is 2.6%. The company, which is part of the Utility - Gas Distribution industry, is expected to give a steady return of 3.9% and 7.3% in the current and next quarter, respectively.Consumer StaplesKimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report), together with its subsidiaries, manufactures and markets personal care, consumer tissue, and professional products worldwide.

The stock, which is part of the Cosmetics industry, is expected to yield a solid return of 15.4% and 25.7% in the current quarter and year, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

222,KMB,"U.S. bourses have suffered the worst fall in six years, triggering a worldwide bloodbath of stocks. It has severely affected investors who had vouched for an extended period of market calm. The major cause of the selling is concerns over inflation and rising interest rates that pushed bond yields higher at the expense of stocks.With the markets witnessing a healthy pullback after a strong run, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns seems judicious.Steepest Sell-Off Since 2011The Dow has tanked 1,175 points, or 4.6%, to 24,345.75 at the closing bell on Feb 5 — marking the steepest one-day drop since Aug 10, 2011. All the 30 components of the blue-chip index ended in the red.The S&P 500 shed 113.19 points, or 4.1%, to 2,648.94. The large-cap index’s percentage drop was the largest since Aug 18, 2011. It was also almost close to a 5% pullback. The index had somehow managed to complete 406 sessions without such a decline, registering its longest period without a 5% pullback in 20 years. All the S&P 500 sectors were down as well. The financial sector declined the maximum at 5%. Other sectors that fell more than 4% were healthcare, industrials, energy, telecommunications and information technology. They were followed by consumer cyclicals and utilities, which lost 3.3% and 1.7%, respectively.Such a sell-off followed last week’s worst weekly decline for the Dow and the S&P 500 in more than two years. The indices turned negative for the year, while the Nasdaq managed to retain a gain of 0.9%. Nevertheless, the tech-laden index dropped 273.42 points, or 3.8%, to end yesterday’s session at 6,967.53.The day’s broad-based weakness drove the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, 104% to 35.02, its highest since August 2015, per FactSet. The VIX shows expectations of volatility in the broader market, and trades inversely to the major benchmarks roughly 80% of the time.Robust Jobs Data — Major Reason for the TumbleEveryone one was quick to name the culprit and it was the jobs data. Stronger-than-expected job addition along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years sparked fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected. In fact, the U.S. 10-year bond yields touched a four-year high as investors continue to take money away from the equity market and flee into treasury for safety. The 10-year treasury note at one point jumped as high as 2.883%, but, ended the day at 2.72%.Coming to the jobs report, the labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with broad-based job gains recorded in January. Non-farm payrolls climbed 200,000 jobs last month after rising 160,000 last December, per the Labor Department. In fact, the economy added jobs for 88 successive months, while unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1%.Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Wages grew at the fastest pace since the end of the last decade on a tighter labor market, tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).Buy These 5 Ultra-Safe Stocks NowGiven the aforesaid factors, it seems like Wall Street is facing a bloodbath. After all, the stock market’s tried-and-tested policy of buying the dip that involves scooping up companies at attractive valuations following sell-offs has failed to boost equities this time around. Moreover, market pundits have been predicting a correction for quite some time. The stock market has remained calmed for a pretty long time, courtesy of a sturdy economy and low interest rates. But, as evident, such things don’t last long.Taking this into consideration mind, let’s take a look at which stocks are worth a bet at the moment. Investors should build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns.

223,KMB,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) has been keen on the execution of its transformation plan through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement, and cost-savings plans. In a move to accelerate the pace of transformation, the company is looking to exit non-strategic assets, reduce complexity and focus on key consumer-focused brands. This will help improve operational performance and enhance shareholder value, amid a rapidly changing retail backdrop.Additionally, the company reported soft preliminary results for 2017 and lowered view. Moreover, it outlined the initial expectations for 2018.Consequently, shares of Newell Brands as much as 18.9% since the news. Overall, the stock has declined 37.4% in the last three months, against the industry’s growth of 0.5%.Coming back to the transformation plan, the company is accelerating the pace by restricting Newell’s portfolio on nine core consumer segments that can garner nearly $11 billion of sales and $2 billion of EBITDA. Further, the company is looking for strategic alternatives for assets in its industrial and commercial product as well as smaller consumer businesses.Brands to be evaluated in the industrial and commercial product business include Waddington, Process Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Mapa. Meanwhile, the company’s Rawlings, Goody, Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage, and U.S. Playing Cards are other brands chosen for exploring strategic options.The strategic alternatives for these brands will significantly lower the company’s operational complexity by reducing 50% of its global factory and warehouse presence. Additionally, it will reduce the company’s customer base by 50% and result in consolidation of 80% of global sales on two ERP platforms by end of 2019. The completion of these plans will aid in making Newell a nearly $11 billion focused portfolio company with leading consumer-facing brands, attractive margins and significant growth potential in global categories.The company anticipates after tax proceeds from these efforts to be higher than what is required to reach a leverage ratio below the lower-end of the current leverage ratio target range. The company is likely to start the evaluation process immediately with results from the transactions coming by the end of 2019. With this, the company anticipates to be better positioned in the dynamic retail landscape with its leading brands, excellent marketing, innovation and solid e-commerce capabilities.Throwing light on the performance in 2017, the company stated that core sales remained soft due to widening of gap between sell-in and sell-through results driven by continuation of retailer inventory rebalancing in the United States and the bankruptcy of leading baby retailer. Further, the company’s margins were hurt by the negative mix of lower Writing sales and lower fixed cost absorption due to shorter cycle runs on self-manufactured products, designed to reduce inventories and maximize operating cash flow.However, the company remains encouraged by brands performance as well as strength in e-commerce business, which maintained a double-digit growth rate. Further, the company expanded market share while accelerating sell-through growth rates in the United States in the fourth quarter, ahead of the third-quarter levels. This reaffirms the company’s confidence in its brands, design and innovation-driven strategy.Further, the company’s efforts to improve working capital seems to be paying off with nearly $1 billion of operating cash flows generated in the fourth quarter, in spite of increased margin pressure from planned downtime of factories and input cost inflation.Based on the preliminary results, the company lowered projections for 2017 and provided an initial view for 2018. The company now expects core sales growth of nearly 0.8% in 2017, compared with 1.5-2% growth predicted earlier. Normalized earnings per share for 2017 are estimated to be $2.72-$2.76, compared with the previous forecast of $2.80-$2.85.The aforementioned $1 billion operating cash flows for the fourth quarter resulted in $930 million operating cash flow for the full year. This surpassed the company’s prior expectation of $700-$800 million.For 2018, the company expects to record core sales growth driven by continued gain market share gains in its core categories and geographies, partially offset by persistent retailer inventory reductions. The company anticipates normalized earnings per share of $2.65-$2.85. The company assumes tax rate of 20-21% including the benefits of U.S. tax reform. Operating cash flow for the year is estimated in the range of $1.15-$1.45 billion, excluding the effect of potential divestitures.This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock is scheduled to release financial results for the fourth quarter and 2017 on Feb 16, 2018.Looking for Some Interesting Consumer Stocks?

In 2018, the company expects incurring pre-tax restructuring charges of about $1,200-$1,350 million.Apart from this program, the company remains on track with its robust FORCE program. In this regard, the company anticipates cost savings of more than $1.5 billion to be generated over the four-year period from 2018 to 2021. This will stem from management’s focus on enriching productivity at manufacturing facilities; optimizing design and raw material expenses and attaining distribution efficiencies.On a combined basis, Kimberly-Clark expects cost savings of more than $2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program, over the next four years.Guidance for 2018Kimberly-Clark provided its overall outlook for 2018. Net sales are expected to rise in a range of 1-2%, while organic sales are anticipated to climb nearly 1% on volume growth. Management stated that it expects net selling prices and product mix to remain similar in 2018, or be slightly higher than 2017. Sales are likely to remain neutral to receive a 1% benefit from currency changes, and it is also likely to get a boost from the buyout of the company’s joint venture in India.Adjusted operating profit is expected to jump 2-5%, buoyed by cost savings of nearly $400 million from the FORCE program and $50-$70 million from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program. However, management expects input cost inflation of about $300-$400 million.Interest costs are expected to tank nearly 20% and effective tax rate is envisioned in a band of 23% to 26%.Considering all factors, the company envisions adjusted earnings per share to grow roughly 11-16% year over year to about $6.90-$7.20. Notably, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2018 is pegged much lower at $6.56, which is likely to witness upward revision.Looking for More?

225,KMB,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) lost luster lately due to lower core sales, weak margins, adverse pricing and commodity cost inflation, despite reporting better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2017. Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have lost 34.4% in the last six months, much wider than the industry’s decline of 8.9%. The stock also has a Growth Score of D, which questions its growth prospects.Given this backdrop, Newell’s transformation plan seems to be a blessing in disguise for the stock. The plan focuses on enhancing its operational efficiency and boosting shareholder value, amid a rapidly changing retail backdrop. Meanwhile, the company has been progressing well with the execution of its transformation plan through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement and cost-savings plans.Recently, management also expanded its accelerated transformation plan aimed at developing a simpler, faster and stronger company. Additionally, Newell believes that there are more divestiture opportunities, which can yield a total of roughly $10 billion after-tax from the accelerated transformation plan. However, the company retained that it will divest operations at competitive market multiples only.Furthermore, management reaffirmed continuing the execution of its strategic plans. These initiatives include optimizing its portfolio by focusing on brands with attractive margins and growth potential in global categories; boosting operating efficiency and simplifying operations; enhancing financial flexibility for higher free cash flow and shareholders’ returns; and making the most of Newell’s scale and differentiated capabilities for higher market share gains.Earlier, the company accelerated the pace of its transformation plan by restricting Newell’s portfolio on nine core consumer segments that can garner nearly $11 billion of sales and $2 billion of EBITDA. Moreover, it is looking for strategic alternatives for assets in its industrial and commercial product as well as smaller consumer businesses. The strategic alternatives for these brands are expected to significantly lower the company’s operational complexity by reducing 50% of its global factory and warehouse presence.Additionally, these alternatives should reduce the company’s customer base by 50% and result in consolidation of 80% of global sales on two ERP platforms by end of 2019. On completion of these plans, Newell is expected to become a nearly $11 billion focused portfolio company, with leading consumer-facing brands, attractive margins and significant growth potential in global categories.That said, we believe the transformation plan has the potential to change the fate of Newell, bringing it back on growth trajectory. However, the near-term headwinds might continue to impact the stock’s performance.Want Top-Ranked Stocks in the Same Space? Count on TheseEnergizer Holdings, Inc.

"
226,KMB,"Consumer Staples companies sell relatively low-priced products that consumers use frequently in their daily lives, including food, beverages and products for personal hygiene or household cleaning. The enduring demand for these products irrespective of the economic cycle gives the sector a defensive posture.
"
227,KMB,"Consumer staples stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 as a whole in the year-to-date period, generating gains of 16.8% in the year-to-date period compared with gains of 14.9% for S&P 500.
"
228,KMB,"Though consumer staple companies, due to their defensive nature, are much less exposed to changes in income, they are still impacted when consumer confidence drops or income growth declines. In that case, consumers tend to buy staples but will prefer cheaper brands, which will hurt the profitability of the sector.Innovations
"
229,KMB,"Consumer product companies regularly need to innovate and upgrade their brands to boost consumer confidence and create differentiated value propositions for their customers in order to remain successful.
"
230,KMB,"A consumer product giant Procter & Gamble Co (PG  -  Free Report) has a strong tradition of not only introducing blockbuster products but also of creating new categories. The company has consistently increased market share in fast growing businesses over the years through innovation and new product launches. Through its game-changing new products like Daz automatic detergent and concentrated liquid detergent, P&G was able to capture a strong market share in U.K. in the laundry category in 2011.
"
231,KMB,"Similarly, Head & Shoulders has transformed itself from merely being a North American brand to the largest shampoo brand in the world due to the company’s marketing efforts and product innovation. In 2012, P&G invested around $2 billion in innovation. It intends to expand its innovation and marketing strategies to more categories, geographies and channels, thus boosting top- and bottom-line growth.
"
232,KMB,"Chocolate maker The Hershey Co. (HSY  -  Free Report) regularly innovates in its core brands to meet consumer needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. Some successful product innovations in recent years include Reese's Minis, Hershey's Drops and Rolo minis. Some new products lined up for 2013 include Kit Kat Minis (Jun 2013), Twizzlers Bites, Jolly Ranchers Bites, Kisses Deluxe, Hershey's Mais and many more. The company also has products planned for some international markets like China, Mexico and Brazil in 2013.
"
233,KMB,"Beverage company PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) regularly creates new flavors of existing products alongside maintaining a robust pipeline of new products. The company also invests aggressively in new packaging to shift consumers to more profitable purchases. PepsiCo’s popular innovations at the premium end include Quaker Real Medleys hot cereals, Stacy's Gingerbread and Stacy's Cocoa and Lay's Stax potato chips. The new products are expected to boost revenue growth and also enable increased price realization in the long run.
"
234,KMB,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co (TAP  -  Free Report) introduced several beer brands in 2012 to ensure variety. New brands like Rickard's Cardigan and Oakhouse in the above-premium portfolio were launched in Canada. New varieties of beer brand Leinenkugel were rolled out in the U.S. under the Lemon Berry Shandy and Batch 19 brands.
"
235,KMB,"Most recently, the company launched a non-beer drink, Molson Canadian Cider, made from apples. Cider will form a part of the popular Canadian beer brand Molson Canadian. Molson Coors has plans to roll out beer brands like Apple Ale and Third Shift brands under Redd's beer brand in 2013 in the U.S. These brands are strengthening the company’s portfolio and also adding to its market share.
"
236,KMB,"Shifting Focus on Health and Wellness and ‘Good-for-You’ Products
"
237,KMB,"Other than enhancing its products, the companies are also focusing on shifting consumer preferences, increasing health consciousness and rising obesity concerns. The companies are now inclined toward making healthier and nutritious products.
"
238,KMB,"Beverage companies like The Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo are slowly expanding their portfolio of non-carbonated drinks due to the increasing awareness about calorie intake and nutrition among consumers. Though these companies are still largely dependent on its carbonated beverages, the changing consumer preference toward health and wellness products pushes them to introduce a variety of non-carbonated beverages.
"
239,KMB,"While Coca-Cola commands a leading position in the juices or still beverages category with its flagship brands such as Minute Maid, Simply and POWERade, PepsiCo is also increasing its focus on low calorie beverages, non-carbonated beverages and healthier snacks. The company’s low calorie cola, Pepsi Next and its 24-ounce can for regular and diet Dew have been well received.
"
240,KMB,"The company also formed a joint venture with Theo Muller Group to open a new yogurt production facility to produce different varieties of yogurt, which is one of the fastest growing categories in the U.S. There is a huge demand for nutritious products and yogurts being rich in protein, calcium and vitamin D will prove to be a healthy snack. Further, the company’s nutrition brands like Quaker, Tropicana and Gatorade are expected to reap benefits from shifting consumer preference toward health and wellness products.
"
241,KMB,"Tobacco companies are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have developed less harmful tobacco products. Increasing health consciousness among youth has reduced the demand for tobacco over time, thus forcing the companies to look for other alternatives like e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes are very popular among youngsters as they have the same simulating effect as cigarettes but are less harmful.Altria Group Inc (MO  -  Free Report) has developed innovative, less harmful and non-combustible nicotine- products for adult tobacco consumers in collaboration with Okono A/S. This is expected to help the company gain market share in the industry. Moreover, existing smokeless tobacco brands like Copenhagen and Skoal are also gaining retail share, having grown from 47.5% in 2008 to 50.6% in 2012.
"
242,KMB,"In addition, in Jun 2012, Altria's subsidiary Nu Mark introduced Verve Discs, a mint-flavored, chewable tobacco product that contains tobacco-derived nicotine, which has been widely accepted by consumers as a substitute to harmful tobacco derivatives. Nu Mark also plans to launch its first e-cigarette brand MarkTen in Aug 2013.
"
243,KMB,"Another cigarette maker Lorillard Inc (LO) acquired the e-cigarette brand blu e-Cigs in Apr 2012. blu e-Cigs look like traditional cigarettes but do not produce smoke, ash or smell. The company’s sales significantly increased post-acquisition and we believe the rising popularity of e-cigarettes will boost blu e-Cigs popularity in the upcoming quarters amid overall slowdown in the cigarette industry.
"
244,KMB,"Another tobacco seller, Reynolds American Inc (RAI) also remains committed to stimulating demand through new and innovative products in the smokeless category, owing to growing health concerns. New mint flavors for the Camel brand of smokeless tobacco like Camel SNUS are intended to meet changing demand.
"
245,KMB,"Moreover, American Snuff’s Grizzly natural premium style cigarettes introduced in 2012 occupy a major portion of America’s smokeless tobacco market. Reynolds American’s Zonnic nicotine replacement therapy gum and the Vuse e-cigarette brand offer potential for long-term commercial success.Cost Reduction and Restructuring Initiatives
"
246,KMB,"In order to boost profits and top-line growth, most consumer staples companies are divesting low-margin brands, improving the supply chain and implementing cost-reduction initiatives. These initiatives help companies to reduce the effects of inflating commodity costs and other input costs, which have remained a drag on margins of most companies in this sector, despite top-line growth.
"
247,KMB,"Coca-Cola is undertaking various productivity initiatives to streamline its cost structure and boost profitability. With the launch of a four-year productivity and reinvestment program in Feb 2012, the company plans to optimize its global supply chain, improve global marketing and innovation, achieve operating expense leverage, standardize information systems and integrate North American bottling and distribution operations acquired from Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE). The program is expected to generate incremental annualized savings of $550 to $600 million over a four-year period ending 2015.
"
248,KMB,"PepsiCo also announced a restructuring program in Feb 2012. It is expected to result in productivity savings of $900 million in 2013, which will go up to $3 billion through 2015. The program will include leveraging new technologies and processes across operations, consolidating facilities, simplifying organization structures, lowering layers of management and workforce.
"
249,KMB,"Consumer products giant, Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB  -  Free Report) is streamlining its manufacturing facilities in Europe. As a part of this initiative, the company dissolved the diaper segment in Western and Central Europe, except the Italian market. This reduced the European workforce by approximately 1,300 to 1,500 positions. The company has stopped selling Huggies diapers in 13 countries so far and expects to exit the remaining five markets by the end of Jun 2013.
"
250,KMB,"Its cost savings program FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere) is expected to generate cost savings of $250–$300 million in 2013 and benefit the company through the continued rollout of lean manufacturing and supply chain practices and the formation of a global procurement organization.
"
251,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark’s pulp and tissue restructuring program helped improve underlying profitability and return on invested capital of its consumer tissue and K-C Professional businesses. Kimberly-Clark anticipates operating profit to increase by at least $75 million in 2013 and at least $100 million in 2014 through the restructuring plan.The J. M. Smucker Co. (SJM  -  Free Report) has also been involved in restructuring its coffee, fruit spreads and Canadian pickle and condiments operations since 2010. The initiative involves capital investments in a food manufacturing facility in Ohio; consolidation of coffee production in Louisiana; and transfer of the company’s pickle and condiments production to third-party manufacturers.
"
252,KMB,"These initiatives will lead to workforce reduction, closure of six facilities and reduction in the overall cost structure in 2013. In Feb 2013, Smucker announced a capacity expansion initiative, scheduled to be completed in 2014, to support the company’s growing peanut and other nut butter businesses.
"
253,KMB,"Global brewer Molson Coors began a number of new initiatives in the third quarter of 2012 for the next two years. The initiatives involved combining its UK and Ireland businesses with its newly-acquired StarBev breweries (later named as Molson Coors Central Europe) to create a single unit called Molson Coors Europe.
"
254,KMB,"Other than this, the company liquidated its under-performing China joint venture, restructured its Coors Light beer business in the rest of China, improved performance in Japan, and integrated the Central Europe license and export business. These initiatives are expected to improve the efficiency of the organization and generate additional resources to invest in brands and innovation.Expansion in Emerging Markets
"
255,KMB,"Besides costs saving initiatives, many consumer staples companies are shifting their focus to emerging markets to boost sales. With market saturation, low disposable income of consumers, uncertain macroeconomic conditions and increased competitive activity in developed markets, these companies are diverting their resources to explore emerging markets.
"
256,KMB,"Though companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are witnessing improving volume trends in North America, driven by increased marketing and advertising spending, we believe that the North American markets are relatively mature compared to their untapped counterparts such as Brazil, India, China, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia, which exhibit consumer spending growth.
"
257,KMB,"Moreover, we have seen that the demand for convenient and branded packaged food tends to grow as middle-class consumers shift to urban living. Thus the rising pool of middle class consumers in emerging markets represents a huge opportunity for the companies.
"
258,KMB,"However, the increasing presence in the emerging markets also brings along the negative impact from currencies for many consumer staples companies. A stronger dollar reduces the value of outside-U.S. sales and in turn limits growth in the emerging markets. However, with improving standard of living in developing countries, the companies are now focusing on increasing pricing to derive profits, which was difficult earlier.
"
259,KMB,"PepsiCo is expanding in nations like Russia, Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom and also in the emerging markets of China, India, Brazil and Africa by offering locally relevant innovation and value-added products. Bottling consolidation in Mexico and the strategic partnership with leading Chinese food and beverage maker Tingyi have strengthened PepsiCo’s business in those countries.
"
260,KMB,"Further, with the acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann in Sep 2011, PepsiCo took control of the largest food-and-beverage business in Russia, bringing the company closer to its strategic goal of building a $30 billion nutrition business by 2020. The company has tripled its revenues from the emerging and developing markets in the past five years. Going forward, management expects two-third of its revenues to come from the emerging markets.
"
261,KMB,"Tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) also commands a footprint in a large number of markets. Asia remains a growth engine for the company. It witnessed robust growth in Indonesia, China, Philippines and Korea.
"
262,KMB,"Further, through strategic acquisitions like Sampoerna in Indonesia and Larkson in Pakistan in 2012, the company has gained a strong foothold in the non OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) markets. In addition, Philip Morris’ acquisition (which is expected to close by Sep 2013) of 100% interest in its Mexican subsidiary will boost its presence in Mexico.
"
263,KMB,"Cereal maker General Mills, Inc (GIS) also focuses on expansion in China, Brazil, India and Russia where consumer spending is on the rise. The company is especially focusing on China, which has one of the largest numbers of consumers given its growing number of middle-class and affluent households.
"
264,KMB,"The company plans to achieve $600 million in sales from its wholly-owned businesses in China in fiscal 2013 and $900 million by 2015. In Brazil, the company’s growth prospects have improved largely following the acquisition of Yoki. In India, though the company’s business is small, it is growing quickly. Sales in India are expected to exceed $70 million in fiscal 2013.OPPORTUNITIES
"
265,KMB,"Despite macroeconomic headwinds, some of these companies have been able to deliver impressive results and have the potential to grow in the upcoming quarters. The positive earnings momentum of consumer staples stocks, which resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Kraft Foods Group Inc (KRFT), PepsiCo and Lorillard, reflects the improved business backdrop.
"
266,KMB,"Food maker Kraft Foods Group has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate since it was spun off from Kraft Foods, Inc into an independent company last year in Oct 2012. In first quarter 2013, Kraft Foods beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both revenues and earnings on the back of solid innovation and stepped up advertising spending for its biggest brands.
"
267,KMB,"The company also reaffirmed its full year 2013 outlook. We are encouraged by Kraft’s aggressive cost reduction and efficiency-improvement initiatives, which will provide more cash for innovation, brand building and marketing initiatives. Kraft also aims to maximize cash flow, which will be used to pay robust dividends.
"
268,KMB,"PepsiCo has delivered positive surprises in the last four quarters on the back of improved performance of its snacks business and encouraging growth in the international markets. The company’s strong brand portfolio, its product and geographic diversity, productivity gains, solid organic revenue growth and strong margins also contributed to growth. Year 2012 was a turning point for PepsiCo with increased investments in brand building, market execution and innovation and improved productivity expected to set the foundation for further growth and competitive advantage.
"
269,KMB,"PepsiCo is positive for 2013 too. The company expects to achieve its top-line target through its strong portfolio of beverages, snacks and healthy & wellness brands. Moreover, the company noticed that many international markets are relatively untapped by other companies, especially for products like salty snacks. Hence, PepsiCo enjoys a competitive advantage over other players.
"
270,KMB,"We are also impressed with cigarette manufacturer Lorillard, which has a dominant share in the tobacco market owing to the popularity of its premium brand Newport and value brand Maverick. Newport continues to gain popularity despite higher pricing and amid overall slowdown in the cigarette industry. Moreover, it is adapting to changing consumer demands by investing in less-hazardous alternatives for tobacco with the acquisition of blu eCigs and developing electronic cigarettes. The rising demand for electronic cigarettes is expected to boost blu e-Cigs sales, going ahead.
"
271,KMB,"There are some other attractive stocks which are worth considering though they carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). They are Kellogg Co (K), Tyson Foods Inc (TSN  -  Free Report), Hershey and Smucker.
"
272,KMB,"Smucker’s performance remained strong in all the four quarters of fiscal 2013 (ending April), driven by a strong portfolio of brands, focus on innovations and promotional offerings. Moreover, strategic acquisitions have broadened Smucker’s presence across emerging markets and added popular brands to its portfolio.
"
273,KMB,"Stabilizing coffee costs also improved margins at Smucker's. The company has increased its fiscal 2013 earnings guidance twice, reflecting the company’s potential to drive profits in the coming quarters.
"
274,KMB,"Kellogg has strong earnings potential as it delivered solid growth in earnings in all the four quarters of 2012, driven by robust organic sales growth performance. Though Kellogg’s performance was weak in the first quarter of 2013 due to decline in the snacks category, higher costs and headwinds from the Venezuela currency devaluation, the company remains positive for 2013 and has re-affirmed its 2013 guidance.
"
275,KMB,"Despite its sluggish cereal business, challenges in Europe and rising input costs, we are optimistic about Kellogg’s solid brand positioning, its geographic diversity and cost-saving efforts, especially its supply-chain initiatives. Moreover, we are encouraged by the growth potential of the Pringles snack business, which was acquired in June last year from P&G.
"
276,KMB,"Even with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), chocolate maker Hershey has solid growth potential driven by strong brand positioning, strategic marketing investments in core brands, disciplined innovation, lower cost inflation, improved pricing and volumes and strong productivity. In fact, Hershey has outperformed and delivered positive surprises in four out of the last five quarters. The company has raised its guidance thrice in 2012, highlighting its attractive earnings potential.
"
277,KMB,"Meat products processor Tyson Foods has been delivering strong earnings in the past several quarters. Though the first-quarter fiscal 2013 (ending Sept) results were sluggish, we remain encouraged with the company’s strong product portfolio and its presence in the international markets, particularly in China, Mexico and India. Tyson is also focusing on strengthening its presence in Mexican cuisine, as Mexican food is becoming increasingly popular in the U.S. processed food industry.
"
278,KMB,"To enhance its portfolio with Mexican cuisine brands, Tyson acquired the assets of Circle Foods in early-June, which owns popular brands like Nuevo Grille and Tortillaland handheld Mexican products, Tortillaland uncooked tortillas and ROTILAND Indian flat breads. Tyson’s focus on Mexican food is also evident from its strategic acquisition of the Mexican snacks and tortilla producer, Don Julio Foods of Clearfield, Utah in Apr 2013. Tyson also has acquisitions and new product launches in the pipeline for 2013.WEAKNESSES
"
279,KMB,"The macro-economic environment in the U.S. has remained challenging and uncertain for quite some time. U.S. consumers are burdened with higher gasoline prices, payroll tax increases and a labor market that is improving at a glacial pace. These external forces might restrict consumer discretionary spending in addition to slow job growth, high interest rates and tightened credit availability. The persistently sluggish European economic conditions also create an overhang. We expect these global economic pressures to continue in 2013.
"
280,KMB,"While the acquisition of StarBev Breweries in Jun 2012 opened doors of opportunities for Molson Coors in the attractive beer market in Central Europe, the unfavorable economic conditions in Europe are expected to offset the gains from this acquisition. Moreover, the acquisition has increased the debt burden of the company.
"
281,KMB,"In addition, the company has been facing continued decline in volumes in three major markets of U.S., U.K. and Canada in the last three years. Lack of brand marketing and unfavorable weather conditions are also hurting volumes. Though Molson Coors has been spending on marketing and advertising for its Miller Lite and the Molson beer brands, it has not led to consistent growth in volumes.
"
282,KMB,"The increasing raw material costs of the company and the currency headwinds are also denting top-line growth. We believe that tough global macroeconomic conditions and declining volume trends will continue to drag the company’s performance in the upcoming quarters. Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
"
283,KMB,"The consumer products giant Procter & Gamble had a tough fiscal 2012 (ending June) as it performed below its own expectations due to an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and rising input costs. The company implemented some meaningful changes to re-accelerate top and bottom-line growth to keep pace with its peers.
"
284,KMB,"These initiatives also improved its performance in the first two quarters of fiscal 2013. However, the effect was short lived as the company posted mixed third-quarter results in late April. Though earnings exceeded management’s expectations on strong cost savings, organic revenue growth was quite weak and below expectation.
"
285,KMB,"Its fourth-quarter outlook was also quite subdued with earnings expected to decline from the year-ago results. P&G is also facing rapid and significant increases in commodity costs, which are hurting margins despite revenue growth. P&G holds a Zacks Rank #3.
"
286,KMB,"Beverage company Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) has been suffering due to weak volume growth, higher cost pressure and macro-economic headwinds in the U.S. The company has had a dismal 2012 and also posted weak sales in the first quarter of 2013.
"
287,KMB,"The company has been facing persistent weakness in overall carbonated soft drinks (CSD) volumes in North America since the past few months, which also remains a significant overhang. Changing consumer preferences, increasing health consciousness and growing regulatory pressures are affecting beverage sales. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
"
288,KMB,"The companies under the Consumer Staples sector sell relatively low-priced products that consumers use frequently in their daily lives, including food, beverages and products for personal hygiene or household cleaning. The purchase of these necessities is generally stable over time, irrespective of the spending patterns or whether the economy is expanding or contracting.
"
289,KMB,"This is a defensive sector, as the outlook for its companies would not change much with the economic cycle. We have seen that lately, as these companies have been playing their role despite concerns about the prolonged weak U.S. economy, the debt crisis in Europe and the slowdown in China.
"
290,KMB,"Consumer staples stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 as a whole in the year-to-date and trailing 52-week periods, up +9% and +18.4% in the YTD and trailing 52-week periods, compared to gains of +6.4% and +10.8% for the S&P 500, respectively.
"
291,KMB,"Many consumer companies are expanding focus to emerging markets, while many are resorting to cost saving initiatives to survive input cost pressures. The companies are also expanding their portfolios through product innovations and acquisitions.Expansion in Emerging Markets
"
292,KMB,"With market saturation, low disposable income of consumers and increased competitive activity in developed markets, many companies are diverting their resources to explore emerging markets. Though companies like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) are witnessing improving volume trends in North America, driven by increased marketing and advertising spending, we believe that the markets of North America are relatively mature compared to their untapped developing counterparts such as Brazil, India, China, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia, which exhibit positive consumer spending growth.
"
293,KMB,"Moreover, we have seen that product demand has remained stable for companies that are more exposed to fast-growing emerging markets in comparison to the slow-growing and saturated developed markets. Demand for convenient and branded packaged food is growing in the developing countries, as middle-class consumers shift to urban living. Thus, the rising pool of middle class consumers in emerging markets represents a huge opportunity for branded consumer companies.
"
294,KMB,"However, growth in the emerging markets has been largely hurt by currency headwinds for many consumer staples companies due to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of outside-U.S. sales. But with improving standard of living in developing countries, the companies are now focusing on increasing pricing to derive profits, which was earlier difficult.
"
295,KMB,"Beverage companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have invested heavily in the emerging markets of India, Russia and China, encouraged by the high-growth nature of these countries. However, the slowdown in Chinese economy has hurt the return on investments for companies.
"
296,KMB,"Coca-Cola has already invested over $2 billion in India in the last 18 years and has been witnessing double-digit business growth in India aided by its top brands like Thumbs Up, Sprite and Maaza. Over the next eight years, Coca-Cola, along with its bottling partners, will make a further investment of $3 billion to build consumer marketing, infrastructure and brands in India.
"
297,KMB,"Coca-Cola also has plans to invest $4 billion in China over three years starting 2012, invest $3 billion in Russia between 2012 and 2016, $8 billion in Brazil through 2016 and $300 million in Vietnam between 2012 and 2015.

"

The company’s recent innovations at the premium end include Quaker Real Medleys hot cereals, Stacy's Gingerbread and Stacy's Cocoa and Lay's Stax potato chips. The new innovations are expected to boost revenue growth and also enable increased price realization in the long run.
"

With the launch of its premium single cup domestic coffee machine Verismo in Sept 2012, the company expects to significantly expand Starbucks’ presence in the fast growing premium single cup coffee segment.

"
315,KMB,"Despite macroeconomic headwinds, some of these companies have been able to deliver impressive results and have the potential to grow in the upcoming quarters. The improved business backdrop is showing up in positive earnings momentum for consumer staples stocks, resulting in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR), Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) and Smithfield Foods (SFD).
"
316,KMB,"Some attractive Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks worth considering are Smucker's (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg's (K), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Hershey's (HSY).
"
317,KMB,"Coffee maker Green Mountain’s performance turned around in the fourth quarter of 2012 (ending September) from past few weak quarterly results, driven by the success of Keurig Single Cup Brewers, single serve packs (K-cups), and Keurig-related products. The company’s margins are improving with favorable green coffee costs.
"
318,KMB,"The company is focusing on its products through innovations and upgrading its Keurig brewing system to attract more customers. Green Mountain has raised its earnings guidance twice for fiscal 2013 in the last two quarters. Green Mountain appears to be well positioned for growth in the future quarters.
"
319,KMB,"Stabilizing coffee costs also improved the margins at Smucker's. The company has witnessed year-over-year earnings growth in all the three quarters of fiscal 2013 (ending April), driven by company’s strong portfolio of brands, focus on innovations and promotional offerings. Moreover, strategic acquisitions have broadened Smucker’s presence across emerging markets and added popular brands to its portfolio. The company has increased its fiscal 2013 earnings guidance in the last two quarters, reflecting the company’s potential to drive profits in the coming quarters.
"
320,KMB,"Like Green Mountain, the consumer products giant P&G also had a tough fiscal 2012 (ending June). However, the company has implemented some meaningful changes to re-accelerate its top and bottom-line growth to keep pace with its peers, which is reflected in its two back-to-back solid quarterly results in fiscal 2013. In addition, the company’s cost savings and productivity improvement initiatives have improved margins.
"
321,KMB,"The world’s largest cereal maker, Kellogg, has delivered solid growth in earnings in all the four quarters of 2012, driven by robust organic sales growth performance. Despite its sluggish cereal business, challenges in Europe and rising input costs, we are optimistic about Kellogg’s solid brand positioning, its geographic diversity and cost-saving efforts, especially its supply-chain initiatives. Moreover, we are encouraged by the growth potential of the Pringles snack business, which was acquired in June last year from P&G.
"
322,KMB,"Meat products processor Tyson has been witnessing strong momentum in the last several quarters backed by its bright prospect in beef and chicken business and consistent innovation towards low fat meat production. Rising demand for chicken coupled with positive pricing is helping the company reap wider margins. In addition, Tyson is working on growing its prepared foods, international poultry and value-added poultry businesses by producing high quality foods by using innovative and cost-effective processes.
"
323,KMB,"Tyson’s close peer Smithfield also has bright prospects ahead as the company expects hog prices and the impact of grain costs to ease in the upcoming quarters. Smithfield’s results have been suffering since last two or three years as a result of higher grain costs and oversupply of hogs. However the company recovered nicely in fiscal 2011 (ending April) and posted record revenues in fiscal 2012, backed by the company’s brand building investments and innovation, restructuring initiatives, improved packaging and production of healthier choices for consumers using lean protein and natural ingredients.
"
324,KMB,"Smithfield is also increasing its focus on consumer convenience by introducing more ready-to-eat foods. Increased export volume of fresh pork is also encouraging and we expect strong demand of fresh pork in the upcoming quarters.
"
325,KMB,"Hershey has solid growth potential driven by strong brand positioning, strategic marketing investments in core brands, disciplined innovation, lower cost inflation, improved pricing and volumes and strong productivity. In fact, Hershey has outperformed and delivered positive surprises in three out of the four quarters of 2012 and has raised its guidance thrice in 2012, highlighting its attractive earnings potential. The outlook for 2013 is also encouraging, especially the expectation of no cost inflation this year.WEAKNESSES
"
326,KMB,"The macro-economic environment in the U.S. has remained challenging and uncertain for quite some time now. The European economy has also remained unfavorable. The pace of economic recovery is relatively slow in U.S., whereas the consumer environment in U.S. is recovering at a mild pace. In Europe, the economic conditions are uncertain and China is also seeing some slowdown. These global economic pressures are expected to continue in 2013 and severely impact the companies in the coming quarters.
"
327,KMB,"For the global brewer Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), the acquisition of StarBev in Jun 2012 opened opportunities in the attractive beer market in Central Europe. However, unfavorable economic conditions in Europe will offset the gains from the acquisition. Moreover, the company has been facing continued decline in volumes in three major markets of U.S., U.K. and Canada in the last three years.
"
328,KMB,"Molson Coors has also spent on marketing and advertising for its Miller Lite and the Molson Brands but this has not led to consistent growth in volumes. The increasing raw material costs of the company and the currency headwinds hurting the top line also remains a concern.
"
329,KMB,"We believe that tough global macroeconomic conditions and declining volume trends will continue to drag the company’s performance in the upcoming quarters. Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report), which focuses on the global food and snacks business of the old Kraft Foods, missed on both the top and bottom lines in fourth quarter 2012 mainly due to currency headwinds. In addition, the gum and candy business has been suffering for the last few quarters. Management does not expect the gum business to stabilize in the coming quarters. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
"
330,KMB,"Beverage company Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) has had a dismal 2012, posting a negative surprise in two of the four quarters of 2012. The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both revenue and earnings while just managing to meet company expectations for the year.
"
331,KMB,"Moreover, the company’s weak volume growth, higher cost pressure and lack of exposure outside the U.S. is concerning. The company has been facing persistent weakness in the overall carbonated soft drinks’ (CSD) volumes in North America since the past few months, which also remains a significant overhang.
"
332,KMB,"Changing consumer preferences, increasing health consciousness and growing regulatory pressures are affecting beverage sales. We therefore prefer to avoid the stock for the next few quarters. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
"
333,KMB,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) closed its operations in Venezuela, thanks to tumultuous economic condition. Poor access to raw materials due to economic barriers, supply chain disruptions and the limited access to dollars to import goods due to currency controls have disrupted operations of the company’s Venezuelan subsidiary.The Venezuelan division produced 75% of the breakfast cereals for the country, per the company's website and employed around 400 workers. Post the news of discontinuation of operations in Venezuela, Kellogg’s manufacturing plant has been captured by the leftist government, under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro. Importantly, Kellogg deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for the Venezuelan subsidiary in December 2016.What’s Exactly Happening in Venezuela?The oil-rich country of Venezuela is now reeling under hyperinflation and strict price controls. The country is divided between the followers of the United Socialist Party (PSUV), earlier led by Hugo Chávez and currently fronted by Nicolas Maduro, and those who want an end to the more than 15-years of rule of the party.Venezuela, having one of the largest oil reserves in the world, heavily depended on revenues from oil imports for sustenance. During the presidency of Hugo Chavez in early 2000s, oil prices were booming. The leader used this money to fund various social programs and was successful in addressing illiteracy, healthcare and poverty issues. Also, the price of key items, food and medicines were fixed at a rate below the cost of production to make it affordable. Chavez also restricted the conversion of national currency into dollars and fixed the rate.When oil prices began to fall the economy went haywire. The government failed to support the projects, paralyzing the country with poverty and inflation. Moreover, the government also stopped companies from raising prices to keep up with hyperinflation.Venezuelan President ReactsThe enraged president Maduro decided to hand the company over to the workers so that they can continue production. He believes that Kellogg’s exit is unconstitutional and has begun judicial proceedings against management.In retaliation, Kellogg said that the company is not responsible for the unauthorized use of the commercial names as well as brands and will exercise legal actions if needed.Importantly, Kellogg is not the first company to exit the country. Other companies include Clorox (CLX  -  Free Report), Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and General Motors (GM  -  Free Report). Though Kellogg stated that it looks forward to resume operations once conditions improve, we believe that chances are dim considering the dismal economic situation.Zacks RankKellogg currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, decline in both top and bottom line did raise some concerns. Nevertheless, management retained its 2018 view.This Hoboken, NJ-based company posted normalized earnings of 68 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but declined 15% year over year from 80 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Management highlighted that lost contributions from divested operations, fall in core sales volume, adverse pricing, and commodity cost inflation coupled with increased share count hurt the bottom line. These were partly mitigated by ongoing cost savings and related synergies, contributions from acquisitions and lower tax rate.Net sales of $3,743.1 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,716 million but declined 9.5% year over year on account of the adverse impact from divestitures, net of buyouts.

335,KMB,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) being a beneficiary of the recent tax reform, is looking forward to share the benefits with its shareholders. As a result, it accelerated the declaration of dividend increase, which usually occurs in May. The company also remains keen on using the benefits from the tax reform to support long-term business growth as well as enhance shareholder returns.Notably, Clorox raised its quarterly dividend by nearly 14% to 96 cents per share from 84 cents. On May 8, 2017, the company had raised its dividend by 5% to 84 cents per share from 80 cents.The new dividend is payable on May 11, 2018, to shareholders on record as of April 25. Thereby, bringing the company’s annualized dividend rate to $3.84 per share, yielding 2.98% based on the current stock price.In fact, Clorox has been enhancing shareholder return from time to time. This is evident from its track record of consistently raising dividends since 1977. Notably, the company’s total shareholder returns for the last three fiscal years sums to 58% compared with 37% for its peer group and 31% for the S&P 500.We believe that Clorox’s consistent dividend payments and increments reflect growth potential of the company’s earnings as well as its cash flow generation capabilities.Per second-quarter fiscal 2018 release, the company anticipates the new tax reform to boost its earnings and cash flows. This was well reflected in the previous guidance raise for fiscal 2018 earnings. Clorox also raised its long-term free cash flow target, under the 2020 Strategy.  It now expects to generate free cash flow, as a percentage of sales, in the range of 11-13% (on a yearly basis) compared with 10-12% projected earlier.Clearly, the company’s disciplined approach to cash allocation facilitates returning excess cash to shareholders. Clorox currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The news did not have a major impact on the company’s share price movement. However, the stock has lost 5.7% in the last six months, outperforming industry’s decline of 8.7%.We believe that dividend hikes not only enhance shareholder return but raise the market value of the stock as well. Through dividend increases, companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling them. Looking ahead, Clorox remains confident of its long-term growth potential, suggesting enhanced value for shareholders via dividend payout.Looking for More Promising Bets?

336,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) has been sailing in troubled waters, thanks to the prolonged struggle with rising commodity costs, lower selling prices and increased competition in the diaper segment. These factors have weighed on the company’s shares that have declined 9.4% in the past three months against the industry’s fall of 8.8%.Rising Commodity Costs Higher input costs have been troubling Kimberly-Clark’s performance for a while. Evidently, commodity cost inflation of $175 million, stemming from greater costs of pulp and other raw materials, caused the company’s adjusted operating profit to fall 3% in the first quarter of 2018. Such factors have also been a drag on the gross margin, which contracted roughly 890 basis points (bps) to 28% in first-quarter 2018.Prior to this, gross margin witnessed year-over-year declines of 200 bps, 60 bps and 10 bps in the preceding three quarters, respectively. To make matters worse, management anticipates input cost inflation of about $400-$550 million for 2018. We expect that such aspects will persistently dampen profits.Apart from Kimberly-Clark, other consumer staples companies such as McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report), Church & Dwight Co. (CHD  -  Free Report) and TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report) have also been struggling with higher commodity costs, which has been marring their profitability.Lower Net PricesLower selling prices are another hurdle faced by this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. In fact, during first-quarter 2018, this trend lingered and affected results in most segments. Evidently, lower net selling prices dragged sales and operating profits of Kimberly-Clark’s Personal Care as well as K-C Professional (KCP) divisions. Moreover, such deterrents limit the company’s ability to fend-off negative impacts stemming from rising commodity costs. Prolonged Weakness in the Diaper SegmentKimberly-Clark’s diaper segment, that holds a vital place in the Personal Care category, has been bearing the brunt of increased competition across several markets. The segment remains particularly challenged in South Korea, due to lower birth rates. The bleak performance of the diaper unit also puts the company’s market share at risk.Any Rays of Hope Ahead?Considering the constant struggle with rising commodity costs, it only seems natural for Kimberly-Clark to undertake aggressive measures to cut costs. The company’s Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE Program has generated higher cost savings each year with record amount of $450 million in 2017. In the first quarter, Kimberly-Clark generated savings of $90 million from this program and projects cost savings of $400 million in 2018.The company estimates more than $1.5 billion to be generated over the four-year period from 2018 to 2021. These savings are expected to be achieved through management’s focus on enhancing productivity at manufacturing facilities, optimizing design and raw material expenses and attaining distribution efficiencies.Speaking of building efficiencies, Kimberly-Clark’s recently embarked 2018 Global Restructuring Program deserves special mention. This plan is likely to enhance the company’s underlying profitability, enable it to compete better and provide greater flexibility to undertake growth-oriented investments. On a combined basis, the company expects cost savings of more than $2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program, over the next four years.While Kimberly-Clark’s savings efforts seem quite robust, they are yet to fully offset the negative impacts from the aforementioned hurdles. That said, let’s wait and see if such initiatives yield favorable impacts in the forthcoming periods and lift investors’ optimism.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

365,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) recently launched Kleenex Reveal Countertop System under the Kimberly-Clark Professional (KCP) segment that partners with businesses to offer improved and exceptional hygiene products. The new countertop system provides superior quality hand towels and requires fewer refills owing to its greater inbuilt capacity. The system aids maintaining a clean restroom area by providing hand towels at the sink itself, thereby reducing water spillage on the countertop and the floor.In addition to Kleenex, other brands in this category include Scott, Kimtech, WypAll and Jackson Safety. The company’s products are one of the most preferred amongst its peers in the United States, when it comes to restroom cleanliness and consumer health.Product Innovation to Boost SalesThe company has been involved in regular innovations and product launches to improve its market share. Of late, the company has been focusing on upgrading personal care portfolio, especially feminine hygiene and diaper products. Innovations related to the Huggies brand has been initiated in several regions such as in Russia and China.Unfavorable Industry Conditions Weigh on Performance  Despite efforts to improve market share, Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing decelerated organic sales growth from the developing markets for a while now. The sluggish growth can be attributed to unfavorable economic environment laden with increased competition and promotional activities. Sales in Latin America, especially in Brazil and Argentina have been displaying such a trend. Though the company has strong long-term growth prospects in these markets, it expects only modest improvement in the second half of 2017. Further, the company’s organic sales in the North American region have been soft due to the effects of competition and less promotional shipments.Competition has particularly hurt the company’s diaper segment volumes. It is observed that more parent shoppers are shifting away from Huggies and buying either less expensive or premium diaper offerings. Additionally, Kimberly-Clark’s performance is also plagued with higher input cost owing to the ongoing inflationary trend.Amid such headwinds lurking in the industry, it would be quite a challenging task for Kimberly-Clark to pull off positive yields from its ongoing innovation and product launch efforts. Moreover, shares of the company have also been losing investor confidence and have decreased 9.7% over the past six months, almost in line with the industry’s decline of 9.3%. The Consumer Staples sector, to which it belongs, increased 5% in the same time frame. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Done With Kimberly-Clark?

"
407,KMB,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

408,KMB,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps.

While earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales exceeded the same for the third consecutive period. In fact, strong performance across key market locations prompted management to raise sales view for 2018. Further, the company’s cost-saving efforts are also praiseworthy and significantly aided the company’s performance in the reported quarter.On the flip side, the company’s performance continues to face challenges from rising input costs. This has been marring investors’ optimism in the stock, which has declined 16.4% in the past six months compared with the industry’s fall of 12.8%Quarter in DetailThe quarterly earnings of $1.71 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased almost 9% year over year.Notably, adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 22% compared with 27.5% in the year-ago quarter.Kimberly-Clark’s sales advanced 5% to $4,731 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,599 million.

Internationally, organic sales advanced 2% across the developed market locations, while it rose 1% in developing and emerging markets.Adjusted operating profit inched-up 0.7% to $824 million. Results were aided by higher volumes, favorable currency translations worth close to $20 million as well as reduced spending on marketing, research and general spending.  Further, operating results also gained from cost savings of $90 million from the Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) program. These upsides were partially offset by lower net selling prices as well as increased input costs on account of greater costs of pulp and other raw materials.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteSegment DetailsPersonal Care Products: The segment includes products like disposable diapers, training/ youth/swim pants, baby wipes, feminine and incontinence care products.Segment sales of $2,307 million went up 3% during the quarter, courtesy of improved product mix and volumes, benefits from currency and buyout of the company’s joint venture in India, somewhat countered by lower net selling prices.

Segment sales gained year over year across all market regions, which include North America, developed regions outside North America as well as the developing and emerging markets.Segment operating profit plunged 11% to $249 million in the quarter on account of unfavorable product mix and input cost inflation, somewhat cushioned by cost savings, increased volumes, favorable currency rates as well as lower marketing, research and general costs.K-C Professional (KCP) & Other: The segment consists of facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers and a range of safety products.Segment sales grew 5% from the prior-year to $832 million in the quarter, backed by growth in volumes, improved net selling prices and product mix as well as positive impacts from currency rates.

Further, the company is on track with its $50-70 million savings targets from this initiative for 2018.Ups Sales Guidance for 2018The upbeat performance of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in all key market regions led management to raise sales view for 2018. Net sales are now expected to rise in a range of 2-3% compared with the previous band of 1-2%.On the flip side, the company expects input costs to rise even further, owing to a hike in the cost of pulp and other raw materials.

411,KMB,"Stocks highlighted include Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report), Kimberly Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) and Healthspring (HS). Also highlighted is the S&P 500 (SPX).What The VIX Is Telling Us
"
412,KMB,"The markets continue to experience unusual volatility. This can be seen in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which set record highs yesterday.
"
413,KMB,"The VIX calculates the expected stock market volatility for the next 30 days. The indicator accomplishes this by using a weighted average of implied volatility from S&P 500 index options contracts. Specifically, the VIX looks at options for the 2 months closest to expiration, which is currently November and December. (October contracts expire today and are no longer factored into the indicator.)
"
414,KMB,"Options prices are based on a combination of risk-free interest rates, expected changes in the price of the underlying asset and time to expiration. The more the price of a stock (or index) is expected to change in the near-term, the higher the amount of volatility an option contract is going to price in. In other words, the more volatile a stock price is, the more its options contracts are going to cost.
"
415,KMB,"Volatility increases the cost of an option contract, because there is a greater likelihood that the contract will expire ""in the money"". At expiration, a trader can exercise his right to buy, or in the case of a put - sell, the underlying asset at a fixed price. Alternatively, he can let the option contract expire worthless. Obviously, if a trader can buy a stock for less than its current price or sell it for more than its current price, he will do so.
"
416,KMB,"The more one thinks an option is going to be valuable at expiration, the more he is going to pay for the contract.
"
417,KMB,"In the case of the VIX, traders are fearful that the S&P 500 is going to have more large swings over the next two months. Therefore, they are paying more for options contracts. Simply put, they expect to exercise their options contracts at expiration. In a falling market, this is bearish, because traders are essentially betting on a further decline.
"
418,KMB,"Is The VIX Calling For A Rally?
"
419,KMB,"The VIX is a contrarian indicator, however. A study by Credit Suisse found that, after adjusting for market drift, high VIX levels correctly predicted a 5-month rally 63% of the time. Given that the indicator is at record levels, it is essentially calling for one heck of a forthcoming rally.
"
420,KMB,"This is partially why some market observers believe that now is a buying opportunity for investors.
"
421,KMB,"Before anyone goes out and bets the farm, however, I should state that there continues to be real economic problems. Though the freeze on credit is starting to thaw, short-term credit remains very difficult to secure. More jobs will be shed and an unemployment rate in the high single digits is within the realm of possibilities. Consumers are tightening their budgets. A higher number of home foreclosures  and credit defaults will occur. Demand for exports will be weaker in the months ahead.
"
422,KMB,"Not to mention, the trend in earnings estimates for 2009 is negative.
"
423,KMB,"Implications for Our Portfolios
"
424,KMB,"We had refrained from adding new stocks to the Focus List and the Growth & Income portfolio because of the prevailing market conditions. While I cannot say with certainty that a short-term bottom has been established, I do believe the short-term risk of buying stocks has diminished. Therefore, we have started the process of rebuilding our portfolios.
"
425,KMB,"Our strategy is to start with less economically sensitive sectors, with a preference towards large-cap companies. (Though, in general, we are market-cap neutral.) As the portfolios increase in size and the market stabilizes, we will look at companies with a higher risk profile.
"
426,KMB,"This strategy was evident in the most recent additions to the Focus List: Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report), Kimberly Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) and Healthspring (HS). BMY and KMB were selected both for their size and their respective industries, pharmaceutical and consumer staples. HS was chosen because it receives its revenues from Medicare.
"
427,KMB,"Ideally, I would like to add a 2-3 stocks each week going forward to the portfolios. Spreading out the additions helps to reduce the risk that our timing is wrong. The actual number of additions per week will vary.
"
428,KMB,"The Markets
"
429,KMB,"My gut says a market bottom was set last Friday. Prevailing trends, however, paint an uncertain outlook, however. Nonetheless, we did see some gains this week, which is a big positive. The gains, however, came with a very large amount of volatility.
"
430,KMB,"When a market rebound does occur, my best guess is that we will then settle into a new trading range.
"
431,KMB,"Going back to the volatility, I want to show you a 10-year chart of the VIX. We have never seen the index at this high a level and, after things calm down, it will be a long time before we see it again.
"
432,KMB,"Keep Looking At Stocks
"
433,KMB,"I will reiterate what I've been saying for the past several weeks - the economy will recover and stocks will find new highs. The economy goes through cycles, with recessions typically being considerably shorter than periods of expansion.
"
434,KMB,"The best thing you can do is keep researching stocks. This is what successful investors do. We'll help get you through it by finding fundamentally sound stocks while giving you the tools necessary to do your own research.

437,KMB,"Consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) posted weaker-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate, probably due to softness in North America. Concurrent to the weak second-quarter results, the company anticipates soft earnings guidance for full year.Adjusted earnings of $1.49 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 by 0.7% and year-ago adjusted results of $1.53 by 2.6%. Despite higher cost savings, earnings suffered due to lower sales and higher cost inflation.Quarter in DetailThe company reported sales of $4.55 billion in the second quarter. Sales marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.56 billion by 0.2% and declined 1% from the prior-year quarter. Notably, currency did not impact second-quarter sales results.Organic sales declined 1% from the prior-year quarter due to lower net selling prices. Softness in North American consumer products, higher competitive activity and less promotion shipments led to an organic sales decline of 2% in North America. Organic sales also declined 3% in developed markets outside North America. However, it increased 2% in developing and emerging markets in the quarter.We note that apart from sluggishness in North America, Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing slower organic sales growth in developing and emerging markets over the last few quarters. We note that the company posted organic sales growth of 5% in each of the first and second quarters of 2016, which decelerated to 3% in the third quarter. Though it showed some improvement in fourth-quarter 2016 with organic sales growth of 4%, it remained flat in first-quarter 2017 and improved just 2% in second-quarter 2017.Though the company has strong long-term growth prospects in these markets, the company expects only modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in 2017, particularly in the second half of 2017.Operating profit in second-quarter 2017 declined 4.7% to $799 million. It was mainly impacted by lower sales and higher input costs of $75 million in the quarter due to increases in raw materials (mainly pulp). Nevertheless, the company generated $120 million of cost savings from the FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere) program during the quarter.Share Price MovementKimberly-Clark’s shares have been underperforming the industry for the last one year. The stock has declined 6.4% in comparison to the industry’s decline of just 0.9%.

Sales improved in developing and emerging markets, but declined in two other regions of North America and developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit improved 3% to $467 million in the quarter driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and input cost inflation.Consumer Tissue:The segment includes bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products for household use.Segment sales dropped 2% to $1.5 billion in second-quarter 2017 owing to lower volumes and average selling prices. Sales improved in developing and emerging markets but declined in two other regions of North America and developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit declined 12% to $241 million in the quarter, as lower sales, higher cost inflation and other manufacturing costs more than offset the benefits from cost savings and lower marketing spending.K-C Professional (KCP) & Other:The segment consists of facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers and a range of safety products.Segment sales grew marginally to $0.8 billion in the second quarter. Growth in volumes and improved product mix was offset by lower selling prices. Sales improved in North America and developing and emerging markets but it declined in developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit surged 9% to $163 million, gaining from cost savings, lower manufacturing costs and reduced marketing, research and general spending, partially offset by input cost inflation.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteOther Financial UpdateCash and cash equivalents were $1.05 billion as of Jun 30, 2017.

441,KMB,"The market sent another clear signal that we are far from being out of the woods. Continued economic woes sent the Dow on its second largest slide ever. Contributing to Wednesday's pessimism were declining retail sales data and a Fed report that signaled more financial and credit problems.    The Dow tumbled 733.08 points, or 7.87%, to close at 8,577.91 on Wednesday. In addition to this being the Dow's second largest point drop, it was the blue chip index's biggest percentage loss since Oct 26, 1987, which followed Black Monday on Oct 19, 1987.Broader averages fell as well. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 90.17 points, or 9.03%, ending at 907.84. The Nasdaq slipped by 150.68 points, or 8.47%, to 1,628.33. The Commerce Department released abysmal retail sales figures, showing a decrease of 1.2% last month, the widest decline since a fall of 1.4% in August 2005. Analysts were expecting a drop of only 0.7% for September.       With consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of total economic activity, the new retail figures are a strong indication that we are, for all intents and purposes, in a recession though technically it has not arrived. The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP). More bad news came from the Fed with the release of the Beige Book report, which stated that the economy continued to worsen in early fall as financial and credit problems spiraled out of control.The report hit Wall Street on the heels of Ben Bernanke's comments, indicating that the credit market rescue will not instantaneously shock the economy back into good health.Oil prices sunk to a level that is below $75 for the first time in about 14 months on a lower demand forecast from OPEC. Light, sweet crude declined $4.09 to settle at $74.54 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold was virtually unchanged today, dipping 50 cents to $839 an ounce. Zacks Elite PortfoliosFocus List stocks found no refuge from Wednesday's market massacre, declining 8.78% for the day. No major news was released on any of the stocks as the portfolio fell on overall market bearishness. Amid the doom and gloom, there were a couple upbeat forecast revisions issued recently. Newly added Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY  -  Free Report) saw analysts increase full-year 2008 earnings estimates by a penny to $1.67 per share in just the past week. Analysts also upped projections on Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report), also a Focus List newcomer. Full-year 2009 earnings expectations were boosted by a penny to $4.63 per share over the past week. The Growth and Income portfolio turned in a loss of 6.12% for the day. There were no new developments to report on the holdings in this portfolio. We are currently evaluating a list of Growth and Income candidates and will soon add more stocks to the portfolio.
"
442,KMB,"Shares of Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) are down roughly 13% over the last year as the consumer packaged goods giant faces tougher competition from rivals and upstarts. With that said, earnings season could give Procter & Gamble a much needed shot in the arm, if it impresses investors.One proven way for investors to benefit during earnings season is to find companies that are set to outperform earnings expectations. This tactic becomes even more important amid volatile market conditions.In the case of Procter & Gamble, the company saw its organic sales lose steam earlier this fiscal year. However, Procter & Gamble raised its fiscal 2018 earnings outlook last quarter.Now, as investors look to use quarterly earnings season to recoup from a rough couple of months, they need to understand how Procter & Gamble is actually expected to perform this quarter in order to see if a turnaround might be in store.OutlookProcter & Gamble’s quarterly revenues are projected to climb 3.5% to reach $16.16 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the CPG power is projected to see its earnings reach $0.98 per share, which would mark 2.1% growth from the year-ago period.  Cleary, Procter & Gamble is projected to report some growth this quarter, but on their own, these top and bottom line estimates don’t give investors nearly enough information.Investors need to know if Procter & Gamble is expected to top our earnings estimate. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Procter & Gamble is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and sports an Earnings ESP of -0.58%. The company has also experienced three downward earnings estimate revisions within the last seven days. Therefore, investors should consider Procter & Gamble a stock that could very well fall short of earnings estimates, and in turn, see its stock price continue to sink.Procter & Gamble is expected to report its upcoming quarterly financial results before the market opens on Friday, April 20, just a few days before fellow CPG giant Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report).Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

443,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23. This consumer goods company has reported an average earnings surprise of nearly 2% over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are placed ahead of the upcoming results. Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation Quote FORCE & Global Restructuring Plans to Drive Bottom LineKimberly-Clark is likely to continue gaining from its ongoing Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) program, while it should also receive some benefits from its recently unveiled 2018 Global Restructuring plan. Notably, the latter marks the company’s biggest restructuring in a long time now. This plan is likely to enhance the company’s underlying profitability, help it compete better and provide greater flexibility to undertake growth-oriented investments. Delving deeper, we note that the program is expected to simplify Kimberly-Clark’s overhead organization and manufacturing supply chain structures. Well, the program will benefit all segments of the company as well as all the major geographical region.Markedly, management expects cost savings of $50-$70 million from this program in 2018, which also bodes well for the quarter under review. Moving to the FORCE Program, Kimberly-Clark has long been gaining from this cost-cutting plan. In fact, the FORCE program has generated higher cost savings each year with record savings of $450 million in 2017, following $435 million in 2016 and lesser each year prior to that. The company anticipates cost savings of $400 million in 2018. On a combined basis, Kimberly-Clark expects cost savings of more than $2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program (discussed below), over the next four years.These dedicated efforts are likely to help Kimberly-Clark offset hurdles related to input cost inflation. Incidentally, Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing rising input costs of late. Increased input costs on account of greater costs of pulp and other raw materials caused adjusted operating profit to fall 2.7% to $836 million in the fourth quarter.  Further, in 2018, management expects input cost inflation of about $300-$400 million, primarily in international markets. However, the robust aforementioned strategies should help the company combat these hurdles and fuel bottom-line growth.Earnings Expectations in NumbersIn fact, FORCE program was a driver for the company in the fourth quarter as well, wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year and the latter also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second consecutive quarter. The year-over-year growth in earnings was driven by cost savings from FORCE program as well as reduced effective tax rate stemming from the latest tax reforms and associated activities. Also, management expects the tax reforms to favorably impact its bottom line and cash flows, which again remains a driver for Kimberly Clark in the quarter to be reported. Well, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.70, which shows an increase of nearly 9% from $1.57 recorded in the year-ago period. The estimate has remained unchanged in the past 30 days.Will Sales Grow Amid North American Challenges?Moving to top line, the year-over-year growth in the last reported quarter was aided by greater Personal Product and K-C Professional (KCP) sales. However, on a region-wise basis, softness in North American consumer products and higher competitive activity have been major concerns for quite some time. Evidently, net sales in North America declined year over year across most segments, owing to lower selling prices. This in turn stemmed from intense promotional activities undertaken amid the mounting competition. Also, organic sales at consumer products decreased 3% in North America. In fact, the company’s overall organic sales also dipped 1%, due to lower net selling prices across most categories.Nonetheless, management stated that it remains committed toward making further brand investments and implementing strategic growth initiatives. For the quarter under review, the consensus marks for Personal Product and KCP sales are pegged at $2,304 million and $795 million, in comparison with $2,250 million and $768 million, respectively. Also, analysts polled by Zacks expects Consumer Tissue sales to grow 2.35 to $1,488 million. Finally, the consensus estimate for Kimberly-Clark’s total revenues stands at $4,595 million, marking a 2.5% rise from the year-ago reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever, our proven model doesn’t show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.While Kimberly-Clark carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of -2.35% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

444,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) has been gaining from improved volumes in emerging markets and its dedicated focus on cost saving, innovation and restructuring. Such strategic plans are expected to drive this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s performance in 2018 and augment its portfolio and market share.Cost Savings Aid Profitability       Kimberly-Clark is aggressively cutting costs through the program — Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE. The program has been positively impacting the company’s profits. During the third quarter, the company managed to deliver cost savings of $125 million which drove bottom-line performance. For 2017, the company previously stated that it expects to generate cost savings in the range of $425-$450 million.Focus on InnovationsBeing a vital player in consumer essentials category, Kimberly-Clark regularly undertakes innovation and launches products to adapt with changing consumer needs and demands. In fact, the company has a number of innovations lined up for launch in the near term, particularly in North America, including upgrades on Huggies Snug and Dry diapers, Good Nights youth pants and Depend underwear.  Restructuring Efforts Bode WellAdditionally, the company has been able to attain greater operating efficiencies and profitability on the back of restructuring efforts. Such initiatives mainly include exiting lower-margin businesses, streamlining manufacturing activities and enhancing focus on growth-oriented arenas. Further, Kimberly-Clark is well positioned overseas and has been expanding in developing and emerging markets.Such factors have aided Kimberly-Clark to outperform the industry over a year. While the company gained just 2.1% in the said time frame, it fared much better than the industry’s decline of about 3.7%.Wrapping UpKimberly-Clark’s dedicated efforts to continue expanding market share and profitability are quite noteworthy. Moreover, we expect favorable economic conditions to drive spending on consumer essentials and personal care items, further boosting Kimberly-Clark’s performance in the forthcoming periods.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?

445,KMB,"Weve mentioned it here before, but its worth saying again; nearly half of a stocks price movement is tied to the performance of its respective group (Sector and Industry).

456,KMB,"The top three Sectors based on the percentage of stocks at (or within 10% of) their 52-week highs are listed below. (Id also like to note that when analyzing a group, I think looking at the number of stocks trading near their 52-week high is better than simply looking at the percentage price change. I say that because if you have a group such as the Oils and Energy sector for instance that has had a huge run up over time, but then pulls back sharply in a wholesale manner (often times signaling a sector rotation), that group can still conceivably have a better average price change than other groups because the recent drop is lost within the preceding price run-up. But monitoring their percentages from their 52-week high can always be detected, regardless of how great their previous run-up was, which in turn lets you cleanly analyze how good the group is really doing.)

469,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s (KMB  -  Free Report) performance has been impressive of late, owing to stringent cost-saving and restructuring initiatives. Additionally, this professional and personal care products company has been steadily expanding its portfolio through innovations. However, adverse North American market conditions and stiff competition in the diaper segment are headwinds.Nevertheless, Kimberly-Clark’s growth efforts have helped shares gain 2.3% in the past three months against the industry’’s decline of 6.6%.Let’s delve into the factors that have been impacting this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s performance.Cost-Savings & Restructuring Initiatives Bode WellKimberly-Clark has been cutting costs through Focus on Reducing Costs (FORCE) program. During third-quarter 2017, the company managed to deliver cost savings of $125 million that favorably impacted the bottom-line performance. Further, it expects to generate cost savings in the range of $425-$450 million during 2017.Additionally, the company has been able to attain greater operating efficiencies and profitability on the back of restructuring efforts.

Also, volume increased 4% in the developing and emerging markets in the last quarter.Headwinds Impacting PerformanceKimberly-Clark’s business in the North American consumer products category has been dismal, thanks to tough industry conditions. Also, the company has been struggling with increased competitive activity in diaper segment. The diaper category faces challenges due to lower birth rates in South Korea and in the United States. These factors have dented the company’s top-line growth for a while.Final ThoughtsWe expect Kimberly-Clark’s innovation and restructuring efforts to revive performance in the diaper segment and in North America.

470,KMB,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.1% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Kimberly-Clark Beats on Q3 Earnings, Reiterates ViewKimberly-Clark made a comeback in third-quarter 2017, outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.6%. On the contrary, net sales marginally fell short of the consensus mark but grew year over year in the quarter under review.The quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 and increased 5% year over year. The quarterly results benefited from improved volumes, cost savings and reduced marketing, research and general spending. However, lower net selling prices and input cost inflation had negatively impacted earnings during the quarter.Quarter in DetailKimberly-Clark reported sales of $4.64 billion in the third quarter. Sales marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.67 billion but depicted growth of 1% from the prior-year quarter. Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by currency rates changes of 1% and marginal growth in organic sales.Organic sales grew marginally, as volumes inched up more than 1%, while net selling prices declined 1%. While organic sales remained even in North American consumer products, the same increased 3% in the emerging market regions. Organic sales declined 3% in the developed markets.Operating profit in the quarter increased 2.2% to $854 million. It was favorably impacted by volume growth, reduced marketing, research and general spending and cost savings of $125 million from the FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere) program. These were partially offset by higher input costs of approximately $115 million, arising out of higher costs of pulp and other raw materials as well as lower net selling prices.Segment DetailsPersonal Care Products: The segment includes products like disposable diapers, training/ youth/swim pants, baby wipes, feminine and incontinence care products.Segment sales of $2.3 billion went down 1% during the quarter, owing to a 1% decline in both net selling prices and volumes. These were slightly offset by an improved product mix. Sales improved in the developing and emerging markets, while the same had declined in the regions of North America and developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit improved 4% to $476 million in the quarter driven by cost savings and reduced expenditure on market research and general spending. These were partially offset by input cost inflation and lower selling prices.Consumer Tissue: The segment includes bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products for household use.Segment sales improved 3% to $1.5 billion in the quarter owing to 4% jump in volume and positive impacts from currency rates of approximately 1%. These were marginally offset by decline in net selling prices of 1% as well as unfavorable product mix. Segment sales improved in both North America and developed regions outside North America. Sales in the segment also depicted growth in the developing and emerging regions.Segment operating profit declined 3% to $260 million in the quarter, as lower selling price and product mix, higher cost inflation more than offset the benefits from growth in volumes, cost savings and reduced spending over marketing, research and other general categories.K-C Professional (KCP) & Other: The segment consists of facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers and a range of safety products.Segment sales grew 3% from the prior-year to $0.8 billion in the third quarter. Growth in volumes (up 2%), positive impacts from currency rates and improved product mix was offset by lower selling prices (down 1%). Sales improved in North America and developing and emerging markets. Sales also improved in the developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit surged 10% to $173 million, gaining from cost savings and higher sales. These were partially offset by input cost inflation.Other Financial UpdateThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $655 million, long-term debt of $7.1 billion and stockholders' equity of $498 million. Management incurred capital expenditures of $209 million during the quarter and expects the same to be marginally below the company's projected range of $850-$950 million for 2017. During the quarter, the company bought back 1.6 million shares at a total cost of $200 million.Guidance for 2017Kimberly-Clark maintained earnings and sales view for 2017. It continues to envision earnings per share at the lower end of the targeted range of $6.20-$6.35. Also, net sales alongside of organic sales are anticipated to remain flat or slightly up from the prior-year figure.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter.VGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

472,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 25. Investors want to know whether the company will deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.5%.A look into Kimberly-Clark’s stock performance, reveals that its shares have been underperforming the Zacks categorized Consumer Products–Staples industry in the past three months. In the said time frame, stocks of the company went down 4.6%, compared with the industry’s decline of 0.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Trending A look at the estimate revision would give us an idea regarding analyst’s expectations right before the company releases its earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter decreased by a penny in the past 30 days while the same has remained stable for fiscal 2017 at $6.29. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 per share for the second quarter reflects a year-over-year decrease of 2%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4.58 billion for the said quarter, a 0.2% decline from the year-ago period, while the same for fiscal 2017 is pegged at $18.5 billion.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kimberly-Clark has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.50. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteFactors Influencing the QuarterKimberly-Clark has been dealing with decelerated organic sales growth, especially in developing and emerging markets over the past few quarters. The decline in sales growth is primarily due to lower volumes and a difficult economic scenario. Moreover, the company’s diaper segment is witnessing lower market share and higher competitive promotional activity as consumers are seen to shift to either premium or less expensive diaper offerings.Nonetheless, the company is focused on improving its performance through regular innovation. In the near term, it has a number of innovations lined up for launch in North America. The company has been aggressively cutting costs through its FORCE program that has been generating higher cost savings each year. The program generated costs savings of $435 million in 2016 and expects savings of at least $400 million in 2017. Evidently, it already achieved $110 million of cost savings in the first quarter.Kimberly-Clark is well positioned in the overseas and has been regularly expanding in diverse regions. Though the company has strong long-term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets, it expects only modest improvement in the overall environment in 2017, particularly in the second half.Still Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks?

474,KMB,"The Zacks Cosmetics industry has been glowing on consumer’ increased spending on beauty products, which has helped it rally 49% in a year, comfortably beating the S&P 500’s gain of 15.5%. Well, the industry (ranked among the top 48% out of more than 250 Zacks industries) has been riding on solid performances by renowned players like The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) and Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report) – which scaled new highs during yesterday’s trading session.  Constant innovations, product launches and effective selling and marketing initiatives have long been favoring Estee Lauder and Nu Skin. Buoyed by such endeavors, these stocks have broken their own 52-week high records multiple times – including yesterday when they hit highs of $152.02 and $75.24, respectively. Closing trade at $151.48 and $75.05 eventually, the respective stocks have surged 79.5% and 38.7% over the past year.  That said, let’s have a deeper insight into the growth story of these stocks individually. Can Estee Lauder Surge Higher?This cosmetics giant has been reporting strong results across most geographic regions and product categories, banking on strategic acquisitions, strong online business and effective management policies. Incidentally, Estee Lauder has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The past acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced have been strengthening its fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed nearly 2 percentage points to sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Further, the company has been constantly undertaking digital initiatives such as online booking for each store appointment, omni-channel loyalty programs and advanced mobile services. These initiatives have been boosting the company’s online sales for a while, which is expected to be a major growth catalyst in the upcoming years.Courtesy of these factors, along with solid cost savings and considerable strength in travel retail business, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company marked its 14th consecutive quarter of earnings beat, while sales kept its positive surprise trend alive for the fourth straight time in the second quarter. Management expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is anticipated to grow 5% in fiscal 2018. All these growth drivers, along with expected gains from the recently enacted tax reforms keeps management encouraged about continuing with its above-industry improvement in the second half and fiscal 2018. This was well reflected in the raised sales and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018, and the favorable third-quarter view. These factors were enough for analysts to turn more constructive about the stock, as evident from the solid upward estimate revisions for the third quarter and fiscal 2018.How’s Nu Skin Placed?Nu Skin has been benefiting from its three-key growth strategy: platform, products and programs, with each component delivering solid growth. To this end, the company has been focused on leveraging social selling networks, which helped its customer base improve 8% year over year in the last reported quarter. Further, the company remains committed toward innovation and product launches to suit consumer needs and thereby expand market share. This is evident from its plans to roll out LumiSpa in several markets during the first half of 2018, given the successful preview of the former last year. Additionally, the company remains encouraged about its Velocity program, which is a rewards plan aimed to motivate sales leaders to enhance their performance. Clearly, Nu Skin’s three-key strategy revolves around solidifying consumer base and augmenting top line.  Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 company remains encouraged about the prospects of this strategy across all regions such as the Americas, South Asia Pacific and EMEA, while it remains particularly impressed with the progress in China. Based on this strength, the company projects revenues to grow about 7-9% in 2018, including favorable currency impacts. Also, Nu Skin — that has surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the past four quarters — envisions earnings per share to lie in a band of $3.45 to $3.55 in 2018. In 2017, the company reported earnings of $2.36 per share, while earnings adjusted for tax reforms came in at $3.23 per share. We believe these factors and Nu Skin’s shareholder-friendly moves should continue boosting investors’ sentiment. Incidentally, the company recently raised its dividend from 36 cents to 36.5 cents per share, which marked its 17th straight year of dividend hike.All said, we expect these cosmetic players to continue adding new leaves to their growth stories – a sentiment which gets rekindled by their long-term growth rates. Markedly, Estee Lauder has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 13%, while that for Nu Skin currently stands at 10.1%.Looking for More Promising Bets?

475,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) made a comeback in the third quarter of 2017, outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.6%. On the contrary, net sales marginally fell short of the consensus mark but grew year over year in the quarter under review.Nevertheless, management reiterated its full-year view. As a result, not much movement was noticed in the stock during pre-market trading hours, in spite of an earnings beat. However, we note that the stock has declined 0.6% on a year-to-date basis, marginally better than the industry’s decline of 1.7%.The quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 and increased 5% year over year. The quarterly results benefited from improved volumes, cost savings and reduced marketing, research and general spending. However, lower net selling prices and input cost inflation had negatively impacted earnings during the quarter.Quarter in DetailKimberly-Clark reported sales of $4.64 billion in the third quarter. Sales marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.67 billion but depicted a growth of 1% from the prior-year quarter. Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by currency rates changes of 1% and marginal growth in organic sales.Organic sales grew marginally, as volumes inched up more than 1%, whereas net selling prices declined 1%. While organic sales remained even in North American consumer products, the same increased 3% in the emerging market regions. Organic sales declined 3% in the developed markets.Operating profit in the quarter increased 2.2% to $854 million. It was favorably impacted by volume growth, reduced marketing, research and general spending and cost savings of $125 million from the FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere) program. These were partially offset by higher input costs of approximately $115 million, arising out of higher costs of pulp and other raw materials as well as lower net selling prices.Segment DetailsPersonal Care Products: The segment includes products like disposable diapers, training/ youth/swim pants, baby wipes, feminine and incontinence care products.Segment sales of $2.3 billion went down 1% during the quarter, owing to a 1% decline in both net selling prices and volumes. These were slightly offset by an improved product mix. Sales improved in the developing and emerging markets, while the same had declined in the regions of North America and developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit improved 4% to $476 million in the quarter driven by cost savings and reduced expenditure on market research and general spending. These were partially offset by input cost inflation and lower selling prices.Consumer Tissue: The segment includes bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products for household use.Segment sales improved 3% to $1.5 billion in the quarter owing to 4% jump in volume and positive impacts from currency rates of approximately 1%. These were marginally offset by decline in net selling prices of 1% as well as unfavorable product mix. Segment sales improved in both North America and developed regions outside North America. Sales in the segment also depicted growth in the developing and emerging regions.Segment operating profit declined 3% to $260 million in the quarter, as lower selling price and product mix, higher cost inflation more than offset the benefits from growth in volumes, cost savings and reduced spending over marketing, research and other general categories.K-C Professional (KCP) & Other: The segment consists of facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers and a range of safety products.Segment sales grew 3% from the prior-year to $0.8 billion in the third quarter. Growth in volumes (up 2%), positive impacts from currency rates and improved product mix was offset by lower selling prices (down 1%). Sales improved in North America and developing and emerging markets. Sales also improved in the developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit surged 10% to $173 million, gaining from cost savings and higher sales. These were partially offset by input cost inflation.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteOther Financial UpdateThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $655 million, long-term debt of $7.1 billion and stockholders' equity of $498 million.

During the quarter, the company bought back 1.6 million shares at a total cost of $200 million.Guidance for 2017Kimberly-Clark maintained its earnings and sales view for 2017.

Also, net sales alongside of organic sales are anticipated to remain flat or slightly up from the prior-year figure.

476,KMB,"Global growth worries have been haunting the markets lately, primarily stemming from the uncertainty in China and other emerging economies. The Chinese central bank’s move to cut interest rate and devalue its currency in August to prop up growth also failed to calm investors. In fact, investors’ fears were heightened after the continual stock market losses in the last week of August. Moreover, the growing concern over the health of the Chinese economy started impacting global markets, be it in the Asian, European or the U.S. markets.
"
477,KMB,"The recent soft September non-farm payroll report and negative revisions to the prior two months indicates that the U.S. economy may not be as immune from global cross currents as many have been hoping. Other measures of economic activity, particularly the two ISM surveys, in addition to trade data and inventory build out suggest that GDP growth in Q3 decelerated markedly from the preceding quarter’s fast pace.
"
478,KMB,"Amid a derailed Chinese economy and global issues, the U.S. Federal Reserve also decided to delay its first rate hike. Though the Fed’s decision brought a sense of relief, it also cast a shadow over the timing of the first interest rate increase. While, a number of Fed officials have indicated that it might arrive at the one of the two remaining FOMC meetings this year, but other experts feel that weak job figures along with low inflation in U.S. are likely to delay the hike in Fed interest rates into 2016.
"
479,KMB,"This uncertainty over interest rate hike and global concerns will thus continue to put pressure on consumer staple stocks in the third quarter and full year results.
"
480,KMB,"We also note that consumer spending pattern is changing and consumers are not willing to spend despite benefiting from lower fuel prices and higher wages. While some are busy boosting their savings, some are burdened with higher health care costs and still-tightened credit availability.
"
481,KMB,"In fact, there are many consumer staple stocks, which are still suffering from continued pressure in the face of limited consumer spending, foreign exchange headwinds and declining unit volumes. Other global issues including potential price wars, a competitive environment, political turmoil in Russia, sluggishness in Japan, and struggle in Europe continue to hinder the financial health of these companies.
"
482,KMB,"Hence, investors should be careful while investing in consumers staple stocks in the near term. Given below are certain headwinds that are likely to prevail in the coming months.WEAKNESSES
"
483,KMB,"Slowdown in Emerging Markets
"
484,KMB,"The majority of the global population lives in emerging economies. Due to a slowdown in income and consumption growth, affordability goes down. Though there remains huge opportunity for sales growth in these markets, currently the state of affairs remains volatile. Developing countries like China, Brazil and Mexico are facing economic slowdown. The Middle East, Russia and Ukraine are witnessing continued political and civil unrest resulting in challenging operating conditions. Some developed markets are also facing weakness due to sluggish consumer demand.
"
485,KMB,"For example, consumer product company, Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report) witnessed some improvement in India and more stable conditions in China in the first half of 2015, but is still struggling with declining volumes in Brazil and a soft economy in Russia. The company is also witnessing weakness in the developed markets with little sign of recovery in North America or Europe. Moreover, it still remains cautious as consumer demand continues to be weak.
"
486,KMB,"Beverage giant The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) also remains apprehensive of broader economic challenges in the future quarters. While the macro-environment is improving in the U.S., Coca-Cola expects challenges in many key emerging/developing markets like Brazil, Russia and China.
"
487,KMB,"Ongoing economic softness and operating challenges in Europe, evolving consumer landscape and an increasingly competitive environment have also been hurting Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.’s (CCE) top line. Management expects these challenges to persist in future quarters, which, coupled with increasingly strong currency headwinds, will limit revenue growth.
"
488,KMB,"Companies like Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report) are also struggling with decelerating growth in the developing markets and currency headwinds. U.K.-based brewer, Diageo Plc (DEO) also faces macroeconomic headwinds and tough retail conditions in emerging markets.Unfavorable Foreign Currency Impact
"
489,KMB,"Companies which have a significant presence in the emerging markets are being affected by currency headwinds, given the recent weakening of many emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the recent currency fluctuations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey are a major concern.
"
490,KMB,"Foreign exchange is a major headwind for companies like Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), General Mills, Inc. (GIS), Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB  -  Free Report), Unilever, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), which have significant business outside the U.S. Venezuelan currency issues are also hurting Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.’s (NUS  -  Free Report) earnings significantly.Declining Volumes
"
491,KMB,"Many consumer staple companies are struggling with declining volume or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top-line.
"
492,KMB,"For example, tobacco companies like Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) and Reynolds American, Inc. (RAI) are facing declining shipment volumes mainly due to higher prices of cigarettes. The government has imposed higher excise taxes on cigarettes, as a result of which tobacco companies are increasing their cigarette prices. Higher prices of cigarettes are leading to lower cigarette volumes. Further, selling of fake versions of the top-branded cigarettes by local retailers are also hurting the cigarette volumes.
"
493,KMB,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) has been witnessing negative beer volumes in the U.S. and Canada for quite some time. In the U.S., the volume declines can be partially attributed to relatively weak economic conditions. In Canada, the premium beer segment has been losing volume since 2001 to the above premium and value segments, mainly due to an aging population and sluggish economy.
"
494,KMB,"The loss of the Modelo brands in Canada due to the termination of the joint venture at the end of Feb 2014 will also lead to volume declines in the near term.
"
495,KMB,"Volumes of food company Mondelez International have been dismal in 2014 and so far in 2015 due to significant pricing actions in response to commodity cost increases, intense competitive pressure, slow response by competitors to higher input costs and the impact of pricing related disputes with retailer customers.
"
496,KMB,"Beverage companies like Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS), Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have also been continuously posting sluggish results in their domestic beverage businesses due to category weakness. Muted volume trend will remain a continuing concern going forward.Bottom Line
"
497,KMB,"As is evident, there are plenty of concerns in the consumer staples industry. However, as regards investing in the space right now, are there any opportunities for short-term investors?

"
500,KMB,"Stocks have bounced back strongly in recent sessions following the soft September jobs report on hopes of delayed Fed action. These fresh questions about the near-term U.S. economic picture add to existing uncertainty about China and the broader global economy.
"
501,KMB,"These doubts notwithstanding, key areas of the U.S. economy appear to be doing just fine. The housing recovery is still in place and while the factory sector seems to be struggling, the picture on the services side is fairly stable. Cheaper gasoline prices and a rise in wages have increased household wealth, which eventually boosted consumer spending. A number of retailers and fast food chains including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), McDonald's Corp. (TM), Target Corp. (MCD) and The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) have hiked wages. Consumers are also expecting lower inflation, primarily due to lower gas prices.
"
502,KMB,"While gradual improvement in the macro-economic scenario would act as a growth driver, stabilized commodity costs will also help improve profit margins for certain staples companies. The favorable margins should help offset some of the negative effects that unfavorable currency typically has on earnings. Even if these improvements are modest in absolute terms, they add to the Consumer Staples sector’s existing attractiveness given its defensive attributes.
"
503,KMB,"Here are some of the key factors that have been driving consumer staple stocks since the past few quarters and also have the potential to boost earnings in the near term.OPPORTUNITIES
"
504,KMB,"Innovations
"
505,KMB,"In a crowded and competitive space, consumer product companies need to regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions to remain successful. In fact, companies with innovative products in their pipeline will be in a position to benefit.
"
506,KMB,"Innovation has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and cereal maker General Mills Inc. (GIS). P&G believes that consistent product innovation, supported by strong marketing and commercialization, will help deliver stronger results over the long term.
"
507,KMB,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) has also been launching new products to boost revenues and market share, which help it to offset the impact of declining volumes. Molson Coors also invests in marketing and advertising to create brand awareness.
"
508,KMB,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (GMCR) has stirred up a revolution with its innovative and exclusive offerings in its single-serve coffee category in order to remain competitive. In September, with the launch of its much-hyped product -- Keurig KOLD brewer -- it entered the cold beverage space, which is five times the size of the hot beverage market. Keurig has also partnered with The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (DPS) to make Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper branded single-serve pods for use on its Keurig Cold at-home beverage system.
"
509,KMB,"For the hot brewer, the company already has strategic agreements with several other coffee and beverage companies like Starbucks Corp. (SBUX  -  Free Report), Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report), Eight O'Clock Bean, and Dunkin Donuts (DNKN) to offer signature drinks of these companies in Keurig Green Mountain’s K-Cups and Vue packs.Transition to Health and Wellness and ‘Good-for-You’ Products
"
510,KMB,"Consumer staples companies are also shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness, rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressure.
"
511,KMB,"America’s largest soft drinks makers -- The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple -- have pledged to reduce calories in their beverages by 20% by 2025 due to a significant customer shift toward healthier and nutritious products. Accordingly, the companies agreed to promote bottled water, no-or-lower-calorie beverages and smaller portion sizes to its consumers. Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) also committed recently to lower calories in its soft drinks by 10% per liter by 2020.
"
512,KMB,"Food companies B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) and General Mills also have been rolling out a variety of nutritious products. Natural and organic food/beverages maker The WhiteWave Foods Company (WWAV) and United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) have been benefiting from strong demand for natural/organic food products and expect the trend to continue.
"
513,KMB,"Food and beverage companies are not the only ones trying to shift to healthier options. Tobacco companies like Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) and Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to this, Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) plans to launch a set of Next Generation Products this year, which will reduce the risks related to tobacco products and attract adult consumers.Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships

514,KMB,"Consumer staples companies are regularly carrying out acquisitions both domestically and internationally to expand their existing customer base and product lines into new markets. Some of them are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better known companies, to take a lead in this challenging environment.
"
515,KMB,"Tyson Foods’ merger deal with packaged meat producer, The Hillshire Brands Company in Aug 2014 was the most talked about and the biggest deal in the meat industry. Similar was the merger of Reynolds American with Lorillard in the tobacco industry.
"
516,KMB,"Another big merger happened in Jul 2015 that of food giants -- Kraft Foods Group, Inc. and H.J. Heinz Company -- per a deal announced in March. The newly formed The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC) is now the third-largest food and beverage company in North America and the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world.
"
517,KMB,"Further, Belgium-based beer giant Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD) is considering taking over its London-based rival, SABMiller plc (SBMRY). The proposed merger would combine the two largest beer companies in the U.S. and could have wide implications on the worldwide beer market.
"
518,KMB,"However, food distributor Sysco Corp.’s (SYY  -  Free Report) merger with US Foods -- the second largest player in the foodservice distribution industry -- did not get approval from the Federal Trade Commission and the deal was called off.Divestitures
"
519,KMB,"The companies are also focusing on improving their product portfolio through divestitures which enable them to concentrate on their core portfolio.
"
520,KMB,"Procter & Gamble has already eliminated almost 60% of the brands (roughly 100 brands) that were witnessing decline in sales and profits in order to focus on more profitable brands.
"
521,KMB,"Similarly, in Oct 2014, Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) spun-off its health care business, which is now called Halyard Health, Inc. (HYH).

The deal, expected to be closed before the end of 2015, also includes the sale of the Le Sueur vegetable businesses. The Green Giant buyout will help B&G Foods enter the frozen food business, which according to the company, has tremendous growth potential.Cost Cutting and Restructuring Initiatives
"
523,KMB,"Most consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. Companies like McCormick & Co., Inc. (MKC), Mondelez International, Inc.

527,KMB,"Consumer staples stocks have done reasonably well in the year-to-date period, with a combination of stable operating backdrop and the inherent defensiveness of the sector adding to the space’s allure.
"
528,KMB,"On the operating front, the moderate economic recovery and improving employment scenario have been helpful. Also, lower fuel prices and rising wages have eased consumers’ disposable income. A number of major retailers and fast food chains like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), McDonald's Corp. (MCD), and others have announced minimum-wage hikes lately, which should help the buying power at the low end of the consumer spectrum.
"
529,KMB,"Commodity costs have in many cases stabilized, which have improved profit margins for certain staples companies. The favorable margins should help offset some of the negative effect that unfavorable currency typically has on earnings.
"
530,KMB,"Here are some of the key factors that have been driving consumer staple stocks since the past few quarters and also have potential to boost earnings in the near term.1. Innovations Drive Differentiation
"
531,KMB,"In a crowded and competitive space, consumer product companies need to regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to differentiate their offerings.
"
532,KMB,"Innovation has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and cereal maker General Mills Inc. (GIS). P&G believes that consistent product innovation, supported by strong marketing and commercialization, will help deliver stronger results over the long term. The company spends around $14 billion on marketing annually.

533,KMB,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) also has been launching new products to boost revenues and market share, which help it to offset the impact of declining volumes. Molson Coors also invests in brand marketing and advertising to create brand awareness.
"
534,KMB,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (GMCR) has particularly notable with its innovative and exclusive offerings in its single-serve coffee category in order to remain competitive. The company has also entered several strategic agreements with other coffee and beverage companies like Starbucks Corp. (SBUX  -  Free Report), Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report), Eight O'Clock Bean and Dunkin Donuts (DNKN) to offer the signature drinks of these companies in Keurig Green Mountain’s K-Cups and Vue packs.
"
535,KMB,"Keurig is now partnering with The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (DPS) to make Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper branded single-serve pods for use on its Keurig Cold at-home beverage system.
"
536,KMB," 2. Shifting Focus on Health and Wellness and ‘Good-for-You’ Products
"
537,KMB,"The companies are also shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness, rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressure.
"

(PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple -- pledged to reduce calories in their beverages by 20% by 2025. Accordingly, the companies agreed to promote bottled water, no-or-lower-calorie beverages and smaller portion sizes to its consumers. Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) also committed recently to lower calories in its soft drinks by 10% per liter by 2020.
"
539,KMB,"Food companies B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) and General Mills also rolled out a variety of nutritious products in 2014 and in the first half of 2015. Natural and organic food/beverages maker The WhiteWave Foods Company (WWAV) and United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) have been benefiting from strong demand for natural/organic food products and expect the trend to continue.
"
540,KMB,"Food and beverage companies are not the only ones trying to shift to healthier options. Tobacco companies like Lorillard Inc (LO), Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) and Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to this, Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) plans to launch a set of Next Generation Products (NGPs) this year which will reduce the risks related to tobacco products and attract adult consumers.3. Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships

"

Consumer giant Unilever NV (UN  -  Free Report) has also divested many businesses in 2014 to concentrate on its core products portfolio.
"
548,KMB,"Similarly, in Oct 2014, Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) spun-off its health care business, which is now called Halyard Health, Inc. (HYH). Snacking giant Mondelez International, Inc. (TM) proposed to spin-off its coffee business to Netherlands-based coffee company, D.E Master Blenders 1753 in order to concentrate on its core snacks business.

552,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters. In the preceding quarter, it missed the consensus mark by 0.7%. Therefore, the question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Kimberly-Clark will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the third quarter.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteFactors Likely to Impact the QuarterKimberly-Clark has been witnessing slower organic sales growth in developing and emerging markets for quite some time now. While performance improved in China, it softened in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, due to lower volumes and highly competitive promotional activity.Though management expects modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in the second half of 2017, the current promotional environment is weakening the market dynamics.In 2017, management anticipates input costs to increase owing to modestly inflationary environment. Input cost inflation are expected to be higher in the range of $200-$300 million from its previous estimate of $150-$250 million. This uptick can be attributable to higher prices for several raw materials including pulp.Nevertheless, we note that the company’s higher cost savings, continued product innovation, strong international presence have been the catalysts that are expected to drive growth. For 2017, the company expects to generate cost savings in the range of $425 to $450 million from the FORCE program, up from the prior estimate of $400 million.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.54. Although the current-quarter estimate has moved down by a penny in the last seven days, it is couple of cents above from the prior-year quarter figure. The consensus estimate for revenue is currently pegged at $4,668 million for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1.6%.Expectations of an increase in both the top and bottom lines boost investor confidence about the stock’s performance in the quarter.Sales for Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional segments are projected to be $2,354 million, $1,490 million and $817 million, respectively. These estimates show a year-over-year increase of 1.8%, 1.2% and 1.9% for each segment, respectively.Further, we note that volumes are estimated to increase 0.03% for both the Personal Care and Consumer Tissue segments, and 0.02% for the K-C Professional segment.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kimberly-Clark has an Earnings ESP of +0.08% per share. However, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) lowers the chances of a beat in the ensuing release.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.26% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

"
553,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s (KMB  -  Free Report) shares have been dismal for a while. The company’s shares have plunged 12.5% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s decline of 9.1%. Its performance has primarily been affected by weak organic sales trend in the North American region. During the first and second quarters of 2017, organic sales from the region declined owing to high competition, reduced promotional shipments and lower net pricing.Although organic sales have been positive in the developing and emerging markets, its growth rate has decelerated in the past few quarters. Further, consumer dynamics have also shifted negatively toward Kimberly-Clark’s diaper offerings. Rising input costs are also hurting the company’s margins. Owing to such challenges, Kimberly-Clark issued soft earnings guidance for the full year, when it reported second-quarter 2017 results. The company now expects earnings per share at the low end of its previous targeted range of $6.20-$6.35. Following the company’s discouraging performance and dull outlook, the Zacks Consensus Estimate also witnessed a downtrend in the past 60 days. In the said period, estimates for 2017 have gone down nine cents to reach $6.22. Also estimated earnings of $1.55 for the third quarter depict a decline of five cents.  Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been striving hard to spark a turnaround. Let’s look into some of the initiatives undertaken by the company to improve performance.Product Innovations Kimberly-Clark dedicatedly focuses on innovations and product launches to improve market share. Recently, the company launched its new Kleenex Reveal Countertop System under the Kimberly-Clark Professional segment, to offer improved and exceptional hygiene products. The company has been providing greater importance toward the improvement of its personal care products portfolio, especially feminine hygiene and diaper products. Innovations related to the Huggies brand has been initiated in several regions such as in Russia and China. In the near term, the company has a number of innovations lined up for launch in North America, including upgrades on Huggies Snug and Dry diapers, Good Nights youth pants and Depend underwear. Savings Enhancing Initiatives Kimberly-Clark is also aggressively cutting costs through a program called Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE. The FORCE program has generated higher cost savings each year with $435 million in 2016, $365 million in 2015, $320 million in 2014, $310 million in 2013, $295 million in 2012 and $265 million in 2011. In fact, cost savings in 2016 exceeded the initial target of at least $350 million. For 2017, the company now expects to generate cost savings in the range of $425 to $450 million from the FORCE program, up from the prior estimate of $400 million.Restructuring efforts, which involve divestiture of lower-margin businesses and streamlining of manufacturing activities, have also resulted in significant savings for the company. Such efforts generated savings of $70 million in 2016, bringing the cumulative benefit to $140 million annually, compared with the original estimate for savings of $120-$140 million by the end of 2017.           Final Verdict We expect that the company’s innovation and restructuring efforts will aid toward driving its performance in the periods ahead. Moreover, the company currently carries a VGM Score of A and has a long-term growth rate of 6.7%.Considering the pros and cons, Kimberly-Clark currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

554,KMB,"Stocks highlighted include Capital One's (COF  -  Free Report), General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report), L-3 Communications (LLL  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report). Charts are shown for the Dow ($DJI) and the S&P 500 (SPX).
"
555,KMB,"To provide insight on the current market and economic environment, I want to share with you various trends and data points that I've been seeing lately.
"
556,KMB,"Earnings estimates for 2009 continue to be cut. For the entire Zacks Rank universe, negative revisions outnumber positive revisions by a ratio of 6.7:1. The caveat is that the overall number of earnings estimate revisions could double over the next few weeks, which could change the ratio significantly.
"
557,KMB,"The outlook for the second-half of 2009 is very questionable, which could actually be a positive. GDP will likely be negative this quarter and probably negative in the first-quarter of 2009. After that, it's anybody's guess. (An economic rebound next year is within the realm of possibilities.)
"
558,KMB,"The credit crunch is starting to thaw, but the world equity markets continue to price in a worsening economic crisis. However, over the short-term, the markets can be very irrational. Just as asset price movement is sometimes overly optimistic (e.g. the tech bubble), asset price movement is sometimes overly pessimistic.
"
559,KMB,"Pensions could be an issue. Companies fund pensions based partially on an assumed rate of return for the plan's assets. In bull markets, an optimistic rate of return allows the company to make smaller contributions. In bear markets, an optimistic rate of return could force a company to make a larger contribution to compensate for inadequate growth in the plan's assets.
"
560,KMB,"This is what happened to Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), which issued disappointing guidance earlier this week. (Even after accounting for the pension expense, LMT's guidance was still below analysts' forecasts, which is why we sold it from the Focus List.)
"
561,KMB,"The stronger dollar could also be a headwind for corporate earnings. It makes our exports more expensive and will hurt those companies that had hedged against a weak dollar.
"
562,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) blamed the strengthening dollar for negatively impacting projected fourth-quarter earnings. (Ironically, the company thinks falling commodity prices could eventually help margins next year. The problem is determining the timing of when lower commodity prices will offset the stronger dollar.)
"
563,KMB,"The silver lining is that valuations are attractive. Heading into this morning's plunge, the Dow and the S&P 500 were trading at about 11x expected 2008 earnings. On a price-to-book basis, the Dow is trading at a multiple of just 2.8. Those who follow the Benjamin Graham strategy will recognize these multiples as being very attractive.
"
564,KMB,"Keep in mind that the S&P 500 has not traded with a single-digit P/E multiple since the mid-1980s, and, thanks to 401K plans, more households own stocks now than before.
"
565,KMB,"Fear Not Matched By Reality
"
566,KMB,"I've heard people warn about the possibility of a very severe recession or even a depression. Such calls are hyperbole.
"
567,KMB,"Inventory levels had been kept in check and continue to fall, not rise. The overwhelming majority of homeowners are current on their mortgages. Most consumers are also current on their credit rates. (Capital One's (COF  -  Free Report) charge-off rate was just 4.3% last quarter; high, but not ""economic depression"" high.) The National Retail Federation's holiday forecast, which is considered grim, still calls for an increase in spending during the upcoming holiday shopping season.
"
568,KMB,"Then there is unemployment. Typically during recessions, the unemployment rate ranges between 9% and 12%. Last month, the unemployment rate was 6.1%. It would take a 50% increase in current unemployment just to touch the levels typically seen during recessionary periods.
"
569,KMB,"The economy is in a recession and conditions will get worse before they get better. But, businesses have already been acting to control costs, and both the Fed and Congress are being proactive. Combined, these factors will serve to lessen the severity of the economic pullback and shorten the length of time until we see a recovery.
"
570,KMB,"The Markets
"
571,KMB,"So far, my call of a market bottom at 7,773 is proving to be correct, but this could still be tested.
"
572,KMB,"What I will point out, however, is that since the Dow ($DJI) hit that level, it has been in a trading range. Yes, the markets have been very volatile, but they have settled into a range. If this range continues to hold, it should prompt buyers to emerge. Let's keep our fingers crossed....
"
573,KMB,"A similar trading range has emerged for the S&P 500 (SPX), and several other domestic indexes.
"
574,KMB,"The VIX remains at record levels. Until the markets stabilize, I don't see it pulling back.
"
575,KMB,"Zacks Elite Portfolios
"
576,KMB,"We are continuing the process of rebuilding our portfolios. As I stated before, we are looking at less economically-sensitive sectors first. The recent additions of L-3 Communications (LLL  -  Free Report) to the Focus List and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) to the Growth & Income portfolios reflect this strategy. There is one consumer staples company that we are considering, but given the current environment, we are waiting to see third-quarter earnings.
"
577,KMB,"We are also looking at stocks from sectors with potentially stronger growth prospects. We are proceeding cautiously, but given the primary focus on more conservative sectors, we do have some flexibility to add a stock with a somewhat higher risk profile. There are a few such companies on our watch list, but none that we are ready to add just yet.
"
578,KMB,"Stick to Strategies That Have Worked Over The Long-Term
"
579,KMB,"I'm going to finish this week's commentary with a post I wrote for the Zacks.com blog.
"
580,KMB,"Yesterday, I discussed the current market environment with one of our financial advisors at Zacks Investment Management. He commented that he is continuing to sign up new clients. When asked why, his response was that many people were angry at their current advisors and wanted someone else to manage their money.
"
581,KMB,"Financial advisors are like any other profession; some are very smart and talented, whereas others border on the edge of incompetency. In the middle is a mix of people who generally do a decent job managing their clients' money.
"
582,KMB,"The problem in bear markets is that many individuals let anger interfere with rationale decisions. Rather than stick with strategies that have worked in the past (and have been proven to work over the long-term), many investors look for alternatives. Often these changes do more harm than good.
"
583,KMB,"As an analogy, the same thing happens with dieting. Individuals who lose weight and then switch diet plans when the pounds start to come back are likely to gain even more weight than those who go back to the diet plan that originally worked for them. (Thanks to my wife for showing me this article in the current issue of Self magazine.)
"
584,KMB,"Investing is no different. If a diversified portfolio comprised of fundamentally-sound stocks with rising earnings estimate and attractive valuations has worked in the past, why change the strategy now?
"
585,KMB,"Bear markets are painful, but they are also temporary. Remember, investing is about the long-term. So stick to strategies that have proven to work over the long-term.
"

"
593,KMB,"A small handful of multinational conglomerates seemingly own almost every major consumer packaged goods brand, food company, or restaurant chain—yet some big-name brands and firms have managed to survive, sometimes for decades, all on their own.Nestle (NSRGY  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Unilever (UN  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), and an array other firms dominate consumer-facing industries, snatching up brands left and right. The reach of these multibillion-dollar companies is greater than ever, especially as some of the largest companies begin to join forces in order to compete long-term on a grand scale.But there will always be companies that avoid being swallowed up by brands for various reasons, especially if their stocks are performing well and their bottom lines continue to grow.Now let’s look at four companies that are almost certainly household names throughout the U.S. that many people might find hard to believe are still their own publicly traded firms.Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. Little tiny Tootsie Rolls have been staples in Halloween baskets for decades. But the candy company’s success might make investors think it got scooped up by a candy giant, such as Mars, years ago. On the contrary, Tootsie Roll has turned into a bit of a powerhouse itself.The company now boasts an array of different candy brands—from Blow Pop and Caramel Apple Pops to Dots and even Junior Mints. With a market cap of $2.38 billion, shares of Tootsie Roll have climbed steadily in recent years. The candy power’s stock now sits just a few dollars below its all-time high of $40.44 per share and has popped from under $20 a share just over five years ago.The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report)Like Tootsie Roll, Clorox has turned itself into a bit of a conglomerate. The cleaning company’s brands include Green Works, Pine-Sol, Glad, 409, and others. With a market cap of nearly $17 billion, the company is certainly not small and wouldn’t be easily acquired, but with giants such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) out there lurking, it is a testament to the company’s strength that it still stands on its own.The company, which has been around for more than 100 years, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but earned an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system.

"
594,KMB,"Consumer staples stocks benefit from the space’s defensive attributes in a volatile market environment. The sector’s operating environment has also improved, but there is no shortage of issues either. Consumer spending remains anemic despite the moderate economic growth as labor market gains haven’t translated into wage gains.
"
595,KMB,"We haven’t seen much commensurate gains in consumer spending as a result of lower energy costs. Higher health care costs and still-tightened credit availability continue to hurt consumer discretionary spending in the U.S. On top of these issues is the impact of the strong U.S. dollar, which is having a material negative effect on the profitability of these operators.
"
596,KMB,"Beyond the U.S., the situation out of Europe still remains challenging despite some improvement and stabilization in the economic landscape. Emerging markets also remain volatile.
"
597,KMB,"For example, consumer product company Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report) is still witnessing weakness in the developed markets with little sign of recovery in North America or Europe. Also, the company still faces macro-economic headwinds in Europe. Moreover, the company does not expect any improvement in market conditions through the rest of the year.
"
598,KMB,"Beverage company The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) also remains apprehensive of broader economic challenges this year. While the macro-environment is improving in the U.S., Coca-Cola expects a sluggish consumer spending environment in other developed nations, like Europe and Japan, as well as challenges in many key emerging/developing markets like Brazil, Russia and China.
"
599,KMB,"Ongoing economic softness and operating challenges in Europe, evolving consumer landscape and an increasingly competitive environment have also been hurting Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.’s (CCE) top line. Management expects these challenges to persist in 2015, which, coupled with increasingly strong currency headwinds, will limit revenue growth.
"
600,KMB,"Here are some of the key headwinds facing the sector:Slowdown in Emerging Markets & Unfavorable Foreign Exchange
"
601,KMB,"The majority of the global population lives in emerging economies, but the growth picture from these markets currently remains less than favorable. The growth opportunity is no doubt there, but it is hard to achieve growth in a decelerating macro environment. Key emerging economies like China, Brazil and Mexico are facing economic slowdown. The situation is even worse in the Middle East, Russia, Ukraine and other markets.
"
602,KMB,"Companies which have a significant presence in the emerging markets are being affected by currency headwinds, given the recent weakening of many emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the recent currency fluctuations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey are a major concern.
"
603,KMB,"Foreign exchange is a major headwind for companies like Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL  -  Free Report), Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB  -  Free Report), Unilever, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), which have significant business outside the U.S. Venezuelan currency issues is also hurting Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.’s (NUS  -  Free Report) earnings significantly.
"
604,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark expects foreign currency exchange to adversely impact sales by 8% to 9% in 2015. Coca-Cola Enterprises also expects currency translation to be a headwind in 2015 as against being a tailwind in 2014.
"
605,KMB,"Companies like Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report) are also struggling with decelerating growth in the developing markets and currency headwinds. U.K.-based brewer, Diageo Plc (DEO  -  Free Report) also faces macroeconomic headwinds and tough retail conditions in emerging markets.Declining Volumes of Beverages
"
606,KMB,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) has been witnessing negative beer volumes in the U.S. and Canada for quite some time. In the U.S., the volume declines can be partially attributed to relatively weak economic conditions.
"
607,KMB,"In Canada, the premium beer segment has been gradually losing volume since 2001 to the above premium and value segments, mainly due to an aging population and sluggish economy. The loss of the Modelo brands in Canada due to the termination of the joint venture at the end of Feb 2014 will also lead to volume declines in the near term.
"
608,KMB,"Sales of food company, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) have also been dismal in 2014 and so far in 2015 due to volume losses following significant pricing actions in response to commodity cost increases, intense competitive pressure, slow response by competitors to higher input costs and the impact of pricing related disputes with retailer customers.
"
609,KMB,"Beverage companies like Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS), Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have also been continuously posting sluggish results in their domestic beverage businesses due to category weakness. Muted volume trend will remain a continuing concern going forward.
"
610,KMB," Bottom Line
"
611,KMB,"We note that the consumer staples companies are fundamentally strong and with the recovery in the economic scenario and increased consumer confidence, earnings should improve soon. However, these companies need to work to survive these headwinds.
"
612,KMB,"As is evident, there are plenty of concerns in the consumer staples industry. However, as regards investing in the space right now, are there opportunities for short-term investors?

"
614,KMB,"The performance of the consumer staples sector has generally been weak over the past year, in terms of earnings and revenue growth. Amid the sluggish macro-economic environment, many companies in the consumer staples sector had to resort to tougher cost-control initiatives, inorganic growth and share buybacks.
"
615,KMB,"This didn’t have much a negative bearing on their stock price performance at all, with the consumer staples stocks outperforming the S&P 500 index in the trailing 12 weeks. This performance momentum has continued into 2015, with the sector among the top performers in the admittedly short year-to-date period.
"
616,KMB,"The perceived defensiveness of the sector likely was the biggest driver of this outperformance, which likely will get a lift from the improving economy and the positive impact of lower fuel costs on household disposable income.
"
617,KMB,"The impact of a recovery in U.S. market conditions and improved labor market can be seen in the better-than-expected results of many consumer staple stocks. Amongst them, leading staffing firm Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last five consecutive quarters and witnessed strong year-over-year earnings growth, driven by solid demand for services provided by skilled professionals as well as a growing labor market in the U.S.
"
618,KMB,"Meat producer Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) also posted better-than-expected results in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Strong sales performance and improved operating margin drove earnings in the quarter and made up for higher input costs. For fiscal 2015, Tyson expects accelerated sales on the back of stronger demand for chicken products and improvement in macro-economic scenario.
"
619,KMB,"While gradual improvement in the macro-economic scenario would act as a growth driver, consumer staple companies also need to work toward strengthening their business structure in order to remain competitive. Here are some of the key points that have been driving the consumer staple stocks since the past few quarters and also have potential to boost earnings in the near term.
"
620,KMB,"Here are the 4 factors that should help the sector sustain its recent momentum:1. Innovation
"
621,KMB,"In a crowded and competitive space, consumer product companies need to regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions and to remain successful.
"
622,KMB,"Innovation has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and cereal maker General Mills Inc. (GIS). P&G believes that consistent product innovation, supported by strong marketing and commercialization, will help deliver stronger results over the long term. The company spends around $14 billion on marketing annually.
"
623,KMB,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) also has been launching new products to boost revenues and market share, which help it to offset the impact of declining volumes. Molson Coors also invests in brand marketing and advertising to create brand awareness.
"

In collaboration with GE Appliances, Keurig Green Mountain will develop GE café Series refrigerator with Keurig Brewing system. With this new technology, consumers can now brew over 400 varieties of Keurig K-Cup beverages from major brands like Folgers, Maxwell House, Starbucks Corp.

Other than this, the company has launched the Keurig 2.0 brewing machine that will work with only licensed K-Cups pods.
"
625,KMB,"Keurig Green Mountain has formed partnerships with The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (DPS) under which Keurig Green Mountain will exclusively make Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper branded single-serve pods for use on its Keurig Cold at-home beverage system, scheduled to launch in 2015.2. Shifting Focus on Health and Wellness and ‘Good-for-You’ Products
"
626,KMB,"The companies are also shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness, rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressures.
"
627,KMB,"In order to combat the declining sales of the company’s carbonated beverages, three of America’s largest soft drink makers -- Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple -- pledged to reduce calories in their beverages by 20% by 2025. Accordingly, the companies agreed to promote bottled water, no-or-lower-calorie beverages and smaller portion sizes to its consumers. Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) is also slowly shifting its product mix from colas to energy drinks and other non-carbonated beverages.
"
628,KMB,"Food companies B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) and General Mills also rolled out a variety of nutritious products in 2014. Natural and organic food/beverages maker The WhiteWave Foods Company (WWAV) and United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) have been benefiting from strong demand for natural/organic food products and expects to continue to gain from the demand for these products.
"
629,KMB,"Food and beverage companies are not the only ones trying to shift to healthier options. Tobacco companies like Lorillard Inc. (LO), Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) and Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).3. Divestitures and Restructuring Initiatives
"
630,KMB,"Most consumer staples companies are divesting low-margin brands and implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. Procter & Gamble is in the process of divesting around 100 brands over the next two years whose sales and profits have been declining over the past three years in order to be a more focused company. Consumer giant Unilever NV (UN  -  Free Report) has divested many businesses in over a year now to concentrate on its core products portfolio.
"
631,KMB,"Similarly, in Oct 2014, Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) spun-off its health care business, which is now called Halyard Health, Inc. (HYH). Following the spin-off, the company initiated a restructuring program in order to improve organization efficiency, improve its underlying profitability, increase the company's flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives and offset overhead costs. The restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, and will result in savings of $60 million to $80 million in 2015. Apart from that, cost savings of at least $300 million are expected from the company's FORCE program in 2015.
"
632,KMB,"In Jul 2014, snacking giant Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ) also plans to separate its European cheese and grocery business.

The company has generated $65 million of cost savings in 2014, and has set a goal to achieve cost savings of at least $85 million in 2015, up 23% from 2014.4. Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships
"
634,KMB,"Consumer staple companies are regularly carrying out acquisitions both domestically and internationally to expand their existing customer base and product lines into new markets. Some of them are also forming partnerships to take a lead in this challenging environment.
"
635,KMB,"Tyson Foods’ merger deal with packaged meat producer, The Hillshire Brands Company in Aug 2014 was the most talked about and the biggest deal in the meat industry.
"
636,KMB,"In the tobacco industry, Reynolds American is close to acquiring the third largest U.S. cigarette company, Lorillard.

Sysco has recently announced the divestiture of 11 facilities of US Foods to Performance Food Group, contingent upon the closing of its proposed merger with US Foods. The merger will create one of the largest food companies in the country giving Sysco increased size and scale in this low-margin business and will also provide significant cost savings opportunities.Bottom Line
"
638,KMB,"The performance of the consumer staples sector has been generally weak in 2014. Now with the gradual improvement in the economy and housing market recovery, 2015 is expected to be better for the consumer staple companies with a strong rebound in earnings. Also, lower fuel prices would further boost consumer confidence.
"
639,KMB,"As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the consumer staples industry over the long haul. How about investing in this space right now?

"
641,KMB,"The Consumer Staples sector has been reaping benefits from an improving economy and rising consumer confidence, lately. Further, labor market optimism and gradual wage acceleration has been positively impacting consumer’s spending nature.However, investors are skeptical regarding headwinds plaguing the sector such as unfavorable currency, declining volumes, price wars, an aggressive promotional environment and rising competition. One such stock affected by the ongoing challenges is Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report).Kimberly-Clark, engaged in the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of consumer products around the world, has been disappointing investors for a while now with dismal organic sales trend. As a result, the company’s top line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last seven quarters in a row, including the recently concluded second-quarter 2017.Headwinds Derailing the Stock                  The company has been witnessing weakness in organic sales particularly due to a tough industry environment in North America. During the first and second quarters of 2017, the region’s organic sales declined due to high competition, reduced promotional shipments and lower net pricing. Although organic sales have been positive in the developing and emerging markets, its growth rate has decelerated in the past few quarters.  Though the company expects modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in the second half of 2017, the current promotional environment is weakening current market dynamics.Kimberly-Clark has incurred lower input cost in 2016, but the trend has changed since the first quarter of 2017. Rising input costs are now hurting the company’s margins. Moreover, it expects the inflationary trend to persist in the periods ahead and anticipates increased prices for several raw materials, including pulp, in 2017. Of late, the company has also experienced a negative shift in consumer behavior in its diaper segment.Dull Outlook, Estimates Showing DowntrendThis Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company continues to expect industry headwinds to linger and has therefore issued soft earnings guidance for the full year. It now expects earnings per share at the low end of its previous targeted range of $6.20-$6.35. Following the company’s discouraging performance and dull outlook, the Zacks Consensus Estimate also witnessed a downtrend in the past 60 days. In the said period, estimates for 2017 have gone down nine cents to reach $6.22. Also estimated earnings of $1.55 for the third quarter depict a decline of five cents. Shares Underperforming the IndustryKimberly-Clark has been trying to spark a turnaround through initiatives such as aggressive cost cutting, planned innovation and marketing campaigns. However, these initiatives have failed to attract investor’s confidence. Shares of the company haven’t reflected any signs of recovery and have declined more than 2% since its dismal second-quarter results. In the past six months, the company’s shares have lost 9.1%, underperforming the industry’s decline of 7.6%. Meanwhile, the Consumer Staples sector, which includes the company, has depicted growth of 4.3% in the same time frame.The ongoing weakness in Kimberly-Clark’s results has made investors jittery, amid global tensions. We note that investors are skeptical about President Trump’s policies. North Korea’s latest nuclear test has further raised geopolitical tensions and increased pressure on the Trump administration.Despite these worries, it may be a good idea to look at some other consumer staples stocks that have the potential to outperform the industry. These stocks remain well positioned in the current market situation and can perform well despite the aforementioned trends. Fetching higher returns in such investment climate is a difficult task.We have highlighted three consumer staple stocks, which have outperformed the industry’s performance. Further, these stocks carry a VGM Score of either A or B along with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.3 Prominent PicksThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report), a leading alcohol producing and selling company, is an ideal pick for investor’s with its Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of B. Impressively the company has delivered an average earnings surprise of 50.1% over the trailing four quarters, with a beat in the preceding past three quarters. The stock has been benefiting from cost-saving initiatives and strategic long-term innovations. In the past three months, shares of the company have increased 9.7%, slightly wider than the industry’s 7.6% gain.Investors may also consider Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report), a leading beauty company, carrying a Zacks Rank #2. The stock bears a VGM Score of B and has a long-term growth rate of 8.7%, both signifying its inherent strength. The company surpassed estimates in two out of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 10.8%. Nu Skin has been consistent with innovation and new product launches, helping it to expand customer base. Over the past six months shares of Nu Skin have increased 24.5%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 11.5%.Another highly potential beauty stock that has been impressing investors is The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report). It carries a Zacks Rank #2, holds a VGM Score of B and has a long-term growth rate of 11.8%. Moreover, Estée Lauder has surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 13.7%. Strong online sales, positive synergies from acquisitions and a wide portfolio of brands and geographical expanse have been favoring the stock. Shares of Estée Lauder surged 30.3% over the past six months, compared with the industry’s gain of 11.5%.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

"
642,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) has been losing sheen over the last few quarters due to slower organic sales growth amid highly competitive promotional environment. Nevertheless, we believe the company’s higher cost savings, continued product innovation, strong international presence to act as catalysts.Let’s delve deeper to understand the factors which have been hurting the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company and find out if the company has the potential to rebound.Slower Organic Sales Growth in Emerging MarketsKimberly-Clark has been witnessing sluggish organic sales growth in developing and emerging markets over the last few quarters. We note that the company posted organic sales growth of 5% in both the first and second quarter of 2016, which decelerated to 3% in the third quarter. Though it showed some improvement in the fourth quarter of 2016 with organic sales growth of 4%, it remained flat in the first quarter of 2017 and grew just 2% in the second quarter of 2017. While performance improved in China, it softened in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, due to lower volumes, and highly competitive promotional activity and a difficult economic environment.Higher Commodity Costs due to InflationThe company has been benefiting from lower commodities cost through 2016. However, the company now anticipates a rise in input costs in 2017, on a modest increase in inflation, going ahead. The company anticipates higher prices of raw materials, including pulp, in 2017.Weak Quarterly PerformanceKimberly-Clark was unable to pull off the second quarter of 2017 earnings due to higher input cost inflation and lower sales due to softness in North America. Kimberly-Clark reported weaker-than-expected numbers in the second quarter of 2017, wherein both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, sales have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five out of the last seven quarters. Following the dismal third-quarter results, the company forecasts soft earnings guidance for full year and now expects earnings per share at the low end of its previous targeted range of $6.20-$6.35.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteWhat Lies Ahead?In order to improve the company’s sales and profits, Kimberly-Clark remains focused on innovating products on a regular basis. The company believes that innovation helps in improving brand positions and market share in the consumer categories. The company is focusing in the training pant category to drive growth. In the second quarter of 2017, the company launched innovative ranges of Huggies for markets of China and Russia. Over the near term, the company has a number of products lined up for launch in North America, including Huggies Snug and Dry diapers, Good Nights youth pants, and Depend underwear.Kimberly-Clark is also aggressively cutting costs through a program called Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) to boost profits. As a result, for 2017, the company expects to generate cost savings in the range of $425-$450 million from the FORCE program, up from the earlier forecast of $400 million.While sluggish organic sales growth in Latin America is hurting the company’s sales. The company is witnessing increased organic sales in diapers in Eastern Europe and China due to strong volume growth and innovation. In China, volume growth is expected to remain healthy along with improvement in pricing in 2017. In fact, the company expects modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in the second half of 2017, despite the current promotional environment.Share Price Performance and Estimates TrendThe consumer products giant has exhibited a bearish run over the last one year. However, the decline was almost in line with the industry’s decline. If we look into the last one month’s performance, we note that the stock declined roughly 1.3%, narrower than the industry’s decline of 2.9%. The industry is currently placed at the top 27% of the Zacks Classified industries (72 out of 256). This signals that the company’s initiatives to turnaround the stock is bearing fruit.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter and for the full year 2017 has remained unchanged in the last 30 days period, in contrary to the estimates revision over the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pegged at $1.55, down from $1.60 per share in the last 60 days. Similarly for 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate declined from $6.29 per share to $6.22, over the same time frame.Bottom LineThough we cannot ignore the fact that Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing slower organic sales growth, due to highly competitive promotional activity since past many quarters, we believe the company’s higher cost savings, continued product innovation, strong international presence have been the positive catalysts to bring a turnaround in the stock in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked food stocks in the industry are Post Holdings Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), Ingredion, Inc. (INGR  -  Free Report) and The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. (CHEF  -  Free Report).Post Holdings has an average positive earnings surprise of 11.32% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

644,KMB,"Share repurchases were still not very significant in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year (the data is not out yet for the second quarter) and the reduction in share count also boosts EPS growth.
"
645,KMB,"Currency translation gains will be less of a factor this quarter due to the rebound in the dollar. However, the strong overseas demand that the previously very weak dollar stimulated will still prove to be a boost to the earnings of many firms. The delay is because in the third quarter they will be shipping goods ordered previously. Given both the rebound in the dollar and the very significant economic slowdown abroad, look for the export boom to fade in the fourth quarter and into 2009.

"
647,KMB,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish.
"
648,KMB,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. With smaller totals for any given sector than the S&P 500 over all, the ratio should be farther away from 1.0 to be truly significant. However, for the sake of consistency, we refer to readings above 1.25 as being in positive territory and below 0.80 as being in negative territory.

"
654,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB  -  Free Report) is a stable company providing shelter for investors in an unstable market. Estimates remain strong and the company just received recognition for its environmentally conscious efforts. 
"
655,KMB,"Company Description
"
656,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation is one of the leading consumer products companies. Its global tissue, personal care and health care brands include Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kotex, Depend, Kleenex, Scott, Kimberly-Clark, Safeskin, Tecnol, Kimwipes and Wypall. Other brands well known outside the U.S. include Andrex, Scottex, Page, Popee and Kimbies. Kimberly-Clark also is a major producer of premium business, correspondence and technical papers.
"
657,KMB,"Slow and Steady
"
658,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark's earnings are historically steady, meeting or beating expectation in each of the past 4 quarters. 5 of the 14 analysts covering the company have revised estimates upward within the past 30 days. The company will report third-quarter earnings on Oct 22.  
"
659,KMB,"Shares of KMB are currently trading at 13 times next year's earnings of $4.63. The projected number exhibits a 9.4% growth rate for 2009.  
"
660,KMB,"The company also continues to poys a solid dividend of $2.32 per share on an annualized basis.  In volatile times, many investors seek solid large-cap stocks, and the consumer staples company is the prototypical example. 
"
661,KMB,"Environmentally Friendly
"
662,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark received an award from the Environmental Protection Agency and members of the freight sector.  This marks the second consecutive year the company has received the SmartWay award for energy conservation and cutting greenhouse gases. 
"
663,KMB,"The company is strategically placing distribution centers near large cities, as well as other measures to reduce its footprint. Kimberly-Clark saved 1.7 million gallons of diesel fuel, and cut carbon dioxide output by almost 114,000 tons. The previous numbers would be equal to removing 15,000 cars from the roads. 
"
664,KMB,"The medical devices industry, which was once acclaimed for its high-paying jobs and research and development opportunities, has been subject to the much controversial 2.3% medical device excise tax since its enactment in the beginning of 2013. Sequestration-related spending cuts to the U.S. federal budget have also undermined the medical devices industry’s prospects. In fact, this has significantly restricted the industry’s bottom-line improvement in the past year.Partial Repeal: A Boon?
"
665,KMB,"However, as a slight respite, in Jan 2014, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) got a $1 billion or 3.5% boost to its fiscal 2014 budget from the prior-year post-sequestration budget (according to fiscal 2014 Omnibus Appropriations bill, released on Jan 13, 2014). According to a statement by appropriators, this hike, although insignificant, is expected to result in 385 million new grant opportunities for researchers compared to 2013. We note that the sequestration, which resulted in a 5.5% cut in the NIH fiscal 2013 budget, resulted in 640 fewer grants in 2013.
"
666,KMB,"Apart from NIH, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, The National Science Foundation (NSF), health professions and nursing workforce development programs are some of the others to gain from this bill.
"
667,KMB,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also managed to get $2.552 billion through this omnibus spending package, a $166 million (7%) increase over the fiscal 2013 post-sequestration funding level. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received a $370 million or 6.8% increase over the year-ago post-sequestration funding level.Situation Remains Bleak
"
668,KMB,"Even more than three months after the Senate passed the Omnibus Appropriations bill, the research funding scenario continues to look bleak. Most economists are of the opinion that with cost of research rising astronomically, this nominal revision can hardly bring any reprieve. While the additional funding for NIH will help sustain current projects and begin funding for new research grants, this is still $714 million short of NIH’s pre-sequestration budget.
"
669,KMB,"Further, things are not at all cheery for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). While the bill included $3.7 billion for the CMS, this was $195 million less than what was enacted in the previous fiscal.
"
670,KMB,"Unless totally repealed or replaced, these spending cuts will last through 2021. NIH expects sequestration to turn graver in the coming years leading to serious consequences like delaying progress in medical breakthroughs, deterioration in job creation and tempering of economic growth. An NBC news article recently noted that many new researchers, who were trained with the U.S. taxpayers’ money, may have to move to Europe and Asia where government funding for medical research is on the rise.
"
671,KMB,"Moreover, the medical device excise tax is taking a heavy toll on the MedTech sector, hurting pricing decisions of companies and subjecting them to tremendous margin pressure. The 2.3% excise tax (effective Jan 2013), which is imposed on the sales price instead of net profit, amounts to a sizable sum, wiping out almost a quarter of the profit at the med instrument owners.
"
672,KMB,"The big players are trying out ways to change their business model and cost structure to accommodate the excise tax. These companies are undertaking various restructuring initiatives to counter costs incurred from the implementation of the new tax. Restructuring especially to offset the effect of the excise tax has already been adopted by several key players. The companies are also trying to focus on strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion or are reducing operations in order to weather the tax burden.M&A Activities
"
673,KMB,"MedTech M&A continues unabated in 2014. Wary of an uncertain economy, MedTech giants have resorted to the acquisition route to harness their strengths and diversify offerings.
"
674,KMB,"The first quarter earnings season in the medical device sector kicked off with such a mega acquisition announcement. Last week, on its earnings call, Zimmer Holdings (ZMH) disclosed that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Biomet, Inc. -- a provider of surgical and non-surgical products -- for a transaction value of $13.35 billion. According to Zimmer, with the successful completion of this acquisition, it will be better able to capture the $45 billion musculoskeletal industry.
"
675,KMB,"Another noteworthy move in recent times is the colossal $13.6 billion takeover of Life Technologies Corporation by its major peer Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report) which closed in February. In the same month, artificial knee and hip maker Smith & Nephew plc (SNN  -  Free Report), entered into an agreement to buy Arthrocare Corporation (ARTC) for $1.7 billion in order to expand its product line in sports medicines.
"
676,KMB,"Global orthopedic device makers, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) and Wright Medical Group, Inc. (WMGI) are also resorting to inorganic means to expand their businesses. In April, Stryker acquired German surgical tools firm, Berchtold Holding. In March, it acquired U.S.-based developer of hip arthroscopy products, Pivot Medical. In December last year, Stryker was in the headlines with its $1.65 billion acquisition of robotic assisted surgery developer, MAKO Surgical Corp.
"
677,KMB,"Wright Medical to expand in the fast growing extremities market, announced a couple of acquisitions: Solana Surgical and OrthoPro. Earlier in November, Wright Medical completing the acquisition of French orthopedic extremities company Biotech International.
"
678,KMB,"Some other significant newest buyouts include Covidien plc’s (COV) $860 million acquisition of Israel-based diagnostic products maker Given Imaging (in February) and Quest Diagnostics’ (DGX) takeover of Solstas Lab Partners Group and its subsidiaries for approximately $570 million (Mar 2014). Besides, to expand its dental business in Europe, in February, Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) acquired five companies from a Dutch company, Arseus NV.  
"
679,KMB,"There have been many more M&As in the MedTech space. Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX) closed the acquisition of Bard EP, the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard, Inc. (BCR). Earlier in September, Baxter International (BAX) closed its $3.9 billion deal to acquire Gambro AB, a Sweden-based renal products company.  
"
680,KMB,"In the light of the discussion above, we see no slowing down of M&A deals in the MedTech space in rest of 2014. We also expect a significant pickup in in-licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates.Divestments
"
681,KMB,"With the medical device excise tax in force, leading to further contraction in profit margins, we have been observing a lot of divestments of late, particularly of non-core business segments. Divestments, specifically to offset the tax, have been announced by many key players. We expect this trend to continue in the rest of 2014.
"
682,KMB,"MedTech giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), after its $1 billion acquisition of privately-held, pharmaceutical discovery and development company, Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc, in Apr 2014 announced its decision to sell off its Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business to The Carlyle Group (CG) for about $4 billion. The divestment, which is expected to go through in mid-2014, will help the company increase its focus on the core pharma business.
"
683,KMB,"Taking a cue from Abbott Laboratories (ABT), which separated its research-based pharmaceuticals business by creating a new company AbbVie (ABBV) last year, Baxter International revealed in Mar 2014 that it will split its biopharmaceuticals and medical device segments into two independent companies in order to put greater management focus on these two businesses.
"
684,KMB,"In January, Wright Medical exited the hip and knee implant market with the $290 million divestment of its OrthoRecon business to MicroPort Scientific Corporation and its affiliates. In January again, Covidien sold off its Confluent Surgical product line for approximately $235 million.
"
685,KMB,"Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has also entered into a definitive agreement to divest its blood transfusion diagnostics unit to Spain-based Grifols for $1.675 billion. Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) on the other hand is working on a potential tax-free spin-off of the company's health care business. In November last year, Quest Diagnostics divested its Enterix colorectal cancer screening test business.Emerging Markets
"
686,KMB,"Although the U.S. still holds the leading position with almost one-third of global market share, a gradual slowdown in established markets due to a number of lingering headwinds are forcing MedTech companies to look for opportunities in the developing world. Currently, with the growth rate remaining in low single digits in developed markets like the U.S., Europe and Japan, large-cap medical device makers are looking to invest more in the high-growth emerging regions.
"
687,KMB,"Accordingly, emerging economies like Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs) as well as Turkey, Mexico, Malaysia, South Africa, South Korea and the Czech Republic are fast coming up in the medical devices space. These emerging economies are seeing an increasing uptake in medical devices largely due to growing medical awareness and economic prosperity.
"
688,KMB,"An aging population, increasing wealth, government focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage make these markets a happy hunting ground for global medical device players. Expansion in emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2014 and beyond.
"
689,KMB,"Among the BRIC members, Brazil is currently the largest healthcare market in Latin America, covering almost one-fourth of the population. Though India has one of the largest and fastest growing healthcare markets in the world, it is considered to have the least developed healthcare infrastructure and spends relatively little in this area. In order to reverse the trend, during the 12th Plan (2012-2017), the Indian government planned to spend 2.5% of its GDP (up from 1.2% earlier) on health care and raise it to at least 3% by 2022.
"
690,KMB,"Accordingly, big players in the MedTech sector are vying to expand their presence in BRIC and other emerging markets. These companies are also looking to establish their manufacturing facilities abroad.
"
691,KMB,"Abbott continues to lead the trend with about 40% of sales coming in from the emerging markets. The company expects this contribution to increase to 50% by 2015.

"
700,KMB,"So far, 41.2% of the Medical sector participants have reported first quarter results which have been fairly good with respect to beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises). We note that the results were not impressive in terms of year-over-year growth.
"
701,KMB,"The earnings ""beat ratio"" was 76.2%, while the revenue ""beat ratio"" was 38.1% in the first quarter.

"
704,KMB,"In spite of several core market challenges, the big three medical device players -- Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical, Inc. (STJ) -- are striving to gain share in the ICD market through new product launches. With gradual stability in the ICD market, these players should be able to revive their top line. In the first quarter of 2014, St. Jude Medical’s ICD revenues increased 2.1% (3% in constant-currency).
"
705,KMB,"Although Boston Scientific posted another quarter of weak ICD sales with 3.1% year-over-year decline, it is taking several initiatives to revive its top line. We also wait for a better-than-expected ICD performance from Medtronic which is slated to report its fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results on May 20.The Cooper Companies Inc. (COO) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) represents a value proposition based on factors such as margin expansion, acquisitions, product line expansion and geographical reach as well as share buybacks. Johnson & Johnson holding a Zacks Rank #2 has been trying to offset the declining sales of some of its important products by bringing in new products through in-licensing deals and acquisitions.
"
706,KMB,"Beyond the MedTech majors, we are also optimistic about the Zacks Ranked #3 orthopedic device players, Zimmer Holdings and Stryker Corporation. The percentage of population over 65 in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other regions is expected to nearly double by the year 2030. We believe the orthopedic giants stand to benefit from this aging demography.
"
707,KMB,"Among scientific instrument makers, Thermo Fisher Scientific has been successfully expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency. Apart from the newest incorporated segment Life Sciences Solution segment with the buyout of Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher’s market leading portfolio of analytical technologies demonstrated strong performance with growth in the Life Sciences Mass Spec and Chromatography businesses.
"
708,KMB,"Among other MedTech stocks, Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (MJN), Covance Inc. (CVD), Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH), Illumina Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Hologic Inc. (HOLX) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) also look attractive.CHALLENGES AND WEAKNESSES
"
709,KMB,"Coming to the weakest link in the MedTech sector, we advise investors against names that offer little growth/opportunity over the near term. These include companies for which estimate revision trends for 2014 reflect a bearish sentiment.
"
710,KMB,"Stocks which do not look inspiring are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Wright Medical, Volcano Corporation (VOLC), CareFusion Corporation (CFN), Haemonetics Corporation (HAE), Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report) and DENTSPLY International Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report), all carrying the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
"
711,KMB,"The consumer staples sector has been generally weak in the recent past due to a difficult consumer spending environment resulting from slow job growth, rising interest rates and tightened credit availability. In addition, difficult operating conditions in Europe and a slowdown in some Asian countries, like China, also weigh on the sector’s outlook.
"
712,KMB,"As a result, consumer staple stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 as a whole in the year-to-date period. We see that in the stocks of most staples stocks, particularly the leaders like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K). Most of the large consumer staples companies are able to increase their earnings solely with the help of cost controls, innovations, acquisitions and share buybacks, but only a few have been able to deliver impressive top-line growth – thus signaling a lack of real growth.Innovations
"
713,KMB,"In a crowded and competitive space, consumer product companies are forced to innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions for their customers to remain successful.
"
714,KMB,"Kellogg’s efforts on that count include introductions of several breakfast options like Special K Nourish hot cereal and bars, Pop-Tarts Gone Nutty toaster pastries, Raisin Bran Healthy Heart Omega 3 cereal, Special K Multigrain cereal, Kashi Golean Vanilla Graham Clusters cereal and Kashi Heart-to-Heart cereal.
"
715,KMB,"Consumer product giant Procter & Gamble has a strong tradition of introducing blockbuster products and new categories. The company has launched new products in most of its categories. In fact, P&G invested around $2 billion in innovation in 2012, which shows the importance of innovation in the company.
"
716,KMB,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co (TAP  -  Free Report) introduced several beer brands in 2012 to ensure variety and it continues to focus on the above premium category in beer in 2013. Other than beer, the company expects to launch the world’s first low-alcohol cider beer mix in the Czech Republic. It will also introduce a new non-alcohol category with the launch of Brewers Lemonade in 2013.Shifting Focus on Health and Wellness and ‘Good-for-You’ Products
"
717,KMB,"The companies are shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products according to consumer preferences, increasing health consciousness and rising obesity concerns.
"
718,KMB,"Beverage companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) are slowly expanding their portfolio of non-carbonated drinks due to the increasing awareness about calorie intake and nutrition among consumers.
"
719,KMB,"Though these companies are still largely dependent on carbonated beverages, changing consumer preference toward health and wellness products has led them to introduce a variety of non-carbonated beverages.
"
720,KMB,"Coca-Cola is expanding its portfolio of non-carbonated drinks, which include Powerade sports drinks and Minute Maid fruit juices, whereas Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) is also slowly shifting its product mix from colas to energy drinks and other non-carbonated beverages. PepsiCo is also increasing its focus on low calorie beverages, non-carbonated beverages and healthier snacks.
"
721,KMB,"Coffee giant Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), is looking beyond its traditional coffee business and making an effort to bring more nutritional and healthy products to its menu. These include Evolution Fresh juices, Starbucks Refreshers energy drinks and new wholesome Salad Bowls.
"
722,KMB,"Food and beverage companies are not the only ones trying to shift to healthier options. Tobacco companies are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).
"
723,KMB,"In the electronic cigarette industry, cigarette maker Lorillard Inc (LO) captures a leading position in the U.S. after it acquired e-cigarette brand blu e-Cigs in Apr 2012. Later with the acquisition of U.K.’s e-cigarette brand SKYCIG on Oct 3, the company has strengthened its position in the wide electronic cigarette market. Nu Mark, the subsidiary of Altria Group Inc (MO  -  Free Report) also launched its first e-cigarette brand MarkTen in Aug 2013, whereas Reynolds American Inc’s (RAI) Vuse e-cigarette brand also offers potential for long-term commercial success.Cost Reduction and Restructuring Initiatives
"
724,KMB,"In order to boost profits, most consumer staples companies are divesting low-margin brands, improving the supply chain and implementing cost-reduction initiatives. These initiatives help companies to reduce the effects of inflating commodity costs and other input costs, which have remained a drag on margins of most companies in this sector, despite top-line growth.
"
725,KMB,"Coca-Cola started a four-year productivity and reinvestment program early last year, under which it plans to optimize its global supply chain, improve global marketing and innovation, achieve operating expense leverage, standardize information systems and integrate North American bottling and distribution operations acquired from Coca-Cola Enterprises.
"
726,KMB,"The program is expected to generate incremental annualized savings of $550 to $600 million through 2015. As the company’s tepid volume growth in the just released third quarter earnings season shows, these measures are key to the company’s bottom-line. PepsiCo also announced a restructuring program last year, which is expected to generate productivity savings of up to $3 billion through 2015.
"
727,KMB,"Through its cost savings program FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere), consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB  -  Free Report) is expected to save $300–$350 million by the end of 2013. Kimberly-Clark’s pulp and tissue restructuring program is expected to increase operating profit by at least $75 million in 2013 and at least $100 million in 2014.
"
728,KMB,"The company has also dissolved the diaper segment in Western and Central Europe, except the Italian market, in order to streamline its manufacturing facilities in Europe. This has reduced its European workforce by approximately 1,300 to 1,500 positions.
"
729,KMB,"Coffee maker Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc (GMCR) is also taking several steps to optimize its efficiency and reduce operational costs. It aims to deliver annual productivity and cost savings benefits in the range of $70 million to $100 million by 2015.
"
730,KMB,"Cigarette company Altria made significant progress with its $1 billion cost reduction program in 2012 by reducing headcount, consolidating certain facilities, improving business processes, and pursuing other savings. The cost reduction program is expected to deliver $400 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2013. Reynolds American is also expected to save about $70 million annually by 2015 through workforce restructuring.
"
731,KMB,"Consumer giant Unilever PLC (UL  -  Free Report) also has been divesting businesses to concentrate on its core foods portfolio. Recently, it has sold its Wish-Bone salad dressing business to Pinnacle Foods Inc (PF  -  Free Report). Besides, it has sold its Skippy peanut butter business in Jan 2013 to Austin, MN-based producer of branded food and meat, Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL), while in Aug 2012, ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG) bought its Bertolli and P.F. Chang's frozen meals brands.Expansion in Emerging Markets
"
732,KMB,"Besides costs saving initiatives, many consumer staples companies are shifting their focus to emerging markets to boost sales. With market saturation, low disposable income of consumers, uncertain macroeconomic conditions and increased competitive activity in developed markets, these companies are diverting their resources to explore emerging markets.
"
733,KMB,"Relative to the mature North American and European markets, emerging markets such as Brazil, India, China, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia are to a large untapped opportunities where consumer spending is still growing. Additionally, demand for convenient and branded packaged food tends to grow as middle-class consumers shift to urban living. Thus the rising pool of middle class consumers in emerging markets represents a huge opportunity for the companies.
"
734,KMB,"However, increased exposure to emerging markets also brings along the negative impact of currency fluctuations for many consumer staples companies. A stronger dollar reduces the value of outside-U.S. sales and in turn limits growth. But with improving standards of living in developing countries, the companies are now focusing on increasing pricing to derive profits, which was difficult earlier.
"
735,KMB,"PepsiCo is expanding in nations like Russia, Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom and also in the emerging markets of China, India, Brazil and Africa by offering locally relevant innovation and value-added products. The company has tripled its revenues from the emerging and developing markets in the past five years. Going forward, management expects two-third of its revenues to come from the emerging markets.
"
736,KMB,"Cereal maker General Mills, Inc (GIS) is also focusing on expansion in China, Brazil, India and Russia, where consumer spending is on the rise.
"
737,KMB,"Tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) has a significant presence in a large number of markets. Asia remains a growth engine for the company. It also enjoys robust growth in Indonesia, Pakistan, China, Philippines, Mexico and Korea.Zacks Industry Rank
"
738,KMB,"Consumer Staples is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
739,KMB,"As a guideline, the outlook for industries in the top 1/3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and the bottom 1/3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
740,KMB,"The consumer staples sector is further sub-divided into the following industries at the expanded level (260 industry groups): Beverages – Alcohol, Beverages – Soft, Consumer Products – Miscellaneous Staples, Cosmetics & Toiletries, Food – Meat Products, Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified, Publishing – Newspapers, Soaps & Cleaning Preparations, Textile – Apparel and Tobacco.
"
741,KMB,"The ‘Consumer Products – Miscellaneous Staples’ is the best placed among them with its Zacks Industry Rank #33, comfortably placing it into the top 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups. It is joined by the 'Cosmetics & Toiletries' with a Zacks Industry Rank #53. The Tobacco, Food – Meat Products and Beverages – Alcohol also lies in the top 1/3rd with Zacks Industry Ranks of #63, #67 and #70, respectively.
"
742,KMB,"The Textile – Apparel lies in the middle 1/3rd with Zacks Industry Rank #157. The Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified barely makes into the middle 1/3rd with a Zacks Industry Rank #168.
"
743,KMB,"However, all the other sub-sectors –- Beverages – Soft, Publishing – Newspapers and Soaps & Cleaning Preparations -- are featured in the bottom one-third of all Zacks industries with respective Zacks Industry Ranks of #241, #214, and #232.
"
744,KMB,"Looking at the exact location of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the consumer staples space as a whole is positive.Earnings Trends
"
745,KMB,"The Consumer staples sector depicts mixed earnings trends. The third quarter 2013 results for the sector have been average in terms of earnings beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) and weak for revenue.
"
746,KMB,"Of the 20.6% companies reported under the consumer staples industry, the earnings ""beat ratio"" was 42.9%, while the revenue ""beat ratio"" was only 14.3%. Total earnings for this sector increased only 0.3% until now, compared with a decline of 0.6% registered in the second quarter. Total revenue declined 1.5% in the quarter, worse than the decline of 0.6% in the previous quarter. We note that the companies are facing weak results due to difficult consumer spending environment.
"
747,KMB,"The consensus earnings expectations for the rest of the year remain muted with earnings projected to grow 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013, thereby pegging the full-year 2013 growth outlook at 5.5%. Revenues will decline 7.1% in the fourth quarter, with full-year revenue to decline 7.5%.
"
748,KMB,"Moreover, the consumer staples sector is expected to account for only 6.8% share of the S&P 500 index earnings in 2013, while it accounts for 7.8% of the total market capitalization.
"
749,KMB,"However, we believe the consumer staple environment will improve in 2014 with the expected recovery in economy and job environment. Earnings for 2014 are expected to grow 9.3%, while revenue is expected to improve 4.1%.
"
750,KMB,"For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our ‘Earnings Trends’ report.OPPORTUNITIES
"
751,KMB,"Despite macroeconomic headwinds, some of these companies have been able to deliver impressive results and have the potential to grow in the upcoming quarters. The J. M. Smucker Co. (SJM  -  Free Report) and Green Mountain have been delivering strong performances consistently and have gained from lower green coffee costs. Both companies have raised their guidance for the fiscal year. The positive earnings momentum of these stocks resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
"
752,KMB,"Companies like PepsiCo, Kraft Foods Group Inc (KRFT), Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Hershey Co. (HSY) also have solid growth potential, despite carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While Kraft and PepsiCo boasts solid organic growth and productivity gains, Tyson and Hershey have solid innovation programs and international presence which helps them to maintain top line growth despite macroeconomic headwinds faced by the developed nations.WEAKNESSES
"
753,KMB,"There were some companies which were hit hard by the challenging macro-economic environment, owing to lower consumer spending. U.S. consumers are burdened with higher gasoline prices, payroll tax increases and delayed tax refund checks. These external forces might restrict consumer discretionary spending. The persistently sluggish European economic conditions also remain an overhang.
"
754,KMB,"While Zacks Rank #3 companies like Molson Coors, Procter & Gamble and Kellogg are facing the brunt of sluggish sales, currency headwinds, weakness in Europe and poor volumes; beverage company Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) has been suffering due to weakness in overall carbonated soft drinks (CSD) volumes in North America and increasing regulatory pressure besides weak volume growth, higher cost pressure and macro-economic headwinds. Dr Pepper holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
"
755,KMB,"While we are witnessing signs of economic recovery in the U.S., there is still much uncertainty surrounding the Consumer Staples sector. In Europe too, though signs of improvement are visible, overall economic conditions remain challenging.
"
756,KMB,"Despite favorable weather conditions, increased consumer confidence and lower fuel prices, there are many consumer staple stocks which are suffering from continued pressure in the face of limited consumer spending, foreign exchange headwinds and declining unit volumes. Not only this, but the continued weakness in results has led many consumer staple companies to provide a weak outlook.
"
757,KMB,"For example, consumer product company Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report) is still witnessing weakness in the developed markets with little sign of recovery in North America or Europe. The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) also remains apprehensive of broader economic challenges. Management even warned that earnings growth could miss long-term targets for both 2014 and 2015.
"
758,KMB,"We note that Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (CCE  -  Free Report) lowered its full-year 2014 sales and profit outlook twice due to ongoing macro and competitive pressures in Europe. Management expects the ongoing economic softness and operating challenges to persist in 2015, thereby limiting revenue growth.
"
759,KMB,"Hence, investors should be careful while investing in consumers staple stocks in the near term. Below are certain headwinds that are likely to prevail in the coming months:1. Slowdown in Emerging Markets and Unfavorable Foreign Exchange
"
760,KMB,"Consumer staple companies are also witnessing sluggish growth in the developed economies. Emerging markets have become increasingly volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural issues. The Middle East, Russia and Ukraine are witnessing continued political and civil unrest resulting in challenging operating conditions. Developing countries like China, Brazil and Mexico are also facing economic slowdown.
"
761,KMB,"Owing to a significant presence in the emerging markets, the companies’ profits are being affected by currency headwinds, given the recent weakening of many emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the recent currency fluctuations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey are a major concern.
"
762,KMB,"Foreign exchange is a major headwind for companies like Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL  -  Free Report), Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB  -  Free Report), Unilever, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), which have significant business outside the U.S., Venezuelan currency issues is also hurting Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.’s (NUS  -  Free Report) earnings significantly.
"
763,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark expects foreign currency exchange to adversely impact sales by 8% to 9% in 2015. Coca-Cola Enterprises also expects currency translation to be a headwind in 2015 as against being a tailwind in 2014.
"
764,KMB,"Specialty coffee retailer Keurig Green Mountain Inc. (GMCR) recently lowered its fiscal 2015 guidance as it expects foreign currency headwinds to continue to impact earnings for the rest of the fiscal 2015. Sales of food company Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) have also been dismal due to volatility in the emerging market and slower global category growth.
"
765,KMB,"Companies like Procter & Gamble and Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report) are also struggling with decelerating growth in developing markets and currency headwinds. U.K.-based brewer Diageo Plc (DEO  -  Free Report) also faces macroeconomic headwinds and tough retail conditions in emerging markets.2. High Commodity Costs Hurting Margins
"
766,KMB,"Though food costs have stabilized, there are still many consumer staple food companies that are being pressurized with significant increases in commodity costs. Rising costs are hurting margins of these stocks despite revenue growth. In 2015, the overall cost environment for food commodities is expected to be under pressure for companies like Procter & Gamble, Kellogg, PepsiCo. and Kimberly-Clark.3. Declining Volumes of Beverages
"
767,KMB,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) has been witnessing negative beer volumes in the U.S. and Canada for quite some time. In the U.S., the volume declines can be partially attributed to relatively weak economic conditions, while in Canada, the premium beer segment has been gradually losing volume since 2001 to the above premium and value segments, mainly due to an aging population and sluggish economy.
"
768,KMB,"The loss of the Modelo brands in Canada due to the termination of the joint venture at the end of Feb 2014 will also lead to volume declines in the near term.
"
769,KMB,"Beverage companies like Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS), Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have also been continuously posting sluggish results in the North American beverage business due to dwindling carbonated soft drinks volume, which is the biggest category of these beverage companies. The rise in health and wellness consciousness among consumers is the main reason for this weakness. Muted volume trend will also remain a concern going forward.Bottom Line
"
770,KMB,"We note that the consumer staples companies are fundamentally strong and with the recovery in the economic scenario and increased consumer confidence, earnings should improve soon. However, these companies need to work to survive these headwinds as these may pull back profits.
"
771,KMB,"As is evident, there are plenty of concerns in the consumer staples industry. However, as regards investing in the space right now, are there opportunities for short-term investors?
"
772,KMB,"Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.
"
773,KMB,"Weather took most of the blame for the sub-par business activity levels in the first quarter of the year, prompting many companies in the consumer staples sector to provide weak guidance. But even as weather improved in Q2, the guidance picture didn’t. The reason for that was the continued difficult consumer spending environment, foreign exchange headwinds and declining unit volumes. While stock prices in the sector have done well lately (consumer staples have outperformed the broader S&P 500 index year to date), many of those issues are still with us.
"
774,KMB,"The sector’s defensive attributes no doubt position it to benefit from the prevailing uncertain market backdrop, but market sentiment will shift against the group if macro visibility improves given these challenges.Uncertain Economic Environment
"
775,KMB,"Though we did witness some signs of economic recovery and improving consumer confidence in the U.S., there is still much uncertainty. The labor market has been making steady gains lately, but we have yet to see much improvement in household buying power as a result of stagnant wages.
"
776,KMB,"The recent drop in oil prices should help consumer finances this holiday season, but the uncertain global environment could prompt many consumers to save the gain instead of spending it. The economic picture in Europe is steadily weakening and the outlook for Japan also remains uncertain. No doubt, consumer product company Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report) is witnessing weakness in the developed markets with little sign of recovery in North America or Europe.
"
777,KMB,"Notably, Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (CCE  -  Free Report) expects fiscal 2014 sales and profits to be at the lower end of its previously provided range, as the company expects challenging retail consumer and competitive environment in Great Britain and poor weather conditions in France.Slowdown in Emerging Markets and Unfavorable Foreign Exchange
"
778,KMB,"Consumer staple companies are witnessing sluggish growth in the developed economies. Market saturation, along with stagnant disposable income and increased competitive activities, add to the companies’ woes.
"
779,KMB,"This is the reason why companies have been looking to faster growing emerging markets. Though a good strategy in the long run, the near-term outlook for many of these markets remains uncertain.
"
780,KMB,"Emerging markets have become increasingly volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural issues. The Middle East, Russia and Ukraine are witnessing continued political and civil unrest resulting in challenging operating conditions. Developing countries like China, Brazil and Mexico are also facing some economic slowdown.
"
781,KMB,"Moreover, owing to a significant presence in the emerging markets, the companies’ profits are being affected by currency headwinds, given the recent weakening of many emerging market currencies. In particular, the recent currency fluctuations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey are a major concern. Foreign exchange is a major headwind for companies like Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB  -  Free Report), Unilever, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), which have significant business outside the U.S.
"
782,KMB,"Unilever plc is anxious as the pace of sales growth has continued to slow down since the fourth quarter of 2013, mainly due to its operations in emerging markets, which account for two-third of its revenues.
"
783,KMB,"Consumer product giant The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) is facing business disruption and substantial price reduction in Venezuela following the publication of new price control regulations in the country. Moreover, volatile market dynamics in countries like Argentina (import restrictions and price controls), Egypt, Syria and South Korea and political unrest in Russia, the Middle East and Ukraine are compounding problems.
"
784,KMB,"Sales of food company, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) have also been dismal due to emerging market choppiness and slower global category growth. It has lowered its sales outlook for 2014 twice this year. Companies like Procter & Gamble and Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report) are also facing the adverse effects of a slower developing market growth and currency headwinds. U.K.-based brewer, Diageo Plc (DEO  -  Free Report) is braced with macroeconomic headwinds and tough retail condition in emerging markets.High Commodity Costs Hurting Margins
"
785,KMB,"Almost all the food companies in the consumer staple sector are facing rapid and significant increases in commodity costs, which are hurting margins despite revenue growth. In 2014/2015, the overall cost environment for food commodities is expected to be under pressure due to domestic and worldwide agricultural supply and demand imbalance and other macroeconomic factors.
"
786,KMB,"Higher commodity costs have lowered the gross margins of Procter & Gamble in both fiscal 2013 and 2014, while Kellogg has been facing increasing prices of raw materials and labor that have hurt the company’s margins since 2011. In 2014, Kellogg expects 3–4% commodity cost inflation in 2014, while PepsiCo expects higher inflation in 2014 than 2013.
"
787,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB  -  Free Report) expects total cost inflation in 2014 to be at the higher end of the previously announced range of $150 million to $250 million, which led the company narrow its guidance for full-year 2014 adjusted earnings, amid the difficult external environment.Declining Volumes
"
788,KMB,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) has also been witnessing negative beer volumes in the U.S. and Canada for quite some time. Since 2001, the premium beer segment in Canada has been gradually losing volume to the above premium and value segments, mainly due to an aging population and sluggish economy, while in the U.S., the volume declines can be partially attributed to relatively weak economic conditions. High rates of unemployment, declining labor participation rates and lower consumer confidence negatively affected volumes.
"
789,KMB,"Beverage companies like The Coca-Cola Co. (KO  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS) and PepsiCo have also been continuously posting sluggish results in the North American beverage business due to dwindling carbonated soft drinks volume, which is the biggest category of these beverage companies. The rise in health and wellness consciousness among consumers is the main reason for this weakness. Though these companies have lately delivered improved volumes, we hope to see sustained momentum in the volumes going forward.Bottom Line
"
790,KMB,"Though the consumer staples companies are fundamentally strong and regularly innovate products, invest in the emerging markets, and adopt cost savings and restructuring measures to revive margin-growth, we are uncertain about the economic environment in the near term, primarily due to limited consumer spending. However, we do believe that the scenario will improve soon.
"
791,KMB,"As seen above, there are plenty of concerns in the consumer staples industry. However, as regards investing in the space right now, are there opportunities for short-term investors?
"
792,KMB,"Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and the trend in this important sector of the economy.
"
793,KMB,"The global financial crisis of 2008 threatened the existence of a number of key industry players. But many companies in the consumer staples sector managed to survive on the back of effective cost-control initiatives, inorganic growth and share buybacks. A gradual recovery in the European economy last year and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar are also showing up in the results of these companies.
"
794,KMB,"For example, soda giants The Coca-Cola Company (KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (DPS) have outperformed expectations in the first half of 2014 driven by aggressive marketing initiatives, cost containment and improved productivity. A sequential improvement in beverage volumes in the second quarter of 2014 was the highlight of the quarter, which impressed investors. Buoyed by the strong performance in the reported quarter, Dr Pepper Snapple and Pepsi raised their earnings outlook for full-year 2014. We also believe that these companies will keep the momentum going in the second half.
"
795,KMB,"Food company McCormick & Co., Inc. (MKC) has also been benefiting from significant cost savings and share buybacks. The company has also raised its fiscal year earnings forecast on the back of solid fundamentals.
"
796,KMB,"Below, we discuss some of these key reasons and what investors in the consumer staple sector can look forward to seeing in the coming months.OPPORTUNITIES
"
797,KMB,"Innovations
"
798,KMB,"In a crowded and competitive space, consumer product companies need to regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions for their customers and to remain successful.
"
799,KMB,"Innovation has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report). P&G believes that consistent product innovation, supported by strong marketing and commercialization, will help deliver stronger results over the long term. Notably, the company spends around $14 billion on marketing annually.
"
800,KMB,"Cereal maker General Mills Inc (GIS) and global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co (TAP  -  Free Report) also has been launching new products to boost revenues. Meanwhile, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.’s (GMCR) newly launched Keurig 2.0 brewing machine is expected to counter competition as only its licensed K-Cups work in the model.Shifting Focus on Health and Wellness and ‘Good-for-You’ Products
"
801,KMB,"The companies are also shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness, rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressures.
"
802,KMB,"Most recently, on Sep 24, three of America’s largest soft drink makers -- The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Inc. and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. -- pledged to reduce calories in their beverages by 20% by 2025. Accordingly, the companies agreed to promote bottled water, no-or-lower-calorie beverages and smaller portion sizes to its consumers. Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) is also slowly shifting its product mix from colas to energy drinks and other non-carbonated beverages.
"
803,KMB,"Food company B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) and General Mills also plan to roll out more nutritious products in 2014. Natural and organic food/beverages maker The WhiteWave Foods Company (WWAV) and United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) have been benefiting from strong demand of natural/organic food products and expects to continue to gain from the natural/organic food revolution.
"
804,KMB,"Food and beverage companies are not the only ones trying to shift to healthier options. Tobacco companies like Lorillard Inc (LO), Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) and Reynolds American Inc (RAI) are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).Divestitures and Restructuring Initiatives
"
805,KMB,"Most consumer staples companies are divesting low-margin brands and implementing cost-reduction initiatives in order to boost profits. These initiatives help companies to reduce the effects of inflating commodity costs and other input costs, which have remained a drag on margins of most companies in this sector.
"
806,KMB,"The Procter & Gamble Company recently announced to divest 90 to 100 brands over the next two years whose sales and profits have been declining over the past three years in order to be a more focused company. Consumer giant Unilever NV (UN  -  Free Report) has divested many businesses since more than a year to concentrate on its core products portfolio.
"
807,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) has also decided to spin-off its health care business, which has been operating on low margins and has been witnessing decelerated sales growth since the last few quarters. In May, snacking giant Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ) announced a spin-off proposal for its coffee business to Netherlands-based coffee company, D.E Master Blenders 1753 in order to concentrate on its core snacks business.Expansion in Emerging Markets
"
808,KMB,"Besides costs saving initiatives, many consumer staples companies are shifting their focus to emerging markets to boost sales. Relative to the mature North American and European markets, emerging markets such as Brazil, India, China, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia are still untapped. Moreover, consumer spending in these markets is also increasing. The rising pool of middle class consumers in emerging markets represents a huge opportunity for these companies.
"
809,KMB,"Tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) has a significant presence in a large number of markets and enjoys robust growth in Asia, Indonesia, Pakistan, China, Philippines and Korea, while PepsiCo generates around 45% of its revenues outside the U.S. Cereal maker Kellogg Company (K) has tripled its emerging market business over the last decade. The Pringles acquisition in June 2012 consolidated its position in some of the fast-growing regions.Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships
"
810,KMB,"Many consumer staple companies are regularly carrying out acquisitions both domestically and internationally to expand their existing customer base and product lines into new markets. Some of them are also forming partnerships to take a lead in this challenging environment.
"
811,KMB,"In late-August, Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) completed its much talked about merger with packaged meat producer, The Hillshire Brands Company, thereby inking the biggest deal in the meat industry.
"
812,KMB,"Likewise, cigarette maker Reynolds American is close to acquiring the third largest U.S. cigarette company, Lorillard. While a combination of these two tobacco giants will possibly create one of the strongest global tobacco companies, regulators could object to the deal to protect the U.S. tobacco industry from becoming a duopoly.
"
813,KMB,"Food distributor Sysco Corp.’s (SYY  -  Free Report) merger with US Foods - the second largest player in the foodservice distribution industry – is also undergoing a regulatory review process by the Federal Trade Commission and may require Sysco and US Foods to divest assets to competitors. The merger can create one of the largest food companies in the country giving Sysco increased size and scale in this low-margin business and will also provide significant cost savings opportunities.
"
814,KMB,"A new wave of consolidation in the brewing industry is also expected in the near term. Speculations are rife that the world’s largest brewing company, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD) aka AB InBev, is seeking finances to buy the second largest, SABMiller plc (SBMRY).
"
815,KMB,"Keurig Green Mountain has also formed several strategic agreements with coffee and beverage companies like The Coca-Cola Co., Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (KRFT), The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report), Eight O’Clock and Dunkin’ Donuts by Dunkin' Brands Group Inc. (DNKN) to offer signature hot drinks of these companies in its K-cups and Vue packs.Bottom Line
"
816,KMB,"As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the consumer staples industry over the long haul. How about investing in this space right now?
"
817,KMB,"Check out our latest Consumer Staples Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.
"
818,KMB,"The dismal run of Consumer Staples continued in the first three months of 2014, after lackluster performances in 2013 and 2012. Continued pressure of a difficult consumer spending environment, foreign exchange headwinds and declining volumes were cited as the main reasons for this weakness.
"
819,KMB,"Middle-class consumers struggled to cope with rising gas prices, delayed income tax refunds and higher payroll taxes. In addition, difficult operating conditions in Europe and a slowdown in some Asian countries, like China, also weighed on the sector’s outlook. Consumer staple stocks have also underperformed the S&P 500 as a whole in the past year.
"
820,KMB,"Unlike discretionary items, demand for consumer staples remains relatively stable across the economic cycle. This perceived safety of the group’s business outlook is a major reason why consumer staple stocks tend to become more in demand in times of uncertainty.
"
821,KMB,"Consumer staple stocks are certainly not the only safe or defensive stocks, but they do benefit from heightened perception of risk in the marketplace. This is the reason why consumer staple stocks have done reasonably well year to date, with the average price of consumer staple stocks in the S&P 500 up +7.8% vs. a gain of +6.7% for the index as a whole in that time period.
"
822,KMB,"But consumer staple companies are witnessing sluggish growth in the developed markets due to market saturation, which along with stagnant disposable incomes and increased competitive activities have added to the companies’ woes. This is the reason why companies have been looking to faster growing emerging markets. That’s a good strategy in the long run, but the near-term outlook for many of these markets remains uncertain.
"
823,KMB,"The policy environment has changed rapidly from pricing and import controls in some emerging countries to political unrest in others that has temporally disrupted business operations. The ongoing currency fluctuations are also problematic, as a stronger dollar reduces the value of outside-U.S. sales and in turn limits growth. In fact, the market growth rate of developing countries slowed down in the last reported quarter.
"
824,KMB,"Lackluster top-line growth, lower volumes as well as currency headwinds have been a drag on the results of consumer staples companies in the first half of 2014 and have led many of them  to provide a weak outlook for 2014. In such a scenario, some of these companies managed to increase their earnings solely with the help of cost controls, inorganic growth and share buybacks, which signals a lack of real growth.
"
825,KMB,"Let us look into the initiatives undertaken by the companies to bolster their earnings in an uncertain and volatile macro environment.Innovations
"
826,KMB,"In a crowded and competitive space, consumer product companies need to regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions for their customers and to remain successful.
"
827,KMB,"In May, beverage giant PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) unveiled its new digital soda dispenser, Spire, which will allow customers to make up to 1,000 personalized carbonated beverages by selecting their favorite Pepsi brands. Spire is expected to directly compete with The Coca-Cola Company’s (KO) Freestyle fountain machines, available since 2009.
"
828,KMB,"While global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co (TAP  -  Free Report) plans to bring novelty in its brands in 2014 including Coors Light, Carling, Staropramen and Blue Moon to drive top-line growth, consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark Corp's (KMB) strives to upgrade its diaper and feminine care products in Brazil, China and Russia in 2014.
"
829,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark also expects to make further progress by expanding the adult care products and baby wipes internationally. It also has an innovative pipeline in North America that includes Huggies diapers and baby wipes, GoodNites youth pants, Depend briefs and Viva towels.Shifting Focus on Health and Wellness and ‘Good-for-You’ Products
"
830,KMB,"The companies are shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness, rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressures.
"
831,KMB,"Beverage companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are expanding their portfolio of non-carbonated drinks due to the increasing awareness about calorie intake and nutrition among consumers and declining demand for carbonated beverages. While Pepsi plans to launch lower calorie, naturally sweetened non-cola products in the U.S. this year, Coca-Cola launched Coca-Cola Life, a naturally sweetened mid-calorie cola in Chile and Argentina in 2013. In 2014, the company plans to expand Coca-Cola Life to other markets.
"
832,KMB,"Another beverage company Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS) has launched many low-calorie versions of its popular brands like Dr Pepper, 7UP, Sunkist Orange Soda, A&W Root Beer, Canada Dry Ginger Ale and RC Cola. Further, it is planning to test market for low-calorie version of Snapple straight up tea and naturally-sweetened, 60-calorie versions of some of its CSD brands (Dr Pepper, 7UP, and Canada Dry). Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) is also slowly shifting its product mix from colas to energy drinks and other non-carbonated beverages.
"
833,KMB,"Food company B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) and cereal maker General Mills Inc (GIS) also plan to roll out more nutritious products in 2014.
"
834,KMB,"Food and beverage companies are not the only ones trying to shift to healthier options. Tobacco companies are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).
"
835,KMB,"In the electronic cigarette industry, cigarette maker Lorillard Inc (LO) owns a leading position in the U.S. after it acquired e-cigarette brand blu e-Cigs in Apr 2012. Later, with the acquisition of U.K.’s e-cigarette brand SKYCIG on Oct 3, the company further strengthened its position in the market. Nu Mark, a subsidiary of Altria Group Inc (MO  -  Free Report), launched its e-cigarette brand -- MarkTen in Aug 2013. Moreover, the recent acquisition of the e-vapor business of Green Smoke Inc. in Apr 2014 enhanced its competitive position in the market.Reynolds American Inc’s (RAI) Vuse e-cigarette brand also received favorable response since its launch in 500 stores in Colorado in Jul 2013 and has gained significant market share. In May 2014, Reynolds announced that it is making a multi-million dollar investment to expand the distribution of Vuse nationwide in fiscal 2014. Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) has plans to foray into the e-cigarette business in late 2015.Cost Reduction and Restructuring Initiatives
"
836,KMB,"Most consumer staples companies are divesting low-margin brands, improving supply chains and implementing cost-reduction initiatives in order to boost profits. These initiatives help companies to reduce the effects of inflating commodity costs and other input costs, which have remained a drag on margins of most companies in this sector.
"
837,KMB,"Consumer giant Unilever NV (UN  -  Free Report) has been divesting its other businesses to concentrate on its core products such as detergents, foods, toiletries and specialty chemicals. Recently, the company sold its meat snacks business, the Royal pasta brand and its hair care brand. In November, it sold its Wish-Bone salad dressing business to Pinnacle Foods Inc (PF  -  Free Report). It also sold its Skippy peanut butter business in Jan 2013 to meat producer Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL), while in Aug 2012, its Bertolli and P.F. Chang's frozen meals brands were bought by ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG).
"
838,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark also decided to spin off its healthcare business in Nov 2013 to optimize its performance and offer flexibility to pursue its own value-creation opportunities. It also divested its low-margin Huggies diapers business in 2012 in all the European markets, except Italy, to reallocate its resources to more promising markets.
"
839,KMB,"Kimberly-Clark also has a cost savings program in place. Its FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere) targets to deliver at least $300 million of cost savings in 2014. Also, Kimberly-Clark anticipates operating profit to increase at least $100 million in 2014, owing to its pulp and tissue restructuring program, which was completed in 2012.
"
840,KMB,"In May, snacking giant Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) announced a spin-off proposal for its coffee business to Netherlands-based coffee company, D.E Master Blenders 1753 in order to concentrate on its core snacks business. Also, the company announced a $3.5 billion, three-year restructuring program to accelerate cost savings and improve productivity. The program is expected to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by 2018, which can be re-invested for further margin expansion. The coffee deal will also allow the company to lower its supply chain and overhead costs.
"
841,KMB,"Coca-Cola’s four-year productivity and reinvestment program, started in Feb 2012, is expected to generate incremental annualized savings of $550 to $600 million through 2015, while PepsiCo intends to generate $1 billion as productivity savings in 2014 under its current productivity plan. PepsiCo also announced a new 5-year restructuring plan last year that aims to generate annual productivity savings of $1 billion from 2015 to 2019. The savings are expected to come from improved efficiency through manufacturing automation and factory closures.
"
842,KMB,"General Mills’ Holistic Margin Management (HMM) program has already delivered $1.4 billion in cost savings from 2010-2013 and is expected to generate additional productivity savings of $3 billion by 2020.Expansion in Emerging Markets
"
843,KMB,"Besides cost-saving initiatives, many consumer staples companies are shifting their focus to emerging markets to boost sales. Relative to the mature North American and European markets, emerging markets such as Brazil, India, China, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia are still untapped. Moreover, consumer spending in these markets is also increasing. The rising pool of middle class consumers in emerging markets represents a huge opportunity for these companies.
"
844,KMB,"Tobacco company Philip Morris has a significant presence in a large number of markets. Asia remains a growth engine for the company as it enjoys robust growth in Indonesia, Pakistan, China, Philippines and Korea.
"
845,KMB,"PepsiCo generates around 40% of its revenues outside the U.S. For the past few years, growth in developing and emerging markets has been higher than the developed markets and the trend is expected to continue for the next 5-10 years.
"
846,KMB,"Cereal maker Kellogg Company (K) has tripled its emerging market business over the last decade. The Pringles acquisition in June 2012 consolidated its position in some of the fast-growing regions.
"
847,KMB,"However, increased exposure to emerging markets also brings along currency headwinds, which adversely impacted the top line of several consumer staples companies like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), Unilever and Kimberly-Clark in the recently reported quarter. Though these companies expect currency headwinds to persist in 2014, they still forecast strong sales gains in the emerging markets.Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships
"
848,KMB,"Many consumer staple companies are regularly carrying out acquisitions both domestically and internationally to expand their existing customer base and product lines into new markets. Some of them are also forming partnerships to take a lead in this challenging environment.
"
849,KMB,"Meat companies Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. (PPC  -  Free Report) and Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) have recently locked horns to win over packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands Company (HSH). The purchase of Hillshire by either Pilgrim’s Pride or Tyson would make them the industry leader in chicken production and would increase their margins in other categories as well, such as desserts and lunch meats. The purchase would also benefit the winning bidder’s economy of scale with more customers and shelf space.
"
850,KMB,"However, there is a holdup in the potential deal as Hillshire Brands is keen to buy Pinnacle Foods in order to strengthen its presence across the frozen, refrigerated and dry grocery categories. As of now, none of the deals have been approved but Hillshire has two alluring offers in the cards.
"
851,KMB,"Likewise, cigarette maker Reynolds American is close to acquiring the third largest U.S. cigarette company, Lorillard, as per media reports on May 22. While a combination of these two tobacco giants will possibly create one of the strongest global tobacco companies, regulators could object to the deal to protect the U.S. tobacco industry from becoming a duopoly.
"
852,KMB,"In Dec 2013, Altria had partnered with Philip Morris to combine their marketing powers to ramp up the distribution of their unconventional cigarettes. Altria and Philip Morris also decided to work together to gain market share as well as to improve the existing versions of the products.
"
853,KMB,"In early Feb, 2014, Coca-Cola entered into a partnership with Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (GMCR) in which the latter will exclusively make Coca-Cola branded pods to be used on its upcoming Keurig Cold at-home beverage system for cold beverages. The deal opens up an exciting new packaging format for Coca-Cola brands.
"
854,KMB,"In May 2014, Coca-Cola raised its stake in Keurig Green Mountain to 16% from 10%, as part of its 10-year partnership with Keurig to step into the world of cold beverages. This move makes Coca-Cola the largest shareholder of Keurig and will help the soft drink giant’s entry into the ‘single-serve at home’ format. For Keurig Green Mountain, this will be a great opportunity to leverage Coca Cola's branding and global presence.
"
855,KMB,"Also in May, Keurig Green Mountain announced a distribution partnership with consumer food company The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report). The deal is an extension of an agreement signed in 2010 for marketing, manufacturing and selling of Smucker brands in Keurig Green Mountain’s K-cups.
"
856,KMB,"In Dec 2013, food distributor Sysco Corp (SYY  -  Free Report) agreed to buy US Foods -- the second largest player in the foodservice distribution industry -- to create one of the largest food companies in the country. The merger will give Sysco increased size and scale in this low-margin business and will also provide significant cost savings opportunities.Zacks Industry Rank
"
857,KMB,"Consumer Staples is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank. https://www.zacks.com/zrank/about-zacks-industry-rank.php
"
858,KMB,"As a guideline, the outlook for industries in the top 1/3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and the bottom 1/3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
859,KMB,"The consumer staples sector is further sub-divided into the following industries at the expanded level (260 industry groups): Beverages – Alcohol, Beverages – Soft, Consumer Products – Miscellaneous Staples, Cosmetics & Toiletries, Food – Meat Products, Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified, Publishing – Newspapers, Soaps & Cleaning Preparations, Textile – Apparel and Tobacco.
"
860,KMB,"The Food – Meat Products industry is the best placed with a Zacks Industry Rank #4, which places it in the top 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups. It is followed by Consumer Products – Miscellaneous Staples and Publishing – Newspapers with Zacks Industry Ranks of #55 and #79, respectively.
"
861,KMB,"Industry groups like Soaps & Cleaning Preparations and Tobacco lie in the middle 1/3rd sharing a common Zacks Industry Rank #109. Textile – Apparel and Beverages – Soft are also placed in the middle 1/3rd.
"
862,KMB,"The rest of the sub-sectors, Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified, Cosmetics & Toiletries and Beverages – Alcohol are featured in the bottom one-third with respective Zacks Industry Ranks of #182, #195 and #212.
"
863,KMB,"Looking at the exact position of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the consumer staples space as a whole is neutral, as most of the companies suffered as a result of an uncertain macroeconomic environment in the first quarter of 2014. Though the companies have provided a soft outlook for 2014, they are hopeful that it will start recovering through 2015.Earnings Trends
"
864,KMB,"Earnings continued to be weak in the consumer staples sector in the first quarter of 2014 due to sluggish top-line growth, foreign currency headwinds and slowdown in the developing markets. We believe that the first quarter 2014 results remained soft in terms of earnings beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) and revenue.
"
865,KMB,"For the 94.1% companies in the consumer staples, which have already reported, the earnings ""beat ratio"" was 56.3%, while the revenue ""beat ratio"" was only 31.3%. Total earnings for this sector increased 2.2% in the reported quarter compared with growth of 3.5% registered in the fourth quarter. Total revenue declined 0.1% in the quarter as against growth of 1.2% in the previous quarter.
"
866,KMB,"This signals a difficult consumer spending environment for the rest of 2014, which is also reflected in the weak guidance provided by the companies.
"
867,KMB,"Per the consensus, earnings are projected to grow 5.1% in 2014, lower than 5.8% growth expected earlier. Revenues are expected to decline 6.5%, more than the prior estimate of a 6.0% decline in 2014.
"
868,KMB,"The consumer staples sector is expected to account for 6.7% share of the S&P 500 index earnings in 2014 compared with 6.5% in 2013. It accounts for 7.7% of the total market capitalization in 2014 so far compared with 7.2% in 2013.OPPORTUNITIES
"
869,KMB,"Despite macroeconomic headwinds, some of these companies have been able to deliver impressive results and have the potential to grow in the upcoming quarters.
"
870,KMB,"Beverage company Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) has a solid brand portfolio enhanced by regular acquisitions and innovations, impressive wine volume growth and effective cost management. Dr. Pepper Snapple, though suffering from weak volume trends due to ongoing pressure in the U.S. carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category, has delivered improved earnings results from the last two quarters with strong margins. The company also has an efficient cost management program and regularly returns cash to shareholders. Both Constellation Brands and Dr. Pepper Snapple hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
"
871,KMB,"Tyson Foods, despite holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects 3% to 4% top-line growth annually, backed by strong focus on its value-added chicken products, prepared foods and beef and pork segments. Tyson also expects demand for protein to go up in the near future.
"
872,KMB,"Natural and organic food/beverages maker The WhiteWave Foods Company (WWAV) has been benefiting from continued robust volume growth of plant-based almond beverages and non-dairy yogurts and growth in soy beverages. This Zacks Rank #1 company has also raised its forecast for 2014 as it expects to gain from the natural/organic food revolution.WEAKNESSES
"
873,KMB,"There were some companies hit hard by the challenging macro-economic environment, owing to lower consumer spending. In Europe, though signs of improvement are visible, the economic conditions are still challenging.
"
874,KMB,"Zacks Rank #3 companies like Procter & Gamble, Mondelez International and Kellogg are facing the brunt of sluggish sales, currency headwinds, slower developing market growth and poor volumes. U.S. fruit firm Chiquita Brands International Inc. (CQB), with a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) has been struggling with the supply and pricing of its raw products, while UK-based brewer Diageo Plc (DEO), holding a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) expects weak consumer demand and declining sales to pressurize its performance in the rest of the year.
"
875,KMB,"Though these companies are fundamentally strong and regularly innovate products, invest in the emerging markets, adopt cost savings and restructuring measures to revive margins, we are uncertain about the economic environment in 2014, primarily due to constricted consumer spending. However, we do believe that the scenario will improve soon.
"
876,KMB,"The operating backdrop for the consumer staples sector was more or less weak in 2013, as it was in 2012 due to a difficult consumer spending environment. Middle-class consumers have struggled to cope with rising gas prices, delayed income tax refunds and higher payroll taxes. In addition, difficult operating conditions in Europe and a slowdown in some Asian countries, like China, also weighed on the sector’s outlook. Consumer staple stocks have also underperformed the S&P 500 as a whole in the past one year.
"
877,KMB,"Unlike discretionary items, demand for consumer staples remain relatively stable across the economic cycle. But consumer staple companies are witnessing sluggish growth in the developed markets, due to market saturation, which along with consumers’ stagnant disposable incomes and increased competitive activities have added to the companies’ woes.
"
878,KMB,"Thus, many of the companies have been looking to the faster growing emerging markets. That’s a good strategy in the long run, but the near-term outlook for many of these markets remains uncertain. The ongoing emerging currency turmoil is particularly problematic, as a stronger dollar reduces the value of outside-U.S. sales and in turn limits growth.
"
879,KMB,"This uncertain macro environment is a big reason why many companies in the sector have lowered guidance for 2014. With top-line growth hard to come by, many companies have been focused on cost controls, acquisitions and share buybacks.Innovations
"
880,KMB,"In a crowded and competitive space, consumer product companies need to regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions for their customers and to remain successful.
"
881,KMB,"For the consumer product giant Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), innovation has been a strong tradition and the company has introduced many new products in most of its categories. While global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co (TAP  -  Free Report) plans to bring new variety in brands like Coors Light, Carling, Staropramen and Blue Moon to drive top line growth, cereal makers Kellogg Company (K) and General Mills Inc (GIS) plans to roll out more nutritious products in 2014. Consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark Corp's (KMB) innovation would include diaper and feminine care upgrades in Brazil, China and Russia. The company also has an innovative pipeline in North America that includes activity on Huggies diapers and baby wipes, the GoodNites youth pants, Depend briefs and Viva towels.Shifting Focus on Health and Wellness and ‘Good-for-You’ Products
"
882,KMB,"The companies are shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness and rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressures.
"
883,KMB,"Beverage companies like Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) are expanding their portfolio of non-carbonated drinks due to the increasing awareness about calorie intake and nutrition among consumers and declining demand for carbonated beverages. Though PepsiCo is not largely dependent on its underperforming and struggling carbonated beverages category, the company plans to introduce naturally sweetened, lower-calorie sodas like Pepsi Next to help revive sales in 2014. Beverage companies like Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS) and Coca-Cola are also working on the same lines to boost sales.
"
884,KMB,"PepsiCo is increasing its focus on healthier snacks, lower calorie beverages and non-carbonated beverages, which include Gatorade and Aquafina. Its rival, Coca-Cola is also expanding its portfolio of non-carbonated drinks, which include Powerade sports drinks, Smartwater brand and Minute Maid fruit juices, whereas Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) is also slowly shifting its product mix from colas to energy drinks and other non-carbonated beverages.
"
885,KMB,"Coffee giant Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is looking beyond its traditional coffee business and making an effort to bring more nutritional and healthy products to its menu. These include Evolution Fresh juices, Starbucks Refreshers energy drinks, wholesome Salad Bowls and Parfait Greek yogurt products.
"
886,KMB,"Food and beverage companies are not the only ones trying to shift to healthier options. Tobacco companies are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).
"
887,KMB,"In the electronic cigarette industry, cigarette maker Lorillard Inc (LO) owned a leading position in the U.S. after it acquired e-cigarette brand blu e-Cigs in Apr 2012. Later with the acquisition of U.K.’s e-cigarette brand SKYCIG on Oct 3, the company strengthened its position in the wide electronic cigarette market. Nu Mark, the subsidiary of Altria Group Inc (MO  -  Free Report) launched its e-cigarette brand -- MarkTen in Aug 2013, and now with the recent acquisition of e-vapor business of Green Smoke Inc, Altria has enhanced its competitive position in the market. Reynolds American Inc’s (RAI) Vuse e-cigarette brand also offers potential for long-term commercial success. Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) has plans to foray into the e-cigarette business in late 2015.Cost Reduction and Restructuring Initiatives
"
888,KMB,"Most consumer staples companies are divesting low-margin brands, improving supply chains and implementing cost-reduction initiatives in order to boost profits. These initiatives help companies to reduce the effects of inflating commodity costs and other input costs, which have remained a drag on margins of most companies in this sector.
"
889,KMB,"Coca-Cola started a four-year productivity and reinvestment program in Feb 2012, under which it plans to optimize its global supply chain, improve global marketing and innovation, achieve operating expense leverage, standardize information systems and integrate North American bottling and distribution operations acquired from Coca-Cola Enterprises. The program is expected to generate incremental annualized savings of $550 to $600 million through 2015.
"
890,KMB,"PepsiCo recorded $2 billion as productivity savings through 2013 under its current productivity plan and intends to generate another $1 billion in 2014. The company also announced a new 5-year restructuring plan in its fourth quarter fiscal 2013 that will aims to generate annual productivity savings of $1 billion from 2015 to 2019. The savings are expected to come from improved efficiency through manufacturing automation and factory closures.
"
891,KMB,"Through its cost savings program FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere), Kimberly-Clark generated cost savings of $310 million in 2013, and expects to continue the momentum going forward and targets delivering at least $300 million of cost savings in 2014. Kimberly-Clark’s pulp and tissue restructuring program is expected to increase operating profit by at least $100 million in 2014.
"
892,KMB,"Coffee maker Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc (GMCR) is also taking several steps to optimize its efficiency and reduce operational costs. It aims to deliver annual productivity and cost savings benefits in the range of $70 million to $100 million by 2015.
"
893,KMB,"Consumer giant Unilever NV (UN  -  Free Report), has also been divesting businesses to concentrate on its core businesses such as detergents, foods, toiletries, and specialty chemicals. On Jan 6, 2014, Unilever agreed to sell its Royal pasta brand to RFM Corporation, one of the biggest diversified food and beverage companies in the Philippines.
"
894,KMB,"Earlier in Nov, it has sold its Wish-Bone salad dressing business to Pinnacle Foods Inc (PF  -  Free Report). Besides, it has sold its Skippy peanut butter business in Jan 2013 to Austin, MN-based producer of branded food and meat, Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL), while in Aug 2012, ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG) bought its Bertolli and P.F. Chang's frozen meals brands.Expansion in Emerging Markets
"
895,KMB,"Besides costs saving initiatives, many consumer staples companies are shifting their focus to emerging markets to boost sales. Relative to the mature North American and European markets, emerging markets such as Brazil, India, China, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia are still untapped. Moreover, consumer spending in these markets is also increasing. Demand for convenient and branded packaged food tends to grow as middle-class consumers shift to urban living. Thus the rising pool of middle class consumers in emerging markets represents a huge opportunity for the companies.
"
896,KMB,"However, increased exposure to emerging markets also brings along currency headwinds, which adversely impacted several consumer staples companies like Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Kimberly-Clark in the recently reported quarter. Though these companies expect currency headwinds to persist in 2014, they still forecast strong sales gains in the emerging markets.
"
897,KMB,"PepsiCo has been performing well in the high-growth developing and emerging markets and about 35% of the total net revenue comes from these markets. Going forward, the company expects emerging markets revenues to increase in high single to low double-digits and also expects two-third of its revenues to come from the emerging markets. Tobacco company Philip Morris also has a significant presence in a large number of markets. Asia remains a growth engine for the company as it enjoys robust growth in Indonesia, Pakistan, China, Philippines and Korea.Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships
"
898,KMB,"Many consumer staple companies are also carrying out acquisitions both domestically and internationally to expand their existing customer base and product lines into new markets. On the other hand, many companies are forming partnership to take a lead in this challenging environment.
"
899,KMB,"For example in Dec 2013, food distributor Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report) agreed to buy US Foods to create one of the largest food companies in the country and improve efficiency of both the companies. After the completion of the deal (expected in the third quarter of fiscal 2014), Sysco will receive annual synergies of at least $600 million per annum over the next three or four years. Apart from this acquisition, the company acquired other 14 companies during fiscal 2013, which represents annualized sales in excess of $1 billion.
"
900,KMB,"Most recently, Green Mountain tied up with Coca-Cola Company on the development and introduction of Coca-Cola’s global brand portfolio for use in GMCR’s forthcoming Keurig Cold at-home beverage system. The deal will allow consumers to make the sodas and other drinks at home through GMCR’s Keurig Cold beverage system.
"
901,KMB,"Also, Coca-Cola is taking a 10% stake in Green Mountain for about $1.25 billion. This partnership will help GMCR to expand its cold beverage lineup, and it will also allow Coca-Cola to get into this growing segment too. However, it could pose a serious competition to the at-home carbonated beverage company SodaStream International Ltd (SODA  -  Free Report) in the near future.
"
902,KMB,"Altria has partnered with Philip Morris whereby the two cigarettes have combined their marketing powers to ramp up the distribution of their unconventional cigarettes. Under the deal, Philip Morris will market Altria’s MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and the latter will distribute two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the United States, as Philip Morris sells cigarettes outside U.S. Altria and Philip Morris have also decided to partner to work on gaining market share as well as improving existing versions for the products.Zacks Industry Rank
"
903,KMB,"Consumer Staples is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
904,KMB,"As a guideline, the outlook for industries in the top 1/3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and the bottom 1/3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
905,KMB,"The consumer staples sector is further sub-divided into the following industries at the expanded level (260 industry groups): Beverages – Alcohol, Beverages – Soft, Consumer Products – Miscellaneous Staples, Cosmetics & Toiletries, Food – Meat Products, Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified, Publishing – Newspapers, Soaps & Cleaning Preparations, Textile – Apparel and Tobacco.
"
906,KMB,"The ‘Publishing – Newspapers’ is the best placed among them with its Zacks Industry Rank #7, placing it into the top 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups. It is joined by 'Food – Meat Products and Textile – Apparel' with Zacks Industry Ranks of #55 and #78, respectively.
"
907,KMB,"Only ‘Beverages – Soft’ lies in the middle 1/3rd with a Zacks Industry Rank #106. However, all the other sub-sectors –- Consumer Products – Miscellaneous Staples, Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified, Beverages – Alcohol, Soaps & Cleaning Preparations, Tobacco and Cosmetics & Toiletries -- are featured in the bottom one-third of all Zacks industries with respective Zacks Industry Ranks of #198, #214, #217, #217, #228 and #249.
"
908,KMB,"Looking at the exact location of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the consumer staples space as a whole is negative, as many of the companies do not expect macroeconomic environment to improve drastically in 2014.Earnings Trends
"
909,KMB,"The consumer staples sector depicts weak earnings trends, with lackluster top-line growth and continued negative guidance. The fourth quarter 2013 results for the sector have been average in terms of earnings beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) and weak for revenue.
"
910,KMB,"Of the 78.8% companies reported under the consumer staples industry, the earnings ""beat ratio"" was 69.2%, while the revenue ""beat ratio"" was only 30.8%. Total earnings for this sector increased 2.4% until now, compared with a growth of 2.3% registered in the third quarter.
"
911,KMB,"Total revenue increased 1.7% in the quarter, better than the growth of 0.2% in the previous quarter. Though revenues have improved marginally, but the companies are expecting difficult consumer spending environment to persist in 2014, which has also reflected in companies’ weak guidance.
"
912,KMB,"The consensus earnings expectations for 2014 are projected to grow 5.8%, lower than 9.3% growth expected earlier. Revenues are expected to decline 6.0% in 2014, as against 4.1% growth in revenues expected earlier.
"
913,KMB,"The consumer staples sector is expected to account for only 6.5% share of the S&P 500 index earnings in 2013, while it accounts for 7.2% of the total market capitalization.
"
914,KMB,"For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our ‘Earnings Trends’ report.OPPORTUNITIES
"
915,KMB,"Despite macroeconomic headwinds, some of these companies have been able to deliver impressive results and have the potential to grow in the upcoming quarters. Beverage company Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) has a solid brand portfolio enhanced by regular acquisitions, impressive wine volume growth and effective cost management. Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) enjoys strong demand for its products, and benefits from operational improvements and positive pricing and thus holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
"
916,KMB,"Companies like Starbucks Corporation and The Hershey Co. (HSYTM) have solid growth potential. While Starbucks boasts solid organic growth, innovation program and productivity gains, Hershey, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) have solid innovation programs and international presence which helps them to maintain top line growth despite macroeconomic headwinds faced by the developed nations. Despite holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Starbucks raised its earnings expectations for 2014 on the back of first quarter earnings beat.WEAKNESSES
"
917,KMB,"There were some companies which were hit hard by the challenging macro-economic environment, owing to lower consumer spending. The persistently sluggish European economic conditions also remain an overhang.
"
918,KMB,"Zacks Rank #3 companies like Procter & Gamble, Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ) and Kellogg are facing the brunt of sluggish sales, currency headwinds, lower pricing and poor volumes. Beverage company Molson Coors, holding a Zacks Rank #4 (Strong Sell) is also a victim of weak consumer demand across many regions and declining sales volume.
"
919,KMB,"Though these companies are fundamentally strong and regularly innovates products, invest in the emerging markets, adopts measures like cost savings and restructuring to revive sales, we are uncertain about the economic environment in 2014, due to our budget-constrained consumers. However, we do believe that the scenario will improve soon.
"
920,KMB,"Companies Struggling to Meet Expectations
"
921,KMB,"The bulk of the 2013 Q4 earnings reports thus far have been from the Finance sector, but the reporting cycle ramps up materially this week, with almost 200 companies including 69 S&P 500 members reporting results. We will get results from a diverse group of bellwethers from industries, ranging from IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) to McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Proctor & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report).  
"
922,KMB,"The Finance centric results thus far indicate that companies are struggling to exceed the lowered earnings and expectations. The beat ratios, both for earnings and revenues, are weaker relative to what we would typically see at this stage of the reporting cycle. The growth picture looks good on surface, but a lot of that is due to easy comparisons.
"
923,KMB,"It is hard to take a definitive feel for the guidance picture at this stage as we haven’t seen that many earnings reports outside of the Finance sector and banks typically don’t provide guidance. But the overall trend among the few non-financial companies continues to be towards negative guidance. The hope has been that the recent uptrend economic fundamentals will start showing up in improved management commentary that will stem the persistent downward revision trend in earnings estimates. We will know more this week, but recent results from the likes of Intel (INTC), CSX Corp (CSX) and UPS don’t inspire much confidence on that front.Q3 Earnings Scorecard (as of Friday, 1/17/2013)
"
924,KMB,"Total earnings for the 52 S&P 500 members that have reported already are up +14.8% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 55.8% and a median surprise of +1.7%. Total revenues are up +3.4%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 51.9% and a median surprise of +0.9%. The earnings and revenue growth rates for these 52 companies are not materially different from what we have seen from them in recent quarters. But the beat ratios are on the weak side, as the chart below shows. 
"
925,KMB,"With results from almost 50% of the sector’s total market capitalization already known, Finance has the most representative sample of Q4 results of the major sectors. Total Finance sector are earnings are up +14.2% from the same period last year, with strong year-over-year gains at Bank of America (BAC) driving most of the gain.
"
926,KMB,"Excluding the $2.7 billion positive year-over-year swing in BAC’s total earnings, growth for the sector would be down +3%. But even including Bank of America’s hefty contribution, the Finance sector’s growth rates and beat ratios at this stage don’t compare favorably to what we have seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters.
"
927,KMB,"The insurance industry, the second largest in the Finance sector accounting for almost a quarter of its total earnings, will start reporting results this week as Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) reports numbers. Total earnings for the insurance industry are expected to be up +41.6%, as the year-earlier period was held down by Sandy-related expenses.The Composite Growth Picture
"
928,KMB,"The ‘composite’ picture for Q4, where we combine the results from the 52 companies that have reported already with the 448 still to come, is for growth rate of +7.1%. This reflects +1.5% higher revenues and net margin gains of about 50 basis points. Finance remains a big growth driver in Q4 – total earnings growth for the S&P 500 in Q4 drop to +3.4% once the sector is excluded.  
"
929,KMB,"Technology earnings are expected be flat in Q4, up only +1% after the +5.9% gain in Q3. We will have to wait a bit longer to get results from the sector’s growth leaders like Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) as the legacy players like IBM and Microsoft on the docket this week are unlikely to move the needle much.
"
930,KMB,"Lack of corporate capital spending has been an issue for the sector for some time and the consensus view is that we will see a turnaround on that front later this year. We haven’t heard anything yet that will add to our confidence in that expectation. But this optimistic view is a big contributor to the expected upturn in the Tech sector’s growth estimate later this year. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be up +9.4% this year and +10.9% in 2015, pronounced acceleration from the flat reading in 2013.Will Guidance Finally Turn Around?  
"
931,KMB,"For obvious reasons, the market is very interested management guidance for 2014. Companies typically provide guidance only for the following quarter, but they do tend to discuss their outlook their outlook for the coming year on the Q4 earnings calls. It will be interesting to see if management teams see any material improvement in the earnings picture this year along the lines of current consensus earnings expectations for 2014.
"
932,KMB,"Total earnings are expected to be up +9.3% in 2014, up from +4.6% growth in 2013, with most of the growth coming in the back half of the year.Monday-1/20
