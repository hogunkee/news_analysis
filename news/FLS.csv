1,FLS,"Machinery makers Dover Corp. (DOV), Flowserve (FLS), Parker Hannifin (PH) and DXP Enterprises (DXPE) rallied again Thursday on higher oil prices and hopes for more infrastructure spending. Stronger manufacturing data and a Parker Hannifin acquisition also may have helped.U.S. oil prices rose 3.3% to $51.06 on Thursday, after surging more than 9% Wednesday on OPEC's agreement to cut production. Higher prices should spur more exploration and drilling in U.S. shale and elsewhere, boosting machinery makers that have seen profit and sales decline.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale plays are big winners from the OPEC deal, but here's why U.S. oil production won't ramp up quickly.Dover, an industrial equipment maker than serves the oil and gas industry among others, climbed 4% to 75.53 at the close on the stock market today. That cleared a buy point of 75, with the stock trading at the highest levels since June 2015. Dover rose 4.1% on Wednesday.Flowserve, which makes flow control products, popped 5.1% to 49.85 Thursday afternoon after climbing more than 5% on Wednesday. Flowserve cleared resistance near 50 and is nearing a traditional buy point of 52.60.DXP Enterprises, which also makes flow control products, rose 3.8% to 34.97, rising intraday to the highest since August 2015. Shares rose 12.8% on Wednesday, clearing a 31.44 buy point.Parker Hannifin rose 3.3% to 143.47, hitting a record high after climbing more than 1% on Wednesday. Parker Hannifin will buy Claracor for $4.3 billion including debt, or $83 a share. Claracor will expand Parker Hannifin's product reach into filtration products. Claracor rose more than 17% to 82.58 by the closing bell.

2,FLS,"If you think that all members of Congress have to comply with all of the laws that we common citizens have to obey, think again. Over the years, Congress has passed thousands of bills and statutes that dictate how we should or shouldn't live our lives, but its members often fail to comply with these rules. In many instances, they actually exempt themselves from those burdensome constraints.To state an obvious example: Taking other people's money via force and spending it will land everyone but a politician in jail.Or, remember a few years ago when we found out that members of Congress weren't prohibited from trading stocks using nonpublic information? For most of us, this type of insider trading is a serious crime that carries a high probability of prison time for regular Joes. The outrage over this scandal led to a reform bill (the STOCK Act) to right the injustice. But then Congress eliminated a key reporting requirement for members of Congress, which gutted the law enough to guarantee more corruption going forward.Just to name another few:Congress is also exempt from investigatory subpoenas to obtain information for safety and health probes and from prosecution for retaliating against employees who report safety and health hazards. In an age of federal agencies' overreach and bogus prosecutions, I bet private businesses would like to be exempt too.Sarbanes-Oxley rules, which can throw chief executives of publicly traded companies in prison for up to 20 years and cost them $5 million in fines if they fail to certify their accounts, don't apply to Congress. The Department of Defense has failed to comply with auditing requirements for several decades without consequences.In other examples, we see that it takes decades for Congress to subject itself to laws that apply to us. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 established overtime pay, record keeping and youth employment standards, affecting full-time and part-time workers. For all its good intentions, many companies consider this act to be the bane of their existence, the source of a constant stream of regulations and enormous costs with small benefits. Congress, in spite of its large workforce, exempted itself from it.That lasted until 1995 -- almost 60 years later -- when the House and Senate finally passed the Congressional Accountability Act, requiring that Congress comply with many of the standards established under the FLS Act. Among other things, the act applied many labor and workplace safety and civil rights statutes to the legislative branch, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the American with Disabilities Act of 1990.But don't let this fool you. Just because it's the law doesn't mean that Congress actually complies with it. Consider overtime rules. Again, under the CAA of 1995, Congress has to comply with the rules, but in order to do so, both the House and the Senate must issue a resolution that they will adopt the rules. In 1996, all those procedural boxes were checked, and Congress subjected itself to overtime pay rules. It never complied again.In August 2004, the Department of Labor issued new and costly overtime pay regulations -- which once again changed the standard compensation levels and overtime exemptions for full-time employees, from a weekly salary level of $155 (the threshold varies based on duties) to a new standard of $455. However, Congress has not yet adopted the regulations to replace the 1996 overtime pay standards with the updated ones.And what do you think is going to happen now that the DOL changed the overtime pay rule to apply to full-time employees making up to $913 a week? Based on their past behaviors, I predict that members of Congress will exempt themselves again, even though many lawmakers forcefully lobbied for the rule to be pushed down the private sector's throat.As Competitive Enterprise Institute's Bill Frezza noted when he heard of the exemption, ""job-killing red tape for thee. Exemption for me.""In Federalist No. 57, James Madison wrote that the House of Representatives ""can make no law which will not have its full operation on themselves and their friends, as well as on the great mass of the society."" How far we have fallen.

3,FLS,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance Report
"
4,FLS,"Sophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
5,FLS,"This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.
"
6,FLS,"Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.
"
7,FLS,"The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.
"
8,FLS,"Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.
"
9,FLS,"IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?
"
10,FLS,"Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.
"
11,FLS,"IBD: How does each segment differ?
"
12,FLS,"Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.
"
13,FLS,"The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.
"
14,FLS,"The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:
"
15,FLS,"First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.
"
16,FLS,"Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.
"
17,FLS,"Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.
"
18,FLS,"This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.
"
19,FLS,"The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.
"
20,FLS,"IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.
"
21,FLS,"Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.
"
22,FLS,"Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).
"
23,FLS,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.
"
24,FLS,"IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.
"
25,FLS,"Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).
"
26,FLS,"IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.
"
27,FLS,"Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.
"
28,FLS,"In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.
"
29,FLS,"IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?
"
30,FLS,"Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.
"
31,FLS,"And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).
"
32,FLS,"This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.
"
33,FLS,"I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.
"
34,FLS,"IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?
"
35,FLS,"Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.
"
36,FLS,"I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.
"
37,FLS,"We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.
"
38,FLS,"Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.
"
39,FLS,"But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.
"
40,FLS,"Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.
"
41,FLS,"Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.
"
42,FLS,"IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?
"
43,FLS,"Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.
"
44,FLS,"The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.
"
45,FLS,"The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.
"
46,FLS,"They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.
"
47,FLS,"I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.
"
48,FLS,"We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.
"
49,FLS,"IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?
"
50,FLS,"Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.
"
51,FLS,"They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.
"
52,FLS,"IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?
"
53,FLS,"Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.
"
54,FLS,"IBD: What's your Visa thesis?
"
55,FLS,"Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.
"
56,FLS,"In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.
"
57,FLS,"A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.
"
58,FLS,"Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.
"
59,FLS,"IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?
"
60,FLS,"Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.
"
61,FLS,"Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.
"
62,FLS,"Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).
"
63,FLS,"They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).
"
64,FLS,"Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.
"
65,FLS,"There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.
"
66,FLS,"And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.
"
67,FLS,"IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?
"
68,FLS,"Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.
"
69,FLS,"Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.
"
70,FLS,"IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?
"
71,FLS,"Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.
"
72,FLS,"They've got a powerful pipeline.
"
73,FLS,"IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?
"
74,FLS,"Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.
"
75,FLS,"They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.
"
76,FLS,"Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance ReportSophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T.

77,FLS,"Second-quarter earnings season is in full effect and the results have been pretty darn good.Of course, the naysayers were a vocal bunch a few weeks ago, saying that earnings would generally be weak, but that hasn't been the case at all. Some misses in the large-cap space, yes, but scads of small- and midcap names continue to deliver the goods.Flowserve (FLS), a maker of industrial equipment, reported earnings before the open Thursday. It's another example of a stock with strong fundamentals and technicals with a consistent track record of dividend growth.The company's product portfolio includes pumps, valves and seals. It also provides aftermarket equipment services to the oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water-management industries.Flowserve split its shares 3-for-1 in late June, which cut its quarterly dividend from 42 cents down to 14 cents, giving it an annual yield of 1%.Early Wednesday, the company topped earnings and sales expectations. Profit and sales growth accelerated from the first quarter, with earnings up 24% from a year ago to 84 cents a share. Sales rose 5% to $1.24 billion. Earnings benefited from continued growth in bookings and improving margins.Sales at Flowserve's Engineered Product Division rose 7% to $625 million thanks to increased equipment sales in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Sales at its Flow Control Division rose 2% to $384 million. Bookings rose nearly 9% to $447 million, helped by strong demand from the oil and gas and chemical industries.Price and volume trends in Flowserve continue to look good. The stock is carving a base-on-base pattern with a buy point of 57.86.
"
78,FLS,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Flowserve Corporation (FLS  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 12.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is FLS due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Flowserve Q1 Earnings In Line, Sales Beat EstimatesFlowserve reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 27 cents per share, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On a year-over-year basis, the bottom-line figure improved 8% backed by robust sales growth.The company’s earnings per share came in at 12 cents on a reported basis, which included pre-tax adjusted items of $25 million.Quarter in DetailIn the quarter under review, sales increased 6.2% year over year to $920 million. The reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $884 million. Solid growth in sales across the company’s two of the three segments drove the overall top line.The company’s bookings totaled $929 million, down 3% year over year. The downside can be attributed to divested businesses. After-market bookings amounted to $482 million, up 5.4%.Adjusted gross margin was 30.3% in the first quarter compared with 31.5% in the year-ago quarter. Operating income in the reported quarter increased to $62.4 million from $60.9 million in the first-quarter 2017.

79,FLS,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season Flowserve Corporation (FLS  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Flowserve is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for FLS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 28 cents per share for FLS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for FLS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.10% heading into earnings season.Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that FLS has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Flowserve, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

80,FLS,"Flowserve Corporation (FLS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 10, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings came in at 50 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.9%. Overall, Flowserve has an average negative surprise of 5% for the trailing four quarters, marked by two earnings beats for as many misses.However, we expect Flowserve to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Flowserve is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock has the right combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Flowserve has an Earnings ESP of +1.10% as the Most Accurate estimate of 28 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation Quote Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving Better-Than-Expected ResultsFlowserve is well poised for growth, courtesy of its leading position in the flow control industry, comprehensive product portfolio, wide global footprint and strong customer relationships. Additionally, the company has an installed base with over 2 million pumps worldwide. Its investments in distribution channel and other industrial opportunities as well as new product development and enhancement will also continue to be the strongest growth drivers.In the to-be-reported quarter, we believe the company’s top line will benefit from modest natural gas investments in North America and Asia. Furthermore, impressive prospects of the U.S. chemical market business are likely to emerge as a key growth driver for the company. Also, the company has been witnessing some stabilization in core aftermarket activities, including parts, services and repairs, which is expected to act as a major growth catalyst.Meanwhile, Flowserve’s short- and long-term strategic plans that include manufacturing optimization via transfer of activities from high-cost regions to lower-cost facilities have enabled it to reduce manufacturing costs and enhance long-term efficiency. For instance, the company’s full-annualized program is expected to result in $230 million savings in 2018.The company’s focus on improving on-time delivery, reducing backlog, enhancing the sales process and leveraging on the supplier relationships are also anticipated to boost revenues in the first quarter.Given this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from the company’s Engineered Product Division segment remains high at $429 million, reflecting growth of 1.7% year over year. Revenues from Industrial Product Division segment are also expected to chart decent growth, with an estimate of $181 million compared with $178 million in the prior-year quarter. This apart, the company’s restructuring efforts, undertaken over the past few quarters, are likely to add value to its upcoming results.However, over the past few quarters, pricing pressure has proved to be a major drag on the company’s top-line performance. In addition, loss of sales leverage and related under-absorption has been hurting the company’s profitability.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Sun Hydraulics Corporation (SNHY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.55% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Over the past few quarters, loss of sales leverage and related under-absorption has been hurting the company’s profitability. Also, upstream oil and gas market uncertainty, which has been bothering the company, has currently spread to midstream as well as downstream markets adding to its woes.Additionally, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is facing dearth of middle and larger sized projects opportunities along with cost reduction and project delivery postponement pressures by customers. Hence, this remains a matter of concern for Flowserve going forward.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include Harsco Corporation (HSC  -  Free Report), Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) and Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report).

83,FLS,"Flowserve Corporation (FLS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15, after the closing bell.The company beat earnings by 8.8% in the last quarter. Overall, Flowserve has an average negative surprise of 1.4% for the trailing four quarters, marked by three beats and a huge miss.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIn the third quarter, Flowserve’s pervasive revenue decline was offset by lower operating expenses, which also ensured an earnings beat. The company’s sales contracted across its segments, with bookings declining year over year. Additionally, cautious spending by clients, loss of sales leverage and related under-absorption has been hurting the company’s profits. Since the company did not project any major turnaround in the adverse geopolitical environment and weak end markets, the aforementioned factors are likely to dent the upcoming quarterly results.The company has been witnessing persistent weakness across its segments, with the magnitude of the decline to be somewhat lower than in the previous quarters. Flowserve’s Flow Control Division (FCD), which witnessed a year-over-year decline of 3.9% in revenues in the prior quarter, is likely to be soft in the upcoming results. Revenues are anticipated to be affected by lower original equipment sales in the Americas and Africa.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the FCD segment revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $304 million, reflecting a fall of 2.9% year over year.Likewise, sales in its Engineered Product Division are expected to decline 2.7% year over year to $533 million in the upcoming results. Revenues in the segment are likely to be marred by soft customer original equipment sales in key end markets. Industrial Product Division sales are expected to be hurt by low original equipment sales and persistent operation issues. We expect segment sales to inch down 1.4% year over year to $210 million.Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation Quote However, the company has been witnessing some stabilization in core aftermarket activities, which include parts, services and repairs, as markets return to regular maintenance schedules.We believe that the company’s top line in the fourth quarter might benefit slightly from modest natural gas investments in North America and Asia. Also, higher bidding activity in the desalination space is expected to bolster sales. This apart, the company’s restructuring initiatives over the past few quarters are likely to prove conducive to fourth-quarter results.Currently, the company is pursuing a $400-million multi-year investment plan, which is expected to result in $195 million of savings in 2017. Further, Flowserve is planning to trim workforce by 15-20% compared with the 2015 levels and shift manufacturing to low-cost regions. We believe that savings from these restructuring activities will boost profits in the upcoming quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Flowserve is likely to beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at -0.39%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Flowserve has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:The Boston Beer Company, Inc.

84,FLS,"We expect Flowserve Corporation (FLS  -  Free Report) to beat on earnings in third-quarter 2017. The company is scheduled to release its results on Nov 1, after the closing bell.The company missed earnings by 50% in the last reported quarter. Overall, Flowserve has an average negative surprise of 7.3% for the trailing four quarters, marked by two earnings beats for as many misses.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsFlowserve had a difficult second quarter, as its earnings missed by half, dragged by precipitous top-line decline, owing to macroeconomic volatility and foreign currency headwinds. Since the company did not anticipate any major turnaround in the adverse geopolitical environment and weak end markets, we expect these factors to cast a shadow on the upcoming quarterly results as well.The company has been witnessing acute weakness across its segments. Flowserve’s Flow Control Division (FCD), which witnessed 13.2% year-over-year decline in revenues in the prior quarter, will likely be weak in the coming results as well, owing in part to lower original equipment sales in the Americas and Africa.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the FCD segment revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $272 million, reflecting dismal contraction of 16% year over year.Likewise, its Engineered Product Division is projected to decline 9.4% year over year to $424 million in the upcoming results, marred by soft customer original equipment sales in key end markets. Industrial Product Division sales will also likely be hurt by low original equipment sales and we expect the segment sales to go down 11.7% year over year to $188 million.Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation QuoteHowever, the company has been witnessing some stabilization in core aftermarket activities concerning parts, services and repairs as markets return to regular maintenance schedules.We believe the company’s top line in the third quarter might benefit slightly from modest natural gas investments in North America and Asia.

Further, Flowserve is planning to trim its workforce by 15-20% as compared to the 2015 levels, as well as shift manufacturing to lower cost regions. We believe savings from these restructuring activities will boost profits in the upcoming quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Flowserve will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

85,FLS,"Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report) has been grappling with precipitous top-line decline, dragged by macroeconomic volatility and foreign currency headwinds.Sluggish progress of the Industrial Product Division turnaround, customer delays in product pick-up and significantly high tax rate are some of the factors that have been plaguing the company’s profits in recent times. Flowserve also gave a disappointing guidance for 2017 in its last reported quarterly results.Investors are abandoning the stock in droves, in light of the miserable guidance and the all-pervasive weakness. The stock has declined 6.9% in the past six months, much worse than the industry’s gain of 16.9%.With respect to segments, the company’s Engineered Product Division revenues have been suffering due to negative currency translation effects, along with lower original equipment sales in the Americas and Africa. The Flow Control Division has also been hit by currency headwinds and soft customer original equipment sales in the key end markets, in recent times.Concurrent with the earnings report, Flowserve reduced its 2017 guidance and now expects adjusted earnings per share guidance to lie in the band of $1.30-$1.50 (previous guidance: $1.55-$1.85). It estimates revenues to decline in the range of 6-10%.Furthermore, the company does not anticipate any major turnaround in the current geopolitical environment and end markets for 2017. Factors including currency rates, commodity prices, expected bookings and market volatility are likely to put pressure on both the top- and bottom-line performances for this year.Not surprisingly, the analyst community has also been distinctly bearish on the stock in recent times. Flowserve’s earnings estimates continued to moved south sharply over the past 60 days, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings plunging from $1.52 to $1.38, on the back of eight downward estimate revisions versus none upward.Flowserve Corporation Price and Consensus Flowserve Corporation Price and Consensus | Flowserve Corporation QuoteUndoubtedly, Flowserve has had a choppy first half of the year. Its biggest challenge comes in the form of capital spending constraints and aftermarket push outs. In the recent past, the company’s operations suffered from project delays, rolling maintenance deferrals, and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance. We believe Flowserve will continue to witness challenging times in the second half of the year.On the other hand, relative stability of oil at around the level of $45-$50 over the past couple of quarters is a major positive for the company. It appears that Flowserve’s orders are finally showing signs of bottoming out, signaling brighter days ahead. We believe stabilization in core aftermarket activities bodes well for long-term growth of the company, going forward.Nevertheless, there is no denying the fact that this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s waning top-line performance remains a major concern.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc. (B  -  Free Report), Altra Industrial Motion Corp. (AIMC  -  Free Report) and Graco Inc. (GGG  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

86,FLS,"Flowserve Corp (FLS  -  Free Report) recently posted a big miss on top and on bottom.  The company reported $0.22 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was looking for $0.44 and that translates into a negative earnings surprise of 50%.  The company also missed on the top line as well, with revenues of $877M when $923M were expected.  The company also lowered guidance and that has sent earnings estimates lower and for that reason it is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.DescriptionFlowserve Corporation is one of the world's leading providers of industrial flow management services.

88,FLS,"Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report) has been facing numerous headwinds in recent times, as evidenced by its dismal second-quarter 2017 results. Precipitous top-line decline, owing to macroeconomic volatility as well as foreign currency headwinds dragged profits for the company.The figures were hurt by sluggish progress of the Industrial Product Division turnaround, customer delays in product pick-up and significantly high tax rate. In fact, the company’s adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whopping 50%. Flowserve also gave a disappointing guidance for 2017.Investors are abandoning the stock in droves, in light of the miserable guidance and the all-pervasive weakness. The stock has declined 14.5% in the past month, much worse than the industry’s decline of 2.1%.With respect to segments, its Engineered Product Division revenues were down 16.6% year over year, dragged by negative currency translation effects, along with lower original equipment sales in the Americas and Africa, which crippled the sales of this segment.Sales at the Flow Control Division also declined 13.2% year over year, hit by currency headwinds and soft customer original equipment sales in the key end markets.Moreover, Industrial Product Division sales were down 10.8% year over year.Concurrent with the earnings report, Flowserve reduced its 2017 guidance and now expects adjusted earnings per share guidance to lie in the band of $1.30-$1.50 (previous guidance: $1.55-$1.85). It estimates revenues to decline in the range of 6-10%.Furthermore, the company does not anticipate any major turnaround in the current geopolitical environment and end markets for 2017. Factors including currency rates, commodity prices, expected bookings and market volatility are likely to put pressure on both the top- and bottom-line performances for this year.Not surprisingly, the analyst community has also been distinctly bearish on the stock in recent times. Flowserve’s earnings estimates have moved south sharply in the past 30 days, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings plunging from $1.79 to $1.41, on the back of eight downward estimate revisions versus none upward.Flowserve Corporation Price and Consensus Flowserve Corporation Price and Consensus | Flowserve Corporation QuoteUndoubtedly, Flowserve has had a choppy first half of the year. Its biggest challenge comes in the form of capital spending constraints and aftermarket push outs. In the recent past, the company’s operations suffered from project delays, rolling maintenance deferrals, and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance. We believe Flowserve will continue to witness challenging times in the second half of the year.On the other hand, relative stability of oil at around the level of $45-$50 over the past couple of quarters is a major positive for the company. It appears that Flowserve’s orders are finally showing signs of bottoming out, signaling brighter days ahead. We believe stabilization in core aftermarket activities bodes well for long-term growth of the company, moving ahead.Other key strengths include strong operational model, solid productivity, and considerable aftermarket content and geographical diversity. In particular, the diligent restructuring efforts are starting to manifest themselves in substantial savings. Despite these positives, there is no denying the fact that this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s waning top-line performance remains a major concern.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc.

89,FLS,"Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report) reversed its recent earnings beat trend as its second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 22 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents by half.On a reported basis, the company’s earnings per share plunged 31.3% to 32 cents on a year-over-year basis. Precipitous top-line decline, owing to macroeconomic volatility, as well as foreign currency headwinds, proved to be major drags for the bottom line.Quarter in DetailRevenues fell 14.6% year over year to $877.1 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $926 million. Sluggish progress of the Industrial Product Division turnaround, customer delays in product pick-up, and significantly high tax rate, proved to be a drag on the revenues. Also, foreign currency headwinds eroded sales by $10 million.The company’s bookings totaled $971 million in second-quarter 2017, up 0.8% year over year at constant currency (cc). After-market bookings totaled $458 million and were down 3.7% at cc, while original equipment bookings were up 5.15% at cc to $514 million. Growth in bookings came on the back of modest recovery in the oil & gas industry, and higher original equipment bookings.Operating income of the company came in at $126.1 million, up 34.5% from the year-ago period. Foreign currency headwinds and lower sales acted as major dampeners for operating income performance. Also, adjusted gross margin expanded 360 bps to 31.5%.Segmental ResultsEngineered Product Division revenues were down 16.6% year over year to $427.7 million in the quarter. Negative currency translation effects, along with lower original equipment sales in the Americas and Africa, crippled the sales of this segment. However, bookings were almost flat year over year at $465.1 million.Sales at the Flow Control Division declined 13.2% year over year to $275.4 million, marred by currency headwinds and soft customer original equipment sales in key end markets.Bookings of this segment totaled $316.2 million, up 1.1% year over year.Moreover, Industrial Product Division sales were down 10.8% year over year to $191.8 million. Foreign currency headwinds, along with low original equipment sales, resulted in the decline across all main geographies. Furthermore, bookings totaled $213.3 million, up 0.5% year over year.Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation QuoteRestructuring InitiativesCurrently, the company is following its $400 million multi-year investment, which is anticipated to result in savings of $195 million in 2017. In 2018, savings from the full annualized program are projected at $230 million. These investments are aimed at streamlining management structure, reducing manufacturing costs and implementing cost-saving measures for the overall optimization of the cost structure.The company also expects to trim its workforce by 15–20%, and manufacturing footprint by 30% compared with the 2015 level, as well as shift manufacturing to lower cost regions, under this $400 million worth of restructuring initiative. Flowserve will announce all facility closures by year-end 2017.In relation to the restructuring efforts, Flowserve spent about $32 million in first-quarter 2017, which, in turn, led to incremental savings of $21 million. It remains optimistic about completing the $400-million program in 2017.Also, under the restructuring program, Flowserve completed the divestiture of the Gestra AG business unit to Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc for €186 million ($198.4 million). The sale is part of Flowserve’s broader strategy to improve focus on core business, and optimize its product portfolio and manufacturing footprint.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowFlowserve ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $505.2 million compared with $367.2 million as of Dec 31, 2016. On Jun 30, 2017, the company’s long-term debt totaled $1,501 million, up from $1,485.3 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Flowserve’s net cash flow provided by operating activities came in at $46.6 million at the end Jun 30, 2017, up significantly from $10.7 million recorded in the prior-year period.2017 OutlookFlowserve reduced its 2017 guidance and now expects adjusted earnings per share guidance to lie in the band of $1.30–$1.50 (previous guidance: $1.55–$1.85). It estimates revenues to decline in the range of 6–10%.The company does not anticipate any major turnaround in the current geopolitical environment and end markets for 2017. Factors including currency rates, commodity prices, expected bookings and market volatility are likely to put pressure on both the top- and bottom-line performances for this year. However, in light of the continued stability of the company’s bookings and modest sequential improvement in operations, Flowserve anticipates its performance to improve in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.To ConcludeFlowserve had a choppy first half of the year. Its biggest challenge comes in the form of capital spending constraints and aftermarket push outs. In the recent past, the company’s operations have suffered from project delays, rolling maintenance deferrals, and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance. We believe Flowserve will continue to witness challenging times in the second half of the year.On the other hand, relative stability of oil at around the level of $45–$50 over the past couple of quarters is a major positive for the company. It appears that Flowserve’s orders are finally showing signs of bottoming out, signaling brighter days ahead. Going forward, we believe stabilization in core aftermarket activities bode well for long-term growth of the company.Other key strengths include strong operational model, solid productivity, and considerable aftermarket content and geographical diversity. In particular, the diligent restructuring efforts are starting to manifest themselves in substantial savings.

90,FLS,"The U.S. market showed strength subsequent to the election of President Trump, primarily factoring in his promised pro-growth policies. However, the momentum has stalled following uncertainties looming over policy enactment and implementation.As far the Industrial Products companies are concerned, the Trump government’s infrastructure improvement plan, if implemented, will boost demand. Also, the sector is seeing improving export demand for its products from foreign nations.Since the beginning of the year, industrial products stocks have been strong performers, with the sector gaining roughly 9.4%. Among the S&P 500 members, the top five industrial machinery gainers include Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report), Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report), Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report). The poor performers include Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Company (EMR  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report).Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.Industrial Machinery - Nation-Wise DescriptionThe United States: The country’s industrial production increased at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities.Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 5.7% in the first half of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction, mining, industrial, material handling and other machineries. Also, the job market showed strength, with the recent data indicating 209,000 new job additions in July. In second-quarter 2017, new job additions averaged 194,333 per month. Unemployment rate declined from 4.4% in June to 4.3% in July.Citing improvement in economic activities, the Federal Reserve raised its interest rates in June and indicated further rate hikes ahead. This, in turn, will make capital investments more expensive and hence might weigh on businesses for industrial products makers.     Per its Jul 2017 report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) trimmed its growth projections for the U.S. economy by 20 basis points (bps) to 2.1% for 2017 and 40 bps to 2.1% for 2018 primarily on account of uncertainties surrounding the implementation of governmental policies.Japan: According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months) decreased 1.4% in first-quarter 2017 while fell nearly 3.1% in April and 3.6% in May.  In second-quarter 2017, total machinery order will likely decline 0.9% while core orders are expected to fall 5.9%. Orders from manufacturing clients will likely fall 1.1% while that from government clients might decline 13.6%.The country’s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels, unfavorable exchange rates, aging population and a huge public debt. Also, the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3% rise in national sales tax in Apr 2015.In addition, the country is facing weak economic conditions externally. However, efforts to improve wages and hence, demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country’s favor in the quarters ahead.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 10 bps to 1.3% for 2017 while it remained stable at 0.6% for 2018.China: China’s GDP grew 6.9% from the year-earlier period in the second quarter, coming in better than expected. Improvements in infrastructure investment, retail sales and higher exports due to healthy global economy have worked in its favor. In March, the government announced its plan to spend $2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020. However, tiff with the U.S. economy over trade relationships might dent its growth momentum.The country’s industrial production increased 7.6% year over year in June on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors, offset by weakness in the mining sector. Industrial production in both May and April grew 6.5%.For 2017, the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6.7% in 2017 and 6.4% in 2018.India: The country’s industrial production decelerated to 1.7% in May 2017, having expanded 2.8% in the previous month. Production suffered from lower rise in manufacturing output and contractions in mining and quarrying outputs.Expectations of a strong demand, improved policies and better monsoon conditions are the factors that will influence the country’s growth, going forward. The government is making concerted efforts to turn the country into a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world. Apart from boosting the foreign capital inflow in the country, these strategies will improve the domestic job market as well as demand for industrial products. The recent interest rate cut by the central bank, driven by prevailing low inflation rate in the country, will allow accessibility to cheap loans.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 7.2% in 2017 and 7.7% in 2018.Brazil: Political uncertainties continue to loom large over Brazil’s economy and are mainly responsible for the countries’ below investment grade ratings. Private investments are low while inadequate infrastructure and still high unemployment rate are making the economy more lackluster.Strong efforts are being made to revive the economy. In July this year, interest rate was trimmed 100 bps by the countries’ Central Bank, this being its seventh consecutive rate cut since Oct 2016. Also, inflation has eased over the past few months. Per the data available, industrial production in the country was flat in Jun 2017 compared with the previous month while showed expansion of 1.2% in May and 1.3% in April.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 0.3% in 2017, reflecting a 10 bps increase from the previous forecast. However, growth projection for 2018 has been cut 40 bps to 1.3%.Eurozone: Per the available data, industrial production in the Eurozone improved 1.3% in May from the prior month and rose 4% year over year. In April, industrial production inched up 0.3% from the previous month. The unemployment rate was 9.1% in June versus 9.2% in the previous month.The IMF predicts output growth in Euro Area to be 1.9% in 2017, up 20 bps from the previous forecasts and grow 1.7% in 2018.Industry RankingMachinery stocks are broadly grouped under the Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry. As a rule, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank).The machinery industry comprises stocks that primarily deals with manufacturing and supplying farm equipments (currently such stocks collectively carry Zacks Industry Rank of 19), construction and mining equipment (ranked 19), industrial electronics (ranked 96), electrical products (ranked 117), thermal products (ranked 53), material handling products (ranked 53), printing equipment for industrial use (ranked 117) and industrial tools and equipment, and providing related services are collectively ranked 117.Going by the Zacks rule, we see that machinery sub-industries fall in the top half. These sub-industries can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorPer the Earnings Preview dated Aug 4, the earnings season has unfolded well. As of that date, roughly 420 of S&P 500 companies reported results for the April-June quarter, with 74.3% beating earnings estimates and 68.3% surpassing revenue projections.Of Industrial Products stocks, roughly 91.7% reported results til Aug 4. Earnings beat recorded as of that date was 68.2% while revenue beat was 54.5%.In the quarter, the market is anticipated to perform well, witnessing earnings and sales growth of 10% and 5.1%, respectively over the year-ago quarter. Seeing the results so far and the favorable operating conditions, we believe that the overall performance of the Industrial Products sector will be encouraging.   ConclusionThe IMF anticipates the world economy to grow 3.5% in 2017. It expects 2% rise in advanced economies and 4.6% growth in emerging nations. Global output is projected to increase 3.6% in 2018, including 1.9% growth for advanced nations and 4.8% improvement for emerging countries.We believe that policies encouraging better trade relations, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand might accelerate growth in the U.S. economy. This, in turn, will prove beneficial for industrial machinery stocks. It will be interesting to watch the activities of companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar, Inc., ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report), Illinois Tool Works Inc (ITW  -  Free Report), Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH  -  Free Report), Ingersoll-Rand PLC (IR  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Automation.In the S&P 500 group, a major machinery company is Caterpillar. It has a market capitalization of $67.58 billion and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). In the next three to five years, the company’s earnings are predicted to grow 9.50%.Earnings of Deere & Company are predicted to grow 9.17%. It currently has $41.50 billion market capitalization and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s long-term growth prospects seem bright on the back of increasing population, rising living standards, investments in new products and expansion in unexplored geographies.

91,FLS,"A few industrial products companies are gearing up to report quarterly numbers on Jul 27. The Q1 earnings season is in full swing, with about 128 S&P 500 companies having already reported results, reconfirming broad-based expectations of better-than-expected earnings (as on Jul 25).Earnings of these companies (accounting for 36.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 7% on 4.2% higher revenues. (For more details, read our latest Earnings Outlook: Sizing Up the Q2 Earning Season). Of these companies, 77.3% have surpassed earnings estimates, with 70.3% coming ahead of revenue estimates.As per our latest Earnings Preview, dated Jul 21, data projects that the total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are now on track to grow an impressive 8.6% from the year-ago period, on 4.7% higher revenues. This is comparable to earnings growth expectations of 5.6% recorded at the beginning of the reporting season.The Industrial Products space (which accounts for about 2% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization) is expected to chart one of the highest earnings growth rates this quarter amongst all Zacks sectors. In fact, its earnings are on track to be up 14.2% in the quarter, on 12.9% higher sales compared with the last year.Industrial products stocks have been performing well since the beginning of second-quarter 2017, with the industry gaining roughly 4.7%, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 2.7%. We believe that growth-conducive policies of the government and expectations of higher infrastructure spending drove the shares’ performance.Further, there are economic indicators which point toward a strong operating environment for the industry. Industrial production — which measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors — grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, led by robust growth in mining and utilities. Additionally, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery rose 4.6% in the first five months of 2017, largely for the construction, mining and oil and gas field machinery. These indicators bode well for the industry.Let’s have a look at how some industrial products companies are positioned, ahead of their scheduled announcements tomorrow:Flowserve Corporation (FLS  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, distributes, and services industrial flow management equipment worldwide. The company has a choppy earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates twice over the trailing four quarters for as many misses, for an average positive surprise of 3.6%. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 25%.Our quantitative model hints at an earnings beat for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in Q2. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of +4.55% (the Most Accurate estimate of 46 cents being higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents), in addition to the favorable Zacks Rank.(For more details, read: Will Flowserve Pull Off a Surprise in Q2 Earnings?).For a possible earnings beat, the company should have the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3. Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation QuoteSimilarly, we expect AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report) to outperform estimates when it reports quarterly results. The company manufactures and distributes agricultural equipment and related replacement parts. It has an impeccable earnings history, having beaten estimates strongly each time over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 40.4%. In the last reported quarter, the company exceeded earnings estimates by a whopping 88.2%.A favorable rank and positive Earnings ESP hint toward an earnings beat this season for the company.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company’s Earnings ESP of +2.89% and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 indicate that AGCO Corporation’s earnings will likely beat estimates this quarter. Its Most Accurate estimate of $1.07 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04.

The company has a choppy earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates twice over the trailing four quarters for as many misses, for an average positive surprise of 2%. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 5.8%.We do not expect Allegion to beat expectations this quarter. Though the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.00.Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Allegion PLC QuoteJohnson Controls International plc (JCI  -  Free Report) operates as a diversified technology and multi industrial company. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 5.6%.

105,FLS,"Stocks stared into the abyss, again, and finally jumped in, as the financial crisis that has been percolating for weeks finally overwhelmed Wall Street. The Dow posted its largest one day drop since just after the September 11 attacks. 
"
106,FLS,"The day started with an orderly sell-off that picked up steam in the second half of the session. No sector escaped the carnage.
"
107,FLS,"The Dow lost 504 points, or 4.42%, to 10917. The Nasdaq Composite Index fared slightly better, giving up 81.36 points, or 3.60%, to 2179. The S&P 500 Index now finds itself below its July lows, shedding 59 points, or 4.71%, to 1192.
"
108,FLS,"There were historic deals, and non-deals, all weekend long, as two of Wall Streets most revered investment banks threw in the towel. Lehman Brothers (LEH) declared bankruptcy after it couldn't find a partner who would take on its problems. Merrill Lynch (MER) fared better as Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) came to its rescue.
"
109,FLS,"All eyes now turn to American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report), the world's largest insurance company, which is desperately trying to raise capital. The State of New York, which regulates insurance companies, announced that it was giving AIG permission to tap $20 billion from subsidiaries in order to give it breathing room while it continued to look for its own White Knight. AIG has far broader financial implications, worldwide, if it were to fail, than Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, due to its size and global reach.
"
110,FLS,"Also on Wall Street's watch list are Wachovia (WB), whose stock was pummeled nearly 25% today, and Washington Mutual (WM). Both companies have large mortgage exposure. Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) released a memo to employees saying it had adequate capital which was not affected by the Lehman bankruptcy to try and quell jitters. The stock closed down 15% anyway.
"
111,FLS,"If it wasn't for the financial crisis, the big news would have been Hurricane Ike, which struck the Texas coast over the weekend. Several million people in the Houston area are still without power. The energy complex fared pretty well considering the winds and storm surge. Fourteen Texas and Louisiana refineries, which refine 3.57 million barrels a day, remain closed. Most appear to have suffered only moderate damage. 
"
112,FLS,"There are reports that about 10 offshore platforms were damaged but that is a small number out of the thousands in the region.

"
117,FLS,"There is no argument that todays bearish action took a toll on many portfolios. The Focus List was not spared. Its holdings averaged out a loss of 3.69% for the day. A tough loss, but one that was narrower than that of both the Dow (-4.42%) and S&P 500 (-4.71%) averages. The portfolio's dip was only slightly wider than the Nasdaqs (-3.60%) fall.

119,FLS,"Amid the market carnage, Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report) came in as todays biggest Focus List decliner, shedding 8.46%. This was for the most part a response to falling oil prices. However, we are watching this holding closely. It is tough to part with the Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock that boasts strong fundamentals and is currently part of the Timely Buys list, but if bearish action persists, it will be removed.

120,FLS,"Focus List stocks that were in the news today included Railroad equipment supplier Wabtec Corp. (WAB  -  Free Report), which announced that it bought Standard Car Truck, a leading rail equipment supplier. The purchase was in the amount of $300 million in cash.

"
123,FLS,"The market pulled back this week as volume declined heading into the holiday weekend. The drop followed a nice upward move, so it's hard to complain.
"
124,FLS,"One thing that I did find peculiar was the reaction to the minutes of April's Fed Reserve meeting. Traders acted a like a child worried about monsters in his closet.
"
125,FLS,"There really wasn't anything in the minutes or the accompanying forecast that should have surprised anybody. The Fed is on hold until at least August. The housing slump will last into 2009, if not longer. Unemployment is going to rise. Commodity prices are creating inflationary pressures. The stimulus package and rate cuts should help increase spending in the second half of the year.
"
126,FLS,"So why the reaction? Probably, a combination of bearish news flow, the exiting of positions ahead of the holiday weekend and the simple fact that some people looking for an excuse to sell.
"
127,FLS,"Certainly, there were more people looking for reasons to sell today. Given the volume levels, I would not read much into it. We are heading into a three-day weekend and there really isn't any catalyst to push stocks in either direction. Sometimes market action is simply what it is.
"
128,FLS,"Downward drops, such as what we saw this week may make for good news headlines, but often do not translate into trend reversals. Investors need to remember that on any given day, they might not like the prices that Mr. Market is offering them.
"
129,FLS,"Oil Prices
"
130,FLS,"Once a month, I write a column for SFO Magazine's web site and I'm going to reiterate what I wrote in an article slated for publication on Tuesday.
"
131,FLS,"Crude is trading at prices that Jed Clampett could never envision, and as is the case with any bubble, it is hard to predict how much further prices will rise.
"
132,FLS,"Brokerage analysts, even those who follow energy companies, have completely underestimated the range that oil would trade at this year. Across the energy sector, earnings estimates are being revised upwards for companies involved in the upstream side of the business (drillers, exploration and production (E&P), etc) and cut for those on the downstream side of the business (refiners).
"
133,FLS,"American Airlines' (AMR) decision to charge passengers for merely checking one bag is evidence that those dependant on managing fuel costs are finding their forecasts to be woefully wrong as well.
"
134,FLS,"At this point, I would be more accurate at predicting the winner of next year's NCAA men's basketball tournament than the price of crude in July and August. And everyone else's crystal ball is equally foggy. At some point, oil is going to be a great short play; nobody knows when, however.
"
135,FLS,"Focus List Update
"
136,FLS,"Two stocks were added this week, Flowserve (FLS  -  Free Report) and Corning (GLW).
"
137,FLS,"FLS makes fluid control systems, particularly pumps. Although the company does a large amount of business within the oil industry, 55% of its revenues come from chemical, power generation and industrial companies. Guidance has been routinely raised and the stock trades at a reasonable valuation relative to projected earnings.
"
138,FLS,"GLW is increasingly becoming a LCD display company more than anything else. (Display technologies accounted for nearly 52% of first-quarter revenues.) As such, Corning gives us exposure to an industry we are not currently targeting. In addition, valuation is good, the company has been growing sales and profits and earnings estimates are trending higher.

140,FLS,"The cyclical nature of industrial machinery demand is benefiting from the synchronized global growth backdrop. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently raised its outlook for the global economy, with the financial institution anticipating the world economy to grow 3.6% in 2017. It expects 2.2% rise in advanced economies and 4.6% growth in emerging nations. Global output is projected to increase 3.7% in 2018, including 2% growth for advanced nations and 4.9% improvement for emerging countries.We believe that continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery. Moreover, healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations, especially in emerging countries, are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment. Further, need for better infrastructure and residential and non-residential spaces require heavy construction machineries.Machinery stocks are broadly grouped under Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The sector has performed well, yielding a solid return of 18.3% year to date. This outpaces growth of 16.9% recorded by the S&P 500 and roughly 13.2% by the NYSE Composite.Among the S&P 500 members, the top five industrial machinery gainers since the beginning of the year include Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report), Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report). The poor performers include Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corp., PLC (ETN  -  Free Report).Industrial Machinery: DescriptionIndustrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.The United States: The country’s industrial production increased2.9% year over year in October driven by impressive growth in mining, manufacturing and utilities output. In September, industrial production increased 1.6% year over year.In addition, a few indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report,new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 6.4% in the first nine months of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction, mining, industrial, material handling and other machineries.Also, the job market showed strength, with the recent data indicating 261,000 new job additions in October. Average of new job additions in the last three months was 162,000 (accounting for hurricane affects). The unemployment rate dropped 10 basis points (bps) to 4.1%. Also, the country’s GDP has advanced 3% in the July-September quarter.We believe that implementation of the Trump government’s growth policies, especially the proposed $1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement, will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks. Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing and commercial construction markets in the country. To continue supporting the growing economy, the Federal Reserve has hiked its interest rates twice this year while another one might be expected in December.The IMF projects the U.S. economy to grow 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018. These estimates represent increase of 10 bps from the previous projection for 2017 and 20 bps for 2018.Japan: The country’s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels, an aging population and huge public debt.Also, the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3% rise in national sales tax in April 2014.However, strengthening exports driven by rise in automobile and electronic shipments have supported the country’s annualized GDP growth of 1.4% in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter. In addition, we believe that initiatives to improve wages are likely to spur domestic demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country’s favor in the quarters ahead.According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months)increased 4.7% in third-quarter 2017. However, the same is predicted to be quite different in the fourth quarter, with total machinery orders likely to decline 1.9%. Core orders are expected to fall 3.5%, orders from manufacturing clients will likely drop 9.4% and that from government clients might decline 3.3%.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 20 bps to 1.5% for 2017 and by 10 bps to 0.7% for 2018.China: China’s GDP grew 6.8% from the year-earlier period in the third quarter. However, this improvement was slightly below 6.9% registered in the previous quarter as a rise in retail sales and higher exports were partially offset by weak expansion in infrastructure investments.The country’s industrial production improved 6.6% year over year in September on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors, offset by weakness in the mining sector. Industrial production in October grew 6.2%.For 2017, the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. We believe that implementation of the government’s plan to spend more than $2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020 will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery.The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6.8% in 2017 and 6.5% in 2018, up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates.India: The country is currently witnessing the after-effects of some major reforms —demonetization and goods and services tax — implemented in the trailing 12 months. These economic decisions along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth going forward.A favorable domestic job market, low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans, infrastructure investments, healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination.The country’s industrial production decelerated to 3.8% in September 2017, having expanded 4.5% in the previous month. Production suffered from weakness in mining and electricity outputs. In the first half of fiscal 2017 (ended September), industrial production expanded 2.5% year over year.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 6.7% in 2017 and 7.4% in 2018, down roughly 50 bps and 30 bps from the respective previous estimates.Brazil: One of the major road blocks for the Brazilian economy are the political uncertainties which have gripped the nation, somewhat jeopardizing its growth opportunities. Corruption charges against its president are believed to be one of the reasons behind the country’s poor investment grade ratings. Moreover, low private investments, inadequate infrastructure and still a high unemployment rate of 12.4% are other major hurdles.Partially negating the impact of these aspects, growth in export demand and efforts to implement a new pension reform targeting the curbing of public debt are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy. Also, falling inflation have prompted the countries’ Central Bank to ease interest rates. Notably, the interest rate has been lowered by 75 bps in October, this being its ninth consecutive rate cut since October 2016.In addition, the country’s industrial production has been encouraging since the beginning of the year. Per the latest data, industrial production in September grew 2.6% from the year-ago comparable month.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 0.7% in 2017, reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast. Also, growth projection for 2018 has been increased by 20 bps to 1.5%.Eurozone: The region, amidst all the political uncertainties, is showing slight improvement in export demand and labor markets. The region’s GDP has improved 2.5% year over year in third-quarter 2017 while industrial production has improved 3.3% year over year in September. The unemployment rate at September end was 8.9% versus 9% at the end of the previous month.The region’s GDP when compared with the previous quarter inched up 0.6% versus 0.7% recorded in the second quarter. Industrial production, on a month-on-month basis, fell 0.6% in September.The IMF increased output growth estimates by 20 bps both for 2017 and 2018 to 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively.Sector and Industry RankingOf the 16 Zacks sector, Industrial Products is currently in the top 25%, holding the fourth position. The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry. As a rule, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank)The machinery industry comprises stocks that primarily deals with manufacturing and supplying farm equipment (currently such stocks collectively carry Zacks Industry Rankof 17), construction and mining equipment (ranked 5), industrial electronics (ranked 186), electrical products (ranked 115), thermal products (ranked 28), material handling products (ranked 28), printing equipment for industrial use (ranked 115), industrial tools and providing related services (ranked 20) and companies serving general industrial purposes are ranked 62.Going by the Zacks rule, we see that machinery sub-industries, except for one, fall in the top half. These sub-industries can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorPer the Zacks Earnings Trends report dated Nov 16, roughly 470 of S&P 500 companies reported results for the July-September quarter, with 72.3% beating earnings estimates and 66.5% surpassing revenue projections.Of the Industrial Products stocks, roughly 95.8% reported results til Nov 16. Earnings grew 16.7% year over year, with roughly 65.2% companies beating estimates. Revenues improved 2.9%, with a sales beat of 69.6%.In the quarter, the S&P 500 companies collectively are projected to deliver earnings growth of 6.5% and sales growth of 5.8%. Seeing the results so far and the favorable operating conditions, we believe that the overall performance of the Industrial Products sector will be encouraging. Earnings for industrial stocks are projected to grow 18.7% while sales to increase 4.5%.Our TakeIt will be interesting to watch the activities of companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar, Inc., ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report), Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH  -  Free Report), Ingersoll-Rand PLC (IR  -  Free Report) and Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.In the S&P 500 group, a major machinery company is Caterpillar. It has a market capitalization of $82.7 billion and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). In the next three to five years, the company’s earnings are predicted to grow 10.3%.Earnings for Deere & Company are predicted to grow 8%. It currently has $48 billion market capitalization and Zacks Rank of #1.The company’s long-term growth prospects seem bright on the back of increasing population, rising living standards, investments in new products and expansion in unexplored geographies.Internal requirements as well as export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country. We believe that efforts to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery companies. Also, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will help in accelerating growth.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

Overall, Flowserve has an average positive surprise of 3.6% for the trailing four quarters, marked by two earnings beats for as many misses.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our proven model, Flowserve has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Flowserve is +4.55% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 46 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Flowserve’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsFlowserve’s key strengths, including strong operational model, solid productivity, considerable aftermarket content and geographical diversity, are anticipated to drive results in the soon-to-be reported quarter. For the past few quarters, the company has been witnessing stabilization in core aftermarket activities concerning parts, services and repairs as markets return to regular maintenance schedules.Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation QuoteWe believe the company’s top line in the second quarter is likely to benefit from modest natural gas investments in North America and Asia. Also, increased bidding activity in the desalination space is expected to boost sales. This apart, the company’s restructuring initiatives over the past few quarters are anticipated to prove conducive to second-quarter results.Currently, the company is pursuing a $400-million multi-year investment plan, which is expected to result in $195 million of savings in 2017. These initiatives helped the company garner savings of $28 million in first-quarter 2017. Further, Flowserve is planning to trim its workforce by 15–20% as compared to the 2015 levels, as well as shift manufacturing to lower cost regions. We believe savings from these restructuring activities will boost profits in the upcoming quarter.Also, under the restructuring program, Flowserve completed the divestiture of the Gestra AG business unit to Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc during the quarter. The sale is part of Flowserve’s broader strategy to improve focus on core business, and optimize its product portfolio as well as manufacturing footprint. In addition, relative stability of oil at around the $45–$50 level for the past couple of quarters is encouraging. Modest recovery in client spending also looks promising.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +33.33% and a Zacks Rank #3, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Aug 4.

173,FLS,"Economic activities around the globe have been jittery in the March quarter, with uncertainties prevalent in a number of developed as well as developing countries. In the emerging world, questions remain about China’s growth outlook, Brazil’s economy has lost momentum and oil exporting nations are forced to deal with the effects of lower oil prices. Lower oil prices are having an impact on the demand for industrial machinery as well, both directly as well indirectly.
"
174,FLS,"In Apr 2015, the World Economic Outlook, published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), highlighted the worsening operating conditions in some developed and emerging nations. This, consequently, will hurt industrial activities, thus posing a major headwind for the machinery industry. The world economy is predicted to grow 3.5% in 2015 and 3.8% in 2016. Advanced economies are projected to grow 2.4% in both 2015 and 2016, while emerging nations will likely grow by 4.3% in 2015 and 4.7% in 2016.
"
175,FLS,"Across nations, the level of industrial activities is measured in terms of industrial production -- output of the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors. A brief discussion on the prospects of the machinery industry in different nations has been provided below.Prospects in the United States
"
176,FLS,"As per the Federal Reserve reports, operating environment for the U.S.-based machinery makers was difficult in first-quarter 2015. Industrial production declined 1% year over year due to weakness in the mining and utilities industries.
"
177,FLS,"Also, export demands for the U.S. machinery were weak in the quarter. According to the U.S. Census Bureau report published in May 2015, machinery shipments decreased by 2.2% in the quarter. Shipments for farm, mining and industrial machineries fell 48%, 13.9% and 0.7%, respectively. New machinery orders were down 9.3%, while order backlog inched up 0.1%.

"
179,FLS,"Presently, market sentiments are shaky in the U.S. as fluctuating currency movements and uncertain global growth will likely hurt the country’s export businesses. Lower oil prices add to the woes by adversely impacting oil and gas drilling activities of the oil producing companies. This, in turn, has lowered capital spending on purchase of machinery and equipments.
"
180,FLS,"According to the IMF, the U.S. economy is projected to grow by 3.1% in both 2015 and 2016.Japan
"
181,FLS,"The latest report by Japan’s Cabinet Office shows that total machinery orders in Feb 2015 declined 1.4% over the previous month. Private-sector machinery orders fell 10.4%, while the same excluding volatile orders edged down 0.4%, raising concerns over the future of capital investments by companies. Orders from government clients decreased 21.9%. The agency predicts a 2.5% decline in total machinery orders for first-quarter 2015.   
"
182,FLS,"In Nov 2014, the government had delayed its second sales tax hike of 2% by 18 months, primarily on account of the shrinking economy. The IMF predicts the economy to grow by a meagre 1% in 2015 and 1.2% in 2016.Emerging NationsChina: The country’s industrial production growth rate declined to 5.6% in Mar 2015 from 6.8% recorded in both February and January. The weakness was triggered by soft domestic demands during the period.
"
183,FLS,"Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate also slowed to 7% in Jan-Mar quarter as against the year-ago quarter. Exports growth was a paltry 5%, while imports shrank 17%. The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow by 6.8% in 2015 and 6.3% in 2016.  India: The country’s industrial production in Feb 2015 increased 5% from the year-ago month on the back of a 5.2% increase in manufacturing and 2.5% in the mining sector. Industrial production growth in January was 2.8%. GDP growth in the December-ending quarter was 7.5%.
"
184,FLS,"Expectations of strong demand, policy improvements and better monsoon conditions will act as the primary growth drivers for the country, going forward. The new government has already taken certain measures to successfully boost the country’s foreign capital inflow. According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow by 7.5% in both 2015 and 2016.Brazil: The country’s industrial production in Mar 2015 declined 3.5% from the year-ago quarter. The fall was worse in February at 9.4% while being down 5.2% in January.
"
185,FLS,"For 2015, the country projects a gloomy outlook as a result of low private investments, inadequate infrastructure and high labor costs. The IMF predicts the country’s output to decline by 1% in 2015, and grow by 1% in 2016. The recovery is dependent on foreign direct investments and expansion of industries like tourism, steel and electricity.Eurozone
"
186,FLS,"The Eurozone’s industrial production (excluding construction) in Feb 2015 managed to rise 1.1% over the prior month, while increasing 1.6% year over year, as per Eurostat’s data released in Apr 2015.

"
203,FLS,"On July 29, Flowserve reported second quarter earnings which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents. Earnings per share were $1.92, or 9% lower than a year ago.
"
204,FLS,"Bookings increased quarter over quarter by 7% to $1.04 billion but that was 21% lower than the second quarter of 2008. The decrease was mainly due to the changes in the chemical, oil and gas markets due to the global recession. Customers also de-stocked inventory which led to a decline in business in the Flow Control Division.
"
205,FLS,"Sales also fell 6% year over year to $1.09 billion but if negative currency fluctuations are excluded, then sales rose 4%. Compared to the first quarter, however, sales climbed 6%. 
"
206,FLS,"The decline in sales was attributable to lower sales by the Flow Control Division and the Flow Solutions Division although those declines were partially offset by increases in the Flowserve Pump Division.
"
207,FLS,"Backlog decreased just 4% to $2.71 billion from $2.83 billion at the end of 2008. This included cancellations of $19 million of orders booked in the last year.2009 Guidance Raised
"
208,FLS,"Given the quarter over quarter increases in sales and bookings the company saw in the second quarter, it is raising its 2009 earnings per share guidance to the range of $7.15 to $7.75 from prior guidance of $6.75 to $7.50. 
"
209,FLS,"Flowserve is especially encouraged by its pump bookings since they may be an indicator that the end markets are starting to stabilize as pumps are ordered earlier than valves and seals due to their longer manufacturing lead times.Zacks Consensus Estimates Rise
"
210,FLS,"With the company's raised forecast, covering analysts moved to increase estimates for both the third quarter and the full year.

218,FLS,"Hurricane Ike was upgraded to a category 2 storm today as it advanced through the warmer waters of the Gulf of Mexico. While Ike is not expected to cause any major damage to the actual energy producing infrastructure of the Gulf, these companies have begun to evacuate employees from their platforms as a precautionary measure.

(B  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28, before the market opens.The company’s financial performance in the last four quarters was impressive, with better-than-expected results in each. Average earnings surprise was a positive 8.94%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of 71 cents per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.33%. We believe that sound financial performance and growth prospects have lifted investor sentiments for the company. In the last three months, the company’s shares have yielded 13.18% return, outperforming the gain of 2.39% recorded by the industry it belongs to.Let us see whether Barnes Group will be able to maintain its earnings streak this quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Barnes Group will likely pull a surprise this quarter.

Price and EPS Surprise  Barnes Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Barnes Group, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Barnes Group’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. Moreover, its positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Notably, we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?We believe that operating conditions in the industry have been favorable for machinery companies in the quarter. Notably, industrial production – a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country – grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities. New orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 4.6% in the first five months of 2017. Such positives should positively impact Barnes Group’s industrial business.Also, governmental policies supporting better trade relations, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will boost Barnes Group’s businesses in the quarter. Efforts of business expansion in international markets, investments for innovation and new product development, effective supply chain and logistics, and enhancement of operational excellence might be other drivers.  Barnes Group’s inorganic initiatives, especially the acquired assets of FOBOHA (Aug 2016), will be beneficial in the quarter. In the second quarter, the company acquired the privately held Gammaflux L.P. This buyout will boost the company’s Molding Solution’s businesses.    Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the industry you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +2.89% and a Zacks Rank #1.
