0,FL,"Hindsight may be 20/20, but with some studying, your stockpicking foresight can get pretty good, too.Foreseeing the move by a stock with terrific fundamentals, a No. 1 ranking in its industry, and loads of fund sponsorship, before it happens is crucial. If such a stock breaks out with force, then you're more likely to grab shares at the proper buy point.Think of the ""buy point"" as the ground floor of a potential elevator-like advance to new highs. It's not enough to just buy the right stock. You have to buy the right stock in the right way at the right time.Those who read Investor's Corner regularly have a strong command of one of the most important patterns in growth investing: the cup with handle. The pattern allows you to be consistent in your buying. You're essentially entering a stock only when it's reached the point in which it can rise fast in a relatively short time frame.Human nature hasn't changed. Greed and fear still drive the market. So the cup with handle and other useful patterns of investor behavior will continue to pop up among IBD's wide span of features and screens designed to help you find and buy great stocks at the right time.Make a habit of going through the stocks presented in IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Stock Spotlight, Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and Stocks Near A Buy Zone. Most of these can be accessed via Stock Lists on the home page at Investors.com. (See the Income Investor columns by clicking on ""Research"" on the main navigation bar on the home page.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAre you completely new to chart analysis, or want to bring your skills up a notch? Check out the real-time annotations done in Leaderboard, which debuted in July 2011.A buy point is a price level at which a stock is most likely to begin a significant advance. It also points to an area of the chart that offers the least amount of resistance to price progress.Where that point is depends on the type of base the stock has formed, whether a cup with handle, a cup without handle, a flat base or double bottom.This is the critical moment. Identifying the correct buy point can make all the difference between a successful investment and a losing trade. And before you buy, always check that the Market Pulse table, updated every day in The Big Picture column, shows the current outlook as ""Market in confirmed uptrend.""Let's look first at one of the easiest buy points to spot: one from a cup without handle.In this type of base, the stock declines as much as 30% to 33% from a recent 52-week or all-time high, then starts to recover in a process that takes at least six weeks to complete. Once the ascent begins, there are no significant pullbacks, or anything that might be considered a handle.The buy point on this pattern is easy: 10 cents above the peak in the left side of the pattern.The flat base isn't much different. When the stock recovers and is 10 cents above the base's prior highest point, that's when you jump in.As the stock approaches new highs — building the right side of the cup pattern — the stock suddenly pulls back moderately in price. This pullback is up to 15% in depth but can be much less. According to IBD research, most handles in the most successful stocks show a drop of no more than 8% to 12% from the handle's highest price.Also, a good handle will form within the upper half of the base. How can you tell? Sometimes you can see it visually. Maybe the handle began forming when the stock was just a few points below the cup's left-side high.When it's difficult to tell, what should you do?Use the midpoint test. Add the highest price and lowest price within the cup, then divide by 2. Do the same with the handle.If the handle's midpoint is higher than the base's midpoint, a breakout has a better chance of succeeding. The stock has already shown strong demand by climbing off its lows, plowing past prior price levels in which some shareholders had bought and immediately harbored paper losses. As a stock rebounds, these folks eagerly sell and get rid of the stock.Use the highest level in the handle area and add 10 cents to derive the buy point.Take Seacoast Banking (SBCF) as an example from 2016. After the Donald Trump presidential election win on Nov. 8, bank stocks took off. Florida-based Seacoast joined the bandwagon with a gusher of a move from Nov. 9 to 14, rising as much as 9% during that time frame and clearing an 18.05 handle buy point on a nine-week cup pattern.The midpoint of the cup was 16.83 (15.85 + 17.80 divided by 2). The handle's midpoint of 17.38 (16.82 + 17.95 divided by 2) was higher, so it passed. As seen in Seacoast's case, sometimes, the handle may begin forming slightly above the cup's left-side high.The double-bottom base is a bit different. The stock forms a cup pattern, but makes another correction before it reaches new highs. The second bottom usually is lower than the first.The pattern has a W-shape. The buy point is the middle intraday peak of the W-shape plus 10 cents. Keep in mind that a handle may also form, presenting an alternative entry.No matter what type of base it is, the stock should pass its buy point in heavy volume. That gives you the confidence big investors are buying as well.How much volume should you expect? Trading should swell at least 40% above the stock's 50-day average volume.If you're watching a stock during the trading session and aren't sure if volume is so strong, check the stock quotes at Investors.com. The volume percentage change is continually calculated.Nursing care facility operator VistaCare went public in December 2002 and by April 2003, it had formed a cup base with a high handle (1). The highest price in the handle was 19.Within the handle, the stock fell 11.6%, in range with the typical handle on a cup base during a bull market. Meanwhile, stocks were taking off and leading growth names were bursting out of bases after the market followed through on March 17, 2003, Day 4 of a new rally attempt. On that day, the Nasdaq soared 3.9% in higher turnover; the S&P 500 gushed 3.5% higher.VistaCare broke out on April 28, 2003, in heavy volume, then held above the 19.10 buy point two weeks later during a pullback that became a bullish reversal (2).On the breakout day, VistaCare showed decent ratings  on IBD Stock Checkup despite being such a young new public company: a 72 Composite, 80 EPS, 78 RS and A- for Accumulation/Distribution.Investors who bought at the correct buy point stood to more than double their money by year's end.(A version of this column was originally published in the April 16, 2010, edition of IBD. VistaCare was acquired by Odyssey HealthCare in March 2008.

""Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2018, we will ignite Nike's next horizon of global growth through the strength of our brand, the power of our innovative products and the most personal, digitally-connected experiences in our industry.""Stock: Nike fell 3.2% late after ending the session up 0.9% at 53.70 in the stock market today. Under Armour (UAA) slipped 1.2%, and U.S.-listed shares of Adidas (ADDYY) fell 3.2% after an employee was embroiled in an NCAA corruption scandal that involved 10 arrests, including several college coaches.Nike also has been struggling from growing competition from Adidas, which has rapidly gained U.S. market share.Even Nike's iconic Jordan brand has looked less dominant, as basketball-shoe sales weaken and more fashionable shoes gain popularity. Adidas in particular has gotten traction from celebrity tie-ins, like shoes designed by rapper Kanye West.Meanwhile, Nike is experimenting with different distribution channels, such as selling some products directly on Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook's (FB) Instagram app.The efforts come despite Nike's strong push to sell directly to consumer through its own site and as traditional retail partners like Foot Locker (FL) struggle in the brick-and-mortar sales environment.RELATED:4 Shoe Stocks In Bases, Buck Nike-Under Armour Slumps: Investing Action PlanEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

A couple of key factors, say experts.Nike ""appears to have misjudged the appetite for some key marquee basketball product,"" wrote Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser last week, downgrading the Swoosh to neutral from a positive rating. Now there's an ""inordinate amount"" of KDs, LeBrons and Kobe shoes on shelves, according to Poser's recent store checks.""We do not believe the basketball business is dead,"" he said. ""Rather we believe a recovery in the basketball category in North America may take longer than we initially anticipated as excess product is cleared.""Cowen's John Kernan, who has a market perform rating on Nike, said he continues to see risk around the company's basketball business amid increased price-cutting in the category.""We recently saw (Under Armour)'s Curry 3 priced at $75 and see little demand at price points above $120 across the entire category,"" said Kernan, adding that there has also been ""significant"" promotional activity in men's and women's athletic apparel and footwear.Piper Jaffray noted an approximate 40% year-over-year rise in clearance styles on Nike.com through the quarter. Add to that a slowdown in same-store sales and digital trends, and Nike ""has yet to reach a bottom on its home turf,"" wrote analyst Erinn Murphy on Friday. She has a neutral rating on Nike.Nike shares rose 0.9% to 53.70 in the stock market today. The Dow component has been trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages after selling off in the wake of terrible results and guidance from athletic shoe retail giant Foot Locker (FL).Under Armour (UAA) dipped 1.4%, and Adidas (ADDYY) fell 3.2% to 110.13, falling below their 50-day line after an executive was implicated in an NCAA basketball scandal. Shares of the European shoe giant, which trades over the counter in the U.S., have pulled back since briefly hitting a record intraday high of 118.98.Then there's Adidas. That the brand is back isn't news to anyone. But those iconic three stripes may be here to stay, contrary to what some investors believe.""In our view, the NKE bulls are still denying the durability of Adidas' resurgence, which we view as having longer growth sustainability,"" said Murphy.And Adidas has surpassed Nike's dominant Jordan brand to rank second among the top athletic-shoe labels in the country, said research firm NPD Group last week.

38,FL,"The increasingly saturated sportswear market and rival Adidas' (ADDYY) emergence as a market-share-munching contender have rattled Nike (NKE) recently, but the Swoosh insists that its fortunes are turning in the U.S. — and some analysts are inclined to agree.Nike topped overall forecasts, but its holiday-quarter performance in North America still reflected a 6% revenue decline, marking the third consecutive drop in the crucial market. By contrast, Adidas' North America sales surged 31% in its most recently reported quarter.But Nike sees revenue on its home turf coming in flat in the current fiscal Q4, then returning to growth in the following two quarters.Chief Executive Mark Parker expects a ""reversal of trend"" in Q4 in the U.S. and Canada, and called out the success of certain footwear styles, such as the Epic React, AirMax 270 and Vapormax.

Dow component Walmart (WMT) tumbled more than 9% in heavy trading after the largest brick-and-mortar retailer disappointed with its latest quarterly results.Walmart's point loss single-handedly accounted for the Dow's loss; without Walmart, the Dow would be up. Walmart gapped below its 50-day line, erasing all gains from a breakout past a 100.23 buy point, what had been a gain of nearly 10%. Shares are nearly 6% below the entry and the break of the 50-day line should cause investors who bought near 100.23 to consider cutting losses short.Market volume was tracking lower compared with the same time Friday.

51,FL,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday — what you need know as an investor for the coming day.X Sports retail chain Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and China Lodging Group (HTHT) report fourth-quarter earnings. Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) present at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference.Wall Street will also be watching for Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation.Dick's Sporting Goods' fourth-quarter earnings will follow the retailer's decision to stop selling assault-style rifles and raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21 in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Kroger (KR) and Walmart (WMT) have also raised their minimum gun-purchase age to 21.American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), the company formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holding, said the decision would have a minimal effect on sales. A former business analyst recently told USA Today that the same was true for Dick's, arguing that its customers go there for apparel and other gear related to team sports rather than firearms.Meanwhile, Dick's has been investing more in e-commerce, but has remained concerned about aggressive competitive discounting from rival retailers.Wall Street expects Dick's fourth-quarter earnings per share to fall 9% to $1.20, with revenue up 10% to $2.732 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales are expected to fall 1.2%, according to Consensus Metrix.Dick's rose 2% to 32.56 in the stock market today. Hibbett Sports (HIBB), which reports on Friday, was down 1.75%. Foot Locker (FL), which this month forecast lackluster sales for the first quarter, rose 1.1%.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines are set to present at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference. The conference follows United's announcement in January that it would be growing capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and flights — this year, next year and 2020. That decision, combined with the carrier's promise to keep matching fares from low-cost rivals, revived Wall Street's anxieties of a protracted airfare battle.For now, though, some analysts expect that the financial forecasts the airlines are likely to issue during the conference will be good news for airline stocks.""We expect the airlines to update 1Q18 investor guidance, and suspect the updates will be positive given relatively modest industry capacity growth in 1Q18, declining jet fuel costs, and continued global economic improvement,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note.She added: ""If there is even a hint about United reducing their 2018 capacity growth, it would be a key positive driver for the stocks.""Delta edged up 0.1%, while United Air climbed 0.6%.American cleared a 55.70 cup-with-handle base on Friday, but volume was well below normal. Shares rose 0.8% to 56.60, also in light trade. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a very short-term high but hasn't made headway since late 2016.Delta and United are in consolidations.China Lodging Group, a hotel operator in China, reports fourth-quarter results amid solid travel demand in the nation, whose economy and middle class have grown over the years. The company as of Sept. 30 operated nearly 3,700 hotels in 375 cities, with much of its business geared toward economy and midtier hotels.Estimates were unavailable from Zacks.Shares found support at their 50-day line Monday, rallying to close up 0.5% at 154.50.The stock is near a 161 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. But China Lodging is in a fourth-stage base. Late-stage bases can work, but they are more likely to fail than first- or second-stage bases.Consumer Price Index data are set to be released by the Labor Department at 8:30 a.m. ET. Consensus is for a 0.2% monthly gain and a 2.2% increase year over year. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, is seen posting a 1.9% annual gain.Wall Street in recent weeks has grown more concerned about potentially higher prices and whether the rebounding U.S. economy can handle them.The Fed has a 2% inflation target.

"
54,FL,"Guns: In the wake of the Florida school shooting, gun control advocates say the horrible tragedy marks a fundamental shift in the nation's debate over gun ownership. But that's what they say after every shooting tragedy, and it never happens.Look at the headlines in the major news media and you'd think that the nation is finally ready to accept strict controls on the sale and ownership of guns.""Parkland school shooting seen as turning point for gun control debate,"" says USA Today.""Why Parkland could be a turning point for gun control,"" says Vox.com""Sen. Nelson Hopes FL Shooting Is the 'Turning Point' on Gun Control,"" says Fox News.On and on it goes.The problem is that these same predictions have been made by the same gun control advocates time and time again. Yet that turning point never arrives.It was just two years ago, in fact, that the same people declared that the Orlando nightclub shooting, which claimed 49 lives ""could be a turning point"" and that ""After Orlando shooting, Americans back stricter gun controls"" and that ""Sandy Hook didn't change our gun laws. Orlando might.""After the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which claimed the lives of 20 elementary school students, the New York Times declared the attack was ""profoundly swaying Americans' views on guns.""Trayvon Martin's shooting that same year was supposed to be a ""turning point in the gun rights debate.""The 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was also going to ""shift the gun control debate.""In 1999 then-Vice President Al Gore said the country had reached a ""turning point"" on gun control.Way back in 1993, a mass shooting at a San Francisco law firm that took eight lives was cited as ""a crucial turning point in the gun control movement.""Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersIt is true that polls taken since the Florida shooting show a spike in support for gun control, students are protesting for gun control, and there's a backlash against the NRA. But these are nothing new, either. Nor is the blot-out-the-sun media coverage of the gun control debate.But the fact is that, despite the current hysteria, the public's view on guns has barely changed in more than two decades, according to Gallup, which has been polling on this topic since the 1960s.And in the nearly 20 years since Al Gore declared that we were at a turning point, the gun ownership rate in the U.S. climbed from 34% to 42% today, Gallup finds.Meanwhile, at least one poll shows that, despite the blanket coverage by the media on calls for more gun control, 54% blame failure of government agencies to respond to numerous warning signs from the prospective Florida school shooter. Just a third blame lack of adequate gun control laws, according to the latest Rasmussen poll.So all these ""turning point"" predictions turn out to be little more than a con by gun control advocates, who hope that if they say it enough it will someday come true.But what the gun control lobby means by ""turning point"" always involves overreaching and Constitutionally dubious bans on guns they deem ""too dangerous,"" based on flimsy facts, faulty reasoning and puerile attacks on law-abiding gun owners. Their ""turning point,"" in other words, is far outside the mainstream.Case in point is the bill introduced by liberal Democrats that would ban the ""sale, transfer, production, and importation"" of semi-automatic rifles and pistols that can hold a detachable magazine. The list of specific guns that would be banned tops 200. This bill has zero chance of being enacted into law.The Hill reports that mainstream Democrats are worried about pushing too hard on gun control, because ""embracing aggressive new gun restrictions carries risks, particularly in conservative-leaning districts where gun rights are sacrosanct. ""Worse, the absolutism of the gun control crowd actually makes it harder to get meaningful improvements in gun laws that will win widespread support and actually could make a difference — such as improvements to the background check system, better security at schools, improved training of school security guards, better coordination among law enforcement agencies and improved mental health efforts.So, don't be surprised if, when the next shooting tragedy inevitably occurs, we will once again be told that — this time — the ""turning point"" on guns has finally been reached.You might also like ...No, There Haven't Been 18 School Shootings This Year — Not Even CloseCNN's Pro-Gun Control 'Children's Crusade' Exploited Grieving Students And ParentsDespite Gun-Control Advocates' Claims, U.S. Isn't The Worst Country For Mass ShootingsIBD's coverage of the gun control debate.

57,FL,"Athletic-gear retail chains Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) surged early Friday after reporting third-quarter earnings that were much better than gloomy forecasts.XRival sporting goods stores as well as key athletic apparel makers such as Nike (NKE) also rallied.Estimates: Earnings per share to dive 29% to 80 cents on revenue of $1.844 billion, down 2%. Same-store sales were seen falling 4.2%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: EPS was 87 cents as revenue dipped to $1.87 billion. Same-store sales fell 3.7%.Stock: Shares surged 28.2% to 40.82 in the stock market today, gapping above their long-sliding 50-day moving average. Foot Locker's stock value has been cut roughly in half this year as the company's results grew more discouraging.In August, when Foot Locker reported second-quarter results, CEO Richard Johnson said sales of ""some recent top styles fell well short of our expectations"" and that there was a shortage of ""innovative"" products. In May, when it reported Q1 results, the company blamed a ""slow start"" on a delay in tax refunds and weakness in March and April.Nike, which sells a lot of its products through Foot Locker, rose 3.4% to 59.19, breaking above a cup-with-handle base buy point of 57.35. Nike also hiked its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 18 cents.Foot Locker reported a 3.4% decline in merchandise inventory and said there was more premium product available than earlier in the year.Goldman Sachs had raised concerns about ""excess inventory sitting at NKE's brick and mortar retail partners,"" as well as ""the high visibility this markdown product gets as it is funneled online via Amazon.com and other platforms."" Nike has agreed to sell some products directly through the e-commerce giant.Estimates: A 68% plunge in EPS to 21 cents on revenue down 8% to $218 million.Results: Hibbett Sports earned 37 cents a share as revenue edged up to $237.8 million.Outlook: Hibbett Sports sees fiscal 2018 EPS of $1.42 to $1.50, up from prior guidance of $1.25 to $1.35. Analysts had predicted $1.30. It forecast same-store sales to be down in a mid-single-digit range vs. earlier targets of a decline in the mid- to high-single-digit range.Hibbett Sports cited strong e-commerce sales as online efforts pay off.Stock: Shares shot up 15.15% to 17.10 after hitting 18.80 intraday.As with other sports retailers, Hibbett's stock has drifted lower this year amid aggressive promotions and the threat from Amazon, which could also develop its own private-label athletic apparel. IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is moving in on traditional retail's turf, in more ways than one. Read our recent cover story on how e-commerce giant's private label lines are giving clothing kings a run for their money. Dick's Sporting Goods this week said that earnings per share next year could fall as much as 20% as it invests in e-commerce, private brands and in other areas. The company also cited margin weakness and ""approximately flat"" same-store sales as reasons for the forecast.Dick's rose 2.9% Friday, closing with solid weekly gains after retreating Tuesday. Finish Line (FINL) leapt 7.4%.RELATED:Nike Flash Sale 'Unprecedented' As Teens Ditch Iconic BrandAdidas' U.S. Boss Talks Amazon, Retail Strategies, And Kanye's Real Impact'Undifferentiated, Mediocre Retail Won't Survive': Nike Rolls Out Retail RevampUnder Armour Reportedly Mulls Getting Out Of These CategoriesRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

The stock receded from its morning peak at 73.94, trading near 71.60 in afternoon dealings.Gap (GPS) climbed above the 29.87 buy point of a large cup with handle in big volume, but dipped below the entry during afternoon trading. Late Thursday, the store chain beat estimates with October-quarter EPS of 58 cents and sales of $3.84 billion. Same-store sales rose 3%, also above views.Guess (GES) broke out of a flat base and was trading near the 174.64 buy point. Volume was 2-1/2 times more than average.A few other stocks in the group cleared resistance levels, though not necessarily proper buy points. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) leapt past resistance around 15 after the company's strong results.Other consumer stocks and the energy sector were leading, while transportation, utility and some technology groups were down the most.

62,FL,"The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index fell back below their 50-day moving averages after retaking that key support level on Monday. President Trump's political woes, a Barcelona terror attack and negative reaction to earnings from Wal-Mart (WMT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) spurred Thursday's sell-off.XAlso during the week, Target (TGT) and off-price chains popped on strong earnings while Home Depot (HD) struggled despite seeming robust results. Several leading stocks came under pressure, though Chinese internet giants Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) rose on earnings.The Nasdaq fell 0.6% for the week and the S&P 500 0.7%. Both tumbled below their 50-day lines Thursday due to a broad sell-off on President Trump's political woes, the Barcelona terror attack and negative reaction to earnings. The Dow sank 0.8%. A few top stocks broke out but several more fell out of buy zones. A wave of retailers had mixed earnings.E-commerce giant Alibaba may be archrivals with online gaming and messaging giant Tencent, but both delivered booming growth for the June quarter. Alibaba blew past bullish EPS forecasts, while sales swelled 56% to $7.4 billion. Tencent revenue shot up 59% as operating profit leapt 70%. Alibaba shares rose 10.4% for the week while Tencent gained 4.8%, both hitting new highs. Also during the week, big e-commerce player JD.com topped sales and adjusted profit forecasts, but its shares tumbled 11% so far this week as high marketing costs swelled its net loss.RELATED:Alibaba Stock Pops As Quarterly Earnings Crush ForecastsChinese Internet Giant Tencent Earnings Top, Revenue Soars 59%Target (TGT) reported flat year-over-year Q2 earnings of $1.23 on 1.6% revenue growth to $16.43 billion, including same-store sales growth of 1.3%, all beating expectations. As the big-box retailer looks to stay competitive amid a sea of sellers, Target's digital revenue by 32% and said its Cat & Jack exclusive kids brand hit the $2 billion mark in its first year. It plans to debut more private-label brands. Profit guidance for the year got a bump up. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT) also topped forecasts as Q2 EPS grew 1% to $1.08 on 2% revenue growth to $123.36 billion. But Wal-Mart gave cautious Q3 guidance.Target shares rose nearly 3.6% on Wednesday but closed up just 2 cents for the week, still near multiyear lows. Wal-Mart fell 1.4%, ending back below a buy point.RELATED: Wal-Mart Q2 Earnings Top, Online Sales Jump 60%, But Guidance WeakTarget Earnings Top As Traffic Picks Up, Online Sales Pop 32%The Federal Reserve signaled that it's ready to begin to trimming its massive balance sheeting according to minutes from its July policy meeting, with policymakers citing asset price ""vulnerabilities"" becoming ""elevated."" Meanwhile, July retail sales climbed 0.6%, their best gain of the year and above expectations. Department store sales were robust, for one month, even as the sector struggles mightily. Initial jobless claims fell to a six-month low in the latest week. Housing and manufacturing data were mixed. July housing starts fell 4.8%, but builders were more confident this month. Industrial production rose less than expected in July, with manufacturing output actually down. The Philly Fed manufacturing index edged lower to its lowest reading since November, but it was above forecasts and still pointing to strong factory growth.Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported fiscal Q4 profit in-line with views as revenue slipped for the seventh straight quarter but topped expectations. Bear analysts focused on continued weakness in its core computer networking business as Cisco shifts to software and services via acquisitions. Analysts say Cisco's market share losses to Arista Networks (ANET) in network switching were again a factor in fiscal Q4.  For the current quarter, Cisco forecast profit and sales in line. Cisco fell 6.1% on Thursday-Friday, hitting its worst level since late January.Extreme Networks (EXTR) popped to a two-month high after the networking firm reported Wall Street-topping fiscal fourth-quarter sales and earnings, and raised its guidance for the September quarter.RELATED: Cisco Falls As Some Investors Lose Patience With TransitionHome improvement retailer Home Depot (HD) reported Q2 results that beat forecasts and raised its full-year outlook.

On Friday, Foot Locker (FL) badly missed earnings and same-store sales forecasts, predicting more trouble ahead. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) comps fell even more than it had said a few weeks ago, slashing full-year earnings guidance. Shares off all three sporting goods retailers tumbled to multiyear lows. Nike (NKE) recently struck a pilot deal to sell some products directly on Amazon (AMZN), another way in which the e-commerce giant has threatened the retail space. But Nike shares also fell on the brick-and-mortar retail woes.RELATED:Foot Locker Earnings Miss Badly, Hibbett Sports Outlook GrimOff-price stores, unlike some of its retail peers, did not get a case of the doldrums this quarter.

Meanwhile, TJX (TJX) profit edged up 1% to 85 cents a share on 6% revenue growth to $8.36 billion; the off-price chain also upped its full-year EPS guidance to $3.78-$3.82. TJX rose 0.8% on Wednesday, when it reported earnings, but closed the week down 0.8%.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) offloaded its stake in General Electric (GE) in the second quarter, among the notable moves to be found in big investors' quarterly disclosures of their holdings during the week. Appaloosa Management, Jana Partners and Moore Capital also parted ways with Snap (SNAP), amid the Snapchat parent's struggles to keep up with other social media sites like Facebook (FB). However, George Soros' Soros Fund Management remained a holdout on the company.The chip- and display-equipment maker late Thursday reported 33% growth in sales to $3.74 billion for its fiscal third quarter, topping Wall Street's views for $3.66 billion. Adjusted income of 86 cents per share grew 72% year over year and beat by 3 cents. Applied Materials (AMAT) popped 2.7% on Friday, retaking its 50-day line after falling below that support area on Thursday.Late Wednesday, NetApp (NTAP) narrowly topped fiscal first-quarter sales views with $1.33 billion, up 2%, and crushed adjusted profit views a 35% per-share gain. The data storage giant's Q2 revenue guidance was in line, but earnings guidance was short 3 cents at the midpoint. NetApp shares slid 5.2% for the week.Coach (COH) reported an 11% increase in Q4 earnings to 50 cents per share, beating analyst estimates by a penny. But sales fell 1.8% to $1.13 billion. The affordable luxury brand sees fiscal 2018 full year EPS of $2.35 to $2.40, under analyst expectations for $2.46, as the company works to fit its newly acquired Kate Spade brands into its business model. Analysts have been skeptical of the retail sector as Amazon (AMZN) continues to dominate. Coach shares plunged 15%.Netflix (NFLX) signed ""Scandal"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" creator Shonda Rhimes to create original shows for the internet TV giant, poaching her from Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC.Synopsys (SNPS) topped fiscal third-quarter sales views with $695.4 million and met consensus views with adjusted income of 92 cents per share. Synopsys fell 2.9% on Thursday but edged 1.2% for the week and remained just in buy range.BitAuto Holdings (BITA), a leading provider of online data and services for China's fast-growing automotive industry, reported second-quarter results that topped views, as revenue rose 52% to $320 million. BitAuto popped on Monday but closed the week up just 8 cents at 36.99.Advance Auto Parts (AAP) shares crashed 20% on Tuesday hitting their lowest levels since 2013 after the auto-parts retailer forecast a same-store sales drop for the year.

63,FL,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the day ahead.XAfter last week's department-store slump, more retailers are gearing up to report. And even though Home Depot (HD), TJX (TJX), Coach (COH), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) compete in separate categories — home improvement, off-price clothing, handbags, millennial apparel, athletic goods — there's little doubt that online behemoth Amazon and the broader shifting retail landscape are, to some degree, impacting them all.Analysts see the home-improvement retailer's Q2 per-share profit rising 12% to $2.21 on 5% revenue growth to $27.8 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Look for possible talk on the earnings call about Sears Holding's (SHLD) recent decision to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon (AMZN). Home-improvement retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's (LOW), which are big appliance sellers, sold off initially on that news. The sector generally has been  seen as having more of a buffer from the power of the e-commerce giant — but Amazon's foray into groceries, fashion and a host of other areas are enough to give retailers the jitters every time it makes a move.Shares dipped 0.4% to 154.26 in Monday's stock market trading. Home Depot, a Dow industrials component, is in a flat base with a 160.96 buy point.The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent is expected to report flat year-over-year EPS of 84 cents and 6% revenue gains to $8.32 billion.Off-price stores are another group that have, in the past, been labeled ""Amazon-proof"" as department stores struggle to adapt to a digital-first shopping environment. But growth has slowed for TJX and other off-price chains. Look for signs of continued resilience or potential chipping in its report. Off-price peer Ross Stores (ROST) reports later in the week.Shares fell 2.1% to 69.58. The stock is still trying to recover from a sharp sell-off that started in May.Purse and accessories maker Coach is seen growing profit by 9% to 49 cents a share while sales are expected to dip 0.7% to $1.15 billion.Handbag brands are in the midst of expanding their fashion houses, with Coach completing its $2.4 billion acquisition of Kate Spade last month, and competitor Michael Kors (KORS) announcing in late July that it's gobbling up luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo.Coach, Kors and others have had to tangle with discounting at department stores as they try to maintain an image of accessible luxury.Cultivating demand with millennial and Gen Z consumers also appears to be a priority for Coach: Pop star Selena Gomez is the latest face of the brand.Shares rose 0.7% to 47.90, near three-year highs.Speaking of young people, Urban Outfitters is projected to report a 44% profit decline to 37 cents a share on a 3% sales dip to $864 million.Specialty teen-apparel retailers have been particularly hard-hit in recent years, as younger consumers gravitate toward experiences and clothing sales remain soft. In early June, Urban Outfitters said that its same-store sales for the second quarter, which it is set to report on Tuesday, were then already ""high-single-digit negative.""Cowen has long forecast that Amazon will unseat Macy's (M) as the nation's largest apparel retailer this year.Urban Outfitters shares fell 0.2% to 17.73, still near recent eight-year lows.Consensus is for 23% EPS growth on nearly 11% sales gains to $2.18 billion.The athleticwear and sporting-goods retailer — which carries Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY) and other popular brands — was just one company whose stock took a hit in late June on news that Nike would be selling some of its footwear on Amazon.Dick's shares rose 2.7% to 34.91, but are near their worst levels since early 2012.Hibbett Sporting Goods (HIBB) and Foot Locker (FL) report later this week.Here's one company reporting Tuesday that's not like the others listed here. Wall Street expects China-based automotive online platform BitAuto (BITA) to post 22 cents EPS on $278.25 million in revenue, according to Yahoo Finance estimates.While still off its 2014 peak, the stock hit a two-year high on Monday, up 6.4% to 39.28.Rival Autohome (ATHM) reported strong results last week.RELATED:Giants Of China's Internet, U.S. Retail Lead Investing Action Plan J.C.

64,FL,"Shares of Hibbett Sports (HIBB) collapsed Monday after the athletic specialty chain, which has over 1,000 stores, said that ""very challenging sales trends"" are weighing on same-store sales to the tune of a 10% decline in the second quarter.Comps have only crumbled by 10% or more on only one other occasion, said Quo Vadis Capital's John Zolidis — the July quarter of the financial crisis, when same-store sales sank 10.5%.Hibbett said it now expects a per-share loss of 19-22 cents in Q2, while analysts see a profit of 15 cents a share.Birmingham, Ala.-based Hibbett also debuted its new e-commerce site, Hibbett.com, in addition to a ""newly enhanced"" loyalty program. The move to sell products online is a late one in an age in which consumers assume that ""omnichannel,"" or seamless offline-to-online shopping, is a given.Hibbett shares had 33.5% meltdown in the stock market today, closing at 13.10, the lowest since early 2009.Nike, Under Armour and Adidas are all carried at Hibbett, but shoppers looking to buy online can find those brands at Foot Locker (FL) or Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), or at the brands' own sites.Foot Locker shares fell 4.6%, and. Dick's lost 5.5%.In addition to investing heavily in its own direct-to-consumer efforts, athletic titan Nike (NKE) recently inked a deal to open it own brand shop on Amazon (AMZN). Under Armour (UAA) and Adidas (ADDYY) already have brand shops on Amazon and make products available to purchase on their own sites.But Hibbett executives insist that the company needed time to execute its plan properly.""Launching an e-commerce site has been a key strategic goal for Hibbett, and we took time to invest in our omnichannel infrastructure to do it the right way,"" said Hibbett CEO Jeff Rosenthal in a statement. ""Our main objective is to provide a seamless shopping experience for our customers with a platform that will allow us to significantly expand our assortment over time.""Zolidis said it is ""likely that some company-specific execution issue is behind the magnitude of the miss,"" and put Hibbett's weakness in the context of a slowing athletic trend, Nike's pullback from its wholesale customers as it invests in direct-to-consumer sales, and Hibbett's lack of an online shop until now.""As it turns out, those people living in small towns do have access to smartphones and they like the convenience of a larger selection and not having to drive to the store,"" he wrote. ""HIBB punctuated just how woefully late it is to offering e-commerce by announcing the final launch of this capability in the same press release today with the terrible news on sales and earnings.""RELATED:Nike Spikes To Buy Point After Scoring With Earnings, AmazonNike, Under Armour Retailer Hibbett Sinks On Weak Holiday

Revenue seen rising 7% to $1.075 billion.Results: Under Armour lost 3 cents a share with revenue up 9% to $1.09 billion. North America revenue fell 1% due to ""business lost to bankruptcies in 2017.""Outlook: Under Armour sees full-year revenue of 9%-11% vs. its prior forecast of 11%-12%. The company cited weakness in North America. Under Armour sees full-year adjusted EPS of 37-40 cents vs. Wall Street forecasts for 42 cents. The company also sees gross profit margins falling vs. a year earlier.Restructuring: ""We intend to meaningfully increase our go-to-market speed and amplify our digital capabilities,"" CEO Kevin Plank said in the earnings statement, with the company forecasting $110 million to $130 million in costs and related charges this year. Under Armour will cut 280 jobs, or about 2% of its workforce, in the effort.Stock: Shares plunged 8.6% to 18.30 on the stock market today, falling intraday to the lowest levels since August 2013. Deutsche Bank downgraded Under Armour last Tuesday to sell from hold with a 17 price target, citing an uncertain growth outlook and pricey valuation.Peer Nike (NKE) continues to flirt with a 59.10 buy point. Nike rose 1.3% to 59.84, moving back above that entry, though on below-average volume.In late June, Nike confirmed it will run a pilot deal with Amazon (AMZN) to sell shoes, clothes and accessories directly on the e-commerce giant.Retail is in a ""challenging"" spot, as execs like to remind analysts on earnings calls. Shares of specialty athletic goods retailer Hibbett Sports (HIBB) sank to 2009 levels after announcing that it expects to see a 10% same-store sales decline in its second quarter. Foot Locker (FL) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) also took a hit.

72,FL,"The S&P 500 index was slightly lower for the week even as Dow components Wal-Mart (WMT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) skyrocketed on strong earnings and hopes that the titans will continue to transition into faster-growth markets. The Dow's General Electric (GE) tumbled as Wall Street isn't sold on its turnaround plan. Tesla (TSLA) unveiled new future vehicles even as it struggles to get the Model 3 out the door and General Motors (GM) ramps up its electric car goals. Chinese internet leaders Tencent (TCEHY), JD.com (JD), YY (YY) and NetEase (NTES) all had strong earnings reports.The S&P 500 index fell 0.1% for the week while the Dow lost 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5% after hitting an all-time high Thursday. Wal-Mart, Cisco, NetApp (NTAP), Applied Materials (AMAT) and several Chinese internets helped, along with some up-and-down movement on tax cuts. General Electric was a disappointment.Wal-Mart per-share earnings unexpectedly rose 2% to $1 a share on 4% sales growth to $123.18 billion, including e-commerce growth of 50%. Investors were pleased, sending shares up 10.9% on Thursday to a record high. On Wednesday, Target (TGT) offered up weak guidance for the ""highly competitive"" holiday quarter. The discounter did top Q3 forecasts with a 12.5% EPS fall to 91 cents and 1.4% sales rise to $16.67 billion. Shares tumbled below their 200-day line on Wednesday but regained that key level by the end of the week.New General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery offered up a plan to turn around the troubled industrial giant, but Wall Street found GE's strategic vision held little that was new or bold. GE will reduce its footprint to just three key divisions — aviation, power and health care. Flannery also halved the profit outlook for 2018 and GE's rich dividends. Investors sent GE shares to a nearly six-year low.Cisco Systems (CSCO) surged to a 17-year high after the computer networking giant said it expects December-quarter revenue to rise 1%-3%, the first year-over-year gain in nearly two years. Cisco forecast earnings of 59 cents a share at its midpoint of guidance vs. estimates of 58 cents. Cisco reported strong demand for its new Catalyst 9000 network switches. The new switches are part of Cisco's plan to grow recurring subscription revenue. Deferred revenue rose 10% in the latest quarter.NetApp (NTAP) reported revenue of $1.42 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $1.38 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at 81 cents per share, ahead of views for 69 cents. The data storage and networking company also raised its outlook for the December quarter. Shares soared.T.J. Maxx parent TJX fell short of revenue estimates with sales of $8.76 billion but met EPS views with a 10% rise to $1 a share. The midpoint of Q4 profit guidance fell short of current forecasts, sending shares lower. Off-price peer Ross Stores, meanwhile, easily topped views with 16% profit gains to 72 cents a share as revenue grew 8% to $3.33 billion. Comps of 4% beat views for 2%, and Ross raised Q4 comp outlook. Ross shares surged Friday.Gap (GPS) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) rallied Friday on well-received Q3 reports from the apparel chains.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought more Apple (AAPL) shares in the third quarter and sold a huge share of its IBM (IBM) holdings, regulatory filings showed. The big investors clashed on the iPhone maker, which hit a record high in Q3. George Soros' Soros Fund Management dumped his entire stake, while David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital slashed its stake nearly in half, and David Tepper's Appaloosa doubled its stake. Outside tech, Berkshire kept faith with airlines. Soros loaded up consumer stocks.It was a good week or China internet companies as five of them reported quarterly results that all topped estimates. The big winner was YY (YY), a provider of livestreaming services. YY reported revenue of $464.8 million, smashing the consensus estimate of $423 million. Shares soared more than 20%. Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), a leader in gaming and messaging, saw its shares approach a new high on its quarterly results. China e-commerce company JD.com (JD) got a boost as well, as did 58.com (WUBA), called the Craigslist of China. Mobile gaming specialist NetEase (NTES) trounced earnings views, sending shares surging nearly 8% Thursday and almost 13% on Friday.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY)  earned an adjusted 78 cents a share in its third quarter, up 30% year over year, on sales of $9.32 billion, up 4%. But analysts expected 79 cents and $9.35 billion. Best Buy blamed the delayed launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone X and hurricanes in Texas and Florida for the Q3 disappointment. For the holiday quarter, Best Buy expects to earn $1.94 a share on sales of $14.35 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling for EPS of $2.03 on sales of $14.36 billion.Semiconductor-equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT) beat fiscal fourth quarter sales and earnings targets and guided higher for the current quarter. Its stock climbed to a record high on the news, finally eclipsing its previous record reached in April 2000 during the dot-com bubble. Another chip-gear stock getting a lift from a positive earnings report was Kulicke & Soffa Industries (KLIC). Also, semiconductor-equipment firm Lam Research (LRCX) got a boost after announcing a $2.3 billion capital return program.Biotechs were relatively beat up last week with a few key exceptions. Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX) continued taking hits Monday, diving nearly 10% on data in a pancreatic cancer trial using its drug, cabiralizumab, with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) blockbuster Opdivo. Pacira Pharmaceuticals (PCRX) lost 6.6% Tuesday after the Food and Drug Administration set a date for an advisory committee to discuss its drug, Exparel, as a regional anesthetic. Also Tuesday, Loxo Oncology (LOXO) led a biotech deluge as stocks broadly lost 1.9% after it agreed to codevelop two cancer drugs with Bayer (BAYRY) in a $1.55 billion deal. On Wednesday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) dipped to a five-month low after reporting five deaths in its late-stage Parkinson's disease studies. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) defied the trend, though, and rose to a nearly 17-year high Monday on a promising trial of its drug, NKTR-214, with Bristol's Opdivo in skin, kidney and lung cancers.Tesla (TSLA) unveiled an all-electric Semi truck with a higher-than-expected 500-mile battery range as well as a next-generation Roadster sports car. CEO Elon Musk said the new truck will start production in 2019, though Tesla has struggled with deadlines. In the meantime, JB Hunt (JBHT) and others plunked down $5,000 reservations, offering cash-burning Tesla more capital for its Model 3 rollout. Tesla shares rose a fraction Friday. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) plans to sell 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026. That aggressive new target hinges on a next-gen EV platform by 2021, with less costly batteries.Inflation appears to be firming, but hurricane recovery may be playing a role, new Labor Department data suggested. Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 1.8% from a year ago, with an annualized 2.4% gain over the past three months. Rent inflation has been behind the recent strength, but used car prices also bounced in October, likely a temporary effect of demand created when hurricanes Harvey and Irma destroyed hundreds of thousands of vehicles.While all evidence suggests the economy is on something of a roll, retail sales moderated after surging an upwardly revised 1.9% in September. The overall 0.2% gain edged past expectations, but came in on the weak side outside of autos with a 0.1% rise.Emirates announced an order for 40 Boeing (BA) 787-10s, valued at $15.1 billion at list prices, instead of the expected Airbus (EADSY) A380 order. Boeing also inked an order for 175 737 Max jets from discount carrier FlyDubai. Airbus had a surprise of its own, shocking industry watchers with a $49.5 billion order for 273 A320neo jets and 157 A321neos from U.S. investor Indigo Partners, the largest in Airbus' history. Even Bombardier (BDRBF) signed an order for its struggling CSeries line at the show. Boeing said the Middle East will need 3,350 new airplanes over the next 20 years, valued at $730 billion, up from its 2015 market outlook of 3,180 new planes.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported third-quarter earnings and sales that beat estimates. But the struggling retailer said earnings per share next year could fall by as much as 20%, citing flat same-store sales and plans to spend money on e-commerce, private brands and other investments. Dick's shares fell Tuesday but rose for teh week. However, Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) reported better-than-expected earnings, sending their shares soaring Friday. Mall-based Foot Locker said inventories are falling, good news for Nike (NKE). Hibbett Sports cited strong online sales, and raised full-year guidance.U.S. crude output hit a new high of 9.645 million barrels per day from a 9.62 million bpd in the week-ago report, the Energy Information Administration said. Stockpiles increased by 1.9 million barrels. Analysts expected a drop of 1 million barrels. In its World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency estimated that U.S. output would jump 25% — to 30 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 24 million currently. But the IEA also cut its 2017 and 2018 oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day. U.S. crude futures fell slightly for the week.RH (RH), the upscale furniture retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware gave preliminary Q3 earnings figures that were well above estimates and other guided 2018 revenue estimates higher. Shares soared 26% on Thursday. But upscale home furnishings chain Williams-Sonoma (WSM) tumbled 13% Friday on weak earnings.Data services provider Splunk (SPLK) reported third-quarter results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, with a revenue forecast above expectations, sending shares up 18% on Friday.Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) shares zoomed nearly 24% on Tuesday on the previous evening's after-hours Wall Street Journal report that private-equity firm Roark Capital had offered over $2.3 billion, or $150 a share, for the restaurant chain.Wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) rejected an unsolicited acquisition offer by Broadcom (AVGO), saying the proposed $130 billion deal undervalues the company. Broadcom was undeterred and indicated it could take its proposal directly to shareholders.Square (SQ) said it's in trials with a Bitcoin service that lets users of its Square Cash money-transfer app buy and sell the digital currency via an exchange.

75,FL,"Shoe and athletic-apparel chain Foot Locker (FL) reported strong fourth-quarter earnings on Friday as same-store sales popped.Earnings per share rose 18% to $1.37, the third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Analysts expected $1.32. Revenue grew 6% to $2.11 billion, in line with views. Same-store sales jumped 5%, better than forecasts for 4.6%.Foot Locker cited strong demand for Nike (NKE) shoes as well as some Adidas footwear. But it didn't mention struggling Under Armour (UAA), which already reported weak holiday results.Foot Locker sees current-year EPS rising by double digits vs. consensus for a 11% gain.Shares surged 9.4% to close at 75.01 on the stock market today, vaultiing over its 50-day moving average. Nike, which depends on Foot Locker for a lot of its sales, gained 0.8%. Under Armour edged 0.7% higher.Finish Line (FINL), another mall-based athletic shoe retailer, advanced 2.9%. Sporting goods chains Hibbett Sports (HIBB)  and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) climbed 2.6% and 1.9%, respectively.Earlier this month, Hibbett reported weak apparel and equipment sales during Q4 and gave weak guidance, ahead of its full Q4 report next month.Concerns have lingered that consumers were growing weary of the basketball genre as interest in more casual sneakers grows. While Nike management said in December that it is seeing ""incredible momentum"" in basketball and that ""basketball is back,"" Foot Locker, in November, said it saw lukewarm results in the basketball-shoe category during the third quarter.In addition to struggling under Amazon's (AMZN) retail choke-hold, the sports retail industry last year contended with the bankruptcies of chains like Sports Authority and Sports Chalet.Those chains may have drawn many bargain-seeking shoppers away from companies in better shape. Other analysts say Sports Authority customers have yet to make the leap to other athletic chains in the wake of the bankruptcy, according to Footwear News.In Q3 however, Foot Locker said U.S. store traffic increased. Casual throwback sneakers from Adidas, Puma and others have also helped sales. The company has also benefited from more health-conscious lifestyle and what it has called a ""casualization"" of the way people around the world wear clothing, although concerns about ""peak athleisure"" exist elsewhere.RELATED:How Mayhem, Drama Can Help The American Mall Cheat DeathUnder Armour CEO Knocks Trump Policy, But Damage To Cool Factor Seen

78,FL,"Nike's (NKE) fourth-quarter earnings and sales topper, as well as confirmation of its deal with Amazon.com, have lifted shares above a buy point Friday.The Swoosh shot up 12% to a 10-month high of 59.71 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, clearing a 59.10 entry from a flat base. Shares closed up 11% at 59, just below that buy point.XBut amid all the excitement about the stock surge, here are three key takeaways from Nike's earnings call late Thursday and analysts' reactions to it.Before the announcement to pilot-test the sale of products directly on Amazon (AMZN), Nike had already been focused on digital and direct-to-consumer selling via its own website and had touted the progress it was seeing.The Amazon deal, which includes certain Nike shoes, clothes and accessories, was reportedly made to guard against counterfeiting and third-party selling on the e-commerce site.Nike CEO Mark Parker said on the earnings call Thursday that the overall aim is to ""elevate the consumer experience by better segmenting and differentiating all of our channels.""That is to say, people like shopping on Amazon, and Nike could only hold out for so long.""NKE's intent is to elevate its brand presentation and storytelling across all channels, and we suspect AMZN will replace the distribution that does not do just that,"" said Canaccord Genuity's Camilo Lyon.For now, don't expect Nike — fiercely protective of its brand image — to start selling all of its merchandise on Amazon just yet.""It's really a small pilot and we have a very tailored assortment for Amazon, so that we can actually learn as we go through this,"" said Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards on the call.The company might want to proceed with caution, since it will still rely on retailers like Foot Locker (FL) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) to sell Nike products.""Two-thirds of NKE's business is still through legacy distribution channels and wholesale arrangements, indicating that the company should move carefully,"" wrote Quo Vadis Capital analyst John Zolidis.Analysts also see Nike sales on Amazon as less of a threat to Foot Locker and more of a threat to department stores, with UBS' Michael Binetti writing, ""... our sense is that product sold on AMZN is more likely to overlap with d-stores/family footwear chains than with FL/FINL.""Growth abroad is strong, but the North American market — where revenue edged up just 1% in Q4 — is still highly competitive.Nike CFO Andy Campion projected ""overall growth"" in North America in fiscal 2018 ""with slight contraction in the first part of the year as we aggressively drive the strategic shift.""For fiscal 2018, the company sees currency-neutral revenue growth in the mid- to high-single-digit range. Consensus is for about 6% revenue growth, according to Zacks Investment Research.Meanwhile, Adidas (ADDYY) continues to steadily nip at Nike's heels. And while Piper Jaffray likes Nike's new initiatives and its team-up with Amazon, ""(we) do not expect them alone to change athletic fundamentals as Adidas is focused on many similar initiatives already,"" wrote analyst Erinn Murphy.""Bottom line, despite initiatives, we worry NKE's embedded 2H recovery is dependent on an Adidas' stumble and near flawless execution given worsening digital/(same-store sales) trajectories,"" she said.Adidas shares were up 2.2%, and Under Armour (UAA) added 2.1%.RELATED:Nike, Micron, Regeneron Get Price Target Hikes; Walgreens Is A BuyNike Deal With Amazon Sends Dow Stock Soaring
"
79,FL,"Like a pro athlete, Nike (NKE) knows that it needs to tweak its strategy from time to time to stay competitive.XOn its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Wall Street will likely be looking for more commentary on the athletic footwear and apparel maker's new consumer-focused initiatives intended to keep it in sync with a digitally driven retail environment and ahead of rivals Adidas (ADDYY) and Under Armour (UAA). Nike's recent sales arrangement with Amazon (AMZN)? Expect questions about that too.For the quarter, Wall Street expects flat year-over-year per-share earnings of 49 cents on 4.5% revenue growth to $8.61 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. That would mark a second flat Q4 for EPS and a slight slowdown in sales growth.The results will come roughly two weeks after Nike announced a new ""consumer direct offense"" alignment. That effort reorganizes Nike's leadership and geographic structure and tightens its focus on a dozen key cities across the world that are expected to account for 80% of its projected growth through 2020.Part of Nike's new game plan also involves what it calls a ""triple double"" goal to double innovation, speed to market and direct engagement with customers. The plan also includes laying off 2% of its global workforce. Nike shares fell more than 3% on June 15, the day of the news.Nike and other major athletic apparel and footwear brands are all developing manufacturing and supply-chain technologies to get on-trend products on shelves faster. Under Armour this week also announced a leadership shuffle of its own, reviving its COO position.The sluggish retail environment has raised questions about how and where individual brands will sell their products, as brick-and-mortar stores like Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) struggle to shore up store traffic amid competition from Amazon and off-price chains.Nike will reportedly sell footwear directly on Amazon in an attempt to combat the sale of knockoff goods at the e-commerce giant. That could spell trouble for J.C. Penney and Kohl's (KSS), Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom said last week.Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) immediately took a hit on news of a possible Nike-Amazon team-up — perhaps not without reason. Nike, Adidas, Hanesbrands (HBI)-owned Hanes and Under Armour are the most frequently bought brands on Amazon, Morgan Stanley said in April.As Nike dials down the emphasis on its self-created ""futures orders"" — a metric designed to reflect retailer demand — it is dialing up its own in-house manufacturing and selling capabilities, with aims to halve its product-creation cycle and streamline its brick-and-mortar and online retail experiences.Still, Cowen this month trimmed its price target on Nike to 53 from 54 on increased promotional activity amid its rivalry with Adidas and Under Armour, and JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight.Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole said earlier this month that the market is expecting Nike to guide fiscal 2018 profit below consensus for $2.52 per share — Zacks currently puts consensus at $2.44 — but that those expectations have already been priced into the stock. He has an equal-weight rating on the stock.Given ""poor"" sentiment and high short interest in Nike, Sole sees bulls snapping up shares of the athletic brand after the market digests the company's full-year guidance on Thursday.Nike shares closed up 0.8% at 53.36 on the stock market today, hitting resistance on the underside of their converging 50-day and 200-day lines. The stock is up less than 5% so far in calendar 2017, underperforming the S&P 500.

80,FL,"XFinish Line (FINL) reported first-quarter sales results below Wall Street estimates Friday as reports Nike (NKE) could start selling its wares on Amazon (AMZN) threaten sports gear retailers. But shares soared in morning trade.Finish Line's earnings tumbled 42.5% to 23 cents per share, in line with analyst estimates. But sales fell 6.1% to $429.8 million, under views for $431.6 million. Same-store sales fell 1.1%.""Following low-single digit comparable sales growth for the combined March/April period, weak traffic trends, and a difficult product launch comparison in May resulted in comps coming in below plan,"" CEO Sam Sato said in the release.Management sees Q2 comparable store sales declining in the low-single digits range. For the year, Finish Line sees comps increasing in the low-single digits range. The athletic shoe retailer sees full-year EPS of $1.12 to $1.23, with the midpoint above analyst expectations of $1.14.Finish Line shares fell more than 3% at one point before the opening bell, but soared 7.4% to 13.67 on the stock market today. Finish Line had fallen nearly 10% in June through Thursday, with the stock recently hitting its worst levels in nearly seven years.Amazon shares rose 0.2%. Nike shares, down about 1% early, rose 0.9%.Athletic wear is the latest retail sector to feel pressure from Amazon. According to a Bloomberg report earlier this week Nike will start selling its shoes on the online marketplace to stop the sale of counterfeit products.Shopping online means fewer trips to the mall and to Finish Line, Foot Looker (FL), Hibbett Sports (HIBB) or Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS).But some analysts say the an Amazon-Nike deal might not include Nike's whole line-up.RELATED: Nike, Adidas Have This 'Major Roadblock' Against Amazon

81,FL,"Word on the Street is that Nike (NKE) will start selling its wares directly on Amazon (AMZN). That means shares of sports stores Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) are taking their turn at having an Amazon-induced anxiety attack Wednesday.X ""Our channel checks indicate that NKE could be close to finalizing an agreement to sell directly on Amazon.com as a wholesaler,"" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann in an early Wednesday note to clients.By midday, Bloomberg had reported, citing a source familiar with the matter, that Nike would sell footwear directly on Amazon through a brand-registry program in a bid to combat knockoff Nikes from appearing on the site.Nike, Adidas (ADDYY), Hanes (owned by Hanesbrands (HBI)) and Under Armour (UAA) are the most frequently bought brands on the site, per an April report from Morgan Stanley, which means Amazon is already a hot destination for customers looking for athleticwear.For Nike specifically, that could bring in an extra $300 million to $500 million in wholesale revenue from Amazon alone, estimated Goldman Sachs, which also said that such a partnership could allow Nike better control over its brand and inventory on the site, as well as access to coveted millennial shoppers.But that could mean fewer ring-ups at the cash register for sports apparel and equipment retailers. Foot Locker shares sank 5% to close at 47.82 in the stock market today, hitting a three-year low. Foot Locker is down more than 20% so far in June after crashing 23% in May.Dick's Sporting Goods tumbled fell 3.8% to the lowest in more than a year. Finish Line (FINL) lost 4% and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) shed 4%, with both falling to their worst levels since 2010.Nike did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Its shares finished 2% higher. Under Armour fell 0.8%, and Amazon rose 1%.It is worth pointing out that if such a deal were indeed to happen, it is not clear whether that would open Nike's entire arsenal of popular apparel and footwear brands to Amazon's reach — an important distinction when it comes to discussing the impact of a potential team-up on Nike's brand image and on sporting goods retailers.We do not know the scope here— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) June 21, 2017Morgan Stanley, in a separate note from earlier this month, had already surmised that athletic apparel brands would sell directly to Amazon (instead of avoiding it altogether, like some retailers), but that they would have an ""appropriate-sized presence there,"" with products and price points that ""won't compromise the integrity of the offering elsewhere.""Nike is notably building out its own direct-to-consumer shops and online platform — so much so that it has muted the importance of its retailer-based ""futures"" metric —  and all the major athletic brands are developing their supply chain and manufacturing technology to increase speed to market.""The big athleticwear brands will offer much better product on non-Amazon channels,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts on June 6. ""If consumers want the hot fashion or the personalized products, they won't be able to get it on Amazon.""Notably, however, smaller rival Under Armour already sells direct on Amazon and through licensed dealers on Amazon Marketplace, said Goldman Sachs, an aspect which gives the Baltimore-based brand ""a clear edge over (Nike) in how fresh product was presented on Amazon.com.""Some worry about what Nike sales on Amazon would mean for the e-commerce giant's development of its own private apparel labels.Would signal Nike's death as Amazon is launching private labels and Nike would supply them with the data needed to build their athleisure.— Chris Burns (@archbyccb) June 21, 2017But Morgan Stanley's analysts said — at least, prior to Wednesday's chatter — that ""no private label maker will likely have a supply chain as fast that can deliver as much fashion newness, and this would be a major roadblock for Amazon because it too aims to move to a fast fashion model.""RELATED:Nike To Shrink Workforce As Stores Seen 'Canceling' Under ArmourNike, Adidas Have This 'Major Roadblock' Against Amazon

88,FL,"Call it the Return of the Three Stripes. The Superstar, revived. Adidas is ""back from the dead in the U.S.,"" and it's a ""BIG DEAL,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Randal Konik on Monday. It's No. 1 probable victim? Under Armour (UA).Online searches for ""Adidas"" have risen into the double digits over the last two years, he said, and athlete endorsements plus celebrity collaborations from the likes of Kanye West and Pharrell Williams have been fueling interest in the brand.""We think its resurgence within athletic apparel and footwear could pose a credible threat to UA,"" he wrote, though Nike (NKE) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) will likely remain unscathed.Under Armour not too long ago bumped Adidas from the No. 2 spot in activewear brands in the U.S. Now, Adidas' ""dominant"" presence at Foot Locker (FL), Finish Line (FINL) and other sportswear stores could mean pushback vs. Under Armour as they jostle for second place to market leader Nike.""Over the past few years, we believe (Under Armour)'s stellar growth in men's apparel and growing presence in footwear has come at the expense of shelf space for Adidas, especially since Nike has remained strong,"" Konik wrote. ""Now with Adidas starting to come back, we think UA (where expectations are high) could see downside risk.""Konik isn't alone in his view. Following Adidas earnings, Cowen's John Kernan noted that Under Armour is ""likely seeing increased competition in (North) America"" from the Germany-based brand.Adidas noted 22% constant-currency sales growth in North America, a steep bump from 7% growth in the prior-year Q1.Amid the comeback play by Adidas, which is prepping for a transition to a new CEO later this year, Under Armour has been losing some of its top brass, including its chief merchandising officer and chief digital officer.Under Armour shares finished unchanged on the stock market today after sliding almost 12% last week.And what about Nike? The Swoosh isn't budging.""Bearing in mind that Adidas’ N. America biz is roughly 1/7th that of Nike’s, we believe any share shift would be minor at this stage and more likely (to) come at the expense of other brands,"" said Konik. ""It’s also probable that Adidas’ strength is helping to expand the overall market as well.""Nike shares closed up 0.5%.Foot Locker climbed 2.3%.

98,FL,"Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY) are in a heated race to evolve their supply chains and manufacturing technologies in order to get new product to market faster. But their innovations — digitized design, automated production, 3D printing — could also increase their share gains and create a shield against another rival: brick-and-mortar killer Amazon.com (AMZN).""Essentially, as brands and their retail partners get faster, they basically can offer a service level similar to what Amazon has, so the brands won't need Amazon as much as other vendors will,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts, adding that the major athleticwear brands are poised to offer better products on their own sites and non-Amazon channels.Nike and Adidas have each made moves to increase speed to market, shedding the old model in which new shoe styles could take up to 18 months to plod from conception to store shelves. In their deep-dive report, released Wednesday, the analysts pointed to these efforts leading to a 66%-or-more cut in supply chain lead times, reducing the chance of having ""bad"" (read: excessive, slow-moving) inventory and increasing sportswear makers' odds of keeping up with the latest trends. That could add an additional 15% to top-line growth, they said.They also projected almost 20% of Nike and Adidas' production being automated by fiscal 2023, a contrast from, say, Adidas' less-than-0.5% Speedfactory creations this year.The shift means that e-commerce giant Amazon might be the one catching up on nabbing the latest fashion or personalized products.""After the supply chain changes take hold, almost no small brand or private label footwear maker for the foreseeable future will be able to offer comparable quality products to what Nike and Adidas have at similar prices,"" they wrote.""Moreover, no private label maker will likely have a supply chain as fast that can deliver as much fashion newness and this would be a major roadblock for Amazon because it too aims to move to a fast fashion model.""Nike shares inched down 3 cents to close at 53.20 on the stock market today, peeping above its 200-day moving average for the first time in almost a month before giving up gains. U.S.-listed shares of Adidas fell 2.1% to 94.50. Under Armour (UAA) jumped 3% to 21.16, while Amazon ticked up 20 cents to 1,010.27.Plus, image-conscious athletic brands are likely to keep a close watch on what products of theirs are sold on Amazon. Calling brand image the ""biggest and most important asset"" for Nike and Adidas, analysts said they tend to lean toward presentation-friendly retailers like Foot Locker (FL).Aside from Nike and Adidas, Morgan Stanley says it sees Foot Locker and Flex (FLEX) (a high-tech manufacturing partner of Nike's) as winners from these industry changes.""Companies such as Under Armour, Skechers (SKX), and Wolverine World Wide (WWW) are working just as hard as their bigger rivals, but our view is they have a long way to go to catch up to Nike and Adidas,"" said analysts.Morgan Stanley sees sales in the athletic wear industry growing to $355 billion in 2021, which translates to 7% annual global growth from the current $290 billion market.RELATED:Nike Vows To Halve Product Cycle To 'Weeks, Not Months'; Stock Falls On Sales, MarginsVictoria's Secret, Nike Are Great, But Amazon Is Millennials' 'Most-Loved': SurveyFoot Locker Stock Plunges As Q1 Earnings, Sales Fall Short As Nike, Under Armour Stars Face Off Again, Here's What's Different

Boeing said it had ""incremental orders and commitments"" of 571 airplanes, valued at $74.8 billion at list prices. But analysts said ""a staggering 64%"" of Boeing's orders at the show weren't firm. Airbus said it booked firm orders of 144 planes valued at $18.5 billion and memorandums of understanding for 182 aircraft valued at $21.2 billion. Analysts weren't expecting many deals in Paris, but orders were double the $50 billion seen at last year's show in Farnborough, England. Boeing shares rose about 3% for the week, hitting new highs. Airbus set a record high Monday, but pared its weekly gain to 0.9%.RELATED: Why Boeing's Paris Air Show Orders Are 'Staggering''Hybrid' Design For New Boeing Midrange Jet Could Hit This Sweet SpotWhy Lockheed May Move F-16 Production To India From TexasOracle (ORCL) earnings easily topped views while revenue advanced 3% as the software giant's overall cloud revenue shot up 64% vs. a year earlier.

That hit Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), TJX (TJX) and more. Meanwhile, Bloomberg sources said Nike (NKE) would sell footwear directly on Amazon via a brand-registry program, sending shares of already-reeling Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Foot Locker (FL) and others sharply lower. But Finish Line (FINL) rebounded Friday despite mixed quarterly results.Meanwhile, Whole Foods Market (WFM) pushed a little further beyond the 42-a-share takeover price from Amazon, leading some to wonder if another bidder could be ready to emerge with an even bigger offer than $13.7 billion. Barclays said it ""would not be surprised is there is a bidding war,"" and JPMorgan analysts have pegged Wal-Mart (WMT) as a possible contender.

100,FL,"Yet again, an NBA Finals that pits the Cleveland's LeBron James against Golden State's Steph Curry. Thus, yet again, another round of ""But what shoe company will win at the cash register?""Beyond the repeat matchup from last year, some things will still be the same when the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors square off for Game 1 on Thursday. LeBron's shoes are still Nikes (NKE). Curry still wears Under Armour (UAA), and his signature shoes are still getting roasted on the internet. A ratings boom could translate into a windfall for both companies, even amid concerns about casual footwear chewing away at basketball-shoe sales.Despite this being the third straight championship with the Cavs and Warriors, a few things are different this time around — namely, Kevin Durant, Donald Trump, and increasing alarm out of the retail sector.Last year, the Warriors didn't have Durant, who enters the finals with his own signature-shoe launch from Nike. The new shoe could lend the athletic-footwear giant, which still accounts for far more market share than Under Armour more star power this year and promotional intrigue.About that promotion: A version of the new KDX sneaker, Durant's 10th signature, will be available on Thursday through Nike's SNKRS app starting at tipoff. But they'll only be available for purchase during the minutes when Durant is actually on the court during Game 1.Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel said in a research note that the KDX shoes ""have been sold out on Nike.com, and multiple stores we checked noted they did not receive pairs (although select locations did highlight having some sizes available).""Nike also said the LeBron Soldier 11 Court General would be available on Saturday. That shoe, the company said, was made ""with direct insight from the top scorer in playoff history"" and featured a gold swoosh intended as ""a nod to LeBron's quest for his fourth championship.""What's more, last year, the United States didn't have President Trump, who has presented a PR problem for Under Armour.In February, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said Trump was an ""asset"" to the U.S. In response, Curry, who supported Trump's election rival, Hillary Clinton, said that word choice was appropriate ""if you remove the 'et.'""Plank later tried to clarify his comments about Trump, taking out a full-page ad in the Baltimore Sun to say that the company stood ""firmly for equal rights"" and was ""publicly opposing"" Trump's travel ban.Backlash aside, the vacuum in the retail industry has only deepened over the past year. ""Peak athleisure"" for Under Armour has been a concern.Adidas throwback shoes have hurt Nike and Under Armour, but Foot Locker (FL) this month said the demand cycle for retro shoes has also been ""slowing down."" Sluggish sales related to the NBA All-Star Game in February and delayed tax refunds hurt overall U.S. athletic-footwear unit sales, which fell 2% in the first three months of this year, NPD Group said.And Under Armour in April said sales of its Curry shoes were ""sluggish.""Nike shares were up 0.1% at 52.99 on the stock market today, while Under Armour fell 2% to 19.16.IBD'S TAKE: Even as Under Armour struggles, one analyst in March said that the 'bottom' for its stock has formed, making for a possible buy opportunity. Last June, the austere white signatures released under Curry's name were seen as a kind of accidental foray into norm-core, and were likened to the bathtubs in a Cialis ad and photoshopped into a still from ""Forrest Gump.""In April, it happened again. Curry's new line of ""Oxblood Leather"" shoes were compared to ""a PT cruiser for your feet,"" ""the leather seats to an Acura"" and ""what Darth Vader wears when walking on a treadmill in a hotel gym at 6 a.m.""Curry has worn different versions of the Under Armour Curry 3ZERO during the playoffs, while Nike has rolled out new LeBron shoes during that time. Either way, many of Nike's Jordans series led sales in Q1, according to NPD Group.RELATED:Macy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will WorkJ.C.

104,FL,"Nike (NKE) missed third-quarter revenue forecasts and offered fiscal 2017 guidance that came in below views, prompting shares to tumble 4% in Wednesday morning trade but hold above their 50-day line.However, analysts generally remain bullish on the athletic wear market leader as China's performance stood out, North American inventory levels appeared to normalize, and futures orders growth of 17% exceeded expectations during the quarter.Here's what they had to say:Jefferies Edward Plank cut his price target to 74 from 76 but reiterated a buy rating, citing ""strong underlying demand coupled with a compelling slate of new product innovations and sporting events over the course of the year"" as driving optimism.Nike management said during the call that it is investing in ""significant brand initiatives"" early in fiscal 2017 that include the Rio Olympics and European Football Championships. It sees low-teens EPS growth for 2017, weighted more toward the latter half of the fiscal year due to those brand investments and ""also due to unfavorable FX comparisons being more pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year.""""But its long term prospects are very favorable, given the brand's vibrant health globally and likelihood for numerous product launches and major sports catalysts to fuel demand and results beyond current expectations,"" wrote Plank.Nike's business ""remains very healthy,"" said Sterne Agee CRT's Sam Poser, adding that the company's product and innovation pipeline are ""incredibly robust.""

105,FL,"Last week, Nike (NKE) gave consumers a peek into a future of self-lacing shoes and more footwear with knit uppers. Meanwhile, one analyst has provided a glimpse into third-quarter futures orders growth -- a key metric for the sports footwear and apparel maker that indicates demand.Profit-wise, Nike's Q3 earnings are expected to grow 7% to 48 cents a share, ending a string of six straight quarters of double-digit EPS growth ranging from 18%-28%. Wall Street analysts expect revenue growth to ramp up to 10%, however, to $8.2 billion. That would reflect a quarter-over-quarter acceleration from 4% revenue growth in the previous quarter.On Monday, JPMorgan Chase added Nike to its Analyst Focus List as a growth strategy pick, saying channel checks point to continued sales growth and ""rational"" promotions and inventory levels. Nike also reportedly hired a top footwear designer from rival Under Armour (UA).Aside from earnings and revenue, futures orders -- which are orders scheduled for delivery to retailers over the next several months -- are another stat that will get close inspection from analysts and investors when Nike reports Tuesday after the close.In Q2, the company logged currency-neutral growth of 20% in futures orders. Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu had called the figure ""absolutely astounding"" and above consensus estimates for midteens growth.Investors shouldn't expect to see quite the same spike in futures orders this time around, according to Sterne Agee CRT analyst Sam Poser, who is predicting a 13.4% currency-neutral increase in futures orders for the quarter.""We . . . contend the 20% increase in FX-neutral futures at the end of 2Q was an anomaly,"" he wrote Wednesday, but added that any deceleration in futures orders growth should ""not be cause for concern.""""For a company that posts $30B in annual sales, 13% growth is still very impressive,"" he said.Nike remains the dominant force in athletic footwear and sportswear, but Under Armour has been hustling to score more market share from the legacy brand. And Adidas is working on a turnaround after slipping to the No. 3 position to Under Armour in recent years.Both Under Armour and Adidas are getting more love during March Madness. But Nike likely won't fall to its competitors anytime soon.""We believe the recent strength of Adidas add more focus to the sports business, and will do nothing to slow Nike's momentum,"" wrote Poser, who has a buy rating and 75 price target on the stock.And with the Olympics in just a few months, investors can perhaps expect to hear some chatter about the games on the company's conference call.Jefferies analyst Edward Plank believes ""trends through the quarter, coupled with (Foot Locker)'s recent results and comments about the health of the athletic cycle, point to potential upside as well as a positive forward outlook and likelihood for futures growth to exceed expectations.""Nike shares rose 0.3% to 64.90 on the stock market today.

""(Foot Locker) is the greatest beneficiary of the ongoing strength of Nike (NKE), and new momentum from Under Armour (UA) and Adidas.""Nike, Under Armour and other activewear brands have been flourishing amid the ongoing ""athleisure"" trend. The shoe makers reported healthy sales gains Friday, with Under Armour nearly doubling last year's numbers.""We firmly believe that the bear thesis of peak margins and the death of the athletic business are completely wrong,” wrote Poser, who said the firm would be “aggressively” buying Foot Locker.Looking at the year ahead, Foot Locker management said it expects mid-single digit same-store sales growth and double-digit earnings gains. Analysts expect $4.75 in per-share earnings for the year, an 11% rise.""Building on those leadership positions, we believe we can continue to elevate our financial performance in 2016 by generating a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and another double-digit-percentage increase in earnings per share,"" said CEO Richard Johnson in a statement.But foreign exchange had a ""substantially negative impact on EPS growth"" last year, wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson, who sees it potentially weighing on the company this year as well.""While we continue to expect good assortment/store execution in a growing basketball and running footwear market, we expect FL's 2016 outlook to be conservative, reflecting a competitive retail environment and the potential for FX headwinds,"" she said.

108,FL,"Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is getting some love from analysts ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report, as the company's too-sheer yoga pants and controversial founder's comments of yesteryear are becoming a distant memory.The yoga apparel company's profits are seen edging up almost 3% to 80 cents a share when it reports results Wednesday. Analysts expect revenue to grow 15% to $693.4 million.Shares fell 0.6% to 60.52 in the stock market today, just above their 50-day line at 60.48. Lululemon Athletica logged a 17% EPS decline and 14% revenue rise in its previous quarter.Lululemon has a devoted following, but its offerings face mounting competition not just from athletic peers Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA), but also from a swath of other companies looking to capitalize on the ""athleisure"" apparel style that remains in vogue.Outlook for the year ahead will guide Lululemon's shares following the earnings report.""Sentiment is bullish ahead of 4Q, but a conservative 1Q guide could drive (near-term) downside given its recent run,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger in mid-March. ""Any pullback creates a buying opportunity, as we see upward EPS revisions and a strong year ahead.""Greenberger, who calls Lululemon the investment bank's ""favorite turnaround story,"" has an overweight rating and 68 price target on the stock.Three years ago, Lululemon had to deal with a recall debacle involving a crop of yoga pants that exposed more than consumers were hoping for. Later in the year, Lululemon founder Chip Wilson told Bloomberg that some women's bodies just ""don't work"" for the pant, a comment that many perceived as a slam on heavier customers. Wilson resigned from Lululemon's board a little over a year ago.Analysts are now looking past all that.""The logistics issues of 2Q '15 and 3Q '15 will be fully behind the company by 2016,"" wrote Sterne Agee CRT analyst Sam Poser, who rates the stock a buy with a 68 price target. ""The impact of the LULU founder's comments in November '13 are in the rearview mirror. LULU continues to improve its customer engagement and store execution.""He expects currency-neutral same-store sales growth, including online sales, to rise 6%.And Wedbush's Morry Brown holds an outperform rating and 72 price target on the stock.

The stock was able to retake its 50-day line last month, but has still yet to retake its 200-day line.Similarly, Skechers (SKX) is above its 50-day line but below the longer-term 200-day line. Shares are trading 40% below their August peak, and lost 3.1% Monday.And Foot Locker (FL) is trading 19% below its September high as it continues to consolidate. The stock fell 1%.Last week, sporting goods retailer Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy.

119,FL,"Under Armour (UA) reported a solid third-quarter earnings and sales beat, but that was overshadowed Tuesday morning by lowered growth projections, despite management's bullish assurances that it has the long-term game in mind.""While we expect to continue to significantly outpace the apparel industry, the growth rate going forward will be less than expected than investor day in 2015,"" said Under Armour CFO Chip Molloy in prepared remarks, outlining plans to ""invest more heavily in areas that we can grow faster,"" such as footwear, international and direct-to-consumer as it ""aggressively"" enters the sports lifestyle and sport fashion categories.""We could choose to optimize for more near-term profits but we believe it is more prudent to invest to maintain superior growth rates while gaining both share and scale,"" he said.At last year's investor day meeting, management planned for operating income of $800 million by 2018, a 23% compound annual growth rate.While it upheld broader revenue goals of $7.5 billion by 2018, Molloy said the company sees annual operating income growth ""in the midteens in each of the next two years as we focus on investing to get big fast.""Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, sounding agitated at times during the earnings call, repeatedly hammered home the point that his growth plans required more investment dollars in the short term.""We're not saying we're losing money,"" he said, ""we're moving and marching forward.""But investors fled, with shares nose-diving 13% to close at 32.89 on the stock market today. Under Armour has been under its 200-day moving average for most of the last 11 months.Meanwhile, Nike (NKE) shares finished 1.6% lower.Plank also laid out three key areas for Under Armour: ""getting big fast, making retail a core competency, and getting more shoes on feet.""Funding growing markets abroad might require additional investments in the near future, but they are ""central"" to the goal of market leadership, he told analysts on the call.Under Armour's footwear and international segments are performing better than the management expected, but the lost revenue from the recent sporting goods retailer bankruptcies — such as Sports Authority and Sports Chalet — weighed on the quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Adidas first made inroads with the runway set, then came back with a vengeance for the retro-loving, sneaker-wearing masses. Now it's poised to get the spotlight this holiday season: ""Uh-Oh, Nike, Under Armour — Adidas Is 'It' Brand This Christmas."" Other costs are in play. Sponsorship partnerships are now 10- to 15-year deals, up from 5-year agreements, he said, citing the 15-year UCLA partnership.Plank said he is ""looking honestly at this moment in time and saying it is time for us to invest.""CFO Molloy said that as the company approaches the $10 billion revenue mark and gains scale, it should see gross margin improvement and be able to leverage its investments in IT systems, distribution and other areas.In the short term, however, gross margin should be ""flat"" over the next couple of years, Molloy told analysts.Before the call, at least one analyst didn't seem fazed.""While this is clearly below our expectations, we believe the sell-off in the stock is overdone and would be buyers on weakness,"" wrote Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy early Tuesday.The company's quarter, by numbers, below:Estimates: Profit growth of 9% to 25 cents a share on 21% sales gains to $1.46 billion.Results: Earnings rose 23% to 29 cents a share as sales climbed 22% to $1.47 billion. But gross margins fell to 47.5% from 48.8% a year earlier ""reflecting negative impacts from the timing of liquidation, increased promotions, and foreign exchange rates.""Outlook: Q4 revenue growth of 20%, below consensus views for 22.2% growth. Management sees 2016 gross margin shrinking by 0.80 percentage points and slowing growth in the North American apparel business.Bonus detail: On Monday, Under Armour rolled out plans to launch the Curry 3 next week. The sneakers will retail at $140, slightly pricier than previous iterations. And if there are concerns about Kevin Durant nicking some of Steph Curry's Golden State glow — and Curry shoe sales — don't be worried, say R.W.

122,FL,"Under Armour (UA) is no longer a smart-alecky young upstart but a well-known contender in athletic apparel, talked about in the same breath as Nike (NKE) and settled in the good graces of American teenagers.Yet sales threaten to slow, if Street estimates are correct, when Under Armour reports early Tuesday.Earnings are expected to rise 9% to 25 cents a share. Sales should grow 21% to $1.46 billion, which would mark both a sequential and year-over-year revenue deceleration.Under Armour shares closed down 0.1% at 37.90 on the stock market today. The stock has been trading sideways for the last month or so, remaining below their key 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Its peers haven't been doing much better. Nike stock rose 0.2%, but has been steadily sliding further below its two key averages since early September.Still, a solid swath of Wall Street has a positive view of Under Armour, with outperform, overweight, positive or buy ratings from the likes of Baird, Cowen, Piper Jaffray, Susquehanna and Mizuho Securities.The Sports Authority and Sports Chalet bankruptcies are in the rearview mirror, and Kohl's (KSS) will start carrying Under Armour merchandise nationwide in early 2017, which Cowen analysts see benefiting the brand by $400 million to $700 million in annual wholesale volume.Other positives from Q3 likely include: solid exposure at the Rio Olympics, back-to-school shopping season and Stephen Curry's Under Armour-branded tour of China as the company aggressively expands its reach in international markets.And Piper Jaffray's latest teen survey indicate that while Adidas might be the hot brand of the holidays, Under Armour is edging up in the rankings.However, Morgan Stanley remains typically bearish on the stock with an underweight rating, citing faster-than-anticipated brand maturation and valuation concerns.IBD's TAKE: Adidas first made inroads with the runway set, then came back with a vengeance for the retro-loving, sneaker-wearing masses.

123,FL,"Adidas (ADDYY) is on a tear. Fiscal 2016 saw the athletic footwear and apparel brand raise its guidance four times, and its view-topping first quarter of 2017, reported late Wednesday, shows that momentum in North America is ""break(ing) out,"" according to Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy in a Thursday note.And it looks like Adidas is gaining shelf space in stores as market data points to major growth in footwear.In the key North America market, where competition remains fierce, revenue surged 31%, including a 36% jump at the flagship Adidas brand.""We believe this strength is supported by distribution gains across the space including accounts like Journeys, Foot Locker, Dick's,"" said Murphy.That strength is perhaps made more impressive by the fact that sales in the U.S. athletic footwear market dropped 3% in the first three calendar months of 2017, according to new NPD Group data.Adidas footwear sales rose nearly 85% during that period, NPD said, vs. Nike's (NKE) ""high single-digit"" decline. Under Armour (UAA) shoe sales fell in the double digits, ""though the brand's expansion into national chains helped offset significant losses in the athletic specialty/sporting goods channel,"" wrote NPD's Matt Powell.Adidas' U.S. shares rose 1.4% to 100.65 at the close on the stock market today. Nike, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, dipped 6 cents to 54.47. Under Armour ticked up to 20.42.Still, Nike's remains king of the court in the U.S. The Swoosh has projected $20 billion in North America revenue by 2020, compared to Adidas' previously announced goals for about $5.3 billion within the same time frame.""The clear momentum into 2017 for adidas suggests that its competitor Nike may not be out of the woods yet and Under Armour will have a much tougher time defending its turf in (North America),"" wrote Murphy.Journeys and Lids parent Genesco (GCO) ""remains the best way to play adidas in small cap,"" and Foot Locker ""likely continues to benefit from the strength in the adidas brand,"" she added.IBD'S TAKE: Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted told IBD in March that its previous strategy ""has given room for a Nike to grow, and also for an Under Armour,"" and is ""still in catch-up mode."" But the company is storming back in the U.S.Genesco fell 1.5%. Foot Locker (FL) shares lost 1%. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) dipped 0.3%.Overall in Q1, Adidas' currency neutral revenue grew 16%, or 19% in euro terms, to 5.671 billion euro, fueled by ""double-digit increases"" in the running and outdoor segments, said the company, in addition to its ""originals"" and Adidas Neo units.

Back on the retailer's Q4 conference call on Feb. 24, executives had said this quarter would be challenging.On Thursday, Foot Locker blamed the delay in tax refund checks.""We believe the delay in the issuance of the vast majority of income tax refund checks until after the NBA All-Star Game significantly affected our February comparable store sales, which were down low-double digits,"" said CEO and Chairman Richard Johnson.But Johnson noted that March comps rose in the ""high-single digits"" and said April comps are likely up in the ""low double digits, which we see as confirmation that the customer's appetite for our exciting product assortments has not changed.""Foot Locker shares initially crashed nearly 8% in the premarket on the news, but reversed higher and traded up 5.4% to 76.55 on the stock market today, vaulting above the 50-day moving average.

132,FL,"Analysts backpedaled Monday from a collective theory in February that cybersecurity spending would slump in 2016, while CyberArk Software (CYBR) garnered an upgrade on continued acquisition chatter.IBD's 25-company Computer Software-Security industry group toppled 7.4% and 7.2% in back-to-back sessions last month after Tableau Software (DATA) and LinkedIn (LNKD) issued gloomy guidance. Since then, however, the group has rebounded 28%.""Based on conversations post-RSA, our security spending concerns have diminished,"" Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury wrote in a research report Monday, referring to the annual RSA cybersecurity conference this month in San Francisco, which more than 40,000 people attended.CyberArk's bread and butter -- privileged account security -- remains a top spending priority in 2016, Nandury wrote. He upgraded CyberArk stock to a buy and boosted his price target to 50 from 30.Nandury noted his upgrade is supported ""with persistent chatter of CyberArk as a potential acquisition candidate, while limiting downside from current levels."" Last month, rumors arose that fellow Israeli firm Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) might be eyeing CyberArk.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, CyberArk stock was up a fraction, near 39. The IBD security software group was down a fraction, hurt by a 16% plunge for NQ Mobile (NQ) stock. NQ announced Monday that a subsidiary of China's Tsinghua Holdings would not be able to proceed with a planned acquisition of NQ subsidiary FL Mobile.Enterprises are shifting some spending from endpoints to privileged account spending, where CyberArk leads, Nandury wrote. Surveys show cybersecurity spending at the forefront of chief information officers' minds driven by ""state-sponsored breaches and hacker collectives.""""Chief information officers understand that once hackers penetrate the perimeter, they look to hack privileged accounts (super-user and administrative accounts) to get to the data,"" he wrote. ""Securing privileged accounts then takes on great importance.""Nandury sees CyberArk hitting its 30% sales growth target as it aggressively expands headcount. Sales and marketing spending is expected to remain in the 35%-40% range, he says.But days before Nandury's upgrade, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho cut his 2017 estimates on CyberArk to take a conservative investment viewpoint. However, Ho still rates CyberArk stock at outperform.For 2017, Ho sees $1.12 earnings per share ex items vs. earlier views for $1.37. He cut pro forma operating margin to 21.2% from 26.3%, and projects 27.3% billings growth vs. earlier expectations for 33.6% growth.CyberArk's December-quarter results were impressive, considering their difficult comparison, Ho wrote in his report. He expects CyberArk to continue market share gains against CA Technologies (CA) and Dell.Like Nandury, he noted that CyberArk says it hasn't seen a drop-off in demand. A January CIO survey by Piper Jaffray shows internal access management, which includes CyberArk's crown-jewel-protecting core, as the fourth-most-important spending target for 2016.Endpoint, compliance and Web-access firewall led the survey in terms of spending priorities.

140,FL,"XNike (NKE) reports third-quarter results late Tuesday, and the dominant global athletic brand is expected to record its first year-over-year earnings decline since late 2012 as rivalries heat up and retail slows down.The Street is looking for a 4% year-over-year decline in profit to 53 cents a share and 5% revenue growth to $8.47 billion for the Dow Jones industrial average component.The bankruptcies of Sports Authority and other sporting goods retailers made their mark on athletic brands last year. The broader brick-and-mortar retail environment continues to adjust to a digital-heavy shopping landscape, though many brands — including Nike — are working on building out stronger direct-to-consumer channels that can circumvent any storefront softness.Now at the forefront of some investor minds is Adidas' (ADDYY) comeback-kid performance after a sluggish period in the U.S. Nike's still No. 1, both globally and at home, but Adidas is looking to recapture share in the key American market.""We believe NKE management continues to grapple with the greater than expected pace and magnitude of Adidas' resurgence — particularly domestically,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy last week. She sees Nike shares remaining ""range bound over the next year as the durability of Adidas' resurgence becomes clearer."" Murphy has a neutral rating and 51 price target on the stock.Nike's stock was one of the only decliners on the Dow Jones industrial average last year, though shares are up about 14% so far in 2017. By contrast, Adidas shares rocketed 62% last year.Nike shares rose 1.7% to 58.77 on the stock market today. Adidas fell 1.2% to 97.30. Smaller rival Under Armour (UAA) rose 1% to 19.58.Adidas doubled its athletic footwear market share in the U.S. in January to 10%, according to NPD Group data, but that is still a far cry from Nike's 45% share. Under Armour, which has since lost the No. 2 spot back to Adidas in the U.S., had a 2% market share that month.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour's rising hip-kid image took a major hit last month after CEO Kevin Plank made comments on CNBC that were perceived as being pro-Trump. He's since walked back on those comments and come out against the travel ban, but some say the damage has already been done. ""Conceptually, Under Armour is less of a threat (year over year), particularly in basketball, and Adidas, while still strong, hasn't increased its rate of U.S. share gain,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Jay Sole, who has an equal-weight rating and 56 price goal on Nike.Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser, who has a positive rating and 64 price target on the stock, said the Swoosh ""remains on its A-game"" and any concerns about Adidas weighing on Nike's growth is ""misplaced.""""The bigger threat from Adidas, in our view, should be to performance based brands, such as Under Armour, that just don't resonate in lifestyle to nearly the same degree,"" wrote Poser.Meanwhile, athletic gear retailer Finish Line (FINL), which reports early Friday, is seen logging a 16% EPS drop to 70 cents a share, on a 6% sales decline to $545.9 million.Retailer earnings can offer a glimpse into brand demand. Foot Locker (FL) reported strong demand for Nike footwear and some Adidas shoes when the sporting goods chain disclosed holiday-quarter results last month, but notably did not mention Under Armour.One last thing: those Nike-specific ""futures orders"" — i.e. the metric that tracks products scheduled for delivery to retailers — will still be closely tracked, though management as of last quarter has begun disclosing that figure during the earnings call instead of in its initial press release.Nike CFO Andy Campion said last fall that the metric isn't as directly correlative to its revenue anymore as its business mix changes, an indication that its direct-to-consumer business is picking up steam.RELATED:Nike Rival Adidas On U.S. Turf War: Paying The Price For The PastUnder Armour Picks General Motors Vet To Be Chief Innovation OfficerFoot Locker Sprints As Earnings Growth Continues To AccelerateUnder Armour CEO Knocks Trump Policy, But Damage To Cool Factor SeenThat Nike Metric That Sank Shares?

141,FL,"XBy all accounts, Adidas (ADDYY) had a whopper of a year. The athletic powerhouse ramped up its outlook no less than four times and grew currency-neutral revenue by 18% in 2016.The years ahead are also looking good, and on Wednesday the Nike (NKE) rival raised its long-term sales and earnings guidance.Shares, which trade in the U.S. on the OTC market, leapt as high as 92.31 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, a new all-time high. Adidas' stock gained 62% in 2016.Nike shares, by contrast, tumbled 19% last year, making it the worst performer on the Dow Jones industrial average. Shares edged down 0.1% to 56.51 Wednesday.Despite Adidas' momentum,  Kasper Rorsted — who took over as CEO from Herbert Hainer last fall — nevertheless has his sights set on driving growth even higher, particularly in the key North American market where the brand has until recently dragged.""It's important to understand we've been in the U.S. for many years, but we've not executed appropriately in the U.S.,"" he told Investor's Business Daily via phone from the company's German headquarters. ""And that has given room for a Nike to grow, and also an Under Armour.""Adidas has in recent months recaptured the No. 2 spot by sales in the U.S. from smaller rival Under Armour (UAA), according to NPD Group data, and in January doubled its U.S. athletic footwear market share to 10% from the prior year.Nike held the lead with 45%, while Under Armour had 2% market share in January, said NPD.""While we're happy with the No. 2 spot, we're happy with the progress — we're actually not happy where we are overall as a company,"" said Rorsted. He added that the company is in ""catch-up mode"" despite being the second biggest athletic brand, and ""we should have substantially higher market share and position in the U.S. than we have today.""""But right now, that is the only market where we're paying the price for the past,"" he said.The company, which plans to ""continue to invest over-proportionately into its U.S. business,"" is in the midst of implementing a new long-term ""Creating the New"" strategic initiative. Rolled out two years ago, it includes a focus on speed to market, presence in key metropolitan cities and consumer engagement in order to accelerate growth.Adidas is now looking to shed its hockey business, in addition to its golf brands, as the company focuses on its stronger brands and core segments.Fourth-quarter sales and net income beat consensus figures, according to Piper Jaffray, which has an overweight rating on Adidas and raised its price target on Wednesday to 190 euros.Currency-neutral sales in Q4 grew 14%, including 29% year-over-year growth in North America and 25% growth in its greater China segment.Calling the North America segment a ""bright spot,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy also noted that Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Foot Locker (FL) and Journeys ""are all seeing better Adidas shelf space in 2017.""For 2017, Adidas expects 11%-13% in currency-neutral revenue growth, better than current estimates. Management intends to shed more light on the details at Adidas' analyst day next week.The company said it now expects 10%-12% in average annual sales growth between 2015-2020, up from prior guidance for a high-single-digit rate. It also sees 20%-22% in average annual growth in net income from continuing operations for that period, up from previous outlook for about 15% a year on average.In addition to retro trends riding high in the U.S. — iconic Adidas shoes such as the Stan Smith and Superstar are major fashion favorites right now — Adidas' Boost, NMD and Kanye West-designed Yeezy designs are all enjoying popularity.""Creating the kinds of sneakers American kids want has had a major impact on their business,"" said NPD sports industry analyst Matt Powell. ""I called them brand of the (year) in 2016 and am about ready to do the same in 2017.""

142,FL,"Under Armour (UA) is getting a little sunshine on this autumn Monday. Wells Fargo upgraded the Nike (NKE) rival to outperform, and even typically bearish Morgan Stanley had some nice things to say about the Baltimore-based athletic apparel brand.A ""top-line reacceleration"" could be in Under Armour's future over the next year to year and a half, thanks to distribution expansion, wrote Wells Fargo analysts Tom Nikic and Ike Boruchow, as the ""noise"" settles from Sports Authority's bankruptcy proceedings.The brand's growth story is still in early days, and it has ""noteworthy"" opportunities to close in on its rivals abroad. Star endorser Steph Curry recently went on an Under Armour-branded tour of China, and the company flexed its marketing muscle at the recent Rio Olympics.Plus, there's Kohl's (KSS) introduction of Under Armour products, which should help offset the loss of Sports Authority, they said. Wells Fargo upped its price target range to 44-46 from 38-42.Under Armour shares rose 1.3% to 38.27 in the stock market today. The stock remains below its 50-day and 200-day moving average. So does Nike's stock, which closed unchanged at 51.79 Monday.IBD's TAKE: Not sure what to do when it comes to moving averages? Here's one guideline: ""Law Of Averages: Sell When Stocks Breach 200-Day Line.""Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole, in a note on Finish Line (FINL), remarked that Under Armour has a ""big opportunity"" after being a ""major share gainer"" at the sports apparel retailer over the past year. Like Adidas, the brand's share of Finish Line sales has doubled.Under Armour sales now represent 6% of the store's sales, he said; Adidas has expanded its Finish Line share to 10% as its resurgence powers higher.Under Armour's ""Curry franchise has the opportunity to become even bigger than it already is if (Under Armour) can tap into Curry's status as not just a great basketball player, but also

144,FL,"Soft traffic and disappointing apparel and equipment sales during the key holiday quarter weighed on Hibbett Sports' (HIBB) fourth-quarter same-store sales, hitting shares of the athletic specialty retailer and at least one of its counterparts Tuesday morning.Ahead of its March 10 earnings release, Hibbett announced preliminary Q4 net sales of $246.9 million, marking growth of half a percent from the prior-year quarter. But comparable store sales fell 2.2% for the all-important shopping period.Hibbett, which has over 1,000 stores in the U.S., carries Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Adidas and other brands among its product assortment.""We continued to experience strength in our footwear business, which was a direct result of our improved assortments and in-stocks by store types,"" said Hibbett CEO Jeff Rosenthal in a release. ""As traffic declined and sales softened, we became more promotional in order to drive sales and manage inventory, which had a negative impact on gross margin.""Hibbett expects 53-55 cents in diluted per-share earnings for the period, well below current Street forecasts for 61 cents a share.For fiscal 2018, the company sees flat to low-single-digit range same-store sales and $2.65-$2.85 in EPS, the midpoint of which is shy of current views for $2.77 a share.Shares of Hibbett sank nearly 12% to end the regular trading session at 29.35 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest level in more than a year. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) slipped 1.3% to 51.75, even as it announced a 12% increase in its quarterly dividend Tuesday morning, while Foot Locker (FL) edged up 0.3% to 70.64.

146,FL,"In an era when more than 80% of the active managers fail to beat their benchmark index, finding a mutual fund that consistently achieves the elusive element of alpha is akin to finding the Holy Grail.USAA Growth Fund (USAAX) is one of those funds. This portfolio of large-cap growth stocks has beaten its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. year to date, as well as in the past one, three, five and 10 years. And it has beaten the S&P 500 stock index in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2015, it returned 5.63% vs. the S&P's 1.38%.Lately much of its outperformance has been driven by such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alibaba (BABA).The portfolio managers are Michael Schroer of Renaissance Investment Management and Aziz Hamzaogullari of Loomis Sayles. They each separately manage half the portfolio. Schroer has been with the fund since 1991 and Hamzaogullari since 2010.The fund's strategy is to look for high-quality companies that can generate sustainable and profitable growth. When the managers see stocks selling at a significant discount to their estimate of intrinsic value, they snap them up. This leads to a small portfolio of just 92 companies. The fund also has a very long-term investment horizon, seen in its 31% portfolio turnover rate.Still, even a fund that consistently outperforms has moments when it doesn't. So far this year, it's underperforming the S&P 500 5.90% to 6.61%.""We favor companies that are high quality growth selling at a reasonable valuation,"" said Schroer. ""In the first half of the year lower P/E growth didn't do well. Higher P/E companies led the market, but by the later part of the year that reversed and lower P/E companies are doing better and we've benefited from that. We're in the sweet spot for the market where lower P/E, higher quality are doing better.""Another part of the strategy, this one favored by the Loomis Sayles team, is described as high ""active share."" Active share is a way of measuring how much a portfolio differs from its benchmark index. ""Our active share has been at or above 80%,"" Hamzaogullari told IBD late last year. ""While it does not ensure outperformance, we believe it is a necessary condition for generating alpha and outperforming the benchmark, net of fees, over the long term.""U.S. stocks make up 90% of the fund, with the rest in foreign equities. Technology makes up 27% of the portfolio.Amazon as of July 31 stood as USAA Growth's largest holding, at about 4% of assets. The stock made up the entire retail-internet segment of the fund. Amazon is up 21% this year, sitting just above support at its 50-day moving average after pulling back 3% from its all time high set Oct. 6. Analysts expect Amazon to post Q3 earnings 371% higher than a year earlier when it reports results Thursday.Facebook is the No. 2 holding also at about 4% of assets. The social networking and media leader is up 24% year to date near the 28.43 buy point of a flat base. Fiscal Q1 earnings are expected to rise 70% from a year earlier when results are reported, expected Nov. 2 after the market's close.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giants and another top fund holding, is up 28% so far this year. The stock has found support at its 50-day moving average, 6% below its 52-week high. The company is expect to show a fiscal Q2 earnings increase of 23% when it reports Tuesday.Not all USAA Growth top holdings have been barn burners. Database bellwether Oracle (ORCL) is up 5% this year. It's been in the fund since 2007.The rest of the top 10 holdings and their percentages are: Cisco Systems (CSCO), 3.24%; Visa (V), 3.11%; Qualcomm (QCOM), 2.89%; Monster Beverage (MNST), 2.52%; Alphabet (GOOGL), 2.48%; United Parcel Services (UPS), 2.37%.""We think technology and consumer discretionary look attractive,"" said Schroer. ""Health care still looks attractive. Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) still look very cheap. In this market there are still high quality companies.""Schroer likes Foot Locker (FL). The athletic shoe retailer posted very good second-quarter sales and still trades at a ""very reasonable multiple of 14."" The stock is up only 4.4% this year.""Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) and both are doing well over the last several months,"" said Schroer. ""They had sold off on fears of the Zika virus hurting tourism, but they didn't suffer too much. Now bookings for next year are running high and multiples are very attractive, Royal's trailing P-E is 13 and Carnival's is 14.""We've taken some things off the table, but we still think there are selective opportunities in this market,"" he said. ""We've gone through six quarters of negative earnings growth and we're watching this quarter carefully for signs of a rebound. So far, so good.""RELATED:Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On Facebook And Other Stock LeadersChinese, Other Foreign Stocks Drove Top Q3 Fund PerformersAlibaba Sets Stage For Big Online Shopping Spree

155,FL,"Under Armour’s (UA) fourth-quarter same-store sales likely weren't very strong, said Morgan Stanley, partly because women may not love the brand as much as men do.Under Armour's most recently reported quarterly comps were likely flat or declined 3%, year over year, said the firm, which pointed to store-count growth outpacing direct-to-consumer growth in Q4.Shares closed down 1%, having found support at their 50-day line on Feb. 16.The company, which had 191 standalone and factory stores by the end of 2015, does not break out same-store sales for those locations. Much of its merchandise is sold through chains such as Foot Locker (FL) and Sports Authority, the latter of which just filed for bankruptcy protection.While warmer-than-expected weather, poor mall traffic and other factors could have impacted comps, analyst Jay Sole also noted a maturing brand, more women's activewear choices on the market, and the idea that some women may be put off by the brand's ""aggressive, young and fearless"" image.Plus, ""we don't think (Under Armour)'s product has been as good as it needs to be to fend off competition from Nike (NKE), Victoria's Secret, Lululemon (LULU), and others,"" he wrote, adding that women have far less brand loyalty than men. Victoria's Secret is owned by L Brands (LB).Under Armour has been making a big push for more female customers with endorsers such as dancer Misty Copeland and model Gisele Bundchen.Among other concerns highlighted in Sole's lengthy analysis are a decline in average sale prices for running footwear and the stock's high valuation.Shares of Nike fell 1%, Lululemon lost 1.6% and L Brands dipped 0.6%.Morgan Stanley's commentary comes just a day after William Blair said Under Armour lost market share with teens and young adults in 2015.Meanwhile, Adidas recently brought on former Lululemon CEO Christine Day as a strategic advisor as it looks to capture more market share among women.Adidas, once a much more dominant force in sportswear, slipped to the No. 3 spot in the U.S. in 2014 behind Under Armour. (Nike continues to sit pretty at the top of the heap.)But on Thursday, Adidas said Q4 sales grew 8% in North America -- Adidas brand sales alone grew 12% in the region -- a marked difference from the 4% North American sales decline that it logged in the year-ago Q4. Management also forecast 10%-12% in currency-neutral sales in 2016 as management sounded bullish about the brand's year ahead.It remains to be seen whether Adidas can retake its second-place spot and displace Under Armour, but activewear makers won't be able to rest in the competition for women's wallets.Speaking broadly about women's apparel in his Under Armour note, Sole said: ""Women will search each season to find the best product for them and go with it, no matter what brand it is. To have a strong and growing women's business, apparel companies have to earn it, year after year.""RELATED:Under Armour Share Loss In This Key Demographic Is ‘Disconcerting’Can Stephen Curry Be Under Armour’s Michael Jordan?Adidas Boosts Outlook, Seen Heating Up Race Vs.

156,FL,"Under Armour (UA) scored big points with shoppers last week with a hefty double-digit gain in athletic shoe sales, far outrunning peers Nike (NKE) and Skechers USA (SKX).In the week ended Feb. 20, Under Armour's athletic footwear sales jumped 97.6% from a year earlier, according to a report by Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner, citing data from market researcher SportScanInfo.Under Armour's shares closed up 0.9% on the stock market today.Sector leader Nike's athletic footwear sales rose 8.2% from a year earlier last week. Nike's shares added 0.35% Friday.Skechers, which is expanding into athletic footwear, saw athletic footwear sales climb 18.5% from a year earlier last week.Skechers' shares dipped 0.2% Friday.Adidas, including its Reebok brand, saw athletic footwear sales rise 14.7% from a year earlier last week. The Adidas brand shoe sales alone climbed 28.3% from a year earlier last week, while Reebok slipped 51.9%.Total athletic footwear sales ""decelerated,"" but still posted ""very strong"" 8.6% year-over-year growth last week, Weiner noted. Analysts said that the strong growth in athletic footwear sales has helped retailer Foot Locker (FL) beat earnings views when it reported Friday.After the prior week’s ""robust"" gain, basketball shoe sales fell 5.3% from a year earlier last week, said Weiner. But unit sales were ""positive"" for the category, he added.""ASPs(average selling prices), which have been under pressure as lower-priced offerings such as Under Armour’s Curry platform gain popularity, led the sales decline (in basketball shoes),"" Weiner said.Under Armour's Curry 2 basketball shoe was the  No. 7 best seller across all athletic footwear last week, he added.Running shoe sales ""accelerated"" to a 13.9% year-over-year increase last week, with a ""modest"" ASP gain, Weiner noted. Best sellers included Nike’s Roshe Run, Air Max 2016, and Air Huarache.The casual athletic shoe category kept up its ""momentum"" with sales up 26.3% year-over-year last week.

157,FL,"Athletic shoe sales in the U.S. climbed 8% to $17.2 billion in 2015, according to research firm NPD Group, ""one of the best performances the industry has had in a number of years.""Amid this growth, Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) and others might want to keep an eye on ""social fitness"" trends as gym goers take to Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) to talk about their workouts -- and the brands they're wearing at the gym.""The athleisure trend has helped the acceleration of growth, as has social fitness, which will continue to shape the sports business as class-based fitness activities and other shared experiences will dominate the industry,"" said NPD Group analyst Matt Powell in a statement.""Brands and retailers must integrate this trend into their plans. It will be necessary for them to capitalize on social fitness in order to grow in the months ahead.”Nike shares closed down 3.7%. Under Armour shares tumbled 6.2%, Skechers (SKX) lost 2.9% and Foot Locker (FL) fell 2%.Powell had told IBD in January that millennials are very social in their fitness activities, unlike their older peers, ""who would lift some weights and leave without talking to anyone.""""(They're) taking more classes, and with the rest of social media they’re sharing their experiences with their friends,"" he said at the time. ""They are really focused more on the social side.""Under Armour has been aggressively pursuing the social-media-attuned workout junkie with a series of app acquisitions and, most recently, the debut of wearable fitness gear as well as a rebooted app powered by IBM's (IBM) Watson supercomputer.In athletic footwear, more casual and retro styles gained popularity last year, while growth in performance styles -- running and basketball in particular -- eased, NPD found.But retro running and retro basketball shoes helped the classics category climb by 30%, year over year.Powell said he expects last year's momentum in athletic footwear to continue into 2016.RELATED:Can Under Armour’s Wearables Woo The Next Generation From Nike?

158,FL,"Superstitious investors may be aware of the ""Super Bowl indicator,"" which says that if an original NFL team wins, the market will end the year up, but an original AFL win translates to a down year for stocks.Regardless of who triumphs on Sunday, these four names are likely to appear at the big game, whether at the stadium or in living rooms across America:The Swoosh is a recurring member of the IBD 50 and also the NFL's official outfitter, which means that both the Denver Broncos and North Carolina Panthers will be geared up in Nike on the field.Nike (NKE) remains, far and away, the market leader in sportswear, but Under Armour (UA) has been aggressively trying to capture more market share. Panthers quarterback Cam Newton endorses Under Armour. His Broncos counterpart, Peyton Manning, has a Nike endorsement deal.For the week that ended Jan. 30, Nike's athletic footwear sales fell 9.1% from the previous year, while Under Armour's jumped 70.5%, according to Deutsche Bank, citing SportScanInfo data.Shares fell 5% in the stock market Friday, hitting the lowest close since Sept. 15.The hawker of football jerseys and other sports apparel is another recurring member of this IBD hot list.Sterne Agee CRT noted in November that Foot Locker (FL), following a view-topping Q3, was ""clearly taking share"" from the likes of Finish Line (FINL), Hibbett Sports (HIBB) and others.Foot Locker stock fell 3.3% on Friday, moving back below its 200-day moving average.Fans are likely to put down a cold beer or three this Sunday.The parent of Corona Extra, Svedka vodka and Robert Mondavi trounced Q3 earnings last month, with Argus Research analyst John Staszak telling IBD in January that Constellation Brands (STZ) had a ""sensational quarter, driven by strong beer sales.""Constellation's in-development $1.5 billion brewery in Mexicali, Mexico, is expected to start operating in 2019. In addition, the company has a $500 million expansion in store for its Nava brewery, also in Mexico. And the firm bumped up earnings guidance for the year.Constellation is a favorite among top fund managers. Nevertheless, the stock sank 6.1%, tumbling below its 50-day moving average and closing below that level for the first time since late September. Constellation hit a record high on Monday but ended the week down 9.5%.Both victory and defeat will surely spill over onto social media after the game, and clips of Budweiser's Clydesdales and wacky Super Bowl ads are bound for Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR).Facebook recently said that it intends to raise 2016 capital spending by about 70% to $4 billion-$4.5 billion.The company has also been working on turning social networking into social commerce as it develops M, a virtual personal assistant that can help make appointments or buy movie tickets. Facebook's Messenger platform can already hail a ride from Uber.Shares fell 5.8% on Friday, though Facebook found support at its 50-day moving average. Facebook hit a record high intraday Tuesday but ended the week down more than 7%. 
"
159,FL,"Nike (NKE) shares retook a key level Monday as smaller rival Under Armour (UA) is kicking its sales up a notch.In the most recently tracked week of shoe sales, Under Armour saw sales for the week ending Jan. 23 jump 66% from a year earlier, while Nike saw sales rise 1.5% in the same period.But Nike’s annual sales are currently almost 10 times that of Under Armour’s, and Nike has seen its stock rise 36% over the last 12 months while under Armour has gained 19%.Nike rose 1.85% to a one-month high in the stock market today, but volume was tracking lighter than average. After finding support at the 200-day line late last month, shares just closed above the key 50-day line on Monday after seeming to hit resistance intraday.The stock is now trading about 7% below its high reached on December 23. Nike reversed that day to close the session below the 50-day support level.Meanwhile, Under Armour gapped up above its 50-day line last week after reporting quarterly earnings. But that line is sloping downward and is below the 200-day line. Under Armour is 19% below its mid-September peak, down 0.35% Monday.Under Armour launched a health kit last month, thrusting itself into the fitness tech space alongside the Apple (AAPL) Watch and Fitbit (FIT).And shoe retailer Foot Locker (FL) is working on a base with a potential buy point of 77.35. After retaking the 200-day line last week, the stock is now 10% below the pivot. Foot Locker rose 2.3% on Monday.Nike, Under Armour and Foot Locker are all members of the IBD 50 list.

160,FL,"Stocks ended slightly lower Friday as the possibility of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike dampened sentiment. However, the Nasdaq recorded its eighth-straight weekly gain.The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.2%, the S&P 500 lost 0.1% and the Nasdaq edged down a fraction. Volume was slightly higher on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq compared to Thursday, according to preliminary data.San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank head John Williams said late Thursday that policymakers should consider a rate hike in September, adding that continued low rates could hurt the economy.His comments came after New York Fed chief William Dudley made hawkish comments earlier in the week.

163,FL,"In the wake of last week's better-than-expected department store results, athletic equipment retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) caught Wall Street off guard on Tuesday with a big earnings beat, as the dissolution of a major peer didn't attack profits.Earnings grew 6.5% to 82 cents a share, well above views for 69 cents. Revenue rose 8% to $1.97 billion vs. analyst estimates for $1.88 billion.""Expectations for the quarter were low as investors remained concerned over margin pressures from the Sports Authority liquidation,"" said Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins in a retail-earnings report. ""With one of its main competitors going out of business and selling all of its inventory at discounted prices there was concern that Dick's would lose business during the quarter.""Instead, shares surged 7% to close at 58.76 in the stock market today.

166,FL,"Five big-name stocks are making notable moves as the market continues to climb higher, including two IBD 50 members, Facebook (FB) and LendingTree (TREE), and two Olympics sponsors, Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD).Nike is trading well below its all-time high reached last December, but it has been rallying since hitting a 10-month low in July. Shares are now nearing the critical 200-day line, boosted by a quick-turnover rise on Friday in sympathy with Foot Locker's (FL) view-topping quarterly results. The athletic footwear and apparel giant's chart has suffered much technical damage, but retaking the 200-day line would be bullish.McDonald's is still feeling the pain from its announcement last month of weaker-than-expected U.S. same store sales in Q2, with shares dropping below their late June low to hit their worst level in five months on Friday. The stock is now 12% below its all-time high, reached on May 10.IBD 50 member Facebook continues to trade within buy range after clearing a 121.18 buy point, a sluggish breakout amid the recent new highs reached by the major indexes. Though the stock has been fading in recent sessions -- it's now 3% below its all-time peak reached on July 28 -- its uptrend remains intact.LendingTree, another IBD 50 name, is in danger of hitting the 5%-8% sell territory. The stock is now 4% below a 106.92 cup buy point. For those who bought the stock after it cleared that level, make sure to keep an eye out for any further losses.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 is a ranking of leading growth stocks based on key measures such as earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance during the past 12 months.

175,FL,"Stocks continue to grind sideways, while the latest run of retail earnings, including Home Depot (HD) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) didn't offer much clarity on consumers. Cisco Systems (CSCO) offered job cuts and a weak outlook. But Chinese internet stocks continue to deliver robust earnings, while oil made a strong advance.The major averages moved sideways, closing little changed. The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, grinding out its eighth straight weekly gain. The S&P 500 fell less than one point and the Dow lost 0.1%. Several Federal Reserve officials made hawkish hints, insisting a September hike was in play. While markets doubt that, the comments did have an effect. Energy stocks were strong as oil prices rallied. Retailers generally rose, led by Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST), though TJX Cos. (TJX) was among the losers. Cisco Systems cut jobs and its outlook. Tencent (TCEHY) led a slew of  top-rated China internet stocks reporting earnings.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose above $50 a barrel. Meanwhile, U.S. crude prices shot up 9.1% for the week to $48.52 a barrel. Buzz about a new push for an oil production freeze among OPEC and large non-OPEC producers helped lift prices. But Saudi Arabia is raising production to meet domestic demand, and Iran hasn't made a decision on joining the informal freeze talks in September.Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the first time in four weeks, with gasoline supplies also down. But U.S. production rose. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for an eighth straight week to a six-month high.Cisco Systems said it will slash 5,500 jobs, or 7% of its workforce, as it continues to shift from hardware to software and services. Cisco topped fiscal Q4 views while sales edged higher. But Cisco's current-quarter EPS and revenue targets were below forecasts. Cisco stock on Monday had its highest close since late 2007, but it went on to fall 1.1% for the week.IBD'S TAKE: While Cisco revenue barely rises, fiber-optic component makers are booming amid strong demand from telecoms, internet giants and China. Acacia Communications shares have skyrocketed since their May IPO. Learn what Acacia CEO Raj Shanmugaraj has to say about the so-called fiber optic ""super cycle"" in a recent IBD interview.Wal-Mart earned $1.07 a share, a penny below a year earlier but beating views. Revenue increased slightly as U.S. same-store rose again and e-commerce growth picked up. The brick-and-mortar retail giant emphasized digital marketing after buying Jet.com this month for $3.3 billion, as it tries to fend off Amazon (AMZN), Alibaba (BABA) and other online retailers.Rival discounter Target (TGT) beat profit views, but sales fell short as Apple (AAPL) product sales fell 20%.

But Home Depot raised its full-year EPS view as it still benefits from a housing ""tailwind."" Meanwhile, smaller rival Lowe's (LOW) missed on the top and bottom lines. Lowe's same-store sales growth was just half of Home Depot's. Home Depot briefly topped a buy point closed the week off 0.8%. Lowe's tumbled 4.8%.Ross Stores late Thursday earned 71 cents a share, up 13%, while sales climbed 7% to $3.18 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of 71 cents and sales of $3.18 billion.

Shares rose 4.4%, hitting a record high.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) delivered a 35% quarterly EPS jump, while sales' 3% gain edged past views. Same-store sales rose just 3% though.

Volume in the stock market today was higher across the board, according to preliminary data.Stocks erased mild gains in the afternoon, after minutes from the Fed's July 27 meeting showed policymakers had greater confidence in the economic outlook, but remained reluctant to raise interest rates.Computer networking giant Cisco Systems was down about 1% after the close despite reporting higher-than-expected profit and sales for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in July. The stock dipped 1% during the regular session, ending just below a 52-week high. It was reported that Cisco plans to lay off 14,000 workers or about 20% of its global workforce.Agilent Technologies (A), a maker of scientific measuring instruments, fell 5% after the close following its quarterly results.NetApp (NTAP) jumped more than 5% in post-session trading after the maker of network storage and data management hardware posted better-than-expected fiscal Q1 profit and sales.The stock is working on a long and deep cup-type base.Chinese social networking stock YY (YY) was up 3% after the close after its Q2 results.

177,FL,"Off-price earnings are scheduled for this week, with TJX (TJX) reporting early Tuesday, and off-price peer Ross Stores (ROST) slated to disclose results after the close on Thursday.A number of department-store retailers surprised the Street last week with earnings and revenue beats, so what can investors expect from the two major off-price stocks?The parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshall's and HomeGoods, TJX is expected to earn 81 cents in per-share profit, a 1% gain from the prior year. Revenue is seen growing nearly 7% to $7.85 billion.IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which includes TJX, Ross Stores, Gap, Foot Locker (FL) and others, has been on a four-session win streak, collectively rising 4% since last Tuesday.While the off-price sector has generally been outperforming the broader bricks-and-mortar retail space, the Retail-Department Stores group is up 19% over the same time frame, on the backs of well-received results from Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) last week. Nordstrom did well on its off-price Nordstrom Rack stores.TJX shares briefly popped out of buy territory earlier Monday but are now back in the zone, dipping 0.1% to 82.77 by the close. The stock had broken out of a flat base with 79.30 entry point in mid-July.IBD'S TAKE: Several companies set to report this week are near buy points.

179,FL,"Nike (NKE) reported flat year-over-year fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday, topping analyst estimates by a penny, but revenue growth of 6% to $8.24 billion was not enough to top views for $8.28 billion.Worldwide futures orders climbed 8%. Excluding currency effects, it rose 11%, below some estimates.Currency-neutral futures orders -- i.e. product orders scheduled for delivery, and an indicator of demand -- rose 6% in North America, the first time it has dipped into single digits since Q3 of fiscal 2014. The metric jumped 24% in China in Q4, a slowdown from 36% in Q3 and 34% in Q2.But Nike shares ended the day up 3.8% to 55.13 on the stock market Wednesday. Under Armour (UA) rallied nearly 6% to 39.75.Deutsche Bank said in a Sunday note that athletic brands like Nike are outperforming in China, despite indications of a slowdown there.For fiscal 2017, Nike reaffirmed expectations for high-single-digit reported revenue growth, reflecting currency-neutral high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth. Consensus is for 10% growth.In spite of recent volatility spurred by Brexit, management said full-year expectations are ""largely unchanged"" from a growth and profitability perspective.For Q1, it sees mid-single-digit revenue growth. Analysts sees 9% growth.Nike gets only about 3%  of its revenue comes from the U.K., and analysts at Jefferies even pegged Nike as a possible medium- or long-term buying opportunity in the wake of the EU referendum.Meanwhile, Sports Authority's liquidation is having an effect. Rival Under Armour recently took a $23 million write-down in Under Armour's Q2 and cut full-year revenue guidance due to the failed retail chain.Excess inventory issues weighed on Nike's Q4 gross margin, which dipped 30 basis points, due also in part to higher product costs and unfavorable exchange rates.But Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards said during the call that full-price channel inventory levels are ""clean,"" and that the company expects to clear remaining excess inventory through its Nike factory outlets and third-party value channels.By geographic segment, North American revenue was flat from the prior-year quarter, while Western Europe sales rose 19% and Central and Eastern Europe sales fell 4%.Revenue in China, an area of tremendous focus, grew 18%. Japan revenue rose 22%, while emerging markets revenue fell 7%.Converse brand sales grew 18%.RELATED:This Apple Chipmaker, Nike, Wal-Mart Among Post-Brexit Buys: Analyst.

181,FL,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

Then shares reversed lower, found support at the 50-day line and ultimately closed down 1.6% at 253.39. The beauty products retailer reported another estimate-beating quarter late Thursday and issued strong Q4 guidance. See if the stock can continue to hold above the 50-day line and break out of the base.Google-owner Alphabet and Facebook have been notable losers in the postelection sector rotation. Facebook fell back below its 200-day line this past week, coming close to its Nov. 14 low of 113.55 — a level the stock hadn't seen since four months prior. Shares are now 13.5 below their Oct. peak. Alphabet lost support at its 200-day line on Friday, and is trading 9% below its high.Starbucks is nearing a test of support at its 200-day line after retaking that level on Nov. 22. The stock has been consolidating, i.e. moving sideways, since October 2015 and is trading 10.6% below its high reached at that time. The late-Thursday announcement that CEO Howard Schultz will be stepping aside to become executive chairman is weighing on shares.After issuing estimate-beating earnings on Nov. 18, Foot Locker found support near the 50-day line and reversed to close the session higher. It soon after cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 73.47 buy point, and though the stock dipped below that level, it's now back in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Want to be able to learn how to spot bases and buy points for yourself?

184,FL,"With stocks on track for their worst January since at least 2009, breakouts have been few and far between. But for a stock to break out, it has to form a base first.Here’s a look at five IBD 50 stocks that are building bases: Facebook (FB), Starbucks (SBUX), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Foot Locker (FL) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW).Facebook earns a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. The social networking giant reports quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday.Shares are trading about 12% below a consolidation buy point of 110.75. Last week, shares were able to find support at the key 200-day line. Facebook rose 0.3% on Tuesday.Starbucks, which has a 96 Composite Rating, also found support at the 200-day line last week. Shares are trading 8% below a 64.10 buy point. Starbucks rose 1.6% Tuesday.Last Thursday, the coffee giant beat quarterly earnings expectations but missed revenue views and issued weak guidance. Still, Starbucks says it’s bullish on its expansion in China.Ulta Beauty reported better-than-expected quarterly results in early December. The beauty products retailer has a 97 Composite Rating.Ulta stock is building a flat base with a 188.58 buy point and is trading 5% below the pivot. Shares are looking to retake the 50-day line in Tuesday’s session. Ulta rose 2%, above its 50-day.Foot Locker is trying to retake its 200-day line, but looks to be hitting resistance there. Shares are trading 14% below a consolidation buy point. They're up 2.6% today.The shoe retailer has a 93 Composite Rating.Edwards Lifesciences has a 94 Composite Rating. When the heart valve maker issues its quarterly results next week, earnings are projected to have risen 17%.Shares were able to retake the 50-day moving average just a few sessions after finding support at the 200-day line. The stock is now just 3% below an 83.53 flat-base buy point. But the stock fell 4 cents to 80.16.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Ross Stores (ROST) and Campbell Soup (CPB) are among other IBD 50 members working on bases.While breakouts provide buying opportunities, the current market environment warrants a cautious outlook.

186,FL,"Warmer weather, online shopping and heavy discounting have made retail a tough space to be in right now, but at least five stocks on the IBD 50 list are bucking the trends.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has held off Amazon (AMZN) better than its retail peers, partly because of the experiential nature of buying beauty products and partly because of the dedicated customer loyalty that companies like Ulta and Sephora have built, according to analysts.Notably, specialty beauty retailers have the benefit of not being in a seasonal industry, say experts, which means that they are not subject to the promotional pressures that department stores and clothing retailers face.Ulta, a member of IBD's Retail-Specialty industry group, has risen 35% over the last year. The group has collectively lost 6%.Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) have also fared well amid a struggling retail backdrop as ""athleisure"" continues to make its way out of the gym and into offices and even major fashion houses.Health and wellness trends -- think juice bars, cleanses and the much-anticipated SoulCycle (SCYL) IPO -- have worked in both companies' favor, and Under Armour's push into wearable technology has inserted itself into the tech conversation alongside Fitbit (FIT) and the Apple (AAPL) Watch.Nike's stock has climbed 31% and Under Armour has grown 17% since Jan. 29, 2015. Shares of the Apparel-Shoes and Relating Manufacturing group and Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing have risen 5% and declined 15%, respectively.Both companies are not the only two activewear companies on the list. Foot Locker (FL), which carries both Nike and Under Armour in its stores, also made the cut.Starbucks (SBUX), for its part, isn't afraid of a slowdown in China. The java giant is expanding assertively into the country, with a goal of operating 3,400 stores there by 2019.Starbucks missed Q1 revenue and guided Q2 below consensus estimates when it reported on Jan. 21, but CEO Howard Schultz expressed enthusiasm about bringing Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay feature to Chinese consumers. He anticipates that it will be a ""runaway success.""Domestically, its mobile efforts have yielded success, with over a fifth of all U.S. transactions now made via smartphone.Starbucks shares have grown 36% while IBD's Retail-Restaurants group has tumbled 15%.Ross Stores (ROST) doesn't even have an e-commerce presence, but the chain of off-price stores has been labeled ""un-Amazonable"" by Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, citing the appeal of the ""treasure hunt"" experience that compels shoppers to visit brick-and-mortar stores.Amid a shift to off-price retailers, analysts agree that there's room for square-footage growth as Ross expands into other regions stateside.Ross Stores' stock has risen 20% over the last year, compared to the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which has declined 14%.A number of other consumer stocks abound on the IBD 50 list, including energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST), discounters Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG), and baby-clothing merchant Carter's (CRI).RELATED:Why Under Armour’s Market Share May Be Bigger Than You ThinkThink We’re In A Recession?

188,FL,"The U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union has beaten up both U.S. and global markets, and the shakedown now presents a few medium- and long-term buying opportunities, say Jefferies analysts, who collectively chose 27 stocks that may be getting unnecessarily punished in the wake of Brexit.Here are a few highlights, including Apple (AAPL) chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Nike (NKE) and Wal-Mart (WMT):""Although it is domiciled in the Netherlands, we do not view Brexit to be materially impactful to NXPI,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis. ""Most semis are U.S. dollar denominated, and that is the case for NXPI, however 15% of its revenues are denominated in Euros, as is a similar level of its cost structure.""NXP shares tumbled 6.2% by the closing bell Monday on the stock market today, after sliding 8.4% Friday and slicing both its 50-day and 200-day lines. Apple shares dropped 1.4%.The big-box retailer gets about 8% of its total revenue from U.K.-based supermarket chain Asda, says analyst Daniel Binder, which is ""relatively small"" exposure. And a British recession could prompt a ""trade-down benefit"" for Asda, ""especially as it renews its emphasis on private label and executes a $1.5 billion price investment campaign.""""We think Wal-Mart's size and reliance on the U.S. consumer positions it relatively well as a safe haven for investors reducing exposure in other areas,"" he wrote.Shares dipped 0.6%.The high-end jeweler has European exposure, but Tiffany (TIF) should expand its gross margin due to lower commodity costs and a renewed push into silver accessories, among other things.Shares have ""already largely discounted weakness in Europe, where TIF generates (about) 12% of sales, but have not yet reflected the potential for improvement domestically as TIF implements its various strategic initiatives and top-line headwinds (largely related to tourism) abate,"" said Jefferies' Randal Konik.Tiffany stock lost 4.3% at the close.Young people probably don't care much about Brexit, at least, not enough to let it stop them from buying Nike, said analyst Edward Plank. The athletic apparel king's European exposure is ""well diversified"" and sportswear trends are still strong, he noted, affirming the firm's bullishness on Nike's opportunities for growth in China.Nike shares slid 1.3% to a 10-month low of 51.89. Nike reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday night.Foot Locker (FL) is another Plank pick for similar reasons. Shares fell 2.5% to 51.79.

190,FL,"Under Armour (UA) shares were tumbling Wednesday on its Sports Authority-related guidance cut, while Nike (NKE) was feeling the weight of two downgrades.How concerned should investors be about the two popular sportswear brands? Here's what some analysts on Wall Street are saying.Nike's probably not the biggest Kanye West or Steph Curry fan right now. The athletic apparel leader received downgrades from Bank of America to neutral and from Morgan Stanley to equal-weight, with the former reportedly citing footwear market share losses, and the latter citing a ""weakening"" U.S. sportswear category and rising competition.Under Armour and Adidas are nipping at Nike's heels. Morgan Stanley's Jay Sole said Under Armour's Steph Curry basketball shoes have nabbed 800 basis points from Nike so far this year.Meanwhile, Adidas' U.S. shoe sales growth has accelerated to 26% across April and May, while Nike's has slowed to 4% from the prior year, he wrote. Products like the Kanye West-designed Yeezy -- and Kanye West-approved Ultra Boost -- are helping the once-lagging three stripes stage a comeback.An Adidas resurgence could present a risk for Under Armour, wrote Jefferies' Randal Konik separately on Wednesday.In the case of Sports Authority, reports of its demise were not so greatly exaggerated after all, and the bankruptcy court's approval of its liquidation -- vs. a restructuring or sale -- means that Under Armour will have to take a $23 million write-down in Q2.The Baltimore-based sportswear brand late Tuesday revised its full-year revenue outlook downwards to $4.925 billion from $5 billion to reflect both the impairment charge as well as unrealized planned sales to the Sports Authority. Under Armour also revised its operating income expectations. CEO Kevin Plank dismissed the impact as a ""one-time event.""Besides battering the stock with a slew of price target cuts, most Wall Street analysts don't appear to be panicking just yet. Sterne Agee CRT's Sam Poser said Under Armour's outlook still appears healthy ""despite the hiccup"" from the Sports Authority's liquidation.But the situation may be indicative of broader industry troubles.""Ultimately, this admittedly one-time event highlights that even Under Armour is not impervious to the challenges occurring within the sporting goods retail space,"" wrote Credit Suisse's Christian Buss.Cowen's John Kernan noted that inventory growth in retail is still outstripping sales growth, an ongoing trend ""especially in the sporting goods, footwear, athletic and apparel industries, and (which) is showing no signs of correcting.""Given the proximity of many Sports Authority locations to those of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dick's could be a beneficiary of the situation and pick up lost sales, says BB&T Capital Markets' Corinna Freedman.Again, Morgan Stanley provides the most downbeat view, arguing in a separate report that Under Armour would have sent its Sports Authority inventory somewhere else if it were not for slow U.S. sportswear demand and inventory that is believed to be ""at a multiyear high.""""Bulls will view this news as a one-off, but we believe new guidance better represents UA's growth rate,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Sole, who thinks ""more negative consequences of this (U.S. athletic apparel) slowdown are possible.""Shares of Nike closed down 0.5% on the stock market today. Under Armour fell 3.9%. Dick's Sporting Goods edged up 0.3%, while rival Foot Locker (FL) lost 1.8%, and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) fell 0.3%.

""Not a concern as they will make up for it in 4Q. So no implications for the broader retail space insofar as what Nike called out.""Plank added that he doesn't see any fundamental reason why Nike shares reversed Wednesday, and that investors may be engaging in some profit-taking on the stock's strength.Overall, Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Nike, which continues to expect full-year gross margin expansion of about 50 basis points, citing strong performance from the first half of fiscal 2016.Cowen's Kernan reaffirmed his outperform rating and 150 price target in the same report, noting that Nike's strength abroad will offset near-term inventory issues.

339,FL,"Stocks fell hard yesterday, as energy names got clobbered; Spdr Energy  (XLE) -3% because oil came under new pressure - breaking $40/barrel sending the algo's into a tailspin, Utilities under the gun; Spdr Utilities  (XLU) - 2.3% on the prospect of the coming rate hike, the dollar showing strength  because of that same rate hike all causing the broader mkt to come under pressure.
"
340,FL,"Toss in the speech that Yellen gave yesterday at the Economic Club of Washington and you have the perfect recipe for disaster.....First of all....I have to ask - Why does the media find it so important to broadcast a speech that Yellen is giving to a local Economic club?
"
341,FL,"[Their own home page says it like this: The Economic Club of Washington, D.C., has, since its founding, played a vital role in shifting the perception of Washington, D.C., from a focus on the city as the center of our national government to a growing awareness of the region as a global business destination] Now yes....it is a Washington DC club and has access to so many people - BUT it is NOT national policy, it is NOT where FED decisions are made, and it is NOT the FED....it's a local club...... So - This was NOT an FOMC speech, it was NOT a formal policy speech, it was NOT a press conference...in fact all it was - was a scheduled speech delivered by the FED Chair.....ok...I get it, She is the FED chair.....but in the end who cares?  Why does this matter when she is just giving a prepared speech to a group of economists (well educated but none of which will influence policy) .....
"
342,FL,"Did anyone think she was making 'the announcement'?   This was NOT an announcement about new monetary/economic policy....it was just more of the same.....hash and re-hash...because in the end she played both sides of the fence leaving it open to speculation/interpretation and conjecture - for WHAT?  Is this not clear? “On balance, economic and financial information received since our October meeting has been consistent with our expectations of continued improvement in the labor market,” Ms. Yellen said in her speech. “Continuing improvement in the labor market helps strengthen confidence that inflation will move back to our 2% objective over the medium term.”.......She went further and said:
"
343,FL,"“Were the [Fed] to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of our goals,” she said. “Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive risk-taking and thus undermine financial stability.”  The longer she spoke the worse it got....the Twitter sphere, the business news channels offering up min by min analysis.....what did that word mean?  What did that sentence mean?  Did you see the look on her face - surely that must mean that rates are not going to rise or maybe she is just playing us....????  Blah, blah, blah....and so we have more of the same.  And today we get to do it all again as Janet now addresses the Jt Economic Committee of Congress....expect more of the same again......it's exhausting really......all this transparency is BS......In the end - she made it clear that she is ready.....enough of the foreplay......let's get to it!
"
344,FL,"This was clear in what she said about possible dissension in the ranks - which some expect will only complicate her position....“I don’t need unanimity. I think we have to tolerate some dissent,” Ms. Yellen said Wednesday, in answer to a question after delivering a speech on the economic outlook. “I wouldn’t try to stifle dissents, and I would even expect some at critical junctures.”
"
345,FL,"And there it is.....she just laid it out...SHE DOES NEED UNANIMITY.... and chiming in from FL - was Atlanta FED pres Lockhart.....saying: “Absent information that drastically changes the economic picture and outlook, I feel the case for liftoff is compelling""
"
346,FL,"Now back to OIL.... We have been talking about the importance of paying attention to the oil market for a long time now....as this is so crucial in understanding the dynamics at play.... Oil prices fell below $40 a barrel yesterday amid this growing global glut which only puts  more pressure on an industry that already is already bleeding....Yesterday we got a report that signaled the 10th straight weekly rise in U.S. inventories of crude oil at a time of year when they are expected to shrink.....but the real problem is global production......as  OPEC, the U.S. and other non OPEC members  are locked in a battle for market share that has left the world flooded with oil.  This will all come to a head tomorrow...at the OPEC meeting...what will the Saudi's do?  Will they play nice in the sand box?  Doubtful....so oil will almost certainly remain under pressure.... which will continue to put pressure on the energy space......and until we see total capitulation we have not seen the bottom....but it feels like we are one step closer to the 'flush'.  There is plenty of room for crude oil prices to continue to collapse, based on this chart — given that support has now been violated.   $30/barrel is not out of the question at this point... and given that rising rates will only further strengthen in the dollar - is that what  the Fed wants, perhaps believing that if gas prices collapse then that could actually help the economy?  This morning - the humans got to re-think all the noise - and realized that the action created by the algo's yesterday was ridiculous....the mkt and investors are now conditioned to accept a 25 bps hike... but they are also keen on going slow in the new year....and that is exactly what Janet intimated yesterday.....and so after  the  selloff yesterday - US futures are up 10 pts at 2092.........volleying between 2065 and 2100.....Does this sound like a broken record? Eco data today includes Challenger Job Cuts - came in at -13.9% which is a positive number - because it says that job losses were 13.9% lower than last year...... We will also get US Services PMI at 56.5, and ISM Non Manf Composite read of 58.  Factory orders to show a gain of 1.4%. European mkts are all higher as they await the Draghi news conference and announcement...the chatter in Europe is that he has to deliver something really BIG....More Park Sausages, MOM!!!  If he fails to deliver that then look for  a selloff  - but I do not believe that will happen...  Here comes Santa Clause....the FTSE+0.12%, CAC 40 +1.07%, DAX  +0.68%, Eurostoxx +1%, Spain +0.86% and Italy +1.13%.

348,FL,"Never mind ""Let It Snow."" Heading into the crucial holiday shopping season, retailers are more likely singing ""Let It Go"" from the movie ""Frozen"" as they try to shake off disappointing quarterly earnings results and a bad week that collectively sank merchant stocks.Nordstrom (JWN), Macy 's (M), J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) were among those that reported the week of Nov. 9, with Nordstrom and Macy's turning in weak results and discounted forecasts, and J.C. Penney and Kohl's shares falling despite beating consensus views.An October retail sales data miss — a worse-than-expected 0.1% gain — didn't help either, though Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce sellers notably logged a 7.1% rise from the previous year as consumers continue to do much of their shopping online. Cowen & Co. predicted in July that Amazon would knock out Macy's as the top U.S. apparel retailer by 2017.Even much-lauded off-pricers haven't been immune to the pummeling that retail stocks were subjected to over the past week. Shares of TJX (TJX), the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, lost 12% over the past week.In a possible sign of things to come, Q3 same-store sales at Nordstrom's off-price arm, Nordstrom Rack, fell 2.2%.""This type of miss from Rack is surprising to us, and we acknowledge the Rack's off-price slowdown could be a negative indicator for TJX,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen on Friday.But he added that TJX, which reports Tuesday, could ""offset some secular weakness"" based on a few factors, including the strength of the company's sourcing and buying teams, home goods offerings and international reach.The company is expected to report a slight earnings dip of 1% to 84 cents a share. That would mark the third straight quarter of earnings deceleration and a swing from earnings gains of 7%, 8% and 15% in the three preceding periods.Revenue is seen rising 5% to $7.73 million, which also would reflect a slowdown.With a 75 IBD Composite Rating, TJX is the highest ranking member of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which ranks a feeble 144 out of 197 groups.Peers in the group include Ross Stores, Foot Locker (FL), L Brands (LB) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO).Fellow off-pricer Ross Stores (ROST) gapped down ahead of its Thursday earnings release, losing 11% for the week. Analysts expect over 6% EPS growth to 50 cents on 6% sales growth to $2.77 billion.And what about the big-box retailers?Target's (TGT) earnings are seen accelerating, with a predicted 59% climb to 86 cents a share on a 1% revenue dip to $17.57 billion. Shares retreated 6.9% last week.And Wall Street expects Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings to slide 15% to 98 cents a share on a 1% revenue decline to $117.79 billion. Shares slid 4%.""We believe retail is in a state of transition as brands wrestle with how to compete against growing & dynamic pureplay online retailers,"" wrote Chen.RELATED:Retail Sales Weak, Except For Amazon, EcommerceMacy's Stock Selloff Could Be Tip Of Iceberg4 Reasons TJX, Off-Price Retailers Will Keep Surging.

364,FL,"Toys R Us, the world's largest toy chain, plans to leave its flagship store in New York's Times Square as it faces an expected rent hike.
"
365,FL,"The 110,000-square-foot store at 1514 Broadway, with an indoor Ferris wheel and mechanical Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur, is too big for any single tenant, said C. Bradley Mendelson, vice chairman at Cushman & Wakefield, who is handling leasing for building-owner Bow Tie Partners. The landlord plans to break up the space, Mendelson said.""The configuration of space is just too expensive for any one tenant,"" Mendelson said. ""Market rates have changed substantially. It has nothing to do with Toys' ability. Toys has been a very good tenant for the last 15, 16 years.""The move reflects rapid rent growth in the Times Square ""bow tie"" — the blocks immediately surrounding the area where Broadway and Seventh Avenue cross, often called the crossroads of the world. Retailers clamoring for access to the square's tourist traffic have been driving rents higher.Rates for ground-floor retail space in the bow tie area averaged $2,317 a square foot in late 2014, higher than anywhere in Manhattan except Fifth Avenue between 49th and 59th streets, according to a report by the Real Estate Board of New York. Three years earlier, the average was $1,433 a square foot.'Proud Resident'Toys R Us has been ""a proud resident of Times Square since our international flagship store opened there,"" Linda Connors, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an emailed statement. ""The lease for our store in Times Square expires in 2016 and, as previously noted, we have been reviewing our lease renewal options. We have not signed a lease agreement for a new location, and any rumors regarding this ongoing process are just that.""The ground floor of 21,000 square feet is being marketed for $2,500 a square foot, its second-floor space for $350 a square foot, and the lower level at $150 a square foot, he said. There are four other retail tenants in the 150,000-square-foot building: Foot Locker (FL) and Swatch stores, a Starbucks (SBUX) coffee shop and the Bond 45 restaurant. Their leases all expire in February, the same time as Toys R Us, he said.Toys R Us may relocate to the retail storefronts across the square at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, where Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) controls the retail portion of the property, according to the Commercial Observer, which reported the retailer's move. Vornado, which owns a stake in the toy retailer, has installed Times Square's largest digital advertising sign above its stores.About 43,000 square feet of retail space are immediately available at the hotel, according to Vornado's website. Wendi Kopsick, a Vornado spokeswoman, said the company would have no comment.The model dinosaur and Ferris wheel are Toys R Us property, and could be used at its new store, ""wherever that may be,"" Mendelson said. There have been discussions with Toys R Us about taking less space but ""nothing ongoing right now"" with the retailer, he said. The Times Square store was a staging area for marketing for the company, which has struggled in competition with the likes of Wal-Mart (WMT) and Amazon.com (AMZN).

490,FL,"Frank Woolworth changed the retail landscape of America by keeping things simple and staying true to his beliefs.He founded F.W. Woolworth & Co. in 1879. The five-and-dime store chain, with its distinctive gold lettering and red awnings, made him one of the richest men in America.""For more than a century, Americans shopped at Woolworth's five-and-tens,"" wrote Jean Maddern Pitrone in ""F.W. Woolworth and the American Five and Dime."" ""These stores were as American as apple pie, baseball and Norman Rockwell paintings.""It was all a labor of love, as Woolworth was quoted as saying in ""Five And Ten: The Fabulous Life of F.W. Woolworth"" by John Winkler: ""No man can make a success of a business which he does not like.""Hard work was another Woolworth staple. ""There are plenty of opportunities today,"" he said. ""Many young men fail because they are not willing to sacrifice.""Come On InWoolworth made sure to provide customers an enjoyable shopping experience at his five-and-dime stores. ""Make it a rule not to bore or annoy customers,"" he wrote to his store managers. ""Let them look around to their heart's content. Don't try and press goods on them. ... Make your customers feel at home. ... Encourage people to meet their friends in your store. Give them something free.""His strategy led to riches. The estate of Woolworth (1852-1919), according to the Watertown, N.Y., city website, was estimated at $27 million when he died — $364 million in today 's money.Also by 1919, F.W. Woolworth & Co. operated some 1,100 U.S. stores and 90 in Britain and Ireland, with annual sales of over $100 million, or $1.4 billion today.A bronze bust of Woolworth, along with seven other industry giants, stands near the Merchandise Mart in Chicago.Paul Seaton, author of ""A Sixpenny Romance: Celebrating a Century of Value at Woolworths,"" wrote of the founder's ""dogged determination, refusing to take no for an answer.""Seaton told IBD: ""To achieve his goal of a successful chain of fixed-price stores, Frank didn't just buy from wholesalers and traveling salesmen. Line by line, he traced his products back to their sources, all over the world, and persuaded the manufacturers to deal direct.""Winkler concluded that all great ideas are traceable to a ""tenacious, believing individual. So it was in this case. Frank Woolworth clung to his belief in the future of the five-and-ten"" — a term that came from his selling nothing for over 10 cents, a practice that lasted until the 1930s.In lower Manhattan, he built the Woolworth Building, which towered nearly 800 feet high and for a time was the tallest skyscraper in the world.Woolworth's personal stature was so high, President Wilson drew him to his World War I Cabinet and tasked him with the responsibility of fundraising.By 1954, the number of Woolworth stores worldwide had grown to 2,800.But in 1997, Woolworth's went out of business and was absorbed into what is now Foot Locker (FL).Woolworth was born in Rodman, N.Y. His father was a farmer who went off to fight for the Union in the Civil War, reaching the rank of captain. Frank grew up working on the farm, much to his disdain.""My youth,"" he said in 1911, ""was the worst time of my life.""Farming taught him what he didn't want to do in life. ""He hated the blisters and calluses on his hands,"" Pitrone wrote. The boy also couldn't stand working the farm implements in the cold.Frank's teachers considered him a bit of a dreamer, Seaton wrote on WoolworthsMuseum.co.uk.Woolworth would reflect years later that ""dreaming never hurt anybody if he keeps working right behind the dream.""The future five-and-dime giant might have dreamt of such an outlet after he and his younger brother Charles were laughed at in a nearby Watertown department store while pondering a birthday present for their mom. Their crime? Wanting to pay with loose change.""Frank walked out and bought a similar item in another shop where the staff were more polite,"" Seaton wrote. ""In later life, he recalled the event and how he had told to his brother that one day people would be able to buy five or even 10 items for 50 cents, and shops would give helpful and friendly service to everyone, both rich and poor.""Farm, School, BusinessAfter leaving school at age 16 to work full time on the family farm, Woolworth figured a way out. He asked his mother to send him to night school to learn book keeping.She did. With her backing, the boy escaped the farm for life in business. By age 21, he had a sales position with a dry-goods store.""In his first job fresh off the farm at a retail store, he was humble and willing to do what was necessary with effort and dedication to prove his point,"" John Compton, who worked 43 years at Woolworth's, told IBD.In 1876, Woolworth married Jennie Creighton, whom his parents had hired as his nurse when he fell ill due to exhaustion and stress. Frank and Jennie would have three daughters.He excelled especially at merchandising. The next year, the dry-goods store wound up with a pile of unsold inventory. Woolworth was tabbed to create a table display where everything was on sale for 5 cents.He did so expertly, and the merchandise sold out.Finding his calling, Woolworth decided to open a five-and-dime store and approached his family for financial backing.The answer was no. Refusing to fold, he appealed to one of his employers, William Moore, who offered him some merchandise on credit. Woolworth was in business.Down, Not OutAfter first opening a store in Utica, N.Y., that failed, he opened one in Lancaster, Pa., in June 1879.""He became convinced that his failure in Utica was ... mainly due to the poor location of his store and Utica itself,"" Winkler wrote.In Utica, he'd sold merchandise at only one price: five cents.In Lancaster, he sparked what Winkler calls the first successful five-and-dime chain in the world.Woolworth was alerted to Lancaster by a friend who gave him a glowing account of the city and reason to believe that the thrifty Dutch population would welcome his store, Winkler wrote. Two years later came a second one in Harrisburg, managed by Charles.Woolworth believed in the power of merchandising.""You don't have to bark for customers,"" he wrote a store manager in the 1890s. ""That method is too ancient for us. But you can pull customers into your stores, and they won't know it. Draw them in with attractive window displays, and when you get them in, have a plentiful showing of the window goods on the counters.""By then, Woolworth had shifted into high gear, targeting cities east of the Rockies for 10 store openings a year. A few years later, he wrote, ""I have been looking over a census of the United States, and I am convinced that there are 100 cities and towns where we can locate (five-and-dime) cent stores.""He learned early from mistakes. ""Some of my first stores failed because I placed them in the wrong part of town,"" he said. ""There's always a right location. Find it.""Said Compton: ""Woolworth never gave up. In his failures, he would regroup and try again but making sure he did not repeat the causes of his earlier failures.""Woolworth made store openings gala events. Saturday starts were preceded by Friday-afternoon receptions of prominent people from each neighborhood. Orchestras enlivened the parties.Over a quarter-century beginning in 1879, Woolworth and Charles enticed family and former co-workers to open five-and-dime stores across North America.Woolworth created a buying consortium known as the Friendly Rival Syndicate. Five independent chains pooled ideas and shared common merchandise. In November 1909, the first British Woolworth's opened in Liverpool.By then, F.W. Woolworth & Co. shares were sold to store managers, family members and suppliers.""He showed extreme loyalty to the people he trusted, helping them through difficult times and rewarding their loyalty,"" Seaton said. ""All of his first managers became directors and VPs, and became immensely rich. Staff across the organization knew him as a kindly, hard-working man who paid everyone a Christmas bonus and gave paid holidays long before this was the norm, but also a man who should not be crossed and expected discretion, hard work and loyalty ... or else!""On Top Of ItWinkler recounted how Woolworth often traveled his store circuit, dropping in unannounced — and pity ""the manager whose counters, shelves or windows were slovenly. To him, the boss seemed ubiquitous. He particularly abhorred cheap and hasty window displays, and would often jump in himself and decorate.""Seaton said: ""Frank embodied the adage 'retail is detail.'""Woolworth had a single-minded focus in putting his stores on top and didn't let setbacks stop him.""Of course you will be discouraged,"" he said of the ups and downs in business. ""But keep on.""

Basketball shoes continue to be big winners in the hotly competitive athletic footwear game, with IBD 50 stock Nike scoring big points among consumers with its namesake and Jordan brands as well as collections from basketball stars LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant, say followers.The apparel and footwear powerhouse has stayed on top of its game by continually rolling out more shoes named after star basketball athletes. Its latest was the LeBron 12 'HRT of a Lion' basketball shoe launched at retail on Oct. 30 after being delayed due to what Nike said was a ""small cosmetic issue."" The debut coincided with the Cleveland Cavaliers forward playing in his first NBA regular-season game for the team in four years that evening.Playing The FieldNike has been gaining traction on several fronts. Ongoing innovation in areas such as its Flyknit technology, now expanded beyond use in running shoes to several other categories such as football and basketball shoes, has helped vault Nike's business to new heights.It has also seen a big jump in its business in Western Europe and in China; and Nike is also riding the crest of the athleticwear wave that's taken workout clothes and sneakers out of the gym and onto Main Street as ""the"" fashion trend.Nike scored a slam dunk in its most recent fiscal 2015 first quarter. Earnings soared 27% to $1.09 a share, ahead of views by 21 cents. Revenue rose 15% to $7.98 billion, beating analyst forecasts for $7.83 billion. It was Nike's biggest quarterly revenue gain since the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Nike has logged double-digit revenue gains the past three quarters.Revenue climbed 25% in Western Europe, 12% in North America and 20% in greater China.Strong performance came from Nike's direct-to-consumer business, which includes its owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through its website. Revenue increased 22%, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and significantly higher Nike.com revenue.""In this current macro environment and given the size of the company, for Nike to be able to grow this quarter's revenue 15% with the expectation of 20% EPS growth for the full year, this early in the fiscal year, is nothing short of an outstanding performance, we think,"" wrote Nomura analyst Bob Drbul in a note following the results.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to climb 21% to $3.60 a share, roughly double the 10% gain it saw the prior year. They see a 15% gain in fiscal 2016 and a 14% rise in 2017.Nike Stock JumpsNike shares hit an all-time high on Friday. They have surged 17% since the company reported first-quarter results on Sept. 25, and more than 30% from a February low.""The reason Nike's stock is doing so well is their products are some of the only ones selling with strength globally,"" Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors, told IBD. ""So they are not having to cut prices for their products.""Adds Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Svezia: ""They've executed pretty well. To some investors who need to look at big consumer discretionary names, Nike is doing well in the face of fiscal and global economic challenges vs. its consumer discretionary peers like McDonald's (MCD) and Coke (KO).""Basketball's Bank ShotThe basketball shoe category was among Nike's fastest growers and strongest performers in the quarter, with double-digit sales gains in North America.""Nike has always dominated the basketball business,"" said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a weekly newsletter. ""Clearly we're in a big basketball up-cycle (as) fashion. Nike has been through these up-cycles in basketball before and never has been able to sustain the up-cycle the way it has this one.""In this up-cycle, he adds, Nike's product development is much ""broader and deeper"" than it was before in terms of materials, colors and technology used in designing the shoes, and they're keeping the products new and fresh.He cites the point that Nike has continued to broaden the offerings in its Air Jordan franchise, which the company has ""kept bigger than ever, and it's been years since Michael Jordan played his last game.""Among the technologies he refers to is Flyknit, a special yarn and computer-controlled weaving method that lets footwear be ""engineered to provide a more precise fit for the specific needs of the foot,"" according to RunningShoesGuru.com.Nike's popular Flyknit athletic shoes are known for comfortable woven uppers that still provide support and come in bright colors and patterns.A Friend In The TrendNike is also benefiting from how athleticwear has become a go-to wardrobe for women and men to sport in most any casual setting. Power brand Under Armour (UA) is also cashing in on this trend.""Nike owns this business in theory,"" said analyst Svezia. ""It's the $30 billion gorilla in the market. They have significant market share and scale and have their weight behind them in terms of growing this business. They should do better than anyone else.""Drbul is upbeat about Nike's recent performance and prospects.""Overall, we think Nike has separated itself from the competition at the greatest level in the history of the company,"" he said. ""They are the creative machine and the innovation they have is second to none. They're hitting on all cylinders with growth in footwear, in apparel and in equipment. There's really very little weakness in its business.""In a report, Drbul said he was ""encouraged"" by Nike's ""robust"" direct-to-consumer performance in the first quarter, which was driven by a 70% increase in e-commerce and comp growth of 15%.He also noted that the company's efforts to ""reset the Chinese market are also clearly paying off.""He expects the Greater China region to grow at a low-mid teens rate for the full year.Sozzi expects Nike to be the ""winner"" in holiday season sales along with Under Armour and the new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and Apple iPhone 6 Plus smartphones.Nike competes with sports apparel outfits such as Under Armour and yoga-inspired clothing company Lululemon (LULU). It's part of IBD's Apparel-Shoes & Retail Manufacturing group, which also includes highly-rated Skechers USA (SKX).

887,FL,"The IBD 50 ranking of leading companies trading in the U.S. pinpoints top market performers. Today's IBD 50 list includes a pair of high performing apparel retailers, Foot Locker (FL) and Ross Stores (ROST).They're rated No. 1 and 2 in the 45-company Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group. Both carry a 92 IBD Composite Rating, meaning they've outperformed 92% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales, profit growth and stock price performanceFoot LockerAthletic shoe maker Foot Locker is slated to report second-quarter financial results on Aug. 21. It may get a lift from back-to-school sales as parents scramble to buy brand-new shoes for their kids to wear to school.Consensus is for Foot Locker to record earnings per share minus one-time items of 69 cents, an 8% increase from the same quarter a year ago.If the company tops Wall Street's earnings target, it will be two years of quarterly reports in a row it has beaten the Street.Revenue is projected to rise 1.3% to $1.66 billion.Foot Locker rose above a month-long first-stage flat base with a 63.76 buy point on May 21, closing at 64.

Dick's Sporting Goods edged higher last week but is in a four-month downtrend.Ross StoresDublin, Calif.-based Ross Stores operates nearly 1,300 Ross Dress for Less and dd's Discounts retail stores in 33 states, D.C. and Guam. Ross Dress for Less is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the U.S.Ross is on tap to report Q2 financial results Thursday after the market closes.

Volume was light on the breakout, which could explain why shares have stalled, but there was good upside volume when the company rallied on its earnings report May 23.Iconix Brand Group (ICON), which fell off the list, broke out in heavy trading April 30 and also is below the 42.57 buy point. The parent company of Danskin, London Fog, Mossimo, Joe Boxer and other apparel brands has held above its 50-day moving average despite the flagging action after its move to new highs.For the IBD 50 as a whole, it was a modestly successful week. The index rose 0.5%, which lagged the 1.4% increase for the Nasdaq and the 1.2% gain in the S&P 500.Sanchez Energy and Air Lease were responsible in large part for the IBD 50's weekly advance. Arris Group (ARRS), the maker of TV set-top boxes, was another big contributor, rising 7% last week to new highs.The IBD 50 has now climbed three weeks in a row and has risen back above the 50-day moving average.

In Q1, earnings fell 17%.As ""athleisure"" — think yoga pants, sweat-wicking tops and colorful sneakers — continues to dominate the weekend warrior wardrobe, activewear companies such as Under Armour, Nike, Foot Locker (FL) and others have benefitted from the trend.Athletic footwear, in particular, is the ""earnings season trend to play"" in Q2, says Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole in a Friday note.""Valuation remains at a high peak, but our view is as long as UA's 2Q report indicates its story is getting better, and we think it will, the stock should rise,"" he said of Under Armour specifically.Under Armour has also made a foray into the white-hot wearables space, currently led by fitness band IPO Fitbit (FIT) and kept in the headlines by the Apple (AAPL) Watch.But the Grip, backed by Under Armour and HTC, will reportedly be delayed in its rollout.

948,FL,"Will tonight's FOX Presidential debate be more like ""All in The Family"" or ""The West Wing""?
"
949,FL,"For the entertainment factor alone - millions of households (both at home and abroad) will be tuned in to the 9 p.m. ET Varsity Presidential Debate - featuring the likes of 'The Donald', Governor (FL) John Ellis Bush (JEB), Governor (WI) Scotty Walker, Governor (AK) Mike Huckabee (really?), Neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Senator (TX) Teddy Cruz (?), Senator (FL) Marco Rubio, Senator (KY) Rand Paul (?), The always outspoken, roll up your sleeves and get in your face NJ Governor Chris Christie, and the sleeping giant - Ohio Governor - John Kasich.
"
950,FL,"The other 7 candidates have been relegated to the JV team and will appear at 5 p.m. in what Carly Fiorina has dubbed - ""The Happy Hour Debate""! How happy is Lindsay Graham? He actually lobbied for his position to be on the JV team......
"
951,FL,"So - if nothing else - it is sure to be a bit entertaining and will provide so much fodder for the late night talk shows and of course the perennial favorite - SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.
"
952,FL,"No matter what happens tonight - the field has to start to consolidate if the GOP has any chance at all of delivering a message to American voters. Currently - with 17 candidates running - the GOP appears fractured and fragmented and the message is getting lost in the antics provided cost free (because he doesn't need any money - as he has told us over and over) by none other than The Donald. The big question - how many minutes into the debate before The Donald's head explodes?
"
953,FL,"Look - don't expect too much tonight - with only 2 hours and 10 candidates - there will not be a lot of substance to the debate - How could any one of them possibly really state their case for why they should be the POTUS (Pres. of the United States)? And just how will 3 moderators - Chris Wallace, Brett Baier and Megyn Kelly really be able to control the crowd without it looking like a sitcom? So sit back, get the popcorn and enjoy the show. Nothing that happens tonight will have any effect on the broader market or investor/trader mentality.

955,FL,"Stocks spiked sharply higher yesterday morning but then lost some ground as investors/traders digested another mixed batch of economic news (ADP) and earnings (Walt Disney (DIS) - the standout disappointment). This then caused 'renewed' speculation about WWTFDN (What will the Fed do NOW?) - causing so many to suggest that they won't do anything in September......So the indexes wallowed back and forth falling from their highs of the day - but not collapsing at all.
"
956,FL,"Given all the chatter from the Fed and their 'representatives' about raising interest rates, yesterday's ADP private payroll report - stunned them.....(So much for that improving labor market) - Job growth was a big disappointment at 185K vs. expectations of 215K, and last month - revised lower, So traders immediately took this as a sign that this weak jobs report might cause the Fed to hesitate.
"
957,FL,"Then we got the Disney earnings - and guess what - not so good.....they reported another big miss on their TV networks and amusement park revenues - the stock plunged 9% taking the DOW index with it. Talk of a slowing economy once again takes the spotlight (Yawn)....... Now - it may not be a good sign that the Disney theme parks underperformed - but I have to ask - Have YOU been to one lately?
"
958,FL,"For a family of 4 you have to fly to FL (or CA), - and at today's airfares that will run you $3000, pay $940 just for the 3-day pass (or upgrade for another $40 each to get what exactly?), or you could get the VIP guided tour for a mere $500/hour if you so choose, get a hotel room for $500/night or $1500 plus tax, buy breakfast, lunch and dinner at ridiculous prices - $15 eggs, $8 cokes and $10 frozen meat patties (I refuse to call them burgers) - and then be subjected to standing in long lines waiting to get on a 3 minute ride while the kids are screaming, crying, fighting, ....so after it's all said and done - this family has spent a minimum of $7k or $8k - but probably closer to $10k or $12k after you buy all the Disney 'stuff' for 3 days and have they really had a good time? (I mean be honest here).
"
959,FL,"How many times can you take a picture with Minnie Mouse , Cinderella or Jasmine? So it may not be a good sign for Disney but I am not sure that it means the economy is slowing or worsening - I think it means that people don't want that kind of vacation. I think the mindset is changing a bit.....I think families want a different experience - and with a stronger dollar - taking your family to Europe is more of a option............So I think the vacation dollars are just being spent more wisely. Again - maybe not so good for Disney - but it is good for families.

960,FL,"From a technical perspective - market breadth still looks a bit weak and lower oil prices aren't helping the action. the Dow continues to trade below long-term support and we are only days away from the feared 'Death Cross' - where the Dow's down-trending 50-day moving average crosses the up trending 200-dma - a technical sign of more difficult times ahead - but remember - do not overemphasize this....the Dow is only 30 names....the one to watch for is the S&P 500 and that is nowhere near as ominous....in fact - the broader market is holding up well and is closer to all time highs than not. Yesterday - it managed to trade back above short-term supports at 2094 to close higher at 2099. This morning - Futures are flat as the market awaits tomorrows NFP report. I suspect that the market will find support right in here at the 2085/2090 range.....- volumes to remain muted as we await tomorrow's report.
"
961,FL,"In Europe this morning - The BoE voted to hold rates steady - after they cut their near-term forecast for inflation - due to lower energy prices and a strengthening pound. This means they are keeping rates at 'record lows' for the time being....In Germany - manufacturing orders showed a strong increase at 2% vs. exp of 0.7%....Stocks had no real reaction - with markets currently mixed ... insignificant really. FTSE -0.11%, CAC 40 +0.11%, DAX +0.06%, Eurostoxx +0.09%, Spain -0.09% and Italy -0.13% - Greece catching a bit of a bounce after 3 days of slaughter - currently +0.03%

977,FL,"Skechers USA (SKX) shares plunged Wednesday as the back-to-school season winds down, pulling the highly rated shoe sector lower.Sterne Agee, citing SportScanInfo data, said last week's sales for the casual and athletic shoemaker rose just 13.3% from a year earlier, far weaker than the 37.3% rise in the prior eight weeks.But Sterne Agee analyst Sam Poser said it's a temporary blip for Skechers, resulting from an abrupt end to hot back-to-school season sales: ""Wind-down of back to school is not a reason to worry.""He maintained a buy rating on the company with a 70 price target.The drop wasn't confined to Skechers, Poser adds, noting particular weakness in the midtier department store channel. The overall casual athletic category also saw growth decelerate to 7.6% last week from the 42% gain during the back-to-school season.The drop comes amid a general malaise among retailers, according to Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins.""Consumers have settled into a shopping lull following strong Labor Day weekend traffic and sales,"" he said in a report Wednesday.Skechers is the highest rated stock in the eight-company Apparel-Shoes and Related Manufacturing group, which is ranked a strong 11 on IBD's list of 197 industries.Shares were down 8.6% in Wednesday midday trading in the stock market today.Among other leaders in the group, Nike (NKE), the largest U.S. shoemaker, rose fractionally.No. 2 Deckers Outdoor (DECK) was down less than 1%, and Steven Madden (SHOO) rose about 1%.In the related Retail Shoes/Accessories group, highly rated Foot Locker (FL) slid less than 1% while rival Finish Line (FINL) advanced 0.4%.

982,FL,"In the race to wow this back-to-school season, athleticwear is primed to be a front-runner.If followers are on target, power brands such as IBD 50 stock Under Armour (UA) and Nike (NKE) should keep up the fast pace as workout attire from leggings to sweat shirts ranks among uniforms of choice for youths heading back to the classroom.Highly rated casual/dress and athletic footwear outfit Skechers USA (SKX) should, according to analysts' forecasts, also be among the top performers this back-to-school season, which runs from the end of July to mid-September. So should action sports retailer Zumiez (ZUMZ).Athletic footwear retailers such as IBD 50 company Foot Locker (FL) and Finish Line (FINL) are also looking at the top of their game for this key shopping period.""Athletic leisurewear is huge,"" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, an industry research firm. ""More and more kids are gravitating toward fitness leisurewear to wear in the classroom, whether it's Under Armour or Nike.""Industry InnovatesPerkins says the trend is benefiting sporting-goods stores such as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and department stores such as Macy's (M) that carry these types of offerings.""The whole athletic footwear and activewear segment has been on fire,"" adds B. Riley & Co. analyst Jeff Van Sinderen. ""You have to give credit to Nike. They have an amazing machine that comes up with phenomenal products, and that keeps demand high. It's all about product innovation, which is the biggest driver of this business.""Overall, retailers should fare better this back-to-school season than they did last year when factors such as heavy competition and economic and job concerns led to weak back-to-school spending.""I continue to be optimistic on this back-to-school season,"" said Michael Niemira, principal of the Retail Economist.He forecasts a 4.7% rise vs. a year earlier in back-to-school sales for electronics, family clothing, books and shoe store categories for July, August and September. That would be up from the paltry 0.9% rise in 2013 and the biggest gain since 2010, he says.The drivers? ""There's an underlying improvement in the economy that is finally helping to lift consumer demand, especially for back-to-school items,"" he said.Niemira says that retailers have moved beyond the weather-related ""soft patch"" earlier in the year, and are getting a ""broader-based lift"" triggered by pent-up demand.Adds Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors: ""I think back-to-school is shaping up better than the stock market may be expecting.""Sozzi expects the ""strong momentum"" he saw before Labor Day weekend to carry over through the first couple of weeks the kids are back to school and do more buying based on what their classmates are wearing.The strong momentum, he adds, will be driven by ""more exciting"" offerings for kids and their parents to buy, such as ""jogger"" pants. Printed pants for teens and girls and mesh tops for men and young adults are also hot.Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters, says retail sales have been improving, but at a very slow rate.""In general, earnings growth and revenue growth (for retailers) have shown improvement from a year ago for this past quarter, and our estimates show a strong third quarter and a healthy back-to-school season,"" she said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect same-store sales for the third quarter — which includes August, September and October for most retailers — to rise 1.4% vs. a year earlier. That would be higher than the 1.3% they forecast for the second quarter.Shoppers kicked their back-to-school spending into high gear in August, says Perkins, leading to a 5% pop in same-store sales for the month, ahead of views for 4.2%.He says based on his store checks, back-to-school season looks to be ""shaping up to be a decent one.""Under Armour ShinesIn terms of apparel brands, ""the big winner for back-to-school is Under Armour,"" said Sozzi.""Under Armour apparel has become the uniform of choice for teens,"" he said. And Nike, he adds, is the winner on the footwear side.Shoes, and athletic footwear in particular, continue to be hot sellers for back-to-school.In the four weeks ended Aug. 17, athletic footwear sales grew 3% vs. a year earlier and children's athletic footwear rose 5%, says an NPD Group report.Basketball shoes are a slam dunk for back-to-school, with a 70% year-over-year jump in sales in the four-week period, says NPD.Van Sinderen said that based on his channel checks for late August, Foot Locker, the leader in the basketball footwear category, and Finish Line, which leads in running shoes, were both doing well for the back-to-school season.Among teen retailers, Perkins cites Zumiez as being well-positioned. He says it's ""niche-oriented,"" with lots of products that you won't find in other stores.More traditional teen apparel retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Aeropostale (ARO) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) won't make the grade, says Martis. She says teens already have the ""basic items"" offered by these retailers. ""They want unique fashion trends for back-to-school,"" she adds.And fast-fashion chains such as Forever 21 and Zara will be the winners on the hot fashion front, according to Martis.Promotions ExpectedOverall, inventories are in ""better shape"" than in last year's back-to-school season, says Perkins. Retailers are carrying less inventory, so they don't have to run ""fire sales.""However, retailers continue to be highly promotional.""For the lower- and middle-income consumer, price points have to fit into a budget that's not growing,"" Perkins said. ""That leads to promotions. And pressure from online retailers is forcing brick-and-mortar retailers to discount and compete even more.""""Online will continue to erode in-store as retailers haven't yet learned how to compete and get online to complement their in-store business rather then detract from it,"" added Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for NPD, in an email.Besides activewear and athletic shoes, hot sellers will include smartphone cases and handbags, he says.Tablets and smartphones, such as the new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus introduced Tuesday, could also grab plenty of sales.""Electronics are a must-have for (back-to-school), and when it comes to tablets, Apple iPads are still a favorite,"" Martis noted.

1038,FL,"Lululemon is a part of IBD's retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group. It has an 90 Composite Rating out of a possible 99. The group also includes Foot Locker, Finish Line (FINL) and Ross Stores (ROST).Did Lululemon Athletica (LULU) pick up the pace in the first quarter?If analysts are right, the yoga-inspired athletic apparel retailer and manufacturer will see slower sales and earnings gains than it did in the prior quarter, as the harsh winter in many parts of the U.S. and the West Coast port labor slowdown took their toll on its business.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings to slip 3% from a year earlier to 33 cents a share when the company reports first-quarter results on Tuesday morning. That would be weaker than the 4% gain it saw in the fourth quarter.Sales have risen at a double-digit rate in all but one of the past 15 quarters. Analysts see a slowdown in the first quarter. They expect sales to rise 8.9% to $418.94 million vs. a 16% gain in the prior quarter.Despite the slowdown chatter, Lululemon had a good week, closing up 4% Friday to 63.80, up 6.7% for the week.After going through a tough stretch with product, management and supply-chain issues a couple of years ago, Lululemon has made a bit of a comeback as its sales benefit from the ""athleisure"" fashion trend that has taken workout clothes and footwear out of the gym and onto Main Street.Power brandsNike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) also have ridden the crest of this trend as has giant athletic footwear and apparel retail operator Foot Locker (FL).But winter's blast and the West Coast port backup wreaked havoc with Lululemon's business in the first quarter.""We had a challenging start to the year as February was externally impacted by both weather and product delivery delays,"" said CFO Stuart Haselden on the fourth-quarter conference call.""First, we estimate that weather had an approximate $3 million impact to sales in February and early March due to store closures and lower traffic in the areas that were impacted by the storms. Second . .. while on-time factory handover delivery performance has improved, we have not been able to avoid the delays in ocean shipment times into the West Coast ports.""Sterne Agee CRT analyst Sam Poser wrote an upbeat note on Lululemon in April after meeting with CFO Haselden in a Lululemon store in Manhattan.""We now believe that the necessary steps to improve on the operational shortfalls that have recently worried us are being taken,"" Poser noted in the report, where he upgraded the company from a neutral to a buy rating. ""We believe the product mix is evolving well. New offerings in men's and women's bottoms are far better than prior offerings in our view. The new product should attract loyal core LULU customers as well as new customers.""John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a weekly newsletter, is more cautious:""They've addressed a lot of the issues they had under former management,"" Horan told IBD.

1039,FL,"Catwalks from New York to Milan confirmed the trend this spring: sneakers have arrived.Models during the spring shows trotted out the latest designer fashions footed in all manner of sneaker styles, from basic white to colorful high-tops.A look around the office, mall or line at your local coffee spot says as much. Sneakers are entrenched fashion accessories. Of course, teens are still the early and most active adopters, coveting the latest fanciful launches from top brands — from flat Converse All Stars to high-tech performance athletic shoes.Teens' penchant for the next new sneaker has been powering strong results at athletic footwear retailer Foot Locker (FL), an IBD 50 stock.Its core ""sweet-spot"" customer base skews to people ages 12 to 20, and heavily male, analysts say.""Teens want brands other kids are wearing,"" said analyst Christopher Svezia of Susquehanna Financial Group.And Foot Locker is delivering. Quarterly earnings have notched up in double or triple digits on a year-over-year basis for all but one of the last 15 quarters. Per-share earnings in the first quarter ending May 3 jumped 22% to $1.11 a share, beating analyst views.Same-store sales in the quarter advanced 7.6%, while total revenue was up 14% to nearly $1.9 billion, also above views.Slam-Dunk SalesFoot Locker's customers are going especially wild for colorful basketball shoes, the fastest growing category in the athletic footwear market.Nike (NKE)-branded footwear, including the hot-selling Jordan basketball brand, accounts for about 60% of Foot Locker's sales, analysts say.New York-based Foot Locker carries a number of other footwear brands with sneaker offerings, including Adidas, Reebok, Under Armour (UA) and Puma.Nike and the Nike-affiliate Jordan Brand are the top two basketball brands in the U.S., with Jordan No. 1, according to the NPD Group.The research firm reported that U.S. basketball footwear sales jumped 21% in the 12 months ending in April, making the category the fastest growing in athletic footwear. The next most popular basketball brands were Germany-based Adidas and its affiliate Reebok.Deutsche Bank Securities estimates that basketball footwear makes up 40% to 50% of Foot Locker's product mix.""Think about all those fancy sneakers, whether running shoes or basketball shoes from Nike or Adidas or whoever. That is why Foot Locker has been outperforming most of its peers,"" said Svezia.Foot Locker competes with Finish Line (FINL) and to a lesser extent Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Sports Authority, among others.The company's core customer, Svezia said, ""is looking for what's next and what's hot — and having it in stock.""Basketball is especially ""critical"" for Foot Locker, Svezia said, adding that the category comes with ""some of the highest prices in footwear,"" at $125 to $250 a pair.Foot Locker's ties with Nike and other brands include brand shop-within-shops such as House of Hoops, Yardline, Fly Zone and Jordan 23 on the Nike side plus Adi Collective and Originals shops for Adidas. As of May 3, the firm boasted 1,041 Foot Locker stores in the U.S., 604 in Europe, 128 in Canada and 92 in the Asia-Pacific region. It also operated 345 Kids Foot Locker stores and 241 Lady Foot Lockers, plus 544 Champs Sports and 276 Footaction locations.Sneakers have also been fueling sales at Kids Foot Locker, which has shown mid-teen to 20% growth the past few quarters, said Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell in a June 13 research note.That suggests the ""sneaker culture is no fad and likely here to stay for years to come,"" he wrote, ""as feet grow.""In a recent phone interview, analyst Sam Poser of Sterne Agee said he expects the largely mall-based Foot Locker to continue to benefit from the ""very strong sneaker trend"" through at least mid-2016 ""as a lot of brands continue to innovate and build up to the (Summer) Olympics.""""Foot Locker has done a great job over the years positioning itself in basketball,"" Poser said in a June 11 report on Foot Locker, which came with a buy rating.""Arguably, Foot Locker globally owns mind share for basketball retail,"" he wrote.Basketball Beyond BordersAccording to Poser, Nike's launch this spring of the Air Jordan 6 ""Carmine"" basketball shoe logged $44 million in sales in the first eight days it was out. He cited data from SportScanInfo.Foot Locker's management has told analysts that passion for basketball is even spreading to soccer-obsessed Europe. They expect that newfound passion to trickle down to basketball footwear sales over time. The company did not respond to an interview request.Foot Locker sales in Europe have been strong, thanks in part to sales of select Nike brands, analysts say.More Stores PlannedThe company is eyeing expansion in Europe. Last year's acquisition of German athletic retail chain Runners Point Group gives it more than 200 Runners Point stores and a related e-commerce site.Foot Locker also plans to expand its children's business through new Kids Foot Locker stores and additional space in Foot Locker locations.But Foot Locker's women's and apparel businesses have been sore spots. Apparel fell to 23% of sales last year from as much as 30% a decade ago, Trussell noted.The company aims to get apparel back to that level in part through the sale of more premium branded products. Apparel has been doing better in stores that have been part of the firm's ongoing remodeling program, he said.On the women's side, Foot Locker is testing a fitness concept called Six:02, which carries yoga pants, work-out wear and other related apparel.Six:02 now has nine stores open and an e-commerce site. Many more stores could roll out as early as next year, Trussell predicted.

The IBD 50 list compiles top-rated growth stocks with top fundamentals that have strong relative price strength in the market.Sportswear retailer Foot Locker (FL), ranked 30th, carries team-branded apparel, including jerseys, caps and scarves. A recent boost in sales of running shoes made by Nike and Under Armour is good news for retailers like Foot Locker, which sells gear for both kids and adults.The New York City-based company says it has a total of 3,546 stores, with retail stores in 23 countries and franchise partners in nine countries.Foot Locker also has been expanding in soccer-crazy Europe, where it has more than 600 stores.

The company, based in Victor, N.Y., has more than 100 brands in its portfolio, including Corona, Svedka vodka and more recent acquisitions Grupo Modelo and Crown Imports.Both Modelo and Crown have been paying off handsomely, and ""strengthened Constellation's position as the largest importer of beer in the U.S. and the country's third largest beer brewer and seller after Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors,"" according to a New America profile.The company is expected to report Q1 earnings on July 2 before the open.

1093,FL,"Most of Under Armour's sales are in apparel, which in the third quarter rose 26% to $561 million, part of it driven by a 5% rise in the average selling price.

1094,FL,"Footwear accounts for about 11% of sales, but it has the potential to grow with retail chains such as Finish Line (FINL) and Footlocker (FL), Poser says. Both are key footwear partners. Department stores also offer ""huge opportunities"" to grow apparel and footwear, he says.
"
1095,FL,"""In footwear, our big story for 2014 is Speedform,"" said Plank in the conference call, referring to the company's latest running shoe. It was inspired by spacesuits and the form-fitting ""material innovation of a bra,"" as the firm's website puts it. The shoes are made in bra factories rather than footwear factories.
"
1096,FL,"Under Armour runs a relatively small retail business, mostly outlet stores, which grew by six in the third quarter to 112 in North America, up from 96 the year before. Four more outlets were expected to open in the fourth quarter, but the pace of growth is expected to slow this year.
"
1097,FL,"Existing outlet stores are being expanded, however, to accommodate more women's apparel, youth products and footwear, noted analyst Christopher Svezia of Susquehanna Financial Group.

1098,FL,"Under Armour operates two full-price stores, one in its hometown of Baltimore and the other a recently opened store in Tysons Corner, Va., near Washington, D.C. It plans to open a full-line store in Manhattan's Soho in the spring.

1101,FL,"Under Armour has already expanded into Europe, notably in the U.K. But Svezia has pointed out that management believes the playing field is better in Latin America, where the demographics are younger and more sports-obsessed.Activewear is a hot fashion statement on and off gym floors and other exercise venues.And Under Armour (UA), which designs and distributes what it calls ""highly technical"" products for men, women and youth, is a beneficiary of that trend.""It suddenly became acceptable (in 2013) to wear activewear in virtually every imaginable venue, including some offices,"" said analyst Faye Landes of Cowen & Co. in a report this month on consumer retail themes.Reasons for this, she speculated, include more comfortable fabrics, peer pressure to look like you care about keeping fit or the desire to ""dress up"" for exercise classes.New Cold-Weather GearUnder Armour keeps upping the performance and fashion ante with new products, the latest a ColdGear Infrared line of clothing to absorb and retain body heat, launched in the third quarter.Under Armour holds a spot on the IBD 50 list of top-rated growth stocks. It has logged 17 straight quarters of double-digit sales growth, with the third quarter's up 26% to $723 million. But shares fell nearly 5% after management's early outlook for 2014 came in at the lower end of its long-term target of 20% to 25% a year. The stock has since climbed 11% to around 89, setting an all-time high.Earnings in the quarter also grew by 26%, to 68 cents a share. Analysts expect 2013 profit growth to slow to 19% from 30% in 2012, but they see 24% growth this year, according to Thomson Reuters.Landes expects another banner year in activewear as new technologies to make clothing softer, thinner or wick better keep consumers going back for more.In her report, one special mention went to Under Armour's men's performance chino. Landes said it ""makes plain old pants seem both uncomfortable and passe.""Most of Under Armour's revenue comes from wholesale distribution to sporting goods retailers such as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Sports Authority and Hibbett Sports (HIBB), among others.While men's products constitute the bulk of sales, Under Armour is making a big push to expand its women's business, still less than 30% of apparel sales in the third quarter. But CEO Kevin Plank said in the last quarter's conference call that women's ""will be larger than men's someday in the future.""A Swipe At The SwooshNike (NKE), Under Armour's chief rival, typically is the No. 1 athletic brand carried in sporting specialty stores. But Under Armour is catching up, says Sam Poser, a Sterne Agee analyst.One reason is that retailers don't want to put their eggs in one basket, Poser said, adding that Nike accounts for as much as 60% of stores' athletic business.""All of the sudden, here comes Under Armour emerging into a very big player, especially in apparel.

1207,FL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Foot Locker has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.5x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Foot Locker’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 25. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Foot Locker has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Foot Locker stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Foot Locker has a P/S ratio of about 0.9. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. If anything, FL is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Foot Locker currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Foot Locker a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Foot Locker might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A. This gives FL a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower, while the full year estimate has seen eleven up and one down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate remained stable in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased by 3.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Foot Locker, Inc. Price and Consensus Foot Locker, Inc. Price and Consensus | Foot Locker, Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineFoot Locker is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 24% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence.However, with a Zacks Rank #3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below: So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.  See the pot trades we're targeting>>

1209,FL,"L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) witnessed an increase in comparable sales (comps) for the third consecutive month as it reported February sales numbers. Comps for the four-week period (ended Mar 3, 2018) rose 3%, after registering an increase of 7% and 1% in January and December, respectively. We note that rate of comps growth has decelerated from the month of January.Net sales, in the month under review, also surged 11.5% to $853.9 million. While, comps increased 2% at Victoria’s Secret, the same at Bath & Body Works improved 7%.Victoria’s Secret merchandise margin rate decreased significantly in February primarily due to rise in promotional activities. However, in case of Bath & Body Works, merchandise margin rate was flat in the same time period compared with last year.Moreover, L Brands announced new share buyback program worth $250 million, which includes $23.1 million remaining under the previous program.Stock PerformanceEver since the company announced fourth-quarter results on Feb 28, shares of this specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products have declined 15.6%. Moreover, in a month, the stock has declined 14.5% wider than the industry’s decrease of 0.5%. The decrease in stock price can be primarily attributed to soft first-quarter and fiscal 2018 outlook. Per L Brands, first-quarter comps are anticipated to be in low-single digits. Sales are projected to be nearly 5 points higher than comps. Further, gross margin is expected to decline marginally due to a fall in merchandise margin rate, somewhat offset by lower buying and occupancy expenses. Earnings per share are envisioned in the range of 15-20 cents versus 33 cents in the year-ago quarter.For fiscal 2018, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s Gross margin rate is anticipated to remain flat compared with the prior-year tally.

1210,FL,"Friday, March 2, 2018President Trump announced a tariff of 25% on imported steel to the U.S. yesterday, surprising not only market indexes but his own White House advisors. His intentions were very clear: “We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!” the President tweeted.But economists and traders took the news quite differently, sending the Dow plummeting 500 points on the news. Trump’s announcement, which also included a 10% tariff on aluminum imports, sent question marks ricocheting around not only the steel industry but geopolitical certainties in the Western hemisphere — most importantly, NAFTA.The North American Free Trade Agreement would be immediately affected by these tariffs, as Canada is the biggest steel and aluminum importer to the U.S. in the world (16% steel, 43% aluminum). Currently, our closest ally and trading partner hopes to work out certain exemptions — or at least reassurances — regarding these purported tariffs, that they won’t be held to such an extreme new standard. This is especially considering there’s no secret who Trump’s target of these tariffs really is: China.Since the early days of his presidential campaign, Trump has said he’d get tough with China, who he claims has taken advantage of trade with the U.S. over decades of non-action from previous administrations. So these tariffs are clearly a way Trump sees to help neutralize Chinese interest on steel imports. Besides this, obviously import tariffs would help domestic steel makes, like Nucor NU and U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) greatly.However, though the steel industry in this country hires roughly 140K workers, that’s a drop in the bucket compared to the 6.5 million workforce engaged in steel usage. Chief among these is the automobile industry, which relies greatly on steel and aluminum products. Higher prices for these materials would lead to higher prices for cars and trucks, and this sort of chain reaction through the economy is precisely why the market is having a problem digesting this news.Currently, the Dow is down another 200 points in today’s pre-market, the Nasdaq is 80 points off its Thursday close and the S&P 500 down 20 points. It’s unlikely this issue will enjoy a swift correction in normal trading hours, so as long as this remains the main pressure on stocks today, we expect to close in the red again to end the week.Q4 Earnings Sweep-UpQuickly, both J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) are also trading down ahead of today’s opening bell.

The stock is down more than 7% following the announcement of fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results due to lower-than-expected top-line results and muted outlook.We note that in the past three months, the stock has increased 0.3% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.7%.This operator of athletic shoes and apparel retailer posted quarterly earnings of $1.26 per share that beat Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.

Gross margin had contracted 340 and 100 basis points in the second and first quarter, respectively.Further, SG&A as a percentage of sales is likely to be up 60-80 basis points in the fourth quarter. SG&A expense rate increased 30 basis points to 19.7% during the third quarter.As a result, the bottom line is likely to decline in the quarter. Foot Locker had earlier forecasted earnings per share to decline in the range of 15-25% in the fourth quarter, excluding the benefit of 12 cents a share from 53rd week. In the third, second and first quarter, the same has declined 23%, 34% and 2.2%, respectively.Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Foot Locker, Inc.

1217,FL,"Markets ended in negative territory on Wednesday following the release of minutes from Fed’s latest policy meeting. Bond rates surged to a 4-year high following the release of the minutes and weighed heavily on equities. Earlier in the session, major benchmarks had rallied after the minutes expressed concerns on the lack of broad-based wage gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.7%, to close at 24,797.78. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.6% to close at 2,701.33. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,218.23, losing about 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 2.8% to close at 20.02.A total of around 6.96 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.49 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow tumbled 167 points to end in the red. The blue-chip index had earlier rallied 303 points at its session high. For the month, the Dow industrials are trading 5.2% down. Also, the Nasdaq declined 16 points to also finish in negative territory.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 shed almost 15 points to end in negative territory. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, only two finished in the green. While the laggards were led by real estate and energy sectors, financials led the gainers. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) were down 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. However, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) rose a paltry 0.1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The three major indexes along with the broader market suffered losses following mixed signals from the Fed at the end of its policy meeting on Wednesday. This led to a surge in yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which rose to a 4-year high at above 2.95%. This surge in yields in turn weighed heavily on equities paring gains notched up earlier in the session.Fed Indicates a Series of Upcoming Rate HikesAt the end of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Fed officials stated that most members had revised their economic growth projections upward from the last meeting in December. Officials also stated that continuing economic expansion and rising inflation would warrant a gradual increase in interest rates in the future.Moreover, the minutes also stated that gradually increasing the interest rates would also help in sustaining the current economic growth as well as ‘balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment.’Members of the FOMC also commented that ‘upside risks’ to economic growth had increased due to a combined effect of tax reforms, an uptick in consumer spending and consumer confidence and other indications which showed that the economy had maintained an uninterrupted pace of growth. This is what led the Fed officials to increase projections on economic growth.Coming to inflation, the officials stated that core personal consumption (excluding food and energy) would increase ""notably faster in 2018."" Notably, personal consumption expenditure index is the preferred measure of inflation that the Fed uses.Further, members also commented that the Fed had actually ‘underestimated’ the effects that tax reforms would have on consumer spending and economic growth. Also, they remained highly skeptical about how much of an ‘impact’ tax reforms would have on wage growth. Following the tax cuts, several companies have issued bonuses to their employees. But the long term impact of these recent cash transfers remains unclear at this point.Economic DataOn the economic data front, existing home sales for the month of January came in at 5.38 million units, below the consensus estimate of 5.61 million units. In December, the metric came in at 5.56 million units.Stocks That Made HeadlinesFoot Locker Unveils Capital Spending Plan Before Q4 EarningsJust few days to go for its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release, and Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) has already played smart.

1218,FL,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 28. While the company posted in-line earnings in the last quarter, the off-price retailer has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2% in the trailing four quarters. The company has been gaining from its robust efforts to attract traffic and drive sales, which have also helped it overcome hurdles related to escalated wage costs.TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Let’s see what’s in store this time.Factors Driving the QuarterTJX Companies has been witnessing year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines for over a year now. Notably, the top-line growth can be largely attributed to solid customer traffic, which is backed by the company’s impressive merchandise mix, along with the other sales-driving efforts. Further, strong merchandise margins reflect the company’s disciplined inventory management and strength of its off-price business model.Among the company’s sales driving efforts, we commend its focus on store expansion, e-commerce as well as marketing initiatives. During the third quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking its total count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017. Also, management remains encouraged by the initial response to its recently opened 3 HomeSense outlets in the United States and its first TK Maxx outlet in Australia. TJX Companies has also undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales by recruiting an experienced internet management team. The company’s e-commerce business Sierra Trading Post is also working toward growing its business. Moreover, TJX’s official website tjmaxx.com, accessible from tablets and smartphones, appeals to the young generation — the company’s main target consumers. TJX Companies plans to add more categories to the online shopping site and invest categorically in it to differentiate it from brick-and-mortar stores.Further, TJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) have been boosting traffic at stores. Its gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) also help the company to improve customer engagement. Further, in order to encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping of brands, the company is expanding its loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada. Together, these factors are likely to drive the company in the fourth quarter. Incidentally, during its third-quarter conference call, management stated that it began the fourth quarter on a strong note, with a solid inventory position and other sales-driving efforts keeping it well placed for the holiday season.Increased Costs Pose ConcernsHigh wage costs have been a hurdle for TJX Companies for a while now. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, higher wages dented the company’s bottom line growth by 1%, with its pre-tax margin going down by 10 basis points. Further, wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2% in fiscal 2018, which also remains a threat to the upcoming results.Final Thoughts & Q4 ExpectationsNevertheless, TJX Companies’ robust sales-boosting initiatives are likely to help the company overcome these hurdles and fuel growth. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings (excluding a nearly 11 cents benefit from an additional week in the quarter) in the range of $1.14-$1.16 per share, reflecting 11-13% increase from the year-ago period earnings. Wage increases are expected to hurt bottom-line growth by 1%, while currency is likely to positively impact earnings growth by 1%. The company expects consolidated comps growth of 1-2% in the fourth quarter.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.28, which shows a 24.3% surge from $1.03 recorded in the year-ago period. In fact, the company’s earnings estimate was revised upward in the last seven days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $10,821 million, up 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that TJX Companies is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

This provider of nutrition and weight management solutions has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 22.1% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.Herbalife LTD. Price and EPS Surprise  Herbalife LTD. Price and EPS Surprise | Herbalife LTD. Quote Soft Volumes Remains a ConcernHerbalife has been grappling with soft volumes for quite some time now, especially in its North American and Mexico operations. Unfortunately, the weak volume trend lingered in fourth-quarter 2017, as evident from the recently reported preliminary volume points data. Herbalife’s preliminary regional volume metrics reveal declines of 7.3%, 8.4% and 6.6% across North American, Mexico and South & Central American regions, respectively. Preliminary results for the upcoming quarter indicate sales volume point growth of 0.2%, 9.6% and 4.5% in its Asia Pacific, China and the EMEA regions respectively. However, the upsides were inadequate to offset the declines in the aforementioned regions. As a result, the company’s overall sales volume points went down 1.8%.As mentioned earlier, volumes have long been a concern for Herbalife. This was also witnessed in third-quarter 2017, wherein earnings and sales declined year over year due to soft volumes and adverse currency fluctuations. Volumes slid 5.6%, with North America suffering the maximum plunge of 16.1%. Volumes at Mexico tumbled 9%, while South & Central America and China witnessed volume declines of 6.8% and 3.5%, respectively. Mexico's volume was lower than expected in particular, owing to exposure to areas affected by earthquakes. Management stated that this natural disaster hurt Mexican volumes by 200 bps in the quarter and the impact also lingered in early fourth quarter.Final Thoughts & Q4 ExpectationsNevertheless, Herbalife continues to focus on implementing new technologies; shifting distributors’ inclination toward learning latest business methods, undertaking innovations and launching new products. Additionally, the company has been on track with its expense management efforts.Considering all factors, management projected adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter in the range of 84 cents - $1.04, during its third-quarter conference call. Excluding the currency impact, adjusted earnings are expected in a range of 80 cents-$1.00 per share. For 2017, Herbalife forecasted adjusted earnings in the range of $4.42-$4.62 per share.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 96 cents, which shows a 4% decline from $1.00 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. However, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,089 million, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model shows doesn’t conclude that Herbalife is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

1222,FL,"Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao (CBD  -  Free Report) or Grupo Pao de Acucar reported fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein adjusted net income from continuing operations came in at R$159 million ($48.9 million), down 18.4% from R$195 million ($60 million) recorded in the year-ago period. Results were impacted by soft EBITDA margin that in turn was hurt by food deflation. However, sales grew year on year, driven by continued strength at Assai and the ongoing recovery at Extra Hiper.While this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 14% in a year, it underperformed the industry’s 40.5% surge.Results in DetailNet revenue in the fourth quarter came in at R$12,510 million ($3,849 million), compared with R$11,740 million ($3,612.1 million) in fourth-quarter 2016. Net revenues increased 6.6% year over year in local currency.Adjusted gross profit climbed 2% to R$2,755 million ($847.6 million), whereas the adjusted gross margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) to 22%. Adjusted EBITDA slumped nearly 20% to R$582 million ($179.1 million), while EBITDA margin shrank 150 bps to 4.7%, due to softness in both segments, largely stemming from food deflation.Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao Quote Segment DetailsMultivarejo same-store sales dipped 0.6%, on account of increased deflationary pressure in food-at-home categories. Management stated that deflation was particularly strong in Christmas seasonal products. Also, tough economic conditions led consumers to shift preferences to other channels, which marred same store sales.Delving deeper, we note that the performance of Extra Hiper remained sturdy, with same-store sales growing on the back of non-food categories like electronics, apparel and general merchandise. Pao de Acucar also witnessed higher sales volume for the second consecutive quarter despite bearing the brunt of food deflation and soft sales during the renovation phase. Notably, Extra Super banner was most affected by food deflation, particularly in basic perishables.While Multivarejo continued undertaking endeavors to enhance efficiency and also generated savings in personnel and electricity costs, the segment’s SG&A increased as a percentage of sales. This was a result of food deflation on sales, inflated costs, expenses associated with renovations at Pao de Acucar and some costs related to the fire at the Osasco DC. These factors also weighed on adjusted EBITDA margin that fell 190 bps to 4.7%.Net sales at Assai surged 28.2% in the quarter, adjusted for the calendar effect. The sturdy growth was driven by higher comps and contributions from new stores. Despite major food deflation in Meat, Staples and Dairy categories, Assai’s comps jumped 10.7%, on the back of greater sales volume. Sale volume was backed by improved customer traffic and continued rise in market share even amid stiff competition. Notably, sales from Assai constituted about 43.5% of the company’s total sales in the fourth quarter, marking 730 bps growth year over year.Operating costs rose to 10.7% of net sales, on account of expenses related to accelerated organic expansion and conversions. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.5%, whereas the adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 5.3%, down 50 bps year over year.The company operated 126 Assai stores by the end of 2017, including 20 new stores. These new stores included 5 organic expansions and 15 Extra Hiper conversions. The company plans to open 20 Assai stores in 2018, including conversions. Also, it remains on track to renovate nearly 20 Pao de Acucar stores.Financial DetailsThe company ended 2017 with cash and marketable securities of R$3,792 million ($1,144.3 million), net debt of R$767 million ($231.4 million) and total shareholders’ equity of R$13,292 million ($4,011 million).During 2017, the company’s capital expenditure for the Food segment increased 9%, due to 15 Extra Hiper conversions into Assai stores and the opening of five new Assai stores, three Pao de Acucar stores, six Minuto Pao de Acucar stores, two Extra drugstores and two gas stations.2017 OutlookThe company faced a tough economic environment in 2017, with major food deflation, persistently high unemployment level and sluggish consumer spending, all of which were headwinds for the retail industry. Despite a challenging landscape, GPA performed well with increased market share at Assai and Extra Hiper. Also, market share at other banners remained more or less stable.In 2018, the company remains focused on its strategy for 2018-2020, which aims at delivering solid food segment. The company plans to achieve this by utilizing its multi-network and multi-format existence in order to offer consumers the innovative services and products. Apart from this, the company also remains on track with digital transformation, as highlighted by the launch of My Discount platform at Multivarejo, which garnered considerable success over the last seven months. Management stated that focus on digital development will remain a major priority in 2018, give consumers’ evolving shopping patterns.For 2018, management envisions same store sales at Assai to be more than the inflation level, while that in Multivarejo is expected to be on par with food inflation. Both segments are anticipated to witness continued market share gains.Further, EBITDA margin is envisioned to increase in both segments, with Multivarejo expected to witness 50-60 bps growth and Assai to witness 20-30 bps. Well, food deflation is likely to persist in the first half of 2018, with expectations of some recovery in the second half.

1223,FL,"Fossil Group Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) saw its shares soar as much as 80% during yesterday’s after-market trading session following the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results. Notably, both the top and bottom line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and comparable store sales (comps) also increased year over year. Sturdy e-commerce business and wearables sales remained major drivers, especially during the holiday season.Fossil’s focus on expanding its wearables portfolio seems to be appeasing investors for a while now. Evidently, the company’s shares have gained 26.3% in the past three months, surpassing the industry’s 18.3% growth.  Q4 in DetailAdjusted earnings came in at 64 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. However, the bottom line declined significantly from $1.21 reported in the year-ago period. The slump can be attributed to lower sales and margins. Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fossil Group, Inc. Quote Including one-time items like tax and restructuring charges, the company reported a loss of $1.65, as against earnings of $1.03 reported in the year-ago period. We note that during the quarter, Fossil’s bottom-line growth gained 9 cents from favorable foreign currency movements.Net sales of $921 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $890 million. Though connected watches boosted sales, overall net sales declined about 4% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to sluggishness in the company's traditional watch portfolio. However, Fossil progressed quite well in the digital space, as its e-commerce sales surged 31% in the fourth quarter.On a constant-currency basis, sales tumbled 7% during the quarter, with soft watch sales across all regions. Underlying weakness in the company’s leather and jewelry businesses across all geographies also marred the top-line performance during the quarter. Management stated that dismal results in United States, Eastern Europe, Middle East and most Asian countries (especially Japan) led to the weakness.Global retail comps climbed 2% year over year, courtesy of positive comps in the watch category, which was partly countered by sluggish comps at leather and jewelry. Region-wise, Americas and Europe delivered favorable comps, whereas Asia remained disappointing.Gross profit tumbled 8.4% to $448.1 million. Gross margin contracted 230 basis points (bps) to 48.7% due to greater sales mix of low-margin connected products and increased product valuation reserves. These downsides were partly compensated by favorable currency fluctuations; shift in mix toward international and e-commerce sales (with higher margins); margin enhancement efforts stemming from the New World Fossil initiative and reduced markdowns in wholesale channels.Operating expenses declined 6.2% to $396.8 million, thanks to lower store costs owing to considerable store closures; a fall in regional overhead expenses and curtailed marketing costs. However, battered by soft sales and gross margin, operating income slumped 22.5% to $51.3 million, with the operating margin contracting 130 bps to 5.6%.Performance Based on Business CategoriesCategory-wise, sales in the watches segment declined 3% (down 6% on constant-currency basis) to $728 million in the quarter. Sales at Jewelry and leather businesses also went down 6% (down 9% on constant-currency basis) to $108 million and 10% (down 14% on constant-currency basis) to $72 million, respectively.Region-Wise PerformanceRegion wise, sales dropped 8% (down 9% on a constant currency basis) in the Americas to $442 million owing to sales decline in the United States and sluggish performance of traditional watches. This was marginally offset by sales growth in connected watches. The region also witnessed weakness in the leather and jewelry businesses.Sales improved 1% in Europe (down 6% on a constant-currency basis) to $337 million. Constant-currency decline was mainly led by weakness in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and a modest fall in Eurozone.Net sales from Asia slipped 1% (down 3% on a constant-currency basis) to $142 million. Sales growth was mainly witnessed in India and China, countered by dismal performance from all other regions, particularly Japan.Other Financial UpdatesAt the end of the quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $231.2 million, long-term debt of $443.9 million and shareholders’ equity of $580.9 million.Since the prior-year quarter, the company has undertaken several store closures. At the end of 2017, the company’s total store count was 544 compared with 585 stores in the year-ago period.On Jan 29, Fossil entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which is due and payable on Dec 31, 2020. The agreement offers revolving credit loans of $325 million (subject to certain borrowing conditions) and a term loan of $425 million.2017 OverviewAdjusted earnings for fiscal 2017 came in at 5 cents a share, considerably down from $2.00 recorded in the year-ago period. This fares way better than the consensus mark of a loss of 73 cents. Net sales descended 8.3% to $2,788 million, with declines across all regions and categories. On a constant currency basis, sales fell 9% year over year. However, top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,758 million. Global retail comps for fiscal 2017 dipped 6% owing to declines across all regions.During fiscal 2017, the company undertook various strategic initiatives directed toward speeding up business evolution and positioning Fossil for long-term growth. Although the company continued with soft sales and earnings, it remains well on track with its goals of boosting growth in its wearables portfolio; utilizing scale to curtail supply-chain expenses; increasing digital capacities and continuing with business transformation through the ongoing New World Fossil plan.Progressing on these lines, Fossil almost doubled 2017 wearables sales to more than $300 million, which formed roughly 14% of total watch sales. Also, this helped the company witness a rise in Fossil brand watch sales in the second half of 2017, largely driven by positive comps in the company’s direct business during the holiday quarter. This in turn was backed by significant wearable launches ahead of the holiday season, which enhanced sales of watches of Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) and Armani. Notably, the company introduced several hybrid and display smartwatches across 14 brands during the year. Management believes that such efforts, along with constant focus on innovations in the traditional watch space places the company well for growth and stability in future.Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s wearable product costs were on par with margin goals toward 2017-end, making it hopeful of gross margin expansion in 2018. Fossil is also in line with its New World Fossil plan which helped it cut costs by $95 million in 2017, keeping it on track to achieve its profit improvement target of $200 million. All these factors, along with constant focus on improving handbag and jewelry sales and augmenting digital sales bodes well for 2018. However, management expects the retail environment in North America to remain challenged owing to changing consumer trends. Thus, the company expects its traditional watch category in the wholesale business to remain pressurized in 2018. Nevertheless, Fossil remains optimistic about enhancing bottom line by cutting cost through its New World Fossil plan and lowering sourcing expenses.OutlookAll said, management issued its outlook for 2018. Fossil Group expects net sales to decline in the range of 14-6%. The company expects gross margin in a range of 51-53%, while operating margin is envisioned in a range of flat to 4%. Further, Fossil expects interest expense and restructuring charges of approximately $50 million each, and adjusted EBITDA in a band of $150 million to $200 million.For first-quarter 2018, the company expects net sales to decrease in the range of 12-6%. Gross margin is anticipated in the range of 50-52%. Fossil expects restructuring charges of approximately $20 million, and adjusted EBITDA in a band of negative $15 million to $10 million.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

1224,FL,"This week we have several very important economic reports coming out.  These top tier reports will give us key data on future indicators regarding factory orders, inflation, retail sales, housing, and consumer sentiment.The biggest report is coming out Wednesday; the Consumer Price Index.  With the current inflation worries, and the implications of the Fed raising rates at a faster pace, this will be the most closely watched report this week.  The last report showed that wages grew by +2.9% which spooked the markets and caused the flash crash.  Current year over year expectations are for a slight dip from 2.1% to 2%. Any pullback will be viewed as a positive for the markets, but if we see an uptick it could cause the markets to fall once again.Also on Wednesday, the Retail Sales report will be released and this will tell us if the recent strength in the segment will continue.  Expectations are for +0.3% gain which would be the seventh consecutive month of a positive reading. A positive reading would help many retail companies like Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), Conn's Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) all of which currently hold a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy rating.The Retail report will also be tied to Friday's Consumer Sentiment announcement which is expected to remain elevated.  Source: Bloomberg.comAs you can see in the table above, consumer sentiment has been around a reading of 95 for over a year.  If consumer sentiment remains at or near its current levels it bodes well for the retail sector, as this report gauges consumer spending, and the overall attitude of the economy.  This week we will also see two regional manufacturing reports, the Phily Fed, and the Empire State.  These reports will give us the conditions in local regions, and will be an indicator for the more important ISM manufacturing index coming out on March 1st.  The recent readings have been very strong, and have shown positive momentum in production and new orders over the past several months. Currently, the regional reports are expected to show continued strong growth.  Lastly, we will also see two very important housing reports this week.  On Thursday the Housing Market Index will be released. This forward looking report has remained high for the past several months.Source: Bloomberg.comTwo closely watched parts of the report will indicate if the increasing interest rate trend will begin show any signs of having a negative impact on the index.  And if the uptick in mortgage rates is impacting housing affordability.This report coupled with Friday's Housing Starts data will be an important barometer for the housing sector and several other sub sectors that rely on new housing.Housing starts took a bit of a dip last month due to weather related issues as you can see in the chart below.Source: Bloomberg.comBut this month's data should be clean of weather related issues, and is currently expected to show a snap back to 1.23 million units, well above December's reading of 1.1 million units.  Also, housing permits are expected to remain high at 1.3 million. A combination of an uptick in both the housing market index, and housing starts will be beneficial for home builders like KB Homes (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp (LEN  -  Free Report), and D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 Buy rating.The data will also be a forward indicator for companies that depend on new homes who supply them with furniture, appliances, and other household needs. Companies that can benefit from positive housing data include, Restoration Hardware (RH  -  Free Report), At Home Group (HOME  -  Free Report), Beacon Roofing (BECN  -  Free Report), and Eloctorlux ELUX-B, all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy rating. If these data points come in as expected, it will set an overall positive tone for the markets for the next several weeks.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1225,FL,"Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this marketer and distributor of apparel, footwear and accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average of 33.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 1 cent down from 23 cents reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,308 million, almost flat from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe believe fourth-quarter results are likely to be impacted by weakness in North American business. Decline in sales in North America has been a major concern in the past few quarters. The company has been reporting sluggish sales from the region since fourth-quarter 2016. In third-quarter 2017, sales from North America declined 12.1% and operating income slumped 64%. This dismal showing can be attributed to bankruptcies, store closures, decrease in productivity and demand along with change in fashion preference.Further, Under Armour has been grappling with higher interest expense as a result of increased debt level. In third-quarter 2017, the company’s interest expenses increased to nearly $9.6 million in comparison with $8.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, it anticipates interest expenses to rise to roughly $35 million in 2017 from $26.4 million in 2016. Gross margin, a key financial metric determining a company’s basic financial health, has consistently declined in the past few quarters. In third-quarter 2017, gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 46.2% following a decline of 190 bps and 70 bps in the second and first quarter, respectively. The company expects gross margin to decline in fourth-quarter 2017.These factors have been well reflected in the company’s stock price performance. Evidently, Under Armour’s shares have plunged over 26.9% in the past six months against the industry’s growth of 10.7%.However, Under Armour’s sustained focus on brand development, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness businesses look encouraging.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Under Armour this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Under Armour has an Earnings ESP of -63.46%. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.43% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Children's Place, Inc.

1226,FL,"The fourth-quarter 2017 reporting cycle is at the half-way mark, providing a robust picture of all-around strength and momentum. We have positive earnings and sales surprises coming from an above-average proportion of companies. Further, positive estimate revisions for the current quarter have been overwhelming, indicating there is more room for growth in the future.Our focus here will be on the Retail-Apparel & Shoes industry, a key segment of the Retail-Wholesale sector, which is presumed to be invariably in business. The retail sector on the whole has been attracting attention as the robust holiday numbers and a favorable economic backdrop have turned it around. The sector is gaining from favorable economic data including a steady improvement in wages, a lower unemployment rate, rising consumer confidence and modest inflation, all of which contributed to increased consumer spending during the holiday period.A prime beneficiary of this momentum has been the Apparel industry, which has performed well lately thanks to the rapid transformation in the space. The industry players are driven by the quick adoption of the omni-channel retailing concept, renewed store formats and focus on providing the most fashionable and in-trend merchandise. Additionally, the companies are benefiting from effective inventory management and cost control techniques.Overall, the industry’s growth graph shows a gain of 19.1% in the last three months, significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s growth of just 6.7%. Further, the industry is placed at the top 21% (53 of 256) of the Zacks Industry Rank.Q4 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S&P 500 index so far, about half have released fourth-quarter earnings results. Total earnings for these companies were up 16%, on 10.5% revenue growth. Further, about 80.5% delivered positive earnings surprises and about 78.1% beat revenue estimates. The blended beat ratio (companies beating both earnings and revenues) so far has been 64.9%.Total fourth-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to increase 13% year over year, with a 7.7% rise in revenues. This follows 6.7% earnings growth and 5.9% revenue increases recorded in the third quarter.For the retail sector, earnings in the fourth quarter are expected to improve 6.6%, with 8.8% revenue growth. However, it is too early to predict anything for the sector as it has a sizable chunk of earnings yet to be reported.The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest Earnings Preview report published on Feb 2.That said, here are five stocks from the Apparel and Shoes industry that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. It makes sense to add these potential winners to your portfolio ahead of their releases. A rational investment can fetch higher returns on the heels of an earnings beat.Our PicksWe have highlighted five stocks that not only meet the prescribed criteria but have also convincingly surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, hold excellent prospects and are therefore well positioned for future earnings growth.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.American Eagle Outfitters Inc.

1227,FL,"Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) has managed to pull off a decent run in the past six months amid the prevailing headwinds in the retail sector. Shares of this company have gained nearly 13% in the past six months, notably outperforming the  industry, which grew 9.5%. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has comfortably outpaced the broader Retail - Wholesale sector's growth of just 6.2% in the said time period.Impressive first-quarter results and strong brand portfolio along with operational and financial initiatives bode well for Foot Locker.  Let us delve deeper into the factors that are propelling the stock’s performance.Solid Q1 ResultsThe company witnessed impressive first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein top and bottom lines surpassed the consensus mark and grew year over year. This also marked its third straight quarter of positive earnings surprise. We also note that the bottom line has improved after declining in the trailing four quarters due to a strong pipeline of new productsAs a result of this, management now envisions double-digit percentage growth in annual earnings per share. Comparable-store sales during the second quarter are expected to be flat to up, marginally. During the third and fourth quarter, the metric is projected to increase in low single digit. The company now envisions comparable-store sales to be flat-to-up low single-digit for fiscal 2018 compared with 3.1% decline registered in fiscal 2017.Brand Strength, a Key DriverApart from the stellar show, Foot Locker boasts of a strong portfolio of leading brands under a variety of store banners that helps it to target specific markets and efficiently meet consumer demand. The company is effectively managing inventory, investing in digital platforms, improving supply-chain efficiencies, and reorganizing corporate and division staff. It also entered into a partnership with Nike for a pop-up store called Sneakeasy NYC and made a strategic investment of $15 million in Carbon38. The company's long-term financial goals include attaining sales of $10 billion, sales per gross square foot of $600, operating margin of 12.5%, net income margin of 8.5% and return on invested capital of 17%.Strategic Initiatives Bode WellThe company is also making efforts to boost its performance by undertaking operational and financial initiatives. These include exploiting opportunities in kids’ and women’s business, shop-in-shop expansion in collaboration with its vendors (such as House of Hoops, PUMA Labs, Jordan Flight 23 shops and The ARMOURY at Champs Sports), exploring store banner.com business, store refurbishment and enhancement of assortments, which is likely to benefit Foot Locker in the long run.Capital Allocation PlanFoot Locker revealed a capital expenditure program of $230 million for fiscal 2018 to sustain robust level of investment and enhance shareholder value. The company plans to spend the capital strategically, with primary focus being on developing digital competencies and supply chain. The company’s digital endeavors comprise improvement of mobile and web platforms, implementation of new point-of-sale software worldwide, and expansion of data analytics capabilities. Apart from these, the company plans to spend a major portion of the capital on its fleet of stores to revamp and remodel them.What Could Limit the Growth?However, the company is facing headwinds from rising SG&A expenses, which is weighing on the company’s margins. During the first quarter, SG&A expenses grew 50 basis points to 19%, owing to considerable investments in digital operations. Management expects SG&A expenses to increase as a percentage of sales by 110-140 basis points during the second quarter and 100 basis points for the full year. Additionally, the European region witnessed a low-double digit decline in comparable sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Nonetheless, we believe that Foot Locker’s strategic vendor partnerships will help improve comps performance. Also, measures such as closing of under-performing stores and effective management of inventory will be the focal point going forward.Looking for More Promising Retail Stocks?

1228,FL,"Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) is set to report its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2018 financial results after market close on Thursday. So let’s see if the sportswear power’s stock might be worth buying ahead of its earnings release and if Nike looks poised to rebound from its recent North American sales downturn.Overview Nike has faced challenges in its domestic market over the last year, as it faces increased competition from rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) as well as Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) and other companies with the sportswear market shifting further toward athleisure. Meanwhile, the company has also been negatively impacted by shifting retail habits that have seen the likes of Dick’s Sporting Good (DKS  -  Free Report), Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report), and Finish Line  all suffer while e-commerce giants such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) continue to soar.Nike saw its North American sales slip by 6% last quarter to $3.57 billion. The company’s North American revenues also fell by 5% in the second quarter and 3% in Q1. Luckily for investors and Nike, the company has seen its sales expand internationally.However, North America still accounted for roughly 40% of Nike’s overall revenues in Q3, so investors will be pleased to note that Nike executives said as recently as March that the company expects North American sales to stabilize. This would also signal that Nike has been successful in its direct-to-consumer push as it adapts to the e-commerce age through various mobile app stores and online selling initiatives.Now that investors have a good sense of what’s going on, let’s jump into some of Nike’s estimates and fundamentals to see if the stock looks like a buy ahead of Q4 earnings.Growth Outlook Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Nike’s fiscal Q4 revenues to climb by 8.25% to $9.39 billion. Meanwhile, Nike’s quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 6.67% to $0.64 per share. Investors also need to know a little bit more on the estimates front, and for that, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file.The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.Based on our latest consensus estimates, analysts expect Nike’s North American revenues to hit $3.76 billion, which would mark a marginal gain from the $3.75 billion it reported in the year-ago period, which is a good sign for all the reasons we already mentioned. One other important figure to keep an eye on is overall Footwear revenues, which are projected to climb by roughly 10.5% to $6.05 billion.Earnings RevisionsMoving on, investors should take a look at Nike’s most recent earnings revision trends. Nike has earned two upward earnings estimate revisions for the full year, with complete agreement to the upside, both within the last 30 days. During this same timeframe, Nike has also received one upward revision for Q4, against no downward changes.Investors should note that Nike’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—is calling for earnings of $0.63 per share, which is 1 cent worse than our current consensus estimate. But Nike has a stellar management team that hasn’t seen them miss our earnings estimates since 2012.Price Movement/ ValuationLastly, investors need to understand how Nike stock has performed recently. Shares of Nike have soared 37% over the last year and have climbed 9.7% over the last three months, which tops the S&P 500’s 4.5% upward movement. Yet, Nike has seen its stock price slip slightly during the last month to sit just a couple of dollars below its 52-week high of $75.91 per share.Meanwhile, Nike’s recent performance has caused Nike’s valuation picture to look a bit stretched at the moment. Nike stock is currently trading at 27X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant premium compared to its industry’s 20.7X—which includes the likes of Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report), Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), and Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report).For further reference, Nike stock has traded as high as 28.5X and as low as 20.7X over the last year, with a one-year median of 25.5X. Therefore, Nike is resting just below its year-long high and above its peers, but it is also worth noting that Nike has traded at a premium compared to its industry over the last five years. Bottom LineWith that said, Nike is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. The company is also expected to grow both its top and bottom lines and end its streak of declining North American sales. Therefore, investors might want to consider Nike stock at the moment.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1229,FL,"Online retail sales continue to soar, with bellwether Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) market cap topping $800 billion. But, their outsized gains haven’t hampered traditional retailers much. All of retailers have been part of a broad-based rally so far this year but hardly any of them are trading near peak levels. Obviously, they have more room to run and this growth narrative is well supported by strong fundamentals.From e-commerce and comparable sales trends to profit margins and earnings to traffic, all have improved this year. Given this bullishness, investors should double down on the hottest retail stocks now.Amazon’s Burgeoning Retail BusinessAmazon is well positioned to cash in on the next wave of online retail. The interesting part is that retail accounts for 60% of its revenues. Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market last year and is aiming to expand its fresh food offerings. At the same time, it is trying to succeed in harder-to-deliver categories like apparels through its Prime Wardrobe segment. Such efforts are paying off.Amazon’s share price went up 1.4% on Jun 4 and finished at a record for the sixth straight session. The e-commerce giant’s market capitalization is now at $801.3 billion. Amazon is just behind Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which presently has the highest market cap of $943.7 billion (read more: Amazon's Retail & Budding Web Services Make It a Real Deal).Traditional Retailers Fight Back Traditional retailers, by the way, have adapted against Amazon and other digital commercial threat. They are expanding their omnichannel presence and gaining customers. Lest we forget, not long ago, traditional retailers were compelled to downsize their operations to accommodate low customer flow. However, this discouraging trend appears to be over. After all, a number of malls are getting a facelift, which is driving traffic.Retailers, in fact, are on a hiring spree. They have led the way in hiring by increasing employment by 31,000 last month. This shows that they are in an expansion mode and their businesses are churning out huge profits. And why not? Sales at U.S. retailers rose in broad fashion in April as fatter after-tax pay checks helped compensate the uptick in fuel cost. Per the Commerce Department, sales increased 0.3% in April, matching the median forecast, after a 0.8% rise in the prior month (read more: 5 Stocks En Vogue on a Broad Rise in US Retail Sales).Retail Stocks RallyAs traditional retailers have started to co-exist with Internet retailers, retail stocks are on a rally mode. So far this year, the SPDR S&P Retail is up 3.5% versus a meager 0.8% of the S&P 500. The two big departmental stores, in particular, surged this year. While the Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) soared nearly 32% on a year-to-date basis, Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) was up 41%.Diane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager at TCW Group, added that “departmental stores are doing well because of the massive upgrade of Macy’s by Evercore, which said that the worst is over for the sector.” Macy’s has already exceeded same-store sales expectations in the recent quarter and has lifted its guidance for fiscal 2018.Sports retailers are also among the big winners. Shares of Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report), Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) are all up more than 15% so far this year. Among smaller retailers, Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO  -  Free Report), to name a few, are also up more than 20%. Their margin erosion is moderating, comparable sales are rising and profit margins are stabilizing.5 Top PicksGiven the aforesaid positives, it will be prudent to invest in the best retail stocks. Americans have ramped up spending on wage gains and bigger paychecks owing to the recent tax cuts. This rise in spending levels will lend a boost to retailers. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Amazon engages in the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions in North America and internationally. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 47.4% in the last 60 days. The stock’s projected growth rate for the current year is 181.8%, compared with the Internet - Commerce industry’s estimated growth of 9.1%.Guess', Inc.

Adjusted EBITDA advanced 14.6% to R$546 million ($168.2 million), with the adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 30 bps to 4.8%, courtesy of higher margins at both segments.Segment DetailsMultivarejo gross sales came in at R$6.8 billion, which was hurt by food deflation as well as shut down of Extra Hiper stores that were converted to Assai stores. Further, same store sales dipped 2% excluding calendar effect, while gross same store sales inched up 0.7%. While the segment began the quarter on a dull note, the scenario improved in March, wherein trends reversed with same-store sales growth of 11.8% (up 3.9% excluding calendar effect).Notably, the company implemented several new commercial actions in early March, including relaunch of the company’s Collect & Win campaign, launch of “My Rewards” in the same app as “My Discounts” which reinforced the company’s loyalty program. Also, the segment benefited from greater promotional activities.   SG&A costs at this segment dropped 4.9%, courtesy of reduced selling costs which stemmed from productivity gains from employee multi-role program and measures undertaken last year. Also closure of Extra Hiper stores for conversion to Assai stores contributed to the fall in selling costs. These factors also benefited adjusted EBITDA margin expand 30 bps to 5.5%.Net sales at Assai surged 25% in local currency to R$5.5 billion. The sturdy growth was driven by higher comps and 20 store openings. Markedly, Assai’s comps jumped 9.9% (up 5.1% excluding conversions), on the back of 8% jump in sales volume and 12 % growth in customer traffic. These also led to a rise in market share.Gross margin grew 90 bps to 15.4%, courtesy of store expansion efforts and favorable taxation, somewhat offset by food deflation. SG&A costs (as a percentage of sales) remained flat year over year as solid performance from mature stores was countered by food deflation and speed of expansion. However, adjusted EBITDA margin grew 80 bps to 4.8% on account of gross margin growth and the other aforementioned factors.Under the Assai banner, the company introduced one store in Sergipe, alongside having seven under construction and two under conversion. Further, four Extra Hiper stores were shut down for conversion under the Assai banner. Companhia Brasileira operates 127 Assai stores across 19 states.Financial DetailsThe company ended 2017 with cash and marketable securities of R$1,701 million ($514.4 million), net debt (adjusted for balance of not discounted receivables) of R$3,121 million ($943.9 million) and total shareholders’ equity of R$13,271 million ($4,013.6 million).During the quarter, the company spent R$330 million ($101.7 million) toward expansion of Assai and renovations of Pao de Acucar stores.OutlookCompanhia Brasileira’s performance in the first quarter remained solid, owing to continued strength at Assai and reversed trends in Multivarejo. Management also stated that it regained its leading position in the Brazilian food space, which in turn was a result of its strategic plan to focus on the cash-and-carry segment. That said, the company remains confident of strengthening this position, courtesy of continued strength in Assai and expected enhancements at Multivarejo.For 2018, management continues to envision same store sales at Assai to be more than the inflation level, while that in Multivarejo is expected to be on par with food inflation. Both segments are anticipated to witness continued market share gains.Further, EBITDA margin for Multivarejo and are likely to come in a range of 5.5-5.6% and 5.8-5.9%, respectively.3 Retail Stocks You Can’t MissBuckle (BKE  -  Free Report) has an impressive earnings surprise history.

However, the company witnessed sequential improvements from the 270 bps, 240 bps and 120 bps gross margin declines in the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Clearly, this reflected a solid reduction in gross margin erosion from 270 bps in the first quarter to 80 bps in the fourth quarter.SG&A expenses increased nearly 9% to $263.8 million, while as a percentage of sales it leveraged 60 bps to 21.5%. The rise in SG&A expenses, in dollar terms, was driven by higher store salaries, due to a strong holiday season and the extra week alongside increased incentive compensation.Furthermore, the company’s adjusted operating income was $118 million, up 10% from $107 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating margin also shriveled 20 bps to 9.6%.Financial PositionAmerican Eagle ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $413.6 million compared with $378.6 million in fiscal 2016. Further, total shareholders’ equity as of Feb 3 was $1,246.8 million.Moreover, the company spent $169 million as capital expenditures in fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2018, management anticipates capital expenditures in the range of $180-$190 million, of which roughly 50% will be spent on store openings and refurbishment. The balance will be invested in omni-channel and digital projects as well as general corporate maintenance.As of Feb 3, American Eagle’s merchandise inventory at cost was roughly $398 million, up 11% from the comparable year-ago period. The increase is attributed to the investments in bottoms, women’s tops and Aerie apparel to support strong sales trends.During 2017, the company returned nearly $176 million to shareholders by paying dividends of $89 million and buying back 6 million shares for $88 million.Backed by its strong cash position, positive free cash flow and gains from the tax reform, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to 13.75 cents per share. The increased dividend is payable on Apr 27 to shareholders with record as of Apr 13.Store UpdateDuring fiscal 2017, American Eagle inaugurated 15 new AE Brand stores, 15 stand-alone Aerie locations and 28 Aerie side-by-side stores. Moreover, the company closed 25 AE brand stores and eight stand-alone Aerie stores.As of Feb 3, the company operated a total of 1,047 stores, including 933 AE (having 116 Aerie side-by-side locations) and 109 stand-alone Aerie stores. Additionally, the company operated 214 international licensed outlets.In fiscal 2018, management intends to open 15-20 new AE outlets and 35-40 Aerie stores, including 10-15 standalone stores and balance side-by-side Aerie locations. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects to shut down 10-15 AE stores and 5-10 old format Aerie stores.Looking AheadManagement remains impressed with its quarterly performance, particularly record sales and sequential improvement in profit margins. The company expects these trends to continue in the first quarter.American Eagle anticipates comps for first-quarter fiscal 2018 to increase mid-single-digits. This is likely to result in adjusted earnings per share of 20-22 cents compared with 16 cents earned in the prior-year quarter.Looking for Some Trending Picks?

1238,FL,"Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report) reported robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein both earnings and sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. Notably, this was the third straight positive earnings surprise and the fourth consecutive sales beat.Amid a highly promotional retail backdrop, results gained from significant progress in its strategic initiatives and strength in Hollister as well as direct-to-customer business.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock surged 11.9% on Mar 7. Additionally, initiatives like strategic capital investments, cost-saving efforts, loyalty and marketing programs aided Abercrombie to outperform the industry in the past month. The stock gained 18.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 5.3%.Q4 SynopsisThe company posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.38 per share, significantly outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. Moreover, the bottom line increased a whopping 84% from 75 cents earned in the year-ago quarter. Earnings benefited from more-than-double operating income in the quarter, as well as positive currency impact. Notably, currency tailwinds, net of hedging, were roughly 14 cents per share in the quarter.Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Abercrombie & Fitch Company QuoteNet sales of $1,193.2 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,169 million and grew 15% year over year. The upside was driven by comparable sales (comps) growth of 9%, benefits of 4% from the additional week and a positive currency impact of 3%.Brand-wise, net sales improved 19% to $709.2 million at Hollister, while sales for the Abercrombie brand rose 9% to $484 million.  From a geographical viewpoint, net sales grew 13% and 20%, in the United States and international markets, respectively. Moreover, the company’s direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, accounting for nearly 34% of the net sales and recording 18% increase in comparable sales.The company remains encouraged by comps performance that benefited from the rise in traffic and conversion. Notably, positive traffic trends improved sequentially from the third quarter. Further, we note that the company’s comps improved sequentially throughout fiscal 2017, with positive comps across brands and geographies in the fourth quarter.On a segmental basis, comps for Hollister increased 11%, while Abercrombie reported 5% growth. Moreover, comps improved 11% in the United States and 5% internationally.While the Hollister brand reflected persistent positive momentum from the previous quarters, Abercrombie showed further signs of improvement, returning to positive comps trend in the fourth quarter.Gross profit margin contracted 90 basis points (bps) to 58.4%, owing to increased average unit cost and lower average unit retail.Abercrombie reported adjusted operating income of $148 million for the quarter, substantially up from adjusted operating income of $61 million recorded in the prior-year period. This marks more than double operating income growth for the quarter. Despite the lower gross margins, the increase in operating income is attributed to significant expense leverage during the quarter.FinancialsAbercrombie ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $675.6 million and gross borrowings under its term loan agreement of $253.3 million. As of Feb 3, 2018, inventories were $424.4 million, up 6% from the prior-year period.On Feb 23, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share on the Class A Common Stock. This is payable Mar 19, to shareholders of record as of Mar 9.Store UpdateIn fiscal 2017, the company inaugurated nine new stores, comprising six stores in the United States and one international full-price store as well as two outlet stores. Additionally, the company shut down 39 stores in the fiscal, mainly comprising of stores in the United States.Management expects to introduce 21 full-price stores in fiscal 2018, including 11 stores in the United States and 10 in international locations. Moreover, it plans to shut down up to 60 stores in the United States in fiscal 2018, through natural lease expirations.OutlookWe note that the company made significant progress on its initiatives in fiscal 2017. This helped it reach significant milestones, including $2 billion sales generated at Hollister, Abercrombie’s return to positive comps trend in the fourth quarter and record digital-sales growth across all brands. Going forward, the company remains keen on further improving customer experience by investing in loyalty programs, stores, direct-to-consumer and omni-channel capabilities. Further, the company expects to maintain its disciplined approach to expense management to drive top- and bottom-line growth.For fiscal 2018, both comps and sales are projected to be up low-single digits. Top line gains from the favorable currency rates will be offset by the absence of the additional week sales in 2017. Favorable foreign currency rate is expected to contribute nearly $50 million to sales and $15 million to operating income in fiscal 2018.Gross margin is projected to be slightly above 59.7% recorded in fiscal 2017, while it will remain pressured in first-quarter 2018. Operating expense, including other operating income, is expected to increase nearly 1% from $2 billion recorded in fiscal 2017. This will continue to reflect expense leverage while supporting ongoing investments in strategic initiatives. Abercrombie also expects average shares outstanding of about 71 million.Furthermore, the company expects core tax rate to be in the mid-to-high 20s range, driven by the recently enacted tax reform. However, including nearly $10 million of discrete non-cash income tax charges related to share-based compensation accounting standards, it expects the effective tax rate in the mid-to-high 30s range.For the first quarter, the company estimates effective tax rate of low-double digits to low teens, including $9 million from the aforementioned non-cash income tax charges.Additionally, the company envisions capital expenditures to be roughly $130 million for fiscal 2018.

1239,FL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Foot Locker has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.8. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Foot Locker’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Foot Locker has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Foot Locker stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Foot Locker has a P/S ratio of about 0.6. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, FL is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Foot Locker currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Foot Locker a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 6.5, which is better than the industry average of 8.3. The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. Clearly, FL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Foot Locker might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A. This gives FL a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been trending higher. The current fiscal quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen seven upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by 8.5% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has increased 10.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Foot Locker, Inc. Price and Consensus  Foot Locker, Inc. Price and Consensus | Foot Locker, Inc. QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineFoot Locker is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 24%) and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence.However, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Foot Locker.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1240,FL,"President Trump announced a tariff of 25% on imported steel to the U.S. yesterday, surprising not only market indexes but his own White House advisors. His intentions were very clear: “We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!” the President tweeted.But economists and traders took the news quite differently, sending the Dow plummeting 500 points on the news. Trump’s announcement, which also included a 10% tariff on aluminum imports, sent question marks ricocheting around not only the steel industry but geopolitical certainties in the Western hemisphere — most importantly, NAFTA.The North American Free Trade Agreement would be immediately affected by these tariffs, as Canada is the biggest steel and aluminum importer to the U.S. in the world (16% steel, 43% aluminum). Currently, our closest ally and trading partner hopes to work out certain exemptions — or at least reassurances — regarding these purported tariffs, that they won’t be held to such an extreme new standard. This is especially considering there’s no secret who Trump’s target of these tariffs really is: China.Since the early days of his presidential campaign, Trump has said he’d get tough with China, who he claims has taken advantage of trade with the U.S. over decades of non-action from previous administrations. So these tariffs are clearly a way Trump sees to help neutralize Chinese interest on steel imports. Besides this, obviously import tariffs would help domestic steel makes, like Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) greatly.However, though the steel industry in this country hires roughly 140K workers, that’s a drop in the bucket compared to the 6.5 million workforce engaged in steel usage. Chief among these is the automobile industry, which relies greatly on steel and aluminum products. Higher prices for these materials would lead to higher prices for cars and trucks, and this sort of chain reaction through the economy is precisely why the market is having a problem digesting this news.Currently, the Dow is down another 200 points in today’s pre-market, the Nasdaq is 80 points off its Thursday close and the S&P 500 down 20 points. It’s unlikely this issue will enjoy a swift correction in normal trading hours, so as long as this remains the main pressure on stocks today, we expect to close in the red again to end the week.Q4 Earnings Sweep-UpQuickly, both J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) are also trading down ahead of today’s opening bell. Though both companies beat bottom-line estimates, they missed on revenue projections and disappointed on comps and guidance.

1241,FL,"The changing retail landscape has been tough on sports retailers like Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report),Hibbett Sports (HIBB  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report). However, these sporting goods firms certainly could bounce back with strong fourth quarter results.Dick’s grabbed national attention on Wednesday after it announced that it will no longer sell assault-style rifles (also read: Gunmaker Stocks Dip After Dick's Discontinues Sale of Assault Rifles).But things are heating up elsewhere. Earlier this week, Hibbett released upbeat preliminary Q4 estimates, while many analysts have taken a bullish tone regarding Foot Locker.Along with the recent positive sentiment, many investors have likely taken a look at some fundamentals and estimates for these sports retailers, and these stocks might look enticing right now. But one of the best and most proven ways to gauge if a stock is set to perform well post earnings is to understand if it is likely to top EPS estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.With all of this said, we are giving our readers a free look at these three sports retail stocks that seem poised to top earnings estimates in March. 1.      Hibbett Sports, Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report)This Alabama-based sports retailer is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an overall “A” VGM score. When paired with HIBB’s Earnings ESP of 16.78%, which signals that earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of the firm’s Q4 results, investors can assume the sports retailer has a solid chance of topping Q4 earnings estimates.Hibbett now expects its quarterly sales will jump by 8%, based on its recently released preliminary Q4 results. Investors should also be happy to note that Hibbett expects to post earnings in the range of $0.47 per share to $0.51 per share, which comes in far above our most-recent consensus estimate that called for earnings of $0.30 per share.Hibbett is set to report its fourth-quarter and full fiscal year results before the opening bell on Friday, March 16.2.      Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report)  Before today’s solid gains, shares of Dick’s had climbed nearly 6% in the last 12 weeks on positive investor sentiment. Dick’s is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks a “B” grade for Value in our style scores system. Dick’s Q4 sales are projected to surge by nearly 10% year-over-year to reach $2.73 billion.On top of strong top-line expectations, DKS’ Earnings ESP of 6.79% signals that analyst sentiment regarding the sports retail power jumped recently. Investors should also note that Dick’s topped third-quarter earnings estimates by more than 15%.Dick’s is set to report its Q4 earnings results before the market opens on Tuesday, March 13.3.       Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report)This sports footwear retailer is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and earns an overall “A” VGM score. Foot Locker also currently sports an Earnings ESP of 4.27%. Foot Locker’s fourth-quarter sales are expected to hit $2.22 billion, which would mark 5.17% growth.Last quarter, Foot Locker topped our consensus earnings estimate figure by 8.75%. Foot Locker is set to report its Q4 and fiscal full-year earnings before the opening bell this Friday, March 2.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Definitely, challenging retail landscape and changing consumer spending pattern are making operating environment tough.In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, earnings per share plunged 23% year over year, following a decline of 34% and 2.2% in the second and first quarter, respectively.

(AEO  -  Free Report) has successfully regained its position in the market driven by focus on improving product assortments, brand strength, efficient inventory management, e-commerce growth and a spectacular comparable store sales (comps) performance. The company is currently doing better than most of its industry counterparts. The company’s business strength became further evident as it reported robust holiday period results earlier this week.Not surprisingly, American Eagle has returned 54.6% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.6% growth.  Further, the company has recorded growth of 3.2% in the past month, which reflects continued stock momentum.That said, let’s find out the various factors that are keeping the stock ticking.Robust Comps Trend — A Key Determinant of GrowthWhile there are many factors aiding the company’s performance, its robust comps trend stands out. The company has been posting positive comps for 11 straight quarters now. Key factors driving this trend are solid online sales, strength in both American Eagle (“AE”) and Aerie brands, improved in-store traffic and favorable product mix. Among the company’s brands, Aerie has delivered comps growth for 14 consecutive quarters.Further, the company’s success in the holiday season, reflected by 8% growth in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 to date comps, boosts investors’ sentiment. Comps for the holiday period gained from record sales and strong momentum at its AE and Aerie brands. American Eagle also benefited from solid online and in-store traffic as customers responded positively to the company’s merchandising offerings.Omni-channel InitiativesAmerican Eagle is on track to develop omni-channel platform to enhance customer experience. Backed by these efforts and efficient digital marketing endeavors, the company’s e-commerce sales contributed about 25% to total revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Additionally, the aforementioned comps performance is mostly driven by the efficient use of omni-channel capabilities. We believe the company’s omni-channel initiatives provide significant opportunities to expand business and cater to the incredible global demand for its products.Other Strategic Actions Driving GrowthApart from enhancing e-commerce presence, American Eagle remains keen on strengthening its product assortments by adding more compelling brands and managing inventory levels diligently. Simultaneously, it maintains commitment toward enhancing store sales by rationalizing its brick-and-mortar store fleet. This calls for closing underperforming stores while expanding the profitable ones. Consequently, the company intends to close about 25-40 stores in fiscal 2017. Additionally, it targets opening 15-20 new AE outlets, one Todd Synder store and 15 Aerie stores across the United States, Canada and Mexico in fiscal 2017.Further, the company continues to build customer base by adding 13% to loyalty members in third-quarter fiscal 2017. It remains on track to convert more than 15 million current metrics and attract new customers through revamped loyalty program which provides a seamless overall experience. In order to boost the bottom line, American Eagle is continuously undertaking initiatives to reduce costs through supply chain efficiencies and updated product allocation system. We believe that these strategic initiatives will drive the company’s top-line and profitability.ConclusionWe believe American Eagle stock is likely to continue this momentum driven by the aforementioned strategic plans and persistence of a robust comps trend. Rightly, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Furthermore, its expected long-term earnings growth rate of 7.5% and a VGM Score of A, highlight its inherent strength.Want More Retail Exposure?

1247,FL,"Dillard’s Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) is in a good form driven by strategic initiatives that aided the company’s performance in the last reported quarter. The company continues to gain from its niche market position, offering a broad array of merchandise in its stores, featuring products from both national and exclusive brands.Notably, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has outperformed the industry in the past year. Though Dillard’s lost 2.8%, it fared better than the industry’s 18.6% decline. Further, the company’s long-term earnings growth rate of 2.6% and Value Score of B, highlight its inherent strength.Growth CatalystsDillard’s stringent focus on offering fashionable products to customers and adding value through exceptional customer care service is aiding stock performance. We believe that the company’s strategy of offering fashion-forward and trendy products acts as a catalyst for attracting more customers.Additionally, we are encouraged by its constant efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities in its brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce business. With regard to stores, the company is benefiting from enhancing brand relations, focusing on in-trend categories, store remodels and rewarding store personnel. Further, its strategy of boosting growth across e-commerce business by improving merchandise assortments and effective inventory management bode well.Moreover, Dillard’s focus on increasing productivity and enhancing domestic operations are likely to strengthen customer base.Focus on Improving Shareholder ValueDillard’s healthy cash flows provide the financial flexibility to take up shareholder-friendly moves as well as engage in store and online business expansion. During the nine months of the fiscal year, the company generated net cash flow from operations of $55.5 million and paid out $6.5 million in dividends. Further, it bought back 0.4 million shares for $23.7 million in the third quarter. As of Oct 28, 2017, Dillard’s had an authorization worth $69.5 million remaining under its $500 million buyback program.Strategic Initiatives Aid Quarterly PerformanceDillard’s emerged strong in third-quarter fiscal 2017 as the bottom line surpassed the consensus estimate after a miss in the preceding quarter. Further, the top line outpaced estimates for second-straight quarter. Driven by growth initiatives, the company remains confident of future results. Hence, management retained fiscal 2017 guidance.Markdowns & Challenging Industry Trends an ImpedimentDillard’s performance is hurt by considerably high markdowns undertaken by the company to clear inventories. These have been weighing upon the gross margin for a while now. Additionally, Dillard’s has been plagued by the challenging trends in the apparel retail segment arising out of the changing preference of customers from offline to online. While revenues surpassed estimates in the third quarter, it declined year over year with merchandise comparable store sales decreasing 0.8% due to the challenging retail backdrop. Meanwhile, persistence of these trends remains a threat.Looking for Trending Retail Picks? Check TheseOther top-ranked stocks in the retail sector include Shoe Carnival Inc.

1248,FL,"Of late, shares of Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) are riding high on better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results and effective implementation of operational and financial initiatives. In the past three months, the stock has gained 36.7%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 24.8%.  Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystClearly, the third-quarter results provided a fresh breath of life to the stock, which in the recent past had struggled due to dismal performance in the preceding two quarters. Let’s look at Foot Locker earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has increased by 4.2% and 3.3% to $1.23 and $4.08, respectively. Further, for fiscal 2018 earnings estimates have jumped by 5.1% to $3.95 per share.We believe that continuous exploitation of opportunities such as children’s business, shop-in-shop expansion, store refurbishment and enhancement of assortments are likely to benefit the company in the long run.International expansion, especially in Europe, is another catalyst. The company is also focusing on augmenting e-commerce platform, growing direct-to-consumer operations, margin expansion and tapping underpenetrated markets. Direct-to-customer comparable sales increased 6.1% in third quarter fiscal 2017. Direct-to-customer sales rose to 13.8% of total sales during the quarter, up from 12.8% a year ago. The company’s store banner dot-com businesses both in the United States and Europe increased in mid-single digit, while digital sales in Canada rose at a double-digit rate.Further, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is effectively managing inventory, investing in digital platforms, improving supply chain efficiencies along with reorganizing corporate and division staff. The company also entered into a partnership with Nike for a pop-up store called Sneakeasy NYC. The company's long-term financial goals include attaining sales of $10 billion, sales per gross square foot of $600, operating margin of 12.5%, net income margin of 8.5%, and return on invested capital of 17%.However, Foot Locker’s dwindling top and bottom-line results remain the primary concern. Challenging retail landscape and changing consumer spending pattern are making operating environment tough. We noted that earnings per share plunged 23% year over year during third-quarter 2017, following a decline of 34% and 2.2% in the second and first quarter, respectively.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the same sector include G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report), Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report). All these stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.G-III Apparel Group has a long-term earnings growth rate of 15%.Michael Kors Holdings has reported positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 23.7%.Lululemon Athletica has surpassed the Consensus mark in the trailing four quarter, with an average beat of 8.1%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1249,FL,"Markets have enjoyed a strong and enduring rally for nearly all of 2017. Benchmarks have broken several milestones on multiple occasions and are on course to create new annual records. Year to date, the S&P 500 is up more than 20% and is on course to registering its highest gains in four years. Successively strong earnings numbers and robust economic growth have been the primary factors powering these gains.However, this extended market rally was not without its occasional losses. Lingering fears about inflated valuations have dogged stocks for some time now. Geopolitical concerns, particularly those related to North Korea also threatened to spoil the party on more than one occasion. Also, there was much hand wringing over the likelihood of tax cuts receiving legislative approval before they were finally signed into law last week.However, it is increasingly likely that the actions of the new administration will boost stocks further in the days ahead. In such a scenario, S&P 500 stocks which have failed to chalk up gains this year should also stand a chance. This is particularly true for stocks with a strong Zacks Rank, which are well placed to ride the continuing market rally in 2018.Factors which Acted as a Drag on 2017’s RallyEven though benchmarks are now close to notching up annual records, a variety of factors have threatened to end their long running rally. Concerns about inflated valuations, particularly relating to tech stocks, have had investors worried on more than one occasion. Even though such fears have yet to come true, they continue to persist to this day. Further, geopolitical concerns have also clouded market sentiment at times. Such worries were especially heightened during North Korea’s recent nuclear tests. Both South Korea and the U.S. government warned of a strong response during these events, leading to losses for stocks.Coming to specific sectors, energy stocks remained depressed over the year with the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) down 3.6% year to date. During the year, the OPEC and other major oil producers successfully adhered to an output control agreement which lent some support to oil prices. However, a step up in production by U.S. shale producers has led to the persistence of oversupply conditions.Further, traditional safe haven sectors have been largely ignored during the year, with the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) up only 7.4% year to date. Instead, investors have favored high growth sectors such as technology in the quest for superlative gains. Industrywide changes have also acted as drags for specific stocks. For instance, the tendency to shop online has caused numerous store closures and created a near brick and mortar apocalypse.Can Tax Cuts, Infrastructure Spending Boost Gains in 2018?On last Friday, President Trump finally signed the much anticipated tax Bill into law.  The exact earnings impact of the tax legislation is yet to become clear, but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost. S&P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up 11.8%, with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation. (Read: What Will the Q4 Earnings Season Bring?)And now that President Trump has scored his first major legislative victory, it is likely that he will press forward with another major issue on his agenda, infrastructure reforms. It is now widely expected that the Trump administration will announce a new infrastructure package in 2018.During his presidential campaign, Trump had promised to implement a $1 trillion infrastructure package. This plan was intended to improve the state of roads, airports and bridges as well as other public works across the country.Recently Trump has commented that his attempt to improve the country’s infrastructure will easily garner bipartisan support. The major obstacle to be overcome is related to funding and if that does happen, markets could receive yet another boost in the year ahead.5 Losers Set to Gain in 2018Even though stocks have notched up strong gains this year, some factors have acted as impediments to gains on several occasions. However, the projected impact of tax cuts and heightened prospects of a new infrastructure package are likely to sustain markets’ rally well into next year.This is why it makes good sense to bet on those S&P 500 stocks which have taken a beating this year but stand a good chance of notching up gains in 2018. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark. This led the stock to take a huge leap and outpace the industry in a month. Clearly, third-quarter results have given a fresh breath of life to the stock, which in the recent past had struggled on account of dismal performance in the preceding two quarters.Foot Locker has lost 33.3% year to date. However, it has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 0.9% over the last 30 days.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

However, it has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Moreover, it has expected earnings growth of 4.3% for the current year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 5.2% over the last 60 days.Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) reported strong third quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.

However, it has a Zacks Rank #2. Moreover, expected earnings growth for the current year is more than 100%. PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) is poised to gain from its capital investment plan, which primarily focuses on infrastructure construction projects for generation, transmission and distribution.

Finish Line’s better-than-expected Q3 also helped lift shares of fellow sports retailers, with Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) stock both climbing in morning trading.The athletic footwear-focused retailer beat Wall Street expectations for earnings, revenue, and same-store sales. Indianapolis-based Finish Line saw its Q3 revenues jump 1.8% year-over-year, driven in part by a 0.8% increase in comps. Finish Line’s partnership with Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) also proved to be somewhat successful, as sales in that category rose by 2.3%.Still, Finish Line reported an adjusted quarterly loss of $12.9 million, or $0.26 per share (also read: Finish Line  Posts Narrower-Than-Expected Loss in Q3).“Looking ahead, we continue to be cautious in the near-term, but I am confident that the work we are doing to position the company for long-term growth and enhanced profitability is gaining traction,” CEO Sam Sato said in a statement.Finish Line now expects to post a 2% to 3% decline in comparable sales for its full fiscal year. The retailer also projects to report a drop in fourth-quarter comparable store sales in the 3% to 5% range.However, based on the company’s solid third-quarter, it upped its adjusted full-year earnings per share range to between $0.59 and $0.67. The retailer’s previous guidance range was $0.50 per share to $0.60 per share.This new positive guidance helped lift shares of Finish Line to their highest point since August, touching $13.41 per share in morning trading.

1251,FL,"The overlooked Deep Value ETF (DVP  -  Free Report), which carries an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a High risk outlook, emerged as the best-performing ETF of November. It gained 11.6%.Most of the gains came in the first half as concerns over the delay in implementation of corporate tax cuts and the sell-off in high yield bonds made investors jittery, triggering the demand for value stocks. Additionally, the recent technology rout and North Korea new missile tests led to a further increase in demand (read: Value ETFs & Stocks to Buy on Tax Cut Delay Concerns).Honing in on value securities ensures a safety net for investors as it includes stocks with strong fundamentals – earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow – that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market, In fact, value stocks have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with growth and blend counterparts.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of DVP.DVP in FocusThis ETF offers exposure to undervalued dividend paying stocks in the S&P 500 with solid balance sheets, earnings and strong free cash flow.

1252,FL,"Benchmarks ended in the red on Friday even as investors remained skeptical over the likelihood of the tax cuts legislation gaining passage as early as this year-end. Concerns over tax overhaul plans also weighed on investor sentiment over last week, with both the Dow and the S&P 500 posted second consecutive weeks of declines.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.4%, or 100.12 points, to close at 23,358.24. The S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.3% to close at 2,578.85. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,782.79, losing 0.2%. A total of 6.3 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.8 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. The CBOE VIX decreased 2.8% to close at 11.43.Tax Reform Woes Weighed on MarketsOn Thursday, House of Representatives finally passed the much awaited tax cuts legislation now named as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This takes President Trump and his team one step closer toward realizing their most important agenda — tax reforms.However, investors remained cynical over the Trump administration’s ability to pass the bill in the Senate by the end of this year. This was mainly because Senate’s version of the tax plan was quite different from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% by end of 2017, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut but not before 2019.Along with the tax cut woes, news of a probe into Russia’s interference in 2016 U.S. election also weighed on key U.S. indexes. Special counsel Robert Mueller and his team had reportedly issued a subpoena mid-October to several top officials involved with Trump’s election campaign to submit all Russia-related documents.Following these developments, out of the 11 key S&P 500 sectors 7 declined on Friday, with utilities and technology sectors emerging as the worst performers. Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) and Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Key Earnings for the DayOn the earnings front, shares of Foot Locker, Inc.

The company’s store banner dot-com businesses both in the United States and Europe increased in mid-single-digit, while digital sales in Canada rose at a double-digit rate.Gross margin contracted 290 basis points to 31% of sales primarily due to fall in merchandise margin on account of higher markdowns to pull traffic and clear slow-moving inventory.

1258,FL,"Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 17. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is will this retailer of athletic shoes and apparel will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 6.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has been stable in the past 30 days and is currently pegged at 80 cents. This shows a sharp decline from earnings of $1.13 per share reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,844 million, down from $1,886 million generated in the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayChallenging retail landscape and changing consumer spending pattern have resulted in a tough operating environment for Foot Locker. In fact, the company’s dismal top line and comparable-store sales performance concerns investors. Following meagre growth of 0.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, total sales declined 4.4% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, comparable-store sales fell 6% in the second quarter, following an increase of 0.5% in the preceding quarter.Management envisions adjusted earnings per share decline of 20-30% (excluding a benefit of 12 cents from 53rd week) for the second half of 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, earnings plunged 34% year over year. Foot Locker had projected gross margin contraction in the range of 230-250 basis points (bps) for the third quarter. Gross margin contracted 340 basis points in the second quarter, after shrinking 100 bps in the first.Nevertheless, we believe that building robust capabilities in direct-to-customer unit, augmenting e-commerce platform, rationalizing store fleet and improving supply chain infrastructure may provide cushion to the stock. Continuous exploitation of opportunities such as shop-in-shop expansion, store banner.com business, store refurbishment and enhancement of assortments also bode well. International expansion, especially in Europe, is another growth catalyst.Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Foot Locker, Inc.

1259,FL,"Welcome to the sixth episode of Full-Court Finance, a podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we take an in-depth look at Under Armour’s (UAA  -  Free Report) climb from startup to multibillion-dollar sports apparel powerhouse, and why its fortunes changed so quickly.Shares of Under Armour have fallen off a cliff in 2017, and Kevin Plank’s company recently posted its first quarterly sales decline since going public more than a decade ago.The reasons behind Under Armour’s third-quarter slump range from shifting domestic shopping habits, to declining sales at sports retailers such as Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report), as well as consumers’ newfound love for athleisure.On top of a need to bolster direct-to-consumer sales and add more non-competitive apparel options, it seems that having stars such as Tom Brady and Steph Curry on its roster, and sponsoring college powerhouses like UCLA and Notre Dame, has not been enough to propel Under Armour to the heights many predicted.Under Armour also faces increased competition from Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) in North America, while the company still struggles to compete with Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) in nearly every business segment.However, the company’s recent downturn has forced Under Armour to make some changes—that investors should take note of—in order to get back on track.Make sure you listen to the entire episode of Full-Court Finance if you want to find out more about Under Armour’s recent woes and what the sports apparel company might do to turn things around going forward.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1260,FL,"The Q3 earnings season has reached the tail end for all sectors save retail, which has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are up 2.3% from the same period last year on 10.1% revenue growth with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates.While earnings growth is well below the last reporting cycle and the four-quarter average, revenue growth has been accelerating compared with the other recent periods. Additionally, the quarter so far has witnessed an above-average proportion of positive surprises, implying that the momentum has been carried forward. Further, the estimates revision trend for the fourth quarter has been favorable, with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods (read: Amazon ETFs to Buy on Q3 Blowout Results).This is especially true given the impressive stock market performance of department store operators like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and others following their quarterly releases. Nordstrom and J.C. Penney posted better-than-expected results. Meanwhile, Kohl's beat on revenues but missed on earnings, while Macy's beat on earnings and missed on revenues.The strength in these stocks led to smooth trading in the broad retail sector. In fact, retail ETFs — SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) — added 0.7%, 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past five trading days.Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of big-box retailers that are likely to report this week. These also have the potential to push related ETFs upward or downward (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).A Peek into Earnings SurprisesReports from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) will be crucial for the sector this week.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Home Depot is slated to report earnings before the bell on Nov 14. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates. The company saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.77%. The stock has a VGM Style Score of A.Target has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -1.60%, indicating less chances of beating estimates. The stock has seen solid earnings estimate revision of seven cents for the to-be-reported quarter over the past three months and delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.11% in the last four quarters. It has a top VGM Style Score of A. The company is expected to report before the opening bell on Nov 15 (read: Profit from Retailers' Defaults With These ETFs).Wal-Mart is scheduled to report on Nov 16 before market open. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.96%, indicating a reasonable chance of beat. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.99% in the last four quarters but witnessed negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter. It has a VGM Style Score of B.Foot Locker, which will likely report earnings on Nov 17 before the opening bell, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.48%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates. The stock has seen negative earnings estimate revision of 41 cents over the past 90 days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter and delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 6.55% in the last four quarters. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Style Score of B.  ConclusionWith notable earnings surprises in the cards and a favorable stock rank for big-box retailers, the ETF space will continue to see good trading in the days ahead even though the sector has an ugly Zacks Rank in the bottom 0%. Further, the ETFs mentioned above have favorable ranks. Notably, RTH and ZRT have a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 while PMR has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1261,FL,"The struggles of the Sports Goods industry, be it Sports Gear Retailers or Producers of Sportswear brands, are far from over. Among the various factors plaguing the Sporting Goods Retailers, the prominent ones are  changing consumer habits, Sportswear brands turning to direct selling channels and increased competition. Additionally, the general retailing backdrop has turned highly promotional, creating pressure on margins and the bottom line.Notably, the general trend suggests customers are becoming more dependent on digital devices and mobile phones for their buying habits. Responding to this trend, sportswear brands are building up their online presence by teaming up with e-retailers as well as improving their website for a chic e-commerce experience. Though sportswear brands still value and recognize sporting goods retailers as an important sales channel, these companies have reduced their inventory with retailers to combat the soft traffic at stores.Citing an example from the sportswear brands, NIKE Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) recently took to selling directly to consumers on social media and e-commerce platforms, as evident from its recent deal with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). NIKE is executing a pilot program with Amazon in the United States, where it will sell limited product assortments on the latter’s website. Earlier, the company sold on Amazon through unlicensed third-party resellers. Under this partnership, NIKE will look to improve the NIKE brand experience on Amazon by improvising the presentation and increasing the quality of storytelling. It also announced plans to sell products directly to consumers through Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) Instagram.Why Sportswear Brands Are Suffering?The concerns for the sportswear brands mainly stems from to foreign currency headwinds, intense competition, higher costs to develop omni-channel capabilities and inventory management, challenging retail environment and aggressive promotions. Notably, the revenues for these brands remain strong due to growth in the sports participation rate owing to increased health and fitness consciousness. However, the margins and bottom line have been hurt by the aforementioned factors.How Are These Industries Placed?While retailers selling sports gear are a part of the Zacks Retail-Miscellaneous space, sellers of sports footwear retailers belong to the Zacks Retail-Apparel and Shoes industry - both forming a part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Notably, the Retail-Miscellaneous industry is placed at the bottom 9% (232 of 256) of the Zacks classified industries, while the Retail-Apparel and Shoes space is at the top 36% with a Zacks Industry Rank of #91. Further, the respective industries have slumped 16.1% and 23.3% year to date, compared with the S&P 500 market’s 13.8% growth.Moreover, the sportswear brands come under the Zacks Shoes and Related Apparel industry, which is a part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry is placed at the top 30% (77 of 256) of Zacks industries and has gained 3.7% year to date. However, it has underperformed the S&P 500 market’s growth.That said, we bring to you some stocks that are trending well despite the industry challenges and can be banked upon. Further, we present to you few stocks that have fallen prey to the turmoil and should be avoided currently.Stocks Trending UpWe have hand-picked some industry outperformers with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), VGM Score of A or B, robust earnings surprise trend and strong fundamentals.First on the list is Caleres, Inc.

So, it is advisable to avoid these stocks with Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell), dismal stock performance and an unfavorable outlook.We suggest keeping away from Hibbett Sports Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report), which operates sporting goods stores in small to mid-sized markets in the South, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and lower Midwest regions of the United States. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 and a VGM Score of C. Moreover, the stock has declined a substantial 61.2% year to date, wider than the industry’s 16.1% dip. The decrease can be attributed to the company’s dismal sales surprise history, reflecting a top line miss in nine of the last 10 quarters. Further, Hibbett trimmed guidance for fiscal 2018 due to soft second-quarter fiscal 2018 results and expectations of the persistence of a tough retail environment.Also avoid, New York-based Foot Locker Inc. (FL  -  Free Report). This retailer of athletic shoes and apparel operates through the Athletic Stores and Direct-to-Customers segments. This Zacks Rank #5 company has delivered negative earnings in the preceding two quarters, with an average miss of 6.6% for the trailing four quarters. The company’s results in the last reported quarter were impacted by soft performance of “some recent top styles” and lack of innovative fresh products in the market. Moreover, the company provided a bleak outlook as it expects the challenging retail landscape and changing consumer spending pattern to make the operating environment tough. Consequently, the stock has declined a substantial 51.4% year to date, wider than the industry’s slump of 23.2%.Finally, we suggest getting rid of Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX  -  Free Report), which designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas under the SKECHERS name, as well as under several uniquely branded names. This Zacks Rank #4 company has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 19.2% in the trailing four quarters. Moreover, investors remain apprehensive about Skechers’ bottom line performance that has been declining for the past five straight quarters due to rise in selling and general & administrative expenses. The stock has dropped 11.9% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 8.7%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1262,FL,"The turmoil in the sporting goods industry has forced companies selling athletic goods to scramble for options to gain business. Hibbett Sports Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) is one of the retailers that have been impacted by the situation.Intense Competition Plagues Sports IndustryThe sporting goods industry seems to be in doldrums, as customers are jumping on the dot-com bandwagon, leaving lesser options for brick-and-mortar retailers. Consequently, the sporting goods space has grown extremely competitive and promotional, consequently creating pressure on margins and the bottom line. While most retailers are trying all means to enhance omni-channel capabilities, competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) still remains a major threat.In fact, this has been a major concern not only for Hibbett, but also for big-wigs in the sporting goods industry. Some of the names that have been hurt by this scenario include DICK’s Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report), Big 5 Sporting Goods Inc. (BGFV  -  Free Report), Foot Locker Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) and The Finish Line, Inc. . Additionally, vendors like NIKE, Adidas and Under Armour resorting to more direct selling options is likely to plague the top lines of these sporting goods retailers. That said, let’s see how this is impacting Hibbett’s performance.Negative Sales Surprise TrendThe company has a dismal sales surprise history, which exhibits top-line miss in nine of the past 10 quarters. Coming to recent results, though the company posted narrower-than-expected loss per share for second-quarter fiscal 2018, both the top and bottom lines compared unfavorably with the prior-year period. Sales missed estimates again, continuing with its negative surprise trend.Moreover, comparable-store sales (comps) were a letdown, marred by sluggish traffic, softness across all categories, increased promotional activities and difficult launch compares. Further, a challenging retail environment played spoilsport.Lowered View Hurt SentimentThe company substantially trimmed guidance for fiscal 2018 due to the soft second-quarter results and expectations of the persistence of a tough retail environment. While the company projects soft sales through the rest of the year, it now anticipates comps decline in the mid to high-single digit range, compared with the prior guidance of negative 1% to positive 1%. Additionally, it envisions earnings for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.25-$1.35 per share, down significantly from the previous forecast of $2.35-$2.55.Strained Margins Still an ImpedimentIn addition to the soft sales trend, Hibbett is witnessing strained margins for quite a while now. This is clear from the fact that the company has witnessed reduction in gross and operating margins in the past few quarters. Notably, its gross margin contracted 160 basis points (bps), 180 bps and 70 bps, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2018, and the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2017. Similarly, operating margin fell 330 bps, 350 bps and 330 bps, in the aforementioned quarters respectively.Coming to the recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s gross margin contracted 440 bps, while it reported operating loss of $5.2 million. The decline in margins was due to unfavorable impact of promotions as well as markdowns related to clearing of excess and aged inventory, along with logistics and store occupancy cost deleverage.Looking ahead, Hibbett anticipates gross margin to contract 250-285 bps in fiscal 2018, compared with its previous guidance of 55-75 bps reduction. Gross margin in fiscal 2018 is anticipated to be hurt by increased markdowns to lower aged inventory, continuation of the highly promotional retail environment, along with persistent logistics and store occupancy deleverage stemming from lower comps.Growth Strategies Raise HopesWhile the external environment remains challenging, Hibbett is encouraged by the progress it is making on internal initiatives, particularly the launch of its new e-commerce site. The company observes that initial results from the website launch have exceeded expectations. Further, it has successfully re-launched loyalty program to re-engage existing customers while attracting new ones. The initial response to the refreshed loyalty program has also been positive. The fact that these initiatives were well-received by customers is evident from the acquisition of new customers, which is crucial for future growth. The company revealed that these initiatives have attracted new customers from locations where it does not have stores.However, more pronounced growth in its top line will be a clear indication that the company’s initiatives are paying off. For now, the troubles in the sporting goods industry discourage investment in the stock.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1263,FL,"Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) sunk near their 52-week low on Wednesday after fellow sportswear giant Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) posted some worrisome results in its first-quarter 2018 earnings report.Nike beat revenue expectations and topped earnings estimates, but profits fell year-over-year and sales remained flat.Despite topping Wall Street projections and extending its earnings beat streak to 21 straight quarters, Nike recorded its slowest quarterly sales growth in almost seven years on Tuesday. One of the biggest reasons for this downturn: lagging North American sales, which dipped 3% from the year-ago period.An array of factors have harmed Nike on its home turf. For one, the rise of e-commerce and online shopping has hurt some of its biggest retail partners’ sales, including Finish Line , Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report), and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report).But competition from a major sportswear player has also helped diminish Nike’s North American presence and could continue to cut into its revenues at home down the road.Adidas (ADDYY) recently passed Nike’s Jordan brand as the second-most popular sneaker company in the U.S. Through the first eight months of the year, Adidas claimed 11.3% of the U.S. shoe market, up from 6.6% a year ago, based on a report from the market research group NPD.Nike’s market share fell just 2% and still dominates the overall U.S. shoe market in terms of total revenue, claiming 37% of all U.S. shoe dollars. But if this slight dip in market share and increased competition has caused Nike investors to worry—its shares dipped over. 3.90% Wednesday—Under Armour investors might just be shaking in their shoes.Nike has more wiggle room than the Baltimore, Maryland-based athletic apparel brand. For example, the Oregon-based company has already started to adjust to shifting consumer habits through several new initiatives, including inking a deal with Amazon (AMNZ) and making an internal online sales push. Under Armour is much younger and has had far less overall success. More than that, it seems that the company does not hold the cultural cachet to fight back against Adidas’ U.S. rise and Nike’s number one spot.Even though the company sponsors some of the most popular athletes in North America, it hasn’t led to great results recently, as Under Armour has seen its stock price plummet almost 58% over the last year.Shares of Under Armour fell by over 2% on Wednesday to rest just above its 52-week low of $15.92 per share.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1264,FL,"The sporting goods industry seems to be in doldrums, as customers are jumping on the dot-com bandwagon, leaving lesser options for brick-and-mortar retailers. Consequently, the sporting goods space has grown extremely competitive and promotional, thus creating pressure on margins. While most retailers are trying all means to enhance omni-channel capabilities, competition from online retailers remains a major threat. Challenging retail landscape and changing consumer spending pattern are making operating environment tough, and Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) falls victim of the same. However, management is not sitting idle and trying all means to lift the company’s performance.Shares of Foot Locker have plunged a little of over 30% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 4.5%. We have tried to ascertain major reasons that can be held responsible for this Zacks Rank #5 (Sell) stock’s dismal show in the bourses. We also note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.95 and $3.80 for fiscal 2017 and 2018 has declined by 22.5% and 30%, respectively, in the past 60 days. Moreover, the same has slumped34.4% to 80 cents for the third quarter.Foot Locker Continues to Grapple with Soft Top-Line PerformanceAfter registering a meager growth of 0.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, total sales declined 4.4% during the second quarter. Meanwhile, comparable-store sales fell 6% during the second quarter, following an increase of 0.5% in the preceding quarter. These numbers are in sharp contrast to the company’s performance in fiscal 2016. During the first, second, third and fourth quarters of last fiscal total sales increased 3.7%, 5%, 5.1% and 5.3%, respectively. Maintaining the same chronological order comparable-store sales rose 2.9%, 4.7%, 4.7% and 5%, respectively.Bottom Line Fell Short of the EstimateFoot Locker, the athletic shoes and apparel retailer, continued with dismal performance in fiscal 2017 posting second straight quarter of earnings miss, when it reported second-quarter results. The quarterly earnings of 62 cents a share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents and plummeted 34% year over year after declining 2.2% in the preceding quarter. The results in the quarter were impacted by soft performance of “some recent top styles” and lack of innovative fresh products in the market.Bleak OutlookManagement anticipates comparable sales to decline in the range of 3-4% in remaining part of fiscal 2017. Foot Locker expects adjusted earnings per share to decline in the band of 20-30% (excluding a benefit of 12 cents from 53rd week) during the second half of 2017. Management envisions gross margin to contract in the range of 230-250 basis points in the third quarter and between 150 and 170 basis points in the final quarter on a 13-week basis. SG&A as a percentage of sales is likely to be up 70-100 basis points in both the third and fourth quarters.Bottom LineNevertheless, Foot Locker is trying to improve performance through operational and financial initiatives. The company is also focusing on augmenting e-commerce platform, growing direct-to-consumer operations, rationalizing store fleet and improving supply chain infrastructure. However, these will take time to reap benefits. Well for the time being you can shift your focus on these better-ranked retail stocks.G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

1265,FL,"Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) stock received two analyst downgrades that caused shares of the sportswear powerhouse to dip on Tuesday, and investors might also be worried after a recent report showed that Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) surpassed Jordan as the second most popular sneaker brand in the U.S.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Sam Poser downgraded Nike on Tuesday from “positive” to “neutral.” Poser also updated his Nike price target to $54 a share from $64 a share. Nike closed at $53.50 per share on Monday.On top of the Susquehanna downgrade, Jefferies analyst Randal Konik and his team lowered Nike’s price target for the second time in the last 30 days. Konik cut his Nike price target from $60 per share to $49 per share and reiterated his “hold” rating.The title of Jefferies’ note to clients is very telling as well: “DATA Shows Nike Losing to Adidas at Home & Away.” The note pointed to the fact that Nike has started to lose market share to Adidas in the running shoe space.According to Konik, Nike has only 35 shoes in the top 60 sellers in the U.S. this year. Last year, the Oregon-based company boasted 52.But what might scare Nike investors further is that its competition is coming from one key competitor: Adidas. The German company had two shoes in the top 60 a year ago. This year, the Adidas earned 24 spots.Nike has also started to discount its shoes more regularly than its European counterpart. The poor performance of Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) and Finish Line  were also cited as reasons for concern.According to the note, Nike’s best upside scenario is that it “regains recent share losses in running and protects bball category dominance as competitive pressures lessen.”On the downside, “Adidas penetration in North America accelerates faster than anticipated, driving incremental NKE share losses… Pricing power loss more severe than expected, compressing gross margins.”Shares of Nike dropped 1.9% premarket after both notes were published. The sportswear giant’s stock now rests around 0.60% lower than yesterday’s close and sits $7 below its 52-week high at roughly $51.20 per share.Aside from the analyst notes, Nike took another massive blow after market research firm NPD Group reported that Adidas passed the Jordan brand as the second-most popular sneaker in the U.S. ""I've never seen a brand in the sneaker industry grow this fast,"" NPD analyst Matt Powell said.Adidas has overtaken Jordan as the #2 brand in U.S. sport footwear. This is an achievement I never thought I would see in my lifetime.— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) September 18, 2017Through the first eight months of the year, Adidas claimed 11.3% of the U.S. shoe market share by dollars, up from a 6.6% share in the year-ago period. Nike’s Jordan brand was nearly unchanged and hovers at 9.5%. Nike brand’s market share fell 2% but still dominates overall, claiming 37% of the market.Bottom LineIn 2015, Adidas only claimed 4% of this market. The fact that Adidas eroded some of Nike and Jordan’s cultural clout that quickly might make some investors very nervous. And rightfully so, because fashion and what’s “cool” rarely lasts forever.Nike is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but scored a “D” grade for Value and an “F” for Momentum in our Zacks Style Scores system. Adidas stock boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment, but its shares dropped by around 1% on Tuesday morning.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

In the past month, the stock has slumped as much as 9%, reflecting the persistent decline. That said, let’s find out what led to the fall of the company’s once strong performance.What Went Wrong in Q2?Cycling of benefits from the increased sales witnessed last year owing to closure of rival stores, along with a challenged industry impacted the second-quarter 2017 results. Consequently, the company reported lower-than-expected earnings in the second quarter, after four consecutive beats in the preceding quarters. Additionally, the top line lagged due to diminished demand for some hardgoods product categories, mainly linked to firearms, camping and water sports. Moreover, sales were hurt by the calendar shift of Easter and Fourth of July holidays, when the company’s stores remain closed, in to the second quarter this year compared with the first quarter in the prior-year.Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation QuoteMoreover, Big 5 Sporting expects sales comparisons to remain tough in the third quarter due to the cycling of benefits from increased sales witnessed in the prior-year quarter related to the closure of rival stores. It also anticipates the retail environment to remain challenging. Consequently, it guided comps to decline in the low single-digit range for the third quarter, while earnings are envisioned in the range of 22-32 cents per share.Intense Competition Plagues Sports IndustryThe sporting goods industry seems to be in doldrums, as customers are jumping on the dot-com bandwagon, leaving lesser options for brick-and-mortar retailers.

1268,FL,"The sporting goods industry seems to be in doldrums, as customers are jumping on the dot-com bandwagon, leaving lesser options for brick-and-mortar retailers. Consequently, the sporting goods space has grown extremely competitive and promotional, thus creating pressure on margins and bottom line. While most retailers are trying all means to enhance omni-channel capabilities, competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) still remains a major threat.Well, this has been a major concern for big-wigs including DICK’s Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report), Hibbett Sports, Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report), Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV  -  Free Report), Foot Locker Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) and The Finish Line, Inc. , as evident from their recent performances and tepid outlook. Moreover, DICK’s Sporting and Finish Line are particularly troubled by the fact that some of their most significant vendors like NIKE, Adidas and Under Armour have resorted to considerable direct-to-consumer selling. To top it, the swoosh brand’s plans to sell directly on Amazon raises further concerns for the sporting goods retailers.Incidentally, Finish Line curtailed its fiscal 2018 view after posting preliminary numbers for the second quarter on Aug 29. While Finish Line crashed 18.4% on the news, the domino effect of this debacle sent shares of Foot Locker, DICK’s Sporting and Big 5 Sporting and down by 1.5%, 1.6%% and 5.1%, respectively.Industry Versus S&P 500While DICK’s Sporting, Hibbett and Big 5 Sporting form part of the Zacks Miscellaneous Retail industry, Foot Locker and Finish Line are sports footwear retailers that belong to the Zacks Apparel and Shoes Retail space. Given the aforementioned turmoil, it is not at all surprising that these industries currently stand among the bottom 11% and bottom 38% out of the 265 Zacks Industries, respectively. Furthermore, the respective industries have slumped 17.3% and 37.1% in a year, against the S&P 500 market’s 12.2% growth.That being said, let’s take a closer look at some fallen pieces, which have performed worse than the industry.5 Stocks to Avoid Pennsylvania-based DICK’s Sporting Goods has seen its shares plummet as much as 54.9% over the past year, clearly lagging the industry’s decline. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company reported a negative earnings surprise in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The company bore the brunt of the industry woes that led to soft margins.Also, DICK’s Sporting’s hunting business remains particularly challenging, which along with the overall boulders in the retail landscape compelled management to lower its fiscal 2017 earnings per share and comparable-store sales (comps) views. This has also caused a downward movement in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has fallen by 19.3% to $2.93 in the last 30 days.Moving to Hibbett Sports, this Zacks Rank #5 stock has a dismal sales surprise history, reflecting a top line miss in nine of the last 10 quarters. Though it posted narrower-than-expected loss per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, both the top and bottom lines compared unfavorably with the prior-year period. Moreover, comps were a letdown, marred by sluggish traffic, softness across all categories, and increased promotional activities.The company also substantially trimmed guidance for fiscal 2018 due to the soft results and expectations of the persistence of a tough retail environment. Consequently, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 for fiscal 2018 has rolled down by 44 cents in a month. These miseries have led Hibbett to nosedive 68.8% in a year.Well, Big 5 Sporting has performed no better. This California-based retailer posted lower-than-expected top and bottom-line results in the second quarter of 2017. Further, comps were hurt by soft demand and the company provided soft comps and earnings outlook for the third quarter, partly due to a tough retail environment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has crashed considerably from 43 cents to 28 cents in the last 30 days. Well, this Zacks Rank #5 stock has tanked 41.8% over the past year, reflecting investors’ shattered confidence in the stock that was once an industry outperformer.Let’s also delve deeper into footwear retailer Foot Locker that has lost a substantial 46.4% in a one-year period. This New York-based company came under pressure following the company’s disappointing second-quarter fiscal 2017 performance, where earnings marked its second consecutive miss and sales saw its fourth straight quarter of negative surprise.Results were largely dented by a challenging retail landscape and changing consumer spending patterns, which are making operating environment tough. The murky quarter called for a view cut, as this Zacks Rank #5 company now expects comps to decline in the range of 3-4% in remaining of 2017, with the bottom line projected to slide in the band of 20-30% during the second half.Margins are also expected to remain pressured. Moreover, we noticed that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has fallen steeply from $5.10 to $3.95, over the last month.Finally, we suggest getting rid of Finish Line, more so after yesterday’s disaster. Notably, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company reported preliminary numbers for second-quarter 2018, wherein consolidated net sales slipped 3.3% to $469.4 million, on account of a 4.6% fall in comps. Moreover, the Indiana-based retailer stated that its gross margin has been pressurized owing to increased promotions.Based on the sales and margin woes, as well as expectations of the difficult trends to linger, management curtailed its comps and bottom-line views for the fiscal. The company now envisions comps to descend in a range of 3-5%, whereas adjusted earnings are now forecasted between 50-60 cents per share.Notably, Finish Line’s bottom line has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 14.5% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone down by 2 cents over the last 30 days. Unfortunately, Finish Line has plunged 64.6% in a year.   Well, these bellwethers remain focused on developing their omni-channel operations to keep pace with the evolving consumer trends. However, it may take a while for these efforts to offset the barriers that are currently lying in the path of these crestfallen stocks.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1270,FL,"Shares of Finish Line  plummeted 30% in premarket trading on Tuesday after the company reported lower than projected preliminary second quarter sales results Monday night. Despite bouncing back a bit since then, investors seem to be running from sporting goods sector stocks due in part to Finish Line’s updated full-fiscal year outlook.The athletic footwear company expects to report $469.4 million in second-quarter revenues, which marks a 3.3% decline from the year-ago period. The revenue dip can be attributed to a 4.6% drop-off in comparable sales.Finish Line now projects its full-year comparable store sales will fall by 3% to 5%, instead of the low-single digit gains the company previously projected. The sports retailer cut its updated full-year earnings projections in half to hit a new range of between $0.50 a share and $0.60 a share—which would be its smallest profit since 2009.In response to the dim outlook, Finish Line  stock touched a new 52-week low of $6.90 a share after more than 18 million shares traded hands Tuesday morning. The company’s average volume is 1.6 million. Finish Line stock has fought its way back from its premarket depths to hover around 19% below Monday’s close.The poor quarter and even worse guidance prompted the company’s board of directors to “unanimously adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “Rights Plan”) to protect the best interests of Finish Line shareholders.”The move to bar any individual stockholder from owning more than 12.5% of outstanding shares was made Monday night to help avoid a possible takeover. The anti-takeover plan is set to expire in August 2020.With a market cap of just $417 million, Finish Line isn’t a massive company. But its negative updated outlook seems to have helped confirm what many investors already knew: the sports retail and sporting goods industry could be in serious long-term trouble—especially in the footwear sector.Sports Industry Retail The Indianapolis, Indiana-based sports footwear retailer helped send sports-related investors running on Tuesday, as it seems the industry continues to be crossed over by the fluidity and reach of online retail.Shares of fellow sports-focused footwear retailer Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) dipped by 1.12%, while Dick’s Sporting Good (DKS  -  Free Report) fell by 1.80% and now hovers just above its 52-week low. Small cap sports retailers Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV  -  Free Report) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB  -  Free Report) both sunk by over 2.50%.  Big-name sportswear brands with major exposure at Finish Line also suffered. Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) saw its stock price fell by 0.95%, while shares of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) dropped by 2.35%.And as is often the case during the recent industry wide investor pullback, Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) felt the brunt of the blow. Shares of the Maryland-based sportswear company tanked by over 3.60% and touched a new 52-week low.Bottom LineBrick-and-mortar sporting goods companies have seen their stock prices fall as e-commerce outlets, and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) in particular, further encroach on their sales. To remain competitive going forward, Finish Line and other retailers need to consider all of their options, and the first among them might be to allocate resources to bolster their online and digital presence.If they don’t, Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour could have little choice but to wean their way off of traditional retail dependence faster than they originally planned.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1272,FL,"Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 18. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this retailer of athletic shoes and apparel will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.1%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 90 cents compared with 94 cents reported in the year-ago period. We noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased by 2 cents in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,821 million, up about 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe believe by continually capitalizing on opportunities like children’s business, shop-in-shop expansion in collaboration with its vendors, store banner.com business, store refurbishment and enhancement of assortments, Foot Locker is likely to benefit in the long run. International expansion, especially in Europe, is another growth catalyst. Further, the company is enhancing its eCommerce platform.However, we are concerned about the company’s sales and comparable-store sales performance. We noticed that Foot Locker’s total sales and comparable-store sales witnessed a marginal increase of 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which are in sharp contrast to the company’s performance in fiscal 2016.During the first, second, third and fourth quarters of last fiscal total sales increased 3.7%, 5%, 5.1% and 5.3%, respectively. Maintaining the same chronological order comps rose 2.9%, 4.7%, 4.7% and 5%, respectively. Management now projects low-single-digit growth in comparable sales with a relatively flat earnings year over year for the second quarter.Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Foot Locker, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Foot Locker is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Foot Locker has an Earnings ESP of -3.33% as the Most Accurate estimate is at 87 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 90 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with the negative Earnings ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.

1273,FL,"Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) plummeted on Tuesday morning after the retailer posted underwhelming quarterly same-store sales growth. The chain’s massive sell-off dragged sporting goods manufacturers and sportswear companies, including Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Under Armour UAA, lower as well.Dick’s sank to a new 52-week low on Tuesday morning, touching $27.92 a share after investors hammered the company’s stock. The brick-and-mortar sports chain carries almost every major sportswear company in the world, and its 0.1% same-store sales growth has some investors running scared.Many other companies in the retail sector shared Dick’s fate, while some were able to avoid the downturn. But companies with big exposure inside of the sporting goods chain were not so lucky.Sports Industry DipsShares of Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Puma SE PUM both fell marginally on Tuesday, with Puma experiencing the bigger drop-off. Callaway Golf (ELY  -  Free Report) and Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report) slid by around 1.50%.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) stock dipped 2% on Tuesday morning. Recently, the powerful sportswear company has made moves to sell more directly to consumers with its new Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) partnership. Nike has also tried to bolster and revamp its own online and mobile presence with the Nike app and the Nike SNKRS app, which hopes to create an easy shoe shopping experience.Still, chains such as Dick’s provide Nike the invaluable service of allowing Nike consumers the ability to try on higher-end footwear and sneakers. Shares of Finish Line  and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report), which cater even more to the high-end sneaker lover, both plummeted over 4% on Tuesday on the back of Dick’s fall. Under Armour (UAA) stock took one of the biggest hits in the sportswear world on Tuesday. Shares of the struggling company sank 4.41% and touched a new 52-week low of $17.81 a share. The company has large exposure in Dick’s and does not yet have the online and direct to consumer outlets to combat the retail drop off.Sports Retailers FallSlow growth, missed Wall Street expectations, and a poor full-year outlook from one of the biggest sporting goods chains helped send shares of fellow sports-based brick-and-mortar companies down as well.Dick’s retail peer Hibbett Sports’ (HIBB  -  Free Report) stock sank 11.65% to hit a new 52-week low of $12.23 a share. Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV  -  Free Report) also struck a 52-week low of $8.43 per share after falling over 5%. Outdoor sporting retailer Cabela’s  stock fell 4.92%. Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) stayed above the fray on Tuesday and actually saw marginal gains.Bottom LineThe retail squeeze is seemingly in full effect as Amazon and e-commerce companies siphon more and more sales from traditional retail. Dick’s hit a 52-week low and the company’s shares have fallen almost 50% in the last year. If the retail chain does not begin to make possibly drastic changes to its game plan, it could eventually get knocked out of the retail world.Nike, Under Armour, and other sportswear companies must also remain diligent in this ever growing digital world in order to remain highly competitive in the minds of investors.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1274,FL,"The Q1 earnings season has reached the tail end for all sectors save retail, which has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are down 1.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% revenue growth with 73.9% beating EPS estimates and 78.3% beating revenue estimates.While the growth pace is well below the four-quarter average, revenue and earnings surprises are much better than recent quarters. This is especially true as woes for departmental stores continued given the shift toward digital shopping.  Though departmental stores - Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) - topped our revenue and earnings estimate, they reported a drop in same-store sales, sparking off concerns on the prospect of their turnaround before the crucial holiday season. As a result, Macy’s dropped 10.2% following the earnings announcement on August 10, marking their biggest daily loss since January 5 while Kohl's shares had its worst day since January 8 falling 5.8%. Another department store chain Dillard's (DDS  -  Free Report) also tanked 15.9% on August 10 after it missed on both fronts (read: 3 ETFs & Stocks to Buy Post June Retail Sales).J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) shed as much as nearly 17% at the close on August 11 to reach an all-time low of $3.77 following dismal second-quarter results.All these results continued to weigh on the broad retail sector, suggesting more pain ahead for the retailers. In fact, retail ETFs - SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) – shed 3.5%, 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively, over the past five trading days.Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of big-box retailers that are likely to report this week. These also have the potential to push the related ETFs upward or downward (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).A Peek into Earnings SurprisesReports from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Staples , Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) will be crucial for the sector this week.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP has chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Home Depot is slated to report earnings before the bell on August 15. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +0.45%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates this quarter. The company saw negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter but delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.45%. The stock has a VGM Style Score of B.Staples has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, making surprise prediction difficult. It saw no earnings estimate revision for the to-be-reported quarter over the past three months and did not deliver any earnings surprise over the past four quarters. The stock has a top VGM Style Score of A. The company is expected to report on August 16.Target has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The stock has seen solid earnings estimate revision of 21 cents for the to-be-reported quarter over the past three months and delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.46% in the last four quarters. It has a top VGM Style Score of A. The company is expected to report before the opening bell on August 16 (read: Target Relieves Some Pain of Retail ETFs).Wal-Mart is scheduled to report on August 17 before market open. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.94%, indicating a higher chance of beating estimates this quarter. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.98% in the last four quarters and witnessed positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter. It has a top VGM Style Score of A.Foot Locker, which will likely report earnings on August 18 before the opening bell, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -3.30%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates. Though the stock has seen negative earnings estimate revision of 13 cents over the past 90 days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, it delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 2.06%. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Style Score of B.  ConclusionWith a few earnings surprises in the cards and a favorable stock ranks for big-box retailers, the ETF space might see some good trading in the days ahead even though the sector has an ugly Zacks Rank in the bottom 13%.This is because retail ETFs could stand out well as these can easily counter shocks from some of the industry’s biggest components given their spread-out exposure to a number of firms in various types of industries like specialty retail, hypermarkets, drug stores, food retail, internet retail and many others.

1275,FL,"Once an industry outperformer, Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) now seems to be in doldrums. This Pennsylvania-based retailer has slumped 22.8% since it reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 15. Further, this stock has crashed 47% in the past six months, much wider than the Zacks Miscellaneous Retail industry’s 14.7% downside. So, let’s analyze the factors that have been hindering the company’s performance and led to the second-quarter debacle.Intense Competition Mars the Sports IndustryThe sporting goods space has been extremely competitive and promotional of late, owing to consumers’ rapid shift to online shopping. While most retailers including DICK’s Sporting are trying all means to boost omni-channel operations, competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) remains a major deterrent. Well, this has been a concern for DICK’s Sporting, as some of its significant vendors including NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) have resorted to considerable direct-to-consumer selling. These factors, along with NIKE’s plans to sell directly on Amazon remains a major threat to DICK’s Sporting’s top line.Apart from DICK’s Sporting, these obstacles have taken a toll on many other major sporting goods companies like Foot Locker Inc. (FL  -  Free Report), Hibbett Sports, Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) and Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV  -  Free Report). Incidentally, these big-wigs recently curtailed their forecasts after posting dismal numbers in the second quarter. Aptly, the industry stands among the bottom 6% of the 265 Zacks Industries.Margins May Remain PressurizedAs stated above, DICK’s Sporting is undertaking several efforts to boost its e-Commerce operations, as evident from the recent relaunch of its website. While these endeavors bode well for the long term, the costs associated with these investments remain a deterrent for the company’s margin. Margins are also bearing the brunt of intense promotional activities undertaken by the company to thrive amid the mounting competition.DICK’s Sporting’s gross margin contracted 17 basis points (bps) and 82 bps in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. This was largely due to higher shipping and fulfilment expenses associated with the online sales. Further, management expects fiscal 2017 gross and operating margins to decline year over year, which reflects chances of these obstacles to linger.Softness in the Hunting CategoryDICK’s Sporting’s hunting category remained extremely challenging in the second quarter. Incidentally, comparable store sales (comps) at this category fell by double digits, which was worse than management’s expectations. Also, the gross margin remained stressed here owing to increased promotions. Further, management expects the hunting business to witness tough times in the remainder of fiscal 2017. Even though DICK’s Sporting is strongly focused on capturing displaced market share from liquidation of rival firms, the company still anticipates the hunting category to remain negative.Q2 Bears the Brunt, Outlook Hurts EstimatesAll aforementioned challenges caused DICK’S Sporting to post negative earnings surprise in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Also, the earnings of $1.00 per share was below the company’s guidance range of $1.02-$1.07. Furthermore, expectations of all aforesaid hindrances to linger compelled DICK’s Sporting to lower its fiscal 2017 earnings per share and comparable-store sales views.For fiscal 2017, which will have an additional week, management expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.80-$3 per share versus $3.65-$3.75, guided earlier. Despite the benefits from industry consolidation, comps for the year are anticipated to be flat to down low single-digit compared with 1-3% growth projected earlier.This, in turn has led a downward spiral in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2017. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents for the third quarter has gone down by 30 cents, while for fiscal 2017 the same has fallen by 19.3% to $2.93 in the past 30 days.Dick's Sporting Goods Inc Price and Consensus  Dick's Sporting Goods Inc Price and Consensus | Dick's Sporting Goods Inc QuoteNonetheless, DICK’s Sporting’s remains committed toward implementing its new merchandise plan, as well as its strategies of augmenting digital operations and exploiting industry consolidation. However, it may take a while for these plans to offset the boulders that are currently lying in this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s path.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1276,FL,"Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) rose slightly on Thursday despite earning yet another analyst downgrade—this time from Cowen.Cowen, citing all too familiar reasoning, lowered its rating for the struggling sporting goods retailer from “outperform” to “market perform.” Cowen’s John Kernan also reduced his Dick’s price target to $28 a share from $31 a share.""Despite Dick's Sporting Goods remaining the preferred destination when shopping for sporting goods according to the Cowen Consumer Tracker, slowing N. America sales growth rates from key vendors Nike and Under Armour, along with increased emphasis on the brands' own direct-to-consumer platforms will pressure Dick's Sporting Goods SSS [same-store sales] growth and margin profile,"" Kernan wrote in a note clients.The Cowen note also cited the fact that Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) represent 32% of Dick’s overall sales. But by now, Dick’s investors are likely well aware of the company’s exposure to these brands and understand that analysts are worried that sportswear companies will transition further into direct to consumer sales.""With Nike's plans to shortly begin direct selling on Amazon, Dick's Sporting Goods likely three largest vendors, Nike, Under Armour and Adidas will all be selling directly on Amazon,"" Kernan continued. ""Sporting good and athletic apparel and footwear industries are currently over-inventoried and the environment is as promotional as we have ever seen.""Yet, shares of Dick’s climbed 1.09% in morning trading. So why did the Pittsburgh-based retailer’s stock climb slightly in morning trading after this downgrade?It is very possible that this line of reasoning simply no longer scares Dick’s investors—because they have heard it all before.The company’s stock price has plummeted by more than 50% since the start of 2017, due in large part to poor sales and lower than expected earnings. And the reason for the drop-off has to be attributed to an overall shift in the retail landscape, especially when considering that Dick’s faces less direct brick-and-mortar sporting goods competition overall.Today’s marginal gain could be a sign that investors are just trying to wish away the Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) malaise. However, as Wal-Mart (WAL  -  Free Report) begins to show true staying power in traditional retail’s fight against online outlets, maybe investors hope that Dick’s can act quickly to change its current trajectory by pivoting some of its business models.Sports Industry Retail The sports retail industry is up almost across the board despite the downgrade and cautious note for an industry giant (also read: Retail Stocks Gain on Better-Than-Expected Earnings From Abercrombie, Sears).Sporting goods retailer Finish Line  saw marginal gains, while shares of Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) climbed by 1.50% on Thursday. Fellow we-sell-everything sporting goods chain Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV  -  Free Report) saw its stock price jump by 3%, and shares of Hibbett Sports (HIBB  -  Free Report) skyrocketed nearly 10%.The sportswear and sporting goods brands that these retailers often heavily rely on also saw nearly universal gains. Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report), Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report), and Callaway Golf (ELY  -  Free Report) all climbed marginally.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index witnessed the fourth week of losses, marking the longest weekly losing streak since May 2016 (read: 4 ETF Ways to Hedge Against Volatility).The Washington turmoil, a terrorist attack in Barcelona and rumors over the resignation of President Donald Trump's Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn led to investors’ pessimism, sparking off risk aversion. Investors losing faith over Trump’s ability to deliver business-friendly policies following the abandon of his plans to form an infrastructure advisory council to implement his keystone $1-trillion infrastructure spending plan took a toll on the stock market last week.Further, lingering tensions over North Korea and a slew of disappointing earnings reports added to the woes. In particular, Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) tumbled nearly 30% following weaker-than-expected earnings while Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) dropped 1.6% despite earnings and revenue beat.Both, network equipment maker Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and data storage company NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report) issued weak sales forecasts for the current quarter while L Brands (LB  -  Free Report) cut its annual profit forecast on weakening sales that led to a decline in their share price following their reports (read: Consumer ETFs in Focus on Wal-Mart Earnings Beat).The feeble domestic backdrop coupled with a weak dollar has given an edge to international and commodity investing.

1279,FL,"Shares of Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) jumped 10.67% in trading on Friday, closing at $59.02 per share, after reporting better-than-expected second quarter fiscal 2017 results.Ross reported earnings of $0.82 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76. Earnings grew 15.49% year-over-year. The company also reported revenue of $3.431 billion, surpassing our estimate of $3.370 billion and growing 7.88% year-over-year.The company also stated that comparable store sales rose 4%. Ross Stores expects to earn between $0.64 and $0.67 per share during the third quarter.This positive earnings report comes in sharp contrast to falling retail stocks resulting from poor earnings and sales this week. Today, Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) fell 28% after missing analyst expectations, dragging other athletic retailers along with it. L Brands (LB  -  Free Report), the owner of Victoria’s Secret, also tumbled on Wednesday after reporting disappointing sales and a weak outlook for the third quarter.Ross owes its success partially to its strategy of being an off-price retailer. The company offers designer and brand name products at deeply discounted rates. This has attracted consumers to its 1,340 U.S. stores, allowing Ross to succeed despite e-commerce retailer threats, like from Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).TJX Companies Inc (TJX  -  Free Report), which owns T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and the popular HomeGoods, also reported second quarter earnings this week that beat our estimates. The success of both these off-price companies demonstrates that department stores like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) aren't doing well just because of online competition, but because consumers want quality products at low prices.ROST remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with a VGM score of ‘A.’Want to learn more about retail?

The company’s earnings are down 34% year-over-year. Foot Locker also reported revenue of $1.701 billion, missing our estimate of $1.813 billion, and are down 4.44% year-over-year.Foot Locker stated that same-store sales fell 6% year-over-year.

At the same time, we were affected by the limited availability of innovative new products in the market.”“We believe these industry dynamics will persist through 2017,” said Johnson, “and we expect comparable sales to be down three or four percent over the remainder of the year.”The company was also hurt by a $50 million pre-tax litigation charge related to a lawsuit regarding Foot Locker’s conversion of former employee’s pension plans.Foot Locker’s poor report falls in a bad week for athletic retailers. This past Tuesday, Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) sank to a new 52-week low after reporting weaker earnings and revenue than investors expected. Dick’s poor performance caused a variety of sports retailers’ stock to fall, including shares of Foot Locker by 4%.In reaction to Foot Locker’s poor report today, fellow athletic retailers have fallen again. Shares of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) fell 5% and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) stock is down 3% in morning trading.

1283,FL,"Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) reported lower-than-expected financial numbers for the second straight quarter, when the company posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings. The New York-based retailer delivered quarterly earnings of 62 cents per share that fell substantially short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents and also declined 34% year over year. The company’s results in the quarter were impacted by soft performance of “some recent top styles”, which also lagged the company’s projections.Following, the results share of this operator of athletic shoes and apparel retailer are down nearly 17% during the pre-market trading session. In fact in the past three months, the stock has tanked 18.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 11.2%.Total sales of $1,701 million were down 4.4% year over year and also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,813 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total sales decreased 4.3%. Comparable-store sales (comps) fell 6% during the quarter. The company’s results were also affected by the lack of innovative fresh products in the market. Further, it believes industry dynamics will continue in 2017, as a result of this it expects comparable sales decline in the range of 3-4% in remaining part of 2017.Nevertheless, we believe by continually capitalizing on opportunities like children’s business, shop-in-shop expansion in collaboration with its vendors, store banner.com business, store refurbishment and enhancement of assortments, Foot Locker is likely to benefit in the long run. International expansion, especially in Europe, is another growth catalyst. Further, the company is enhancing eCommerce platform.Gross margin contracted 340 basis points to 29.6% of sales.

1284,FL,"Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) stock sunk to a new 52-week low on Thursday, less than a week before the struggling sporting goods retailer is set to report its second-quarter earnings.Other retailers, including industry powers and sporting goods chains, have already reported rough second-quarter results. Now, investors are preemptively dumping Dick’s as the e-commerce squeeze seems to be in full effect.Last week, outdoor sporting retailer Cabela’s  posted earnings of $0.53 a share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.57 per share and marked a 10.2% year-over-year decline. The company also fell short of revenue targets and dipped 4.2% from the year-ago period, due in part to a 9.3% decline in comparable store sales.Today, citing the decline at Cabela’s, UBS analyst Michael Lasser remained cautious about Dick’s ahead of its earning report.“While DKS probably benefitted from fewer competing stores in 2Q, we think there were offsets that weighed on its same-store sales,” Lasser wrote in a Thursday note. “DKS has had a lot going on, creating the potential for distractions due to the TSA and Golfsmith conversions, the Second Skin launch, vendor consolidation and management turnover… Still, it should be better positioned than other sporting goods retailers to weather the storm.”Last quarter, Dick’s earnings jumped 8% year-over-year to $0.54 a share. The retailer’s revenues increased by 9.9% to $1.8 billion, but sales fell below our Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, consolidated same-store sales climbed 2.4% from the previous year.Those first-quarter numbers don’t scream looming disaster for Dick’s on their face, but recent earning estimate revisions, spurred by slow overall growth, resulted in the company’s full-year Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings dropping to $3.67 from $3.71 a share. On top of that, our consensus estimate for the company’s fiscal 2018 earnings has fallen from $4.08 to $3.97 per share.The Pittsburgh-based retailer faces less direct brick-and-mortar sporting goods competition today, but online retailer Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)) has sapped some of the company’s moneymaking power.Shares of the sporting goods chain plummeted over 7% on Thursday to reach a new 52-week intraday trading low of $33.49 a share. Dick’s is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The company is set to report its second quarter earnings results on August 15.Sports Industry DownMacy’s (M) and other retailers’ shaky second-quarter earnings reports spurred Thursday’s massive retail meltdown, which hit the sporting goods world hard as well (also read: Retail Earnings Roundup: Macy's, Kohl's, Dillard's Plummet).Sporting goods retail peers Hibbett Sports (HIBB  -  Free Report) and Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices fall over 3% on Thursday. Shares of Finish Line  dipped 2.35%, while Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) dropped by 1.35%.The brands that these sports retailers sell have also been dragged down. Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) and Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) both sunk by around 2%.

1285,FL,"Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) stock moved higher on Tuesday morning after the retailer received a significant analyst upgrade.Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole upgraded Foot Locker stock from “Equal-Weight” to “Overweight.” On top of that, Sole assigned the struggling footwear retailer a $65 price target.The Morgan Stanley analyst tried to reassure Foot Locker investors who are worried that the retailer is inevitably doomed due to the rise and proliferation of e-commerce—and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) in particular.Sole noted that Foot Locker targets a different consumer base than Amazon. The analyst pointed out that less than 5% of the footwear retailer’s top 200 selling shoes are even available on Amazon. He also noted that despite the race for brands to sell directly to consumers online, the appeal of brick-and-mortar is still out there.The analyst projected that Foot Locker will get back to 3% to 5% same-store growth down the line. Sole noted that the current dip might be a solid place to scoop up Foot Locker stock.Today’s upgrade came after a Barclays’ analyst noted last week that he thinks Foot Locker stock is under valued. Barclays’ analyst Matthew McClintock stated that an extremely negative, and perhaps unrealistically bleak, Foot Locker future has led to the massive year-to-date decline in the company’s stock price. Barclays maintained its “Overweight” rating on Foot Locker.Shares of Foot Locker climbed 4.16% in Tuesday morning trading to hover around $51 a share. The company’s stock price has been trending upward over the last two weeks, but Foot Locker is still well below its 52-week high of $79.43 per share.Foot Locker is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) but scored an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth in our Style Score system.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1286,FL,"As another earnings season unfolds, it is time to reshuffle your portfolio but this time only to avoid adding stocks that have lower earnings beat predictability. Dodging these stocks will definitely minimize the risks to your portfolio. In today’s discussion, we are focusing on the Retail-Wholesale sector – one of the 16 Zacks categorized sectors –  in a bid to identify those stocks that do not fulfill our expected earnings beat criteria of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings Season So FarPer Earnings Preview, as of Jul 21, out of the 97 S&P 500 companies that have come up with their quarterly numbers, approximately 78.4% have delivered positive earnings surprises, while 72.2% beat top-line expectations. According to the report, earnings of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far are up 8.4% from the same-period last year, while revenues have increased 5.1%.Total earnings for the index are expected to improve 8.6% from the same period last year on 4.7% higher revenues. The report also indicates that the Retail-Wholesale sector is expected to record top-line growth of 3.9% but is likely to witness earnings decline of 0.2% this season.However, before zeroing in on the stocks, let’s have a look at all that is happening in the sector and how it is placed in the changing economic scenario.Changing Retail DynamicsThe retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. This shift in buying pattern has forced retailers to come up with innovative ways to market their products. Retailers who have responded quickly to it by staying ahead technologically stand in good stead.With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers including big-box ones are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels. They are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities.Sector’s Correlation with the EconomyThe Retail-Wholesale sector has not been an outstanding performer but it still holds some promise, given the favorable economic indicators. However, we understand that the space is not fully immune to global uncertainties, which could limit growth.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in raising buyers’ confidence. Consumer confidence, which ebbed some time back, took an unexpected “U” turn in June.However, the second straight month of slump in retail sales overshadowed steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration. U.S. retail and food services sales in June declined 0.2%, following a revised reading of 0.1% decrease registered in May.How to Identify the Laggards?Surely, not all retail stocks are going to beat or meet expectations. There will be some slow coaches. We can identify them before they report by combining our proprietary Zack Rank and Earnings ESP system. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) along with negative Earnings ESP have no or a very slim chance of outperforming estimates.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Portfolio Better Off Without These 5 StocksStay away from Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report), a retailer and wholesaler of general consumer products. The stock holds a Zacks Rank #5 and has an Earnings ESP of -13.16%. The company is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 15.Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) is another stock to shun. This provider of automotive replacement parts, accessories, batteries and maintenance items for cars, vans and sport utility vehicles holds a Zacks Rank #5 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.79%. The company is expected to come out with its second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 15.Don’t let your portfolio fall prey to The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of -2.44% and a Zacks Rank #5. The grocery retailer is slated to report its second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 8.Another stock that you should forget for now is American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -6.25%. This specialty retailer of on-trend clothing, accessories, and personal care products is expected to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 16.Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #4 and has an Earnings ESP of -6.52%, also does not deserve a place in your list of stocks.

1287,FL,"Stocks of sporting goods retailers performed sluggishly yesterday, following Hibbett Sports Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) announcement that its comparable store sales (comps) for second-quarter fiscal 2018 may fall as much as 10% due to extremely challenging sales trends. Further, the company indicated that the decline in sales and pressured margins in the quarter, would lead to a loss of 19–22 cents per share.Following the news, shares of Hibbett plunged more than 33%, hitting the 52-week low mark. Moreover, its industry counterparts were also punished with DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) and Foot Locker Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) falling 5.5% and 4.6%, respectively. In fact, Hibbett’s shares have declined as much as 50.3% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s drop of 12.4%. This can primarily be attributed to the company’s dismal sales surprise history, wherein it has lagged estimates in eight out of the trailing nine quarters.Additionally, the news also hurt athletic equipment and apparel manufacturers including the likes of Nike Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report). While Nike and Under Armour declined 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively, following the news, Adidas dipped only 0.4%.The news of a tepid second-quarter overshadowed the company’s announcement of launching its eCommerce site, which analysts believe was bit too late. However, the company issued a statement in its defense that it waited to put the necessary infrastructure in place including new distribution center and omni-channel capabilities to provide a seamless customer experience.Hibbett’s eCommerce site will not only provide customers with user-friendly experience but will also offer wide variety of footwear, apparel as well as equipment items to select from. We believe that in an era of challenging retail landscape, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s focus on omni-channel initiatives will help achieve its long-term goal.

1288,FL,"Shares of multiple sporting goods companies were down in morning trading on Monday after Hibbett Sports (HIBB  -  Free Report) announced that it expects a big second quarter drop off in a key sales category.Hibbett, a Birmingham, Alabama-headquartered sporting goods chain, announced today that it projects same-store sales to fall by around 10% in the second-quarter. Shares plummeted more than 30% after the announcement Monday morning, touching a new 52-week low in the process.In a statement, the company cited ""very challenging sales trends"" as a key reason for the predicted drop in same-store sales. Hibbett’s dismal second-quarter forecast has helped send shares of sports chain retailers Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) down as well.Shares of Foot Locker were down -4.52% in morning trading and also touched a new 52-week low. The footwear-focused chain has seen its stock price tank since its reported less than stellar first-quarter earnings in May. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Dick's stock fell 3.26% in Monday morning trading, reaching about $1 higher than its intraday and 52-week low by afternoon hours. The company is Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Interestingly, Hibbett’s horrible quarter is forcing the company to get with the times. “Launching an e-commerce site has been a key strategic goal for Hibbett, and we took time to invest in our omni-channel infrastructure to do it the right way,” the company’s president and CEO Jeff Rosenthal said.“Our main objective is to provide a seamless shopping experience for our customers with a platform that will allow us to significantly expand our assortment over time.”However, with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) snatching up business from retails chains every day, it might be too little too late for the struggling sporting goods chain to try to turn things around online.Luckily for Dick's and Foot Locker, their e-commerce presence is far more established. Still, investors will have to wait a couple more weeks to see how things shake out, as all three companies are projected to report earnings in mid-August.Athletic Footwear & Apparel DipsSome of the world’s biggest athletic gear giants also fell in morning trading on the back of the Hibbett news. Shares of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) fell by 1.25%, while Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) dropped by 1.84%. Adidas’ (ADDYY  -  Free Report) stock dipped only 0.60%. The news has clearly made investors hesitant about the state of the sporting goods market.However, Hibbett’s downturn is not as likely to affect these apparel powers as their retail counterparts, especially in the long run, as the companies have more flexibility to adapt to the shifting retail environment.In fact, shares of Nike had climbed roughly 16% this year until today’s dip. Nike also reached a significant partnership with Amazon in late June. The global sports company’s products could already be purchased on Amazon through third-party sellers, but the new partnership will see Nike become more prominent on Amazon.Bottom LineAs more and more people become focused on health and exercise, it seems unlikely that the sporting goods business will fall apart completely anytime soon. What seems more likely is that sports apparel and retail companies will need to shift their focus online and completely revamp their brick and mortar models.Hibbett’s story is a cautious tale for those that remain stuck in the past for too long.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
