0,TXN,"The Apple (AAPL) iPhone event on Sept. 12 will be key for the tech titan's stock, but also at key suppliers. Here's a look at five Apple iPhone chipmakers that are near buy points or working on bases: Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), Qorvo (QRVO) and Broadcom (AVGO).Skyworks Solutions poked above a 108.66 cup-with-handle entry in intraday trade this past Tuesday, but was not able to make the breakout stick. Shares closed Friday 3.7% below that level.Skyworks rose 2.4% to 107.19 on the stock market today.Texas Instruments ended last week 3.6% below a cup-with-handle buy point of 84.34. Shares came very close to that level on Thursday, but the stock reversed lower. Texas Instruments rose 1% to 82.22 on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: To find more stocks for your watch list, make sure to check out MarketSmith's screener tools.

Shares were 12.6% below a potential entry at 90.59, with four straight losses.Analog Devices rose 2.2% to 82.22 Monday.Qorvo is trying to climb up the right side of a cup base with a 79.44 buy point. But Qorvo still has a long way to go as shares are currently trading about 10% below the entry.Qorvo climbed 1.4% to 72.63.Broadcom briefly broke out over a 256.88 entry in late July, but a sell signal was triggered as the stock fell 7% below that level. Shares are now seeing a new resistance level around 258.Broadcom rose 1.5% to 247.74 Monday.Meanwhile, Apple remains within the 5% buy range of a flat base with a 156.75 entry. Shares are just a few bucks below an all-time high of 164.94 reached Sept. 1. But the stock has now logged losses for four sessions in a row, capping Friday with a 1.5% drop.Shares climbed 1.8% to 161.50 on Monday.When the iPhone 8 actually goes on sale, we'll find out who's in and who's out as far as chipmakers go, with teardowns revealing which suppliers have a significant portion of the handset's brains. A supercycle in iPhone sales, which many analysts are expecting, will likely boost chip stocks too as a result.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksApple (AAPL) Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart AnalysisThis Hot Chipmaker Has A New Base, Leading 6 IBD 50 Stocks Near BuysChip Stocks And Semiconductor Industry NewsLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains 
"
1,TXN,"The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials are all near record highs. So where are the big winners?XApple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) sold off last week to drop below recent buy points, with Apple undercutting its 50-day moving average as well. Nvidia (NVDA) got off to a strong start, but has pared much of its gains. Meanwhile, many ""breakouts"" are like Alibaba (BABA), creeping into buy zones but just stalling or pulling back. All of that suggests that the risk-reward for investors isn't great.Using pattern recognition via IBD's Marketsmith, as of Friday there were 75 recent breakouts of stocks trading at least $15 million worth of shares a day, with current Composite Ratings of 90 or better. That doesn't include every breakout: Apple's Composite Rating was above 90 until its recent sell-off. Tesla now has a 77 CR, though that's in part due to a lack of profits. Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have decent but not great fundamental and technical readings. But still, this is a fairly large list to study.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Of those 75 recent breakouts, just 14 were more than 5% past the entry point as of Friday's closing bell, making them extended. Most are just out of range. The biggest winner is RV and towables maker Winnebago (WGO), with a 13.7% advance through Friday, taking on a further gain Monday morning. There are several auto parts firms in the mix. A few chip gear makers are the only tech representatives.Meanwhile, dozens are like Alibaba, SAP (SAP), Square (SQ), Amgen (AMGN) — nudging out to buy zones, stalling out and sometimes briefly undercutting their entry areas. Alibaba and Square fell in Monday morning trading to below its ascending base buy point.Some of these breakouts have come in light or lackluster volume, suggesting a lack of institutional support. Unless you bought right at or just above buy point, there's good chance you're down.Boeing (BA) and chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN) are Sept. 15 breakouts that have advanced to near the high end of their 5% buy zones. Maybe Boeing and TI are on their way to be big gains.On the other hand, some stocks such as Nvidia and Universal Display (OLED), have made big initial moves but then pulled back.Nvidia broke out on Sept. 15. In the next session, the graphics and AI chipmaker rose as high as 9.5% above the buy point. But shares have fallen for the past four days, and are now just 2.5% over the entry.Universal Display, a maker of parts and tech for OLED screens as those next-generation displays are being used in high-end TVs, Samsung handsets and the upcoming Apple iPhone X, was 13.6% above its double-bottom entry Tuesday intraday. But thanks to three days of selling, Universal Display is now just 3.8% over the buy point. You don't want to see a 10%-plus winner roundtrip to the buy point.Nvidia and Universal Display fell more than 2% shortly in Monday morning trade, with both stocks undercutting their recent buy points.Meanwhile, 17 of the 75 recent breakouts were below their buy points as of Friday. Some are just below their entries. But Proofpoint (PFPT), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Apple iPhone chipmaker Skyworks (SWKS) fell so far that those buy points are now invalid.Because of the current 90+ Composite Rating screen, the number of underwater or failed breakouts may be higher. Apple and Tesla are definitely below their buy points but technically not quite failed breakouts, though Apple's above-average volume tumble through its 10-week line gave an additional reason for investors to cut losses. Apple fell 0.8% Monday morning while Tesla rose 0.5%.Oracle (ORCL), with its heavy-volume plunge below its buy point and 50-day line after issuing weak guidance, is a failed breakout.If the market picks up, with even a modest uptrend, you might see stocks that are hovering at or above buy points take off. On the other hand, a market slide, even modest, would likely push many more breakouts underwater.Investors need to recognize the current landscape, despite the market direction being ""confirmed uptrend."" There are stocks that are working, but big winners are scarce. Pay close attention to your portfolio as well as the major averages and leading stocks.RELATED:The Big Picture: Small Caps Up; Apple's Stock TumblesNvidia Stock Shaken On Report Tesla Is Developing Chips With AMDFacebook Stock Is At A Make-Or-Break Moment; Here's WhyThis Defense Giant Just Broke Out; These 2 Rivals Are Near BuysHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

2,TXN,"IBD 50 growth stocks have greatly outpaced the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and other major averages in 2017. While many IBD 50 stocks are extended, here are five members that are near buy points in bullish bases: Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), laser technology firm Coherent (COHR), Stamps.com (STMP) and Global Payments (GPN).XSkyworks, Coherent and Global Payments have risen above entry points, at least intraday, in recent sessions. Facebook has traded tightly for several weeks.IBD 50 stocks were up an average of 69.5% through Sept. 14, vs. 11.5% for the S&P 500 index.The major averages are trading at all-time highs even as the Fed is expected to begin whittling down its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet today. That's been well-telegraphed by policymakers. But will they stick to their relatively hawkish forecasts for future interest rate hikes with inflation low and market expectations even lower?Facebook rose 1.5% to 172.52 in Tuesday's stock market trading. The social networking giant is in a flat base going back to July 27, with a 175.59 buy point. Its Facebook's first real consolidation since late January.Facebook could soon win approval to enter China, according to an analyst report Tuesday. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made several trips to China, taking lessons in Mandarin Chinese as part of a long-term effort to win over authorities. Facebook has more than 2 billion users but has largely been shut out of China, the world's largest internet market.Skyworks rose 0.4% on Tuesday to 107.93, just below a 108.65 cup-with-handle base. Skyworks broke out on Sept. 15, but fell back below that entry on Monday as Apple slumped amid concerns that iPhone 8 preorders are lackluster. Apple itself remains comfortably in buy range, however, up 6 cents to 158.73. A few other iPhone-related chip plays are starting to move out as well, including Texas Instruments (TXN) and Applied Materials (AMAT).Coherent shot up as high as 281 intraday Tuesday, briefly topping a 278.49 cup-base buy point. But the stock pulled back to close at 265.87, up 1.85%.Coherent makes laser systems and components for a variety of uses, including fiber optics and OLED screens. OLED plays are gaining interest as Apple will use the next-generation display tech for its upcoming iPhone X.Coherent has reported huge and accelerating profit, but shares plunged Aug. 2 as earnings fell short of lofty views.Stamps.com rose 1.6% to 208.20 on Tuesday, working its way through a consolidation with a 220.35 entry. Stamps.com broke out of a cup pattern in late May, then skyrocketed 36% on Aug. 3 following strong earnings.Global Payments fell 0.9% to 96.06 on Tuesday, its fourth decline in five sessions. On Sept. 12, shares rose as high as 98.14, just inching past a 98.09 buy point, but closing just below that level.Payment stocks have been market leaders in the past few months, with newcomers PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ) joining Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) among those breaking out to record highs.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Bide Time Ahead Of Fed; IBD 50 LeadsThis Is How Much IBD 50 Stocks Are Beating The MarketIBD 50 List Of Top-Rated Growth StocksApple Leads 7 Top Stocks Holding In Buy RangeFacebook's Long-Awaited Entry Into China Market May Be NearStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

XApple (AAPL) will finally unveil its much-anticipated new iPhone, which has been hyped for a year and contributed to the stock's sky-high valuation. Meanwhile, moguls from the media and telecom sectors will huddle amid expectations for more mergers…
"
4,TXN,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and other U.S. indexes tumbled Tuesday morning as global markets were rattled following North Korea's overnight launch of a ballistic missile that crossed over northern Japan before crashing into the ocean. It was the latest in a series of provocations from the rogue nuclear-armed nation.XJapan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decried the ""grave"" threat while South Korea President Moon Jae-in ordered his military to show that it can ""overwhelm"" North Korea in the event of an attack.President Trump, who earlier this month vowed ""fire and fury"" for North Korea, has not responded directly yet.S&P 500 futures retreated 0.6% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.8%. Dow Jones industrial futures slid 0.5% vs. fair value, or more than over 100 points against fair value.South Korea's Kospi fell 0.2% Tuesday, well off session lows. Japan's Nikkei slid 0.45%. Major European indexes fell more than 1% intraday.Gold prices, already moving to 2017 highs on Monday, rose 0.9% with global tensions and a falling dollar.In the current choppy market, it's key to follow proper buy and sell rules. Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), leading gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), and Biogen (BIIB) all show the importance of waiting on proper buy points before taking a new position.Tesla dipped below its 50-day moving average on Monday. Skyworks drifted further below that support area as iPhone chipmakers failed to rally with Apple. On the upside, GLD broke out into a buy zone, and kept rising overnight. Biogen, meanwhile, approached an entry point.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index closed Monday higher. The Nasdaq moved back above its 50-day moving average while the S&P 500 index finished just below that level.As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. Why not buy before a stock surges out of a base? If it rallies, you get a bigger gain, right? But as an investor you shouldn't try to seek the biggest possible gain, but to maximize the odds of a big gain while minimizing losses.A buy point is the price level at which a stock is most likely to begin a significant advance. It's an area of the chart that offers the least amount of resistance to price progress.If a stock clears a buy point and then reverses below that level, that is not good technical action. Because it's clearly negative, it's easier to cut losses short. You may have an opportunity later to buy the stock again if it makes a new move into buy territory.In contrast, if you buy within a consolidation or when a stock is extended or in a downtrend, it can fall significantly over a few days or weeks without necessarily triggering any major changes in the chart. So you can either be shaken out of ""normal"" stock action or find yourself saddled with big capital losses.Tesla shares fell 0.7% to 345.66 in Monday's stock market trading, dipping just below their 50-day moving average. Tesla is in a cup-with-handle base with a 370.10 buy point. If you cheated and bought the stock on the Aug. 16 peak of 366.50, you'd be sitting on a near-6% loss.Tesla shares fell 1.8% to 339.40 in premarket trading Tuesday.Skyworks, which already was below its 50-day line, dipped 1.3% to 100.70, falling intraday to a new low for its handle. Skyworks' potential entry is all the way at 108.65.Skyworks stock is not alone. Fellow Apple chip stock Broadcom (AVGO) is below its 50-day line, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI) are just above that support level. Despite Apple's continued rise — shares rose 1% to 161.47 on Monday, still in range from a 156.75 entry — we haven't seen a wave of breakouts from key suppliers.Skyworks was not yet active in premarket action, while Apple fell modestly.SPDR Gold Shares, or GLD, rose 1.6% to 124.69, clearing a 123.41 buy point in strong volume. GLD largely tracks gold, which topped $1.300 an ounce and hit an 11-month high. GLD had just topped a prior buy point on June 6, but failed  to close above that level. GLD, and gold prices, then sold off for the next month before making a new move higher.GLD rose 0.65% to 125.50 in early trading as North Korea's missile launch pushed more investors into gold.Biogen rose 2.5% to 292.30 on Monday, closing in on a 297.05 buy point. Biogen announced positive trial data on an experimental Alzheimer's drug early Monday.Biogen's stock rose to 296.91 on Aug. 16, but didn't top the entry. Shares then retreated toward the 10-week line. Biogen's latest move is encouraging, but not definitive.Biogen was little changed Tuesday morning.Watching breakouts overall can give you a strong indication of the market's health. If a number of top-rated stocks are breaking out and continuing to advance, that's clearly bullish. But if breakouts fail or stall, that's a reason to be cautious or move to the sidelines.RELATED:The Big Picture: Nasdaq Fights For Support; This Sector RalliesChart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real Opportunity5 Chip Stocks Set Up Bases; Best Buy Due: Investing Action PlanBiogen's Alzheimer's Drug Shows Promise, Stock Nears Buy PointThese 4 Chip Stocks Just Carved This 'Super Growth' PatternETFs: Gold Soars, Biotechs Rally

6,TXN,"XDallas-based Texas Instruments received at least nine price-target hikes to its stock following the company's beat-and-raise June quarter report. Six of those price-target hikes were from analysts with buy ratings on the stock and three were from analysts with neutral ratings.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann was the most bullish of the bunch. He reiterated his buy rating on TI and raised his price target to 100 from 93.""The company once again demonstrated the increasingly profitable and secular attractiveness of its automotive and industrial-focused markets where the company will continue to gain share on a consistent basis,"" Mosesmann said in a report Wednesday.Shares rose 1.4% to 82.53 on the stock market today. Texas Instruments rose as high as 84.24, briefly clearing a cup-with-handle base buy point of 82.91.Texas Instruments gets over half of its revenue from the industrial and automotive sectors. In 2016, 33% of its revenue came from industrial and 18% from automotive.The company could get a lift in the September quarter from an increase in orders related to Apple's (AAPL) next-generation iPhones, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report.Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD also delivered a beat-and-raise quarterly report late Tuesday.The designer of graphics and computing chips received price-target hikes from at least four Wall Street analysts. Three of those analysts have buy ratings on the stock and one is neutral.Also, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra initiated coverage of AMD on Wednesday with an outperform rating and price target of 20.Rosenblatt's Mosesmann was again most bullish. He rates AMD stock as buy and upped his target to 22 from 20.AMD stock rose 4.6% to 14.76, surging to a 10-year high of 15.65 intraday. AMD closed just below a buy point of 14.77.Meanwhile, BMO Capital Markets downgraded AMD to market perform from outperform on valuation. BMO analyst Ambrish Srivastava kept his price target of 15 on AMD.""We believe shares of AMD are fairly valued at current levels and are factoring in a lot of continued favorable news and earnings power, which we do not see materializing,"" Srivastava said in a report. ""While we laud AMD for near-flawless execution on its product road map, and expect the company to take share in all the new markets it is targeting, we just do not see meaningful ensuing earnings.""Semiconductor equipment supplier MKS Instruments late Tuesday matched views on earnings and beat its target for sales in the second quarter and upped its guidance for the third quarter.MKS stock finished 2.8% higher at 83.15, in the upper half of its daily range that peaked at 84.95. MKS has a potential entry at 88.50.CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino downgraded MKS to hold from buy, but kept his 12-month price target of 86.""We think MKS is benefiting from a favorable memory landscape and transition to 3D Nand technology,"" Zino said in a report. ""We note limited visibility, but are encouraged by chipmaker capital spending plans. We positively view growth potential in adjacent markets and free cash flow generation.""RELATED:Two Top Chipmakers Top Views, Guide Up, Near Buys

Analyst Jeffrey Bernstein said McDonald's still has a valuation below that of peers.Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank lifted its target to 180 from 175, and Goldman Sachs raised its target to 174 from 167. Both firms have buy ratings on the Golden Arches.Shares of McDonald's closed down 1.6% at 156.51 on the stock market today, after jumping 4.8% Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Despite big signs of improvement at McDonald's it still isn't among the leaders in IBD's Retail-Restaurants industry group.

He sees the valuation as excessive given that AMD is limited to low-margin products. But BofA/Merrill Lynch raised its price target to 18 from 16.50, keeping a buy rating.

8,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN), along with equipment giants Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) — all five of these chip stocks are near buy zones, with Texas Instruments and Lam Research reporting this coming week.XInvestors also are digesting strong earnings this week from chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone supplier, and Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML.Skyworks fell slightly Friday following its strong earnings report late Thursday. Skyworks' results and outlook offer some insight into demand for Apple and the overall Apple ecosystem. ASML, which reported on Wednesday, surged nearly 10% for the week, becoming extended from its July 14 breakout.As for Apple itself, the iPhone maker's stock dipped 7 cents to 150.27 on Friday, after an intraday test at its 50-day moving average. Apple ended a nine-day winning streak on Thursday as it moves toward a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Broadcom, which was down 0.1% to 253.11 in Friday stock market trading, is just below a 256.88 buy point of a base-on-base formation.Broadcom weathered the recent tech sell-off better than most leading chip stocks, spending only a few days below its 50-day line. However, the base is the chipmaker's fourth in the past year. As bases enter into later stages, breakouts are more likely to fail.Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach said in a research note this month that Broadcom ""is picking up new (iPhone) content in custom applications, including touch and wireless charging.""However, Broadcom's planned purchase of Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) has been put off to allow more time for government review.Texas Instruments, another Apple chipmaker, fell 1.2% to 81.70 on Friday, moving further away from a 84.75 buy point of a late-stage flat base.Texas Instruments reports second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Earnings per share are expected to jump 25% to 95 cents, with revenue up 9% to $3.554 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.TI's margins have grown as more chips find their way into automobile technology, and as demand remains solid in the industrial space, Zacks said in a research note. While the company also stands to benefit from the expansion of more connected devices in general, it faces heightened competition from other chipmakers.Applied Materials, which provides equipment used to make chips, was close to a 47.96 buy point of a flat base.

9,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported its second straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth after Thursday's market close.

""As system-level complexity and performance requirements intensify across mobile and Internet of Things ecosystems, we are extending our product reach and capturing more content per platform.""Stock: Skyworks fell 2.9% to 104.50 in late trade, off after-hours lows. Shares closed up 2.1% to 107.64 on the stock market today, their 11th gain in 12 sessions. The stock is closing in on a 112.21 entry from a cup base. Skyworks retook its 50-day moving average last Friday.Why It Matters: Skyworks, which makes power amplifiers used in the iPhone and other devices, is one of the first Apple chip stocks to report. So it offers an early indication for other iPhone suppliers such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as Apple itself. Qualcomm (QCOM) reported late Wednesday, but its royalties feud with Apple doesn't make it a great bellwether. Qualcomm fell 5% Thursday.Apple won't report until Aug. 1.

11,TXN,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial averages were heading lower early Thursday morning. On Wednesday, chip stocks fueled the Nasdaq composite's 0.7% rally, on strong industry growth figures. But shares of Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip suppliers such as Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) are all still below key support levels after significant sell-offs.XNasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6% vs. fair value, while S&P 500 futures sank 0.4%. Dow futures were off 0.25%.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.4% and China's Shanghai composite rose 0.2%. In Europe intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE fell 0.7%, Germany's Dax 0.8% and France's CAC-40 1%.Apple shares themselves aren't acting that badly. The iPhone maker tumbled with other leading techs on June 9, then fell through its 50-day moving average on June 10. But since then the stock has moved sideways. Technically, Apple is in a flat base with a potential 156.75 buy point, though it needs to get above its 50-day line before investors should pay close attention.Apple's influence on the market is hard to overstate. Not only is the world's most valuable company by market cap and a member of the three major indexes, but its business strongly influences a raft of other companies, notably iPhone chip suppliers. Those chip stocks have been showing technical weakness, which one up session can't repair. Let's take a look at Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo.Broadcom is one of the better-looking iPhone chip stocks. Shares began pulling back with other techs on June 9, but held above its 50-day moving average until finally losing that support last week. On Monday, shares fell intraday to 229.08, almost roundtripping a near-13% gain from a 227.85 buy point cleared in early May.Texas Instruments tumbled hard on June 9, losing a buy point.

13,TXN,"In America, most moviegoers must have a bag of popcorn while watching. In growth stocks, what's the one thing you must have for an outstanding breakout?Volume. Lots of it.If the amount of shares traded on breakout day, or a few days afterward, surges well above normal levels, your confidence in the stock should grow. As a stock bolts out of a good double bottom or other type of base, heavy turnover means this: The big guns on Wall Street are accumulating shares big time. They're willing to pay up.What are ""normal levels?""IBD calculates a 50-day average daily share volume and plots it as a thin red line on daily charts. So you can quickly see if volume was heavy, flat or light on any trading day. Just compare the height of the volume bar for that day with the 50-day line itself.At Investors.com, open up a daily chart and click on any price-and-volume bar. A pop-up data box shows the volume that day and how it compares with average volume. Ideally, volume on the breakout day should be at least 40% above the 50-day average. For small and midcap stocks, volume might double, triple or even quadruple.Texas Instruments (TXN) flashed a picture-perfect breakout on Sept. 15.After peaking on June 9 of last year at 84.65 (1), the semiconductor play cooled off for three weeks, hitting bottom at 75.92. The 10.3% drop from head to toe was unusually shallow for a typical cup with handle. Yet, it carved the pattern well. Notice how the nearly four weeks up in price, formed the cup's right side. The handle was also quite long, but it showed a dry-up in volume (2). Note the bullish support along the 50-day moving average.On the breakout, the market was in a confirmed uptrend. (Always check in the Big Picture column). TI rallied 1.9% and rolled past the 84.34 buy point (10 cents above the handle's highest price). See how the volume bar soared well above the 50-day moving average line (3)? Mutual funds, banks, pension funds and the like furiously snatched shares. Turnover soared 154% above its average 4.06 million shares to 10.3 million.TI briefly pulled back three days later in above-average trade (4), but it paled vs. the breakout volume. Plus, the Dallas-based firm held above the proper buy point. No reason to sell.Could you have viewed TI's base as a flat base as well? No problem. With an 84.75 buy point, the breakout day was the same.Want an easy way to discover future breakouts? Check IBD's Stocks On The Move table.

Microchip finished the regular session Tuesday up 0.8% to 85.19. Microchip shares have climbed for six straight days, notching record highs on five of them.Late Monday, Microchip guided Wall Street analysts higher for the current quarter. The Chandler, Ariz.-based company said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.24, based on the midpoint of its guidance, up from its prior target of $1.22, which it gave on May 9. It also raised its sales forecast for the period.Microchip's outlook is being impacted by strong industry demand and ""extremely low"" inventories, Microchip Chief Executive Steve Sanghi said in a statement. Microchip makes microcontrollers and mixed-signal, analog and flash-IP systems.""While we are adding capacity in numerous areas, we expect that it could take another year for our inventories and lead times to return to more normal levels,"" Sanghi said. ""As a result, revenue opportunities are moving from one quarter to another and will likely continue to do so for several quarters.""Microchip received at least three price-target increases from Wall Street firms on the news.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now features eight chip-industry players including Microchip Technology at No. 24.Rosenblatt Securities reiterated its buy rating on Microchip and raised its price target to 102 from 100.Susquehanna Financial Group maintained its positive rating on the stock and raised its target to 98 from 92.Pacific Crest Securities kept its sector-weight rating on Microchip, but raised its fair-value target to 87 from 85.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said Microchip's industry commentary bodes well for other semiconductor firms, especially those with greater exposure to analog chips and microcontrollers.

21,TXN,"Recent device analysis by Chipworks points to several semiconductor winners, Susquehanna Financial Group said in a report Wednesday.Those winners include Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM); Texas Instruments (TXN); ON Semiconductor (ON); and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which is being purchased by Qualcomm (QCOM), Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report.Maxim gained significant market share in audio amplifiers in the first half of the year, helped by contract wins at Huawei, the giant Chinese tech firm. It also is being used in Samsung's flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone, Susquehanna said.Texas Instruments has been gaining power-management chip content in Chinese smartphones. It also won business in security cameras, game consoles, solid-state drives, routers and set-top boxes, the investment bank said.ON Semi has gained in power-management chips in PCs, handsets and other devices as well as in rapid-charge components in handsets. Plus, ON Semi is benefiting from the growth of devices with USB Type-C connections, Susquehanna said.NXP has been dominating the near-field communications chip market. It captured about 80% of NFC sockets in the first half of 2017, Susquehanna said.Ambarella (AMBA) stock dived below its 50-day moving average, a key support level, in bearish fashion on Wednesday after the maker of video-processing chips gave disappointing sales guidance for the current quarter late Tuesday.Ambarella reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, but offered weak revenue guidance for its fiscal Q2.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned 39 cents a share excluding items, up 15% year over year, on sales of $64.1 million, up 12%, in the quarter ended April 30. Analysts expected 36 cents and $63.5 million.For the current quarter ending July 31, Ambarella expects revenue of $69 million to $72 million, below Wall Street's consensus estimate of $72.35 million. The midpoint of its guidance would be an increase of 8% year over year.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now features nine chip-industry players including Nvidia and Microchip Technology.Most of the revenue shortfall in fiscal Q2 is related to weakness in its drone camera business.Ambarella is working to diversify its business from action cameras and drone cameras for customers like GoPro (GPRO) and DJI and into more internet-enabled security cameras, law-enforcement cameras and automotive cameras.Ambarella stock was down 10.25% to 53.60 on the stock market today. The stock peaked at 129.19 in July 2015 when GoPro wearable action cameras were a hot item.Investment bank Stifel reiterated its buy rating on Ambarella stock, but trimmed its price target to 64 from 65 on Wednesday.Needham maintained its hold rating on Ambarella on Wednesday.""Despite a weaker outlook for drones, the rest of Ambarella's business is performing strongly,"" Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said in a report. ""The company saw strong revenue growth in IP security cameras, both in professional and home monitoring, body-worn police cameras, and auto (equipment manufacturer) video recorders. … Additionally, Ambarella is seeing strong initial traction for 360-degree cameras and virtual-reality solutions, but notes it is still too early to forecast the size of this opportunity.""RELATED:This IBD 50 Chip Stock Just Notched A Record High, Here's Why

24,TXN,"What does a teardown of General Motors' (GM) plug-in Chevy Bolt reveal? That electric vehicles, including the upcoming Tesla (TSLA) Model 3, could be profit spinners much sooner than expected.X A team of UBS analysts recently took apart the Bolt, which they describe as the world's first real mass-market electric vehicle with a range well above 200 miles — and one with certain similarities to the Model 3. The analysts gained insights into the the future of mobility as well as what is in store for industries with skin in the game.""This new generation of electric cars has far-reaching implications for the global autos industry, but also for many other sectors, such as capital goods, chemicals, mining, technology and energy,"" the analysts wrote in a May 18 research paper.Tesla shares fell 0.15% to 310.35 in the stock market today after slipping intraday to 306.80. The stock hit a record high of 327.66 set on May 2.Here are some findings that surprised the analysts:The Bolt is a money-loser for General Motors but is poised to become a moneymaker by 2025. Using calculations based on the price, costs and margins for the Bolt, the UBS analysts estimate Tesla's Model 3 will require an average selling price of roughly $41,000 to break even.That is modestly higher than the Model 3's estimated base price of $35,000. But buyers are likely to pay up for the bells and whistles, meaning Tesla likely will cross the $41,000 break-even for the Model 3 with ease, in the analysts' view.Takeway: Fears that Telsa will lose money on the mass-market, $35,000 Model 3 may be unwarranted.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla is expected to begin Model 3 output in July, with mass production by year-end and continuing to accelerate in 2018. Here's an in-depth look into whether Elon Musk's Model 3 production plan is too fast and too furious.The Bolt's electric powertrain — its most expensive component — costs $5,000 less than the analysts expected.  An all-electric car and a traditional car with an internal combustion engine may cost roughly the same sooner than expected given the shrinking costs for battery packs and other EV modules.Takeaway: By 2025, electric vehicles could account for 14% of annual new car sales worldwide, with emissions-leery Europe a key demand driver.More than half the contents of the Bolt are sourced from outside the traditional auto supply chain. In fact, the entire electric powertrain and infotainment modules for the bolt are supplied by South Korean electronics giant LG.The Bolt has a mere 24 moving parts vs. 149 in one traditional car, the Volkswagen (VLKAY) Golf. What it lacks in mechanical complexity, it makes up for in electronic refinements.Takeway: Traditional auto suppliers stand to lose from the trend toward vehicle electrification.The Bolt and its electrified ilk may help auto manufacturers turn profits relatively soon, if costs fall and volumes grow sooner than expected. However, these extremely low-maintenance vehicles could threaten others.Traditional suppliers, however, face competition from new entrants and dwindling revenue from some lucrative business lines — such as spare parts. Dealerships' revenue from after-market service could take a 60% hit too.Takeway: Electrified cars will disrupt the automotive industry, in some unanticipated ways.The Bolt's body and chassis use far less iron and steel than the Golf, and far more aluminum and copper.

25,TXN,"Chipmakers Texas Instruments (TXN) and Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) received a flurry of stock price-target increases after posting better-than-expected March quarter results late Tuesday. But investors sold off shares in both firms on Wednesday.Texas Instruments nabbed at least seven price-target hikes from Wall Street firms, including Cowen, Jefferies, Mizuho, Oppenheimer, RBC Capital Markets, Rosenblatt Securities and Susquehanna Financial Group. Of those firms, five have buy ratings or the equivalent and two — Cowen and Mizuho — have neutral or market perform ratings.Macom scored price-target hikes from Jefferies and Needham, both of which rate the stock as buy.Still, shares of Macom and TI fell Wednesday because of sales concerns in key markets.TI bears moaned about possible weakness in the company's automotive chip business this quarter. Macom investors stressed over a downturn in the company's sales of optical networking products to carrier customers.TI stock closed down 1.5% at 81.11 on the stock market today. Macom shares tumbled 6.5% to 50.32.Dallas-based TI earned 97 cents a share, up 41% from the year-ago quarter, on sales of $3.40 billion, up 13%, in the first quarter. Analysts expected TI to earn 83 cents a share on sales of $3.3 billion.""Demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market,"" TI Chief Executive Officer Rich Templeton said in a statement.For the second quarter, TI expects to earn 95 cents a share, up 6%, on sales of $3.55 billion, up 8%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling for TI to earn 91 cents a share on sales of $3.5 billion.""The company once again demonstrated the secular attractiveness of its automotive and industrial focused markets where the company will continue to gain share on a consistent basis,"" Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Macom is one of nine semiconductor industry stocks on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating on TI stock and raised his price target to 93 from 90.Lowell, Mass.-based Macom earned 63 cents a share excluding items, up 37% year over year, on sales of $186.1 million, up 39%, in its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected Macom to earn 61 cents a share on sales of $182.7 million.For the current quarter, Macom expects adjusted earnings of 69 cents a share, up 35%, on sales of $196 million, up 38%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. That matches what Wall Street was modeling.Macom Chief Executive John Croteau said the company is seeing softness in its carrier business offset by explosive growth in networking chips for internet cloud data centers.""We are excited about the opportunity in Cloud Data Centers which is now a separate and distinct secular growth driver for Macom and believe we are uniquely positioned in one of the highest growth markets of the electronics industry,"" Croteau said in a statement.RELATED:Xilinx Gets Upgrade In Busy Week For Chip EarningsChipmaker Maxim Falls On Slowing Automotive Chip Sales'Arms Race' Underway In Smartphone Specs; Apple To Fire Next

In January's report, 65 top funds invested a total of nearly $1.8 billion in the tech giant.But with analysts seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales, institutional investors may fear the explosive growth of the past may be coming back down to earth as the company settles in to its new headquarters nicknamed Apple Spaceship in Cupertino, Calif.For the December quarter, Apple beat estimates for sales and earnings, but came up short on iPhone sales and guided lower for the current quarter. Apple's stock has now fallen sharply below its 10-week line in heavy volume, a sign of institutional selling. Apple is currently testing support at its 40-week line.Four stocks on the list received over an estimated $1 billion each in investments from the top funds over the past three months: Bank of America, medical sector stocks UnitedHealth (UNH) and Abbott (ABT), and semiconductor pioneer Texas Instruments.BofA is up more than 20% from a breakout in September, and has shown resilience – and support at its 50-day line – in the face of increased volatility and selling pressure in the general market.Abbott has given back much of the 13% gain in made from the buy point it cleared in December.

49,TXN,"Veteran semiconductor securities analyst Hans Mosesmann, who joined Rosenblatt Securities this month, initiated coverage on a range of chip stocks Wednesday. He slapped Intel (INTC) with a sell rating and gave buy ratings to three stocks on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.The IBD 50 currently lists 10 chip industry stocks, including Broadcom (AVGO), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Nvidia (NVDA), all of which Mosesmann recommends.""We are initiating coverage of the semiconductor sector today with a positive bias in an industry that is seeing moderating growth (mid-single digits), continued consolidation, and a slowing of Moore's Law,"" Mosesmann said in his research report.Key disruptive themes to watch include artificial intelligence (machine learning, deep learning and self-driving cars), cloud computing and data center growth, the emergence of compute-centric graphics processing units, and multiple bandwidth transitions including optical, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is ranked No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of superior growth stocks.In computing, Mosesmann favors the prospects of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as the top GPU players in the market. Nvidia's investments in artificial intelligence and parallel computing give it an edge in markets like autonomous driving, he said. AMD has the opportunity to gain market share in x86 servers with its Zen processor portfolio, he said.He rates both stocks as buy with price targets of 140 for Nvidia and 16.50 for AMD.Nvidia stock slipped a fraction to 110.76 on the stock market today. But AMD stock rose 2% to 14.28, hitting its highest price since October 2007.Mosesmann said he is ""skeptical"" about Intel's prospects in computing, hence the sell rating. Intel fell 1.2% to 36.07 Wednesday.He rates Broadcom, Microchip and Texas Instruments (TXN) as buy because they are diversified, free-cash-flow-focused companies. He set price targets of 250 on Broadcom, 90 on Microchip and Texas Instruments.Broadcom stock rose 0.66% to 214.16, hitting an all-time high for the third straight trading day. Microchip rose 0.77% to 73.04. TI stock rose 15 cents to 77.23.He also set buy ratings on memory chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) and optical components firm Inphi (IPHI). He gave price targets of 34 to Micron and 60 on Inphi.Micron stock slipped 2 cents to 23.75 Wednesday, while Inphi fell 0.72% to 51.03.Mosesmann rates as neutral Cavium (CAVM), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) and Xilinx (XLNX) based on valuation.RELATED:Chip Sector Remains Strong As Recent Earnings Impress

50,TXN,"Michael Clarfeld has helped steer $5.6 billion ClearBridge Dividend Strategy Fund (SOPAX) to solid performance by pursing high-quality stocks that provide price appreciation with improving dividends.The fund he co-manages has returned an average annual 8.89% in the three years ended Jan. 31, topping 80% of the diversified income-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The fund's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.12%.His bull's-eye is dividend growth, not high dividends. He and co-managers Harry Cohen and Peter Vanderlee favor stocks that are financially healthy enough to pay dividends that rise. They avoid those with yields that are inflated either by companies desperately trying to attract investors or by falling share prices.The bonus is that the financial strength that provides a launchpad for dividend growth inoculates stocks against the risks of a rising interest rate environment, he says.""Stretching for yield is risky,"" he warns. ""Dividend growth is the place to be. That growth can offset the negatives of rising rates.""Dividends can be shock-absorbers, smoothing investors' rides during market turmoil. Yet their stock holdings still offer the potential of price gains, the thinking goes.Just look at some of his fund's holdings. Among the fund's four holdings with the highest Composite Ratings from IBD, Texas Instruments (TXN) is up 43% in the past 12 months ended Jan. 31; it has an annual dividend growth rate of 15.3% in the past three years, according to dividend.com. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 42%; its dividend growth rate is 10.6%. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is up 22%; its dividend growth rate is 6.8%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is up 41%; its dividend growth rate is 31.2%.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Medical Care industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 87 IBD Composite Rating and four straight years of earnings per share (EPS) growth — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.That volatility antidote of dividend-paying stocks might come in handy sooner rather than later. The market has traded sideways since mid-December as investors wait to see how the newly installed president's policies play out and whether a Republican-controlled Congress makes good on the business friendly actions investors expect from it.Stocks offering dividend growth also might fare better than bonds if the Federal Reserve makes good on its signals that it intends to raise rates multiple times this year.From his office in Manhattan, 39-year-old Clarfeld talked with IBD about whether it's wise to own a dividend-paying portfolio in a rising rate environment and his fund's overall investment approach.IBD: Do you ever give in to temptation and buy high-yield stocks?Clarfeld: If you buy only stocks with high current dividends, you miss out on some good stocks. We own American Tower (AMT), for instance, which is a wonderful business. (Its share price is up 34% since the end of 2012. Its dividend yield is 2.2%.) But it only began to pay dividends in 2012. So you have to be open-minded.We used to own Heinz (now part of KraftHeinz (KHC)). Several years ago it was much easier to find great companies with solid growth and high dividends like Heinz. But then it got taken over. We couldn't find a replacement that was as good a company with a good growth rate and a high current yield, so we ended up tilting more toward dividend growth and a little less toward high current yield as the impacts of quant easing became more pronounced over the last many years.IBD: Dividend growers are among the most stable companies. Why not buy shares in them directly and avoid a fund's expenses?Clarfeld: There are a couple of reasons. One is diversification. It would not be particularly efficient for an individual to buy 4o to 50 stocks. The broker commissions would add up.And the average person who has a job and a family does not have time to follow 50 different companies, industries, competitors and figure out which to buy, the correct time to buy, and so on.IBD: You began a stake in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) not long ago, but well before its recent Trump bump. What's your thesis?Clarfeld: We bought it early in the year when it was yielding north of 3%. (Yield now is 2.3%.) Pre-election, there was so much investor fatigue toward large banks, prices were very beaten down. And the prospect of interest rates going up, it seemed like it would never happen. And it seemed like regulatory pressures would persist forever. We just thought the valuation was too pessimistic. And JPMorgan has lots of franchises that are valuable.IBD: Texas Instruments' (TXN) earnings per share growth has accelerated for four straight quarters. What's driving it?Clarfeld: We like their emphasis on analog chips. If you think about Texas vs. Intel (INTC), which we also own, Intel makes the brains of computers. They are high performance, high dollar value. Texas focuses on the other end of the spectrum. Their chips sell for 10 to 20 cents. They are basic but high quality. And they're attractive because they are the largest player in that space.Anyone designing a new alarm clock or refrigerator or car and needs basic chips knows that Texas Instruments has them. And once those chips are designed into something, it rarely changes. So they provide a recurring revenue stream like an annuity.High performance chips require huge R&D spending. Texas Instruments' chips are much less capital intensive. So they can direct 100% of their free cash flow to shareholders.IBD: Automatic Data Processing (ADP) got a nice Trump bump. But you've owed this for years, right?Clarfeld: It's been a core holding for 10-plus years. It's a business we think can compound earnings for years. And payroll processing provides recurring revenues. Once you get a company's payroll, the business is sticky. This company benefits from job growth in the economy. It is taking share. And it provides ancillary services. They help companies deal with Affordable Care Act compliance, although a potential repeal or replacement is now a risk for them. Still, the ACA is not a core driver of this business.And recently it's benefited like a lot of financials from rising interest rates. They earn a float on payrolls they handle. Rising rates mean that float will increase.IBD: You reopened your stake in Alphabet (GOOG) after closing it. What brought you back?Clarfeld: We're a dividend portfolio. We don't go looking for nondividend-payers, but we don't want to be overly dogmatic. We wanted this exposure and there is no other way to get it.Over the past 10 years, we've owned three nondividend-payers: Apple (AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (BERKB) and Alphabet. There is no search company like Google. There is no company like Berkshire Hathaway, which won't initiate a dividend while Warren Buffett is alive. After he's gone, who knows? And we think Alphabet will likely initiate a dividend in the future. We're not forecasting that, but we think they will.IBD: You trimmed your Waste Management (WM) stake. Why is that?Clarfeld: Actually, it's an example of a business we like. The business is stable and predictable. It's cyclical with the economy. There's been enough consolidation to make the industry rational. In fact, they've been able to drive prices higher despite a relatively weak economy. We have trimmed some just on valuation.IBD: What distinguishes Walt Disney (DIS) from other media names?Clarfeld: Their ability to create properties and then monetize them. They make movies, then turn it into a theme park attraction and then sell merchandise from it to kids. They show an ability to do that in a way few other companies can.And they own ESPN, which is dominant in sports. The biggest piece of ESPN is monthly subscription income, not advertising, and their paid subscribers are growing. So their revenue is stable and predictable. They have multiyear contracts with (cable) systems, with built-in (price) escalators.IBD: Is Home Depot (HD) a play on an expected pickup in economic growth?Clarfeld: What we like about it is not what's going to happen to the economy in 2017. We don't own a lot of retailers because they're hard to understand. And they have a fashion element, which can become unpopular suddenly. Home Depot is not like that. They're not trying to call a fashion fad. And they don't need to spiff up their stores, which are warehouses. It took a huge step down in the financial crisis. We bought it back then. Our cost basis is below 30. (Now it's trading around the high 130s.) It's a play on people spending on their homes.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has trended higher since the election. Is this a play on the expectation of reduced health care regulation?Clarfeld: They have diversified their operations. The stock has done well because people expect reform or changes under the new administration that will be market based. Company management is very commercially oriented.RELATED:Where Vanguard's CEO McNabb Sees Fund Giant Headed In 2017Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stocks Gains In 2017After 2016 Ends On Strong Note For Mutual Funds, What's Ahead For 2017

Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares. Eighty-nine funds put $1.3 billion into Bank of America.Apple broke out on Oct. 27, but after a short rise has eased back to form a new flat base showing a possible 176.34 entry. Intel has pulled back after making a solid gain from an early October breakout.

The financial titan is currently 13% above the buy point.Several stocks on this month's list are in or near a potential buy zone, but keep in mind that recent selling pressure in the major indexes and pullbacks by several leading stocks means the current uptrend could be starting to roll over into a correction. If that happens, it will be difficult for individual stocks to make a sustained upward climb.Orthopedic implant maker Stryker (SYK) is working on a first-stage base-on-base with a 160.72 entry.

Stryker closed below that benchmark line on Thursday in rising volume.Heico has found support at its 10-week moving average as it tries to complete a flat base with a 93.10 entry. The pattern is part of a long, first-stage base-on-base formation.Fellow defense contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne is also working on a base, but is trading below its 10-week moving average with a lagging RS line.Regional bank stock Synovus Financial (SNV) jumped past a 47.77 entry on Nov. 28, but has now pulled back to test that buy point once again.Three stocks on the list currently pay a dividend yielding at least 2% on an annualized basis: Texas Instruments (2.5%), Intel (2.5%), New Mexico-based electricity utility PNM Resources (PNM) (2.4%) and Dover (DOV) (2%).For a look at how to generate income with stocks and mutual funds without taking on undue risk, see IBD's new special report on income investing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of new sells, with 94 net sellers (163 funds selling minus 69 buying). But recent chart action may be telling a different story.Like BofA and other big bank stocks, JPMorgan has gotten a bump as the likelihood of Donald Trump and Republicans passing tax reform has risen.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had 55 net sellers (130 selling, 75 buying), while Aetna (AET), which will merge with CVS (CVS) if the deal clears regulatory hurdles, had 35 (94 selling, 59 buying).Johnson & Johnson is working on a flat base as part of a longer first-stage, base-on-base formation.

The maker of jet engine components and electronic systems closed Tuesday's near the very top of the buy range.Pulte is up over 40% from a breakout in June, but the Atlanta-based homebuilder has been trading in a very tight range in recent weeks and may offer an add-on buying opportunity at 34.70.Applied Materials is trying to form a new base, but note that it's late-stage and the semiconductor equipment maker's relative strength line is well below new high ground. The stock continues to tests support at its 50-day line.Although Bank Of America received the aforementioned $1 billion buy-in, it also topped the list of stocks being sold with 36 net sellers (93 funds selling minus 57 buying).No. 2 on the sell side was fellow financial titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which had 35 net sellers (91 funds selling minus 56 buying).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Honeywell (HON) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), as well as Aetna and Southwest Airlines (LUV), were also among the 10 stocks with the most net sellers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearLooking For The Next Nvidia?

TI also guided higher. The stock jumped nearly 5% in premarket trading after closing up 0.3% at 98.42.Texas Instruments isn't just one of the biggest chipmakers but also fairly diverse, with big exposure to the mobile and automotive markets. So TI's results are a good indicator for chips and end markets.STMicroelectronics (STM), chip-gear maker MKS Instruments (MKSI) and LED-chip maker Cree (CREE) also jumped overnight on their results.But big-cap chip-equipment maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled overnight on weak guidance. Teradyne warned of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices.That's not the most recent chip warning directly tied to smartphone weakness. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), which makes a lot of chips for Intel, Nvidia and others, cited phone woes in its grim outlook last week.Still, the SOXX ETF rose a fraction in premarket trading.Intel, which reports earnings Thursday, rose 0.5% in Wednesday's premarket. On Tuesday, Intel closed up 0.7% at 51.45 after hitting 53.64 intraday, nearly retaking a 53.88 flat-base entry.Nvidia was indicated slightly lower after initially showing a modest gain.Remember that after-hours action in stock futures as well as individual stocks and ETFs doesn't always translate into regular-session gains.Chip stocks are a huge share of the market, especially in the Nasdaq. Chips are in so many products, from PCs, servers and smartphones like the Apple iPhone, to also ""non-tech"" products such as cars and appliances. So if semis are faring poorly, it's not a good sign for end demand in many industries.

87,TXN,"Chip stocks are hoping for some much-needed good news in the week ahead as earnings season shifts into high gear.The week ahead will bring earnings reports from a bunch of closely watched chip companies, including Texas Instruments (TXN) on Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday, and Intel (INTC) on Thursday.The sector was knocked down over the past week by cautious reports from chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research (LRCX).Investors fret the chip sector has peaked and is starting to enter a down cycle, analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTaiwan Semi, the world's largest contract chipmaker, added to those concerns on Thursday when it lowered its target for sales growth in the global semiconductor industry this year to 5%, down from its prior outlook for 5% to 7% growth.That day, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.3%. It was the biggest one-day drop for the index, known as SOX, since Feb. 8 and only the 10th time in the past eight years when the index fell more than 4%.The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) fell 1.2% on the stock market today.The broad sell-off in the chip sector was not justified, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said in a report Friday. Taiwan Semi said the sales weakness was related mostly to the smartphone sector, particularly Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker said sector growth areas like automotive, Internet of Things and data centers remained strong, Gill said.Lam Research also rattled chip stocks when it gave a disappointing outlook late Tuesday for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year. Fremont, Calif.-based Lam makes wafer fabrication equipment for the semiconductor industry.Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Friday said chip stocks could go 4% to 7% lower. Rough earnings, trade fights and market volatility have ""soured the mood,"" analyst Vivek Arya said in a report.Arya cut his price targets on chip stocks with heavy exposure to Apple's iPhone business, including Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).Chip company earnings in the week ahead could decide if the sector rebounds or continues its downward trajectory.Dallas-based Texas Instruments is set to report first-quarter results after the market close Tuesday. Analysts expect TI to earn $1.11 a share, up 14% year over year. That's on sales of $3.65 billion, up 7%, in the March quarter.Analysts say Santa Clara, Calif.-based AMD should earn 9 cents a share, reversing a year-earlier loss of 4 cents a share. That's on sales of $1.57 billion, up 59%, in its fiscal first quarter.Wall Street expects San Diego-based Qualcomm to earn 70 cents a share, down 48%, on sales of $5.19 billion, down 13%, in its fiscal second quarter.A legal dispute with major customer Apple has dampened its results in recent quarters. Apple refuses to pay technology licensing fees to Qualcomm until the legal matter is resolved.Also weighing on Qualcomm is the possibility that China could block its proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). On Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce gave a pessimistic preliminary review of the Qualcomm-NXP deal.Analysts see Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel earning 72 cents a share, up 9%, on sales of $15.05 billion, up 2%, in the first quarter.RELATED:Qualcomm To Cut 1,500 Jobs To Help Stave Off Broadcom MergerIntel Stock Nears Buy Point After Price-Target HikeChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

88,TXN,"The stock market rally isn't quite dead. The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 sold off Friday, but all held above their recent lows. But the chip sector, along with key semiconductor stocks Nvidia (NVDA), Applied Materials (AMAT), Texas Instruments (TXN), undercut recent levels Friday, while Micron Technology (MU) wiped out big gains and flashed sell signals.The chip action is worrisome for the stock market rally attempt. It's hard for stocks to have a sustained advance without chips taking part. For one, chips are a big part of the overall market, especially the tech sector. Second, if chip stocks are struggling, that could be a bad sign for demand in the vast array of products that use chips, from the Apple (AAPL) iPhone to a Tesla (TSLA) Model 3.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbled 3.1% on Friday, undercutting its April 2 low. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) ETF also did so. Notably, the Philly Sox index retreated on Thursday. The major averages rose somewhat that day, but volume was light and the Nasdaq lagged.Nvidia retreated 7.5% last week to a two-month low. But its real problems began March 27, when Nvidia said that it was halting self-driving tests. That also was bad news for Nvidia customer Tesla. That was a bad day for the general market, with the Nasdaq finding resistance at the 50-day line and reversing sharply lower.But there were warning signs earlier that day. Soon after the March 27 open, Applied Materials and fellow chip-gear maker Lam Research (LRCX) reclaimed buy points, but quickly backed off.Last week Applied Materials skidded 5.9% last week to its worst levels since mid-February, approaching its 200-day line. Texas Instruments' relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a two-month low. Several other chip stocks undercut recent lows, including Lam Research, Apple chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMicron Technology was a rare chip stock that was a market leader in recent weeks. Micron had a powerful breakout from late February and rapidly ran up. But the memory-chip giant has sold off 23% from its March 13. On Friday, shares nearly completed a round trip back to the 47.08 double-bottom base buy point. Micron closed below its 50-day line.Micron's sell-off dragged down several other memory plays, including chip-gear makers Applied Materials and Lam.However, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF, Nvidia and Micron were all up about 1% in premarket trading Monday.Another factors also aren't encouraging. The three-day stock market rally came on increasingly light volume, while Friday's sell-off came on heavier trade. That's classic stock market correction behavior.Some recent breakouts, such as Five Below (FIVE), Vipor Energy Partners (VNOM), fell back below buy points on Friday. Apple and Netflix (NFLX), which reclaimed their 50-day moving averages by Thursday, fell back below those levels on Friday.Despite Friday's big retreat, the put/call ratio came in at a relatively tame 1.04. That fear gauge is below the 1.15 level that often indicates a short-term bottom. The market has several big sell-offs over the past 10 weeks, only to bounce back quickly, sometimes that very day. So even a stock market correction, investors may be complacent.Instead, that lack of investor panic should be one more reason to worry. If nothing else, the recent market swings should underscore the importance of not trying to jump back into stocks before a confirmed rally.As long as the major averages hold above recent lows, the stock market rally attempt is still live. If one or more of the major averages rises strongly in heavier volume on Monday, that could confirm the new uptrend.Stock market futures indicated a solid open Monday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The Big Picture: Trump's Trade War Takes Out BullsMicron, Texas Instruments Hit With Sells As Broker Starts CoverageNetflix, 3 Top IPOs Join Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Earnings Growth If You're Not Following This Sector Leader Closely, You Should Be After Market Sell-Off, These Stocks Added To, Cut From IBD Lists

""We focus on stock-specific ideas where either estimates are too low or the Street is missing a key transformation.""Arcuri likes Intel because of its data-center chip business and sees Broadcom and Marvell as ""transformation stories.""Arcuri is positive on KLA-Tencor because of its shift from semiconductor production equipment to industrial technology, plus its exposure to the growth of AI computing.The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks currently features seven chip industry players. They include Applied Materials, Lam Research, Micron and Nvidia.Arcuri thinks Applied Materials and Lam will be hit by semiconductor cyclicality.

Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM), along with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Deere (DE), all should benefit from easing tensions between the world's two largest economies.Meanwhile U.S. Steel (X) and other domestic steel stocks took a hit, even though Chinese steel makes up a small share of U.S. steel imports.The aerospace giant is America's biggest exporter and China is a key customer. China's jet purchases could reach a worth of $1.1 trillion over the next 20 years. A U.S.-China trade war could have been damaging to the Dow Jones aerospace giant.Boeing shares rose 3.6%, to close at 363.92, on the stock market today.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBack in April, Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said the Boeing threat was ""dissipating"" due to Chinese and American policymakers seeking to avoid a trade war, with a mutually beneficial outcome. He noted that China's proposed 25% tariffs on aerospace products would only impact imports of Boeing's 737-700 and MAX 7. They account for less than 1% of Boeing's backlog orders.NXP Semiconductors stock rose 3.3%, to finish at 114.65, as a trade deal increases the chances its takeover by Qualcomm will go through. The stock gapped above its 50-day moving average and hit its 200-day line before retreating.The Dutch company already had climbed on reports that Chinese regulators are looking more favorably upon Qualcomm's attempt to acquire the chipmaker. That came after President Trump signaled he would ease stiff sanctions vs. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE.Analysts have said completing the $44 billion NXP transaction is Qualcomm's most pressing near-term issue. The deal was first announced in October 2016.San Diego-based Qualcomm also risked fallout from its status as a major supplier in China.Qualcomm shares initially rallied but pulled back fractionally as the chip giant likely will go ahead with its hefty NXP takeover.Other semiconductor firms with a big China presence include Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron (MU).Caterpillar has been investing heavily in China as it competes in the world's largest construction- and mining-equipment market.Last year the firm announced a five-year pact with China Energy Investment tied to mining-equipment sales and rentals in the future. It is also hoping to cash in on the country's ""Belt and Road"" initiative. The $1 trillion infrastructure spree builds on old Silk Road trading routes and spans Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Caterpillar stock rose 2.1% to 158.92, hitting its best levels intraday since late February. The Dow Jones stock is working on a consolidation with a buy point of 173.34.The Dow Jones industrial average firm, which makes thin coatings and many other industrial products in addition to Post-its and Scotch tape, made 10% of its sales from China last year.3M stock rose 1.4% to 201.76, but has plunged in recent months, hit by a weak earnings report.The stock also has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 35 and an abysmal relative strength rating of 17.The farm equipment giant has invested significantly in China, and risked a big drop in demand at home from Chinese tariffs and bans of U.S. agricultural products.

China imported $14 billion worth of soybeans from the U.S. last year.Deere stock rose 2% to 158.33. The stock has been building a cup base for the past 13 weeks and is shooting for a 175.36 entry point. Deere shot up 5.75% Friday on its quarterly earnings report.In every trade war there are winners and losers, and steel seemed to be a big winner when the Trump Administration slapped a 25% tariff on imported steel and a 10% tariff on imported aluminum.But the Trump administration has made several exemptions and postponements on those tariffs.

Bond markets have become a focal point for many investors, as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged above 3% on Tuesday. That was the first move above 3% in more than four years. Rising yields occur when bond prices decline. This typically indicates decreased demand for bonds, which isn't generally a negative for the stock market. In fact, when bond prices decrease and yields rise, stocks usually rise as investor capital shifts from one market to the other.Rising yields are a general indicator of the environment of rising rates created by the Federal Reserve's strategy to begin normalizing target interest rates for banks. The Fed began lowering those target rates from a peak of 5.25% in 2006. The target rates remained abnormally low — below 1% — between 2008 and 2017, following the U.S. economic recession. The Fed began hiking its rate target back above 1% in June last year. It has since implemented two subsequent increases. Markets expect three more increases this year.For consumers, rising rates means things like mortgages and credit card debt are more expensive. For companies, it increases the cost to borrow capital. But there are a long list of industries that benefit from rising risk environments, and it is a welcome change for most fixed-income investors.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Is The Bull Market Finally Over?Despite Today's Market, Baozun And Solaredge Technologies Join This IBD Stock ListApple Stock Falls For Fifth Straight Day As Wall Street In 'Full Panic Mode'Google Earnings Raise Questions On Amazon.com Rivalry, SpendingFacebook, Twitter, Boeing, PayPal, Visa Earnings: Action Plan

115,TXN,"Stock futures edged higher early Wednesday morning after Democrat Doug Jones won Alabama's special election Tuesday, reducing the GOP's already-narrow Senate majority. Meanwhile, investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's 2018 outlook and an expected interest-rate hike Wednesday afternoon.X Alabama is normally a deep-red state, but accusations of sexual misconduct involving teens hurt Republican Roy Moore.Tuesday's vote will complicate President Trump's agenda by cutting the GOP Senate majority to just 51-49. However, Jones likely won't take office for a few weeks, giving Republicans some time to pass tax cuts with the current 52-48 split.Details of the evolving GOP tax-cut plan appeared after Tuesday's close. Meanwhile, the Fed is virtually assured of raising rates at 2 p.m. ET, but the question is how many hikes that policymakers will forecast for 2018.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value after briefly falling following the Alabama election results. Dow and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced about 0.15%.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is close to carving out a flat base. But Apple chip plays are not faring as well, with Broadcom (AVGO) undercutting its buy point Tuesday, joining Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Applied Materials (AMAT), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qorvo (QRVO) below the 50-day line as chipmakers continue to slump.The GOP tax plan being hashed out between the House and Senate now has a 21% corporate tax cut, down from the current 35%, but up from prior  plans for 20%. There would be a 37% personal income rate and the mortgage interest deduction would  be capped at $750,000, down from the current $1 million but above the House's $500,000.Apple shares fell 0.6% to 171.70 in Tuesday's stock market trading, but they're still holding support slightly above the 50-day moving average.Apple appears to be headed toward a flat base, which needs a minimum of five weeks. That would occur at the end of this week. This hypothetical bullish consolidation, with a potential buy point of 176.34, would be a base-on-base formation above a prior cup-with-handle pattern.Apple is investing $390 million in Finisar (FNSR) to help the optical components maker revamp a Texas plant to make key iPhone chips. Finisar shot up in premarket trading on Wednesday's news.Apple, a member of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials, has shaken off iPhone X supply concerns.But such worries may be affecting key iPhone-related chip plays, which are also struggling due to general weakness in semiconductors.Broadcom had been one of the stronger Apple chipmakers, holding above its 259.46 buy point for the most part since the late-October breakout, becoming somewhat extended in late November.Broadcom, which is mounting a now-hostile bid for fellow wireless-chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM), reported strong earnings and guidance as well as a big dividend hike last week.Shares popped intraday Dec. 7 on the report, but closed flat. In the last three sessions, shares tested their buy point and 50-day moving average, finally closing below both levels with Tuesday's 0.4% loss to 258.81.Because Broadcom wiped out a 10% gain from its buy point, that entry is now invalid. A strong, high-volume retaking of the 50-day line could present a new buying opportunity.The chip-equipment giant is not a direct Apple supplier, though it's been deemed an iPhone X play for its work with OLED screens.Applied Materials fell 2.2% to 50.47 on Tuesday, continuing to hold below its 50-day moving average.In fact, just one of the 22 largest chip-gear stocks by market cap is current above that key support line, Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC). That's despite the record chip-gear sales in 2017 and 2018 seen by industry group SEMI.Among top chipmakers, Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN) are slightly above their 50-day lines, but not many others are, outside of M&A-related plays.Analog Devices successfully broke out in late September/early October, unlike many other Apple suppliers. Shares rose more than 9% above an 85.81 buy point by Nov. 20. But shares then reversed lower on the company's latest earnings report and soon undercut their 50-day line.In recent sessions, Analog Devices has been holding just above or below the 85.81 entry, which is technically still valid. Shares fell 0.4% to 85.48 on Tuesday.Skyworks broke out in late October and Qorvo in early November, with both rising for a few sessions but then quickly tumbling through their buy points and 50-day lines.Skyworks fell 0.5% to 96.47 on Tuesday, about 18% off its high. Qorvo lost 1.3% to 67.70, hitting a four-month low intraday.RELATED:The Big Picture: This Key Tech Sector Shows Unusual Weakness5 Truck Stocks Set Up Buy Points Despite Tesla Semi: Investing Action PlanBullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?Bullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy Point

He rates AMD stock as neutral with a price target of 15.""In a quarter that had to be near perfect, we were disappointed by Q4 gross margin guidance of just 35%,"" Rolland said in a report. ""We wonder if AMD is perhaps underpricing their GPU (graphics processing unit) products as there are still many 'stock-outs' and as retail channels are pricing many cards over 50% above MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price).""IBD'S TAKE: AMD stock had been forming a cup-with-handle base ahead of its third-quarter financial report.

Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus. But the Dow Jones giant slashed its full-year EPS target. 3M stock plunged.Caterpillar (CAT) reported strong Q1 earnings and sales, but shares of the heavy construction and equipment maker reversed sharply lower Tuesday after warning that operating margins hit a ""high watermark"" for the year.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q1 profit and revenue above estimates. Fifty-two customers now spend over $5 million annually, a metric that is up 108% year over year.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) topped sales and adjusted profit views, but shares tanked as sales of transcatheter heart valve replacements lagged.Illumina (ILMN) beat the consensus. Adjusted profit rose 127% per share as sales swelled 31% to $782 million.Align Technology (ALGN) reported adjusted earnings of $1.17 per share and $436.9 million in revenue, handily beating views for 98 cents and $408 million, respectively.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) delivered impressive Q1 EPS and revenue growth, but fell short of some lofty expectations. Shares fell 4.7% for the week. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) continues to rise after last week's strong results.First Solar (FSLR) hit a six-year high after Q1 earnings topped expectations due to the sale of several solar projects, as it expanded U.S. production.Proofpoint (PFPT), a cybersecurity firm, topped adjusted first-quarter earnings and revenue views, but guided low on Q2 profit.

127,TXN,"The stock market faces several key tests in the coming week. Can the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq reclaim key support. Can Apple (AAPL) stock hold its 200-day? How will chip stocks respond? Will the 10-year Treasury yield top 3%? And is Twitter (TWTR) now a better stock than Facebook (FB) or Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL)?The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all fell below their 50-day moving averages on Friday. Apple stock, the top weighting in all three gauges, tumbled to just above its 200-day line. Several chip warnings set the stage for the stock market and Apple struggles; now Intel (INTC) leads several other big chip names with earnings this week. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield shot up to a four-year high of 2.96%, as inflation and Fed rate hike fears mount up.Those stock market tests are interrelated to a large extent. But there's also a big question. After struggling for years as a company and stock, Twitter has been roaring back over the past 12 months and in 2018 while FANG stocks Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet have lost momentum.The stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, and the major averages did close higher for the week. But the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite came under pressure just as stock breakouts were picking up steam. The 50-day line usually is an important level, but it's loomed especially large over the last several weeks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSince tumbling through its 50-day line on Feb. 5, the S&P 500 has only closed above that level 13 times. The Dow Jones has only been ended above the 50-day in nine sessions since Feb. 5. The Nasdaq was above its 50-day for the most part from mid-February to March 21, but since then it's had just 3 days over that line.The S&P 500 and other major averages rose slightly on the stock market today.After tumbling 2.8% on Thursday, the iPhone maker fell 4.1% on Friday, crashing through its 50-day moving average and closing just above its 200-day line. No question, Apple stock was a major reason for Friday's stock market sell-off.Apple did trade below its 200-day line for a few days in early February as the brief stock market correction bottomed. But aside from that unusual market environment, Apple stock has not traded below its 200-day line since July 2016.Technically, Apple is in a flat base. But its  relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at its lowest levels since mid-February. The RS line hasn't made headway in almost a year.Apple rose a fraction Monday morning.Chip stocks set the stage for Friday's sell-off in the major averages and Apple with gloomy outlooks from a trio of major semiconductor players: Chip-gear makers ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) and contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Taiwan Semi, which makes chips for Apple and many others, cited weak smartphone demand.The iShares Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) ETF dipped below its 50-day on Wednesday, then tumbled Thursday and Friday. The Philly Sox SOXX ETF rose slightly early Monday.While the stock market can rally without chips participating, it's not easy. Chips are a major part of the stock market. And chips are in so many products, from the Apple iPhone to the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3. So if semiconductors are struggling, that's a bad sign for several other big stock market sectors.Intel, Texas Instruments (TXN), MKS Instruments (MKSI) are among the key chip names on tap this week.The 10-year Treasury yield rose sharply last week, especially Wednesday-Friday, closing at a four-year high of 2.96% and contributing to Friday's stock market slide. With oil prices at their highest levels since late 2014 and wage pressures bubbling, inflation and Fed rate hike concerns are growing.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield hit 2.99% and then pared gains to 2.97%.A year ago, this would have been a laughable question. At most, investors might debate whether Twitter or Snap was a better Facebook also-ran.Over the past 12 months, Snap has tumbled 28%. Facebook has climbed 16% and Google-parent Alphabet 25%. Twitter stock has more than doubled, surging 118%. In 2018, Twitter has rallied 33%, while Facebook is down 6% while Google and Snap are up 2% and 4%, respectively.Snap was massively overhyped for its March 2017 IPO. Facebook, struggling with user growth and time on site, is struggling with a data privacy scandal as well as Russian interference. Those Facebook woes have spilled over to Google, while both are facing growing headaches in Europe over competition and privacy concerns.Twitter has gained momentum. In the fourth quarter it crushed adjusted earnings views and reported its first-ever GAAP profit. Always popular with reporters, policy experts and newshounds, Twitter is building on its news niche with more video even as Facebook de-emphasizes news.Alphabet reports earnings late Monday, followed by Twitter early Wednesday and Facebook that evening.Twitter is consolidating just above its 50-day line, but does not yet have a proper base or buy point. Alphabet is working on a double-bottom base, just below its 50-day. Facebook has been moving higher, but is below its 50-day and 200-day lines.Alphabet and Facebook were just above break-even Monday morning, while Twitter rose a fraction.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Futures Signal More Losses; These Big Earnings Are On TapNot Just Apple: The Other Big Reason For Friday's Market Sell-OffThe Big Picture: Coming Week Could Turn Market AroundStocks To Watch: TD Ameritrade, Green Dot Among Stocks Added To IBD 50 ListFacebook, Amazon, Alphabet Lead Tech Earnings Bonanza: Investing Action Plan

128,TXN,"It is quite rare that a new technology transforms the world so significantly that people can't imagine life without it.The internet is one example. Apple's (AAPL) iPhone or Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google might be others.Yet, for those watching closely, it's certainly not a coincidence that early this year, four blockchain ETFs made their entrance into the market. And this trend is not necessarily linked to the hype surrounding digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Experts predict blockchain technology is not only here to stay, but could be a major disrupter in the way companies do business — possibly even larger than the internet.In descending order of asset size, the four ETFs are $178 million Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (BLOK), $124 million Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy (BLCN), $38 million First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process (LEGR) and $13 million Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol (KOIN).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBlockchain is a digital ledger of information stored chronologically in ""blocks"" to allow for the efficient and nearly instantaneous processing and transfer of data. Experts say it could result in huge cost savings and increased profits for companies using it.""We really believe this could be one of the major innovations of the last 20 or 30 years, including the internet; it could be even possibly bigger than the internet was as far as disruption,"" said Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares.A Reality Shares' report states that usage of blockchain is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 61%, and well-known companies including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intuit (INTU) are committed to adopting and developing blockchain technologies. In addition, it notes that there are over 1,200 blockchain startups, with private investment in those reaching nearly $5 billion in 2017, according to various sources.So, how exactly are the companies involved with the technology, and how can investors tell the real players from the fake ones?Ervin says that Reality Shares uses an economic impact score to see what impact blockchain will have on a company's future earnings. For example, even though IBM (IBM) is a huge company with many other projects going on such as artificial intelligence, ""blockchain's one of IBM's biggest initiatives in the entire company,"" he said. ""Their long-term strategic vision is really embracing blockchain and being the go-to provider of it.""Last year, IBM developed a food traceability blockchain platform for Walmart (WMT) to enhance food safety and transparency. It also partnered with Walmart and Chinese retailer JD.com (JD) in a Blockchain Food Safety Alliance collaboration to improve food safety in China. Ten other major food suppliers and retailers have expressed their interest as well.Another large player is Intel, which has developed a chip that allows for transactions to be committed to a shared database. ""If I'm a pharmacy and you get a prescription of Oxycodone, you can't forge it and create two copies of that anymore because it's all based on the blockchain,"" said Ervin. ""They (Intel) think their revenue alone could go up almost 20% just from this new chip that they've built, which will be at the core of all of these blockchain-as-a-service solutions.""Amazon's cloud service AWS is investing in blockchain in health care and life sciences, financial services, supply-chain management, security and compliance. A wide variety of applications have been developed by its AWS partners, including T-Mobile (TMUS), consulting firm PwC, vision specialist VSP Global, Samsung and Deloitte.Because blockchain needs a lot of processing power, chip producers such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are poised to benefit from the development and sale of specialized chips. First Trust's LEGR invests in providers of products and services to enable other firms to employ blockchain technology. Chips and other such providers comprise about 50% of the portfolio.The other 50% is comprised of firms that employ the technology to make their business more efficient, such as CME Group (CME), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Overstock.com (OSTK), said Ryan Issakainen, senior vice president at First Trust Portfolios.The fund will not invest in names that have not shown an actual test case, he adds: ""We don't want to have a company that says they're going to have a new cryptocurrency offering for a certain type of service, but they haven't made investments in it yet."" An example would be Eastman Kodak (KODK).Amplify's BLOK is the only actively managed fund among the four ETFs. Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs, says that this allows the fund to quickly include new names or sell those that are involved in controversies.Besides the big conglomerates involved in blockchain, Magoon says the fund also holds some more pure-play names, such as Japanese IT firm Digital Garage, Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings, and Japanese internet and media firm GMO Internet. GMO operates several cryptocurrency exchanges, offers a wallet service for cryptocurrencies, and a blockchain service to store medical records.""I think what's going to happen for investors is: You could wait (for more of a) pure play or some big announcement happens like 'Canada's government to use blockchain,' but for us, we're trying to be early in the game,"" he said.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Blockchain Expands Beyond Bitcoin To Amazon, Nvidia, AlibabaAI, Robotics, Blockchain Among Hot New ETF Industry TrendsFirst Trust Launches New Blockchain ETF To Meet Demand

131,TXN,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were little changed early Wednesday morning after the major averages hit record highs Tuesday. Apple (AAPL) just closed higher on Tuesday as another analyst warned of sluggish or falling iPhone X demand. Apple's relative strength line, which tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500 index, has slumped to a multimonth low.X Meanwhile, stocks influenced by iPhone demand are faring worse, raising another red flag for Apple. Universal Display (OLED) tumbled below a buy point following a failed breakout by fellow OLED play Coherent (COHR). And iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks (SWKS) continue to trade near recent lows.S&P 500 index futures were essentially flat vs. fair value. Futures for the Dow industrial average rose a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.1%.Apple rose as high as 179.44 in Tuesday's stock market trading, but retreated to close with a 4-cent gain to 177.04 after JPMorgan cited evidence of flagging demand for the iPhone X, the latest bearish analyst prediction for Apple.The stock is still above a recent 176.34 flat-base buy point. But Apple has been sluggish even as the major averages have been surging higher. Apple's RS line is now at the lowest level since the stock's prior breakout on Oct. 27. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) Apple hasn't made much headway vs. the S&P 500 since early May. Investors want to focus on stocks that are truly leading the market.Apple shares fell a fraction in late trading Tuesday.Universal Display makes tech used in creating organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens, used in the iPhone X and a growing number of high-end phones and TVs.The stock cleared a 192.85 buy point on Jan. 8 and rose as high as 209 intraday Friday. But shares have fallen for three straight sessions, tumbling 4.9% to 189.35 on Tuesday in more than double normal volume.Meanwhile, Coherent, which makes lasers used in the OLED production process, skidded 5.4% to 282.59, falling below its 50-day moving average. Coherent jumped on Jan. 17 to close just above a 320.83 buy point, but has sold off since then.When Apple catches a cold, iPhone chipmakers often get sick. Broadcom, Skyworks and Qorvo (QRVO) are all below their 50-day moving averages, with the latter two also below their 200-day lines. Broadcom's RS line is at a nine-month low. The RS lines for Skyworks and Qorvo are at 52-week lows.Texas Instruments (TXN) also supplies some Apple chips, and it's been a highflier, mostly on its prospects in the automotive and Internet of Things markets. But shares tumbled 7% late Tuesday after Texas Instruments failed to beat earnings estimates or lift guidance.

If that trend holds up, it would indicate that institutional investors are selling heavily, at least in the Nasdaq. That hasn't happened much at all since the start of the year. Decliners led gainers by a 7-3 ratio on the Nasdaq and by 8-to-5 on the NYSE.Indexes had been running hot this month, with the Nasdaq rising more than 7% in January.

Shares have struggled to maintain altitude amid iPhone X demand concerns and the relative strength line has declined accordingly.IBD 50 leader Alibaba reclaimed its 191.85 cup-shaped base entry Tuesday and looked to extend its gain Wednesday with a 2.7% advance.

The stock is still well-extended from its most recent base — an 84.34 cup-with-handle entry — and about 9% above its 50-day line where it last found support in early December.Selling off in the wake of the earnings release were a number of leading chip names, like Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT). Lam fell about 1%, as it trades just off a potential 219.80 cup-shaped base buy point. While the relative strength line remains off its old highs, it has been drastically improving over the stock's recent six-day win streak.Applied Materials fell 1.6% and is also shaping a cup-shaped base that has a 60.99 entry.Meanwhile, defense leader General Dynamics (GD) reversed from heavy losses to advance over 3% and breakout after its Q4 revenue came in light vs. estimates.

136,TXN,"Wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday was fined the equivalent of $1.23 billion by the European Union for alleged anticompetitive behavior.The EU's European Commission fined Qualcomm for abusing its market dominance in LTE baseband chip sets. The commission said Qualcomm prevented rivals from competing in the market by making significant payments to a key customer, Apple (AAPL), on condition it not buy from rivals, including Intel (INTC).""Qualcomm illegally shut out rivals from the market for LTE baseband chip sets for over five years, thereby cementing its market dominance,"" Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a written statement. ""Qualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals. These payments were not just reductions in price — they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm's baseband chip sets in all its iPhones and iPads.""Baseband chip sets enable smartphones and tablets to connect to cellular networks for voice and data transmission.Qualcomm's actions are illegal under EU antitrust rules, Vestager said.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Qualcomm says it will appeal the European Commission's decision to the General Court of the European Union.""We are confident this agreement did not violate EU competition rules or adversely affect market competition or European consumers,"" Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement. ""We have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process.""Qualcomm shares slipped 0.5% to close at 67.98 on the stock market today.Texas Instruments stock fell Wednesday after the chipmaker posted its slowest revenue growth in four quarters on softer demand for its chips used in communications equipment.TI shares tumbled 8.5% to close at 109.70 Wednesday.Late Tuesday, TI reported December-quarter earnings that were in line with Wall Street's estimates, with sales slightly above views. It earned an adjusted $1.09 a share, up 24% year over year, on revenue of $3.75 billion, up 10%.""For the first time in several quarters TI delivered merely an in-line quarter and guide, which for investors used to beat-and-raises may set up for a healthy pause (given the 20% plus move since last quarter),"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said in a report. ""The notion that TI can grow the top line at 10%-plus levels organically, as was the case in 2017, is simply untenable. However, 5-7% growth is we think a sweet spot for TI in terms of sales growth given its powerful position in analog/embedded markets where they are gaining dollar share on a secular basis.""Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating on TI stock and upped his price target to 135 from 120.Texas Instruments stock received at least five price target increases on the news, as well as one decrease.Chipmaker Microsemi (MSCC) has been approached about a possible takeover and is exploring its options, Reuters reported.Microsemi has hired investment bank Qatalyst Partners to advise it on the best course of action, a source told Reuters.Aliso Viejo, Calif.-based Microsemi is a major supplier of semiconductors for aerospace, defense, communications and industrial applications.Microsemi stock climbed 1.8% to close at 63.44 on Wednesday.

139,TXN,"ETF investors bet big on technology stocks ahead of earnings reports from marquee names in January. Powered by demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple (AAPL) delivered supersize results on Jan. 31 and saw its shares soar.Technology was the strongest S&P 500 sector in terms of flow of money as the new year got underway, according to Sector SPDRs. Investors last month poured $897.3 million into Technology Select Sector SDPR (XLK), the largest and most active exchange traded fund for exposure to this sector.This marked a significant reversal from 2016, when investors yanked nearly $900 million from XLK for the year, said Dan Dolan of Sector SPDRs. Trading activity in XLK so far this year suggests that ETF investors are ""very bullish"" on the technology sector, in his view.""In addition to the flows, the short positions declined by 27%"" in January, Dolan told IBD via email. ""Earnings have been very good,"" he pointed out, ""for most of the big names.""Those names include Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) — tech stalwarts reinventing themselves for a new cloud-driven, Internet of Things era — as well as chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Texas Instruments (TXN), Microsemi (MSCC), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Outliers included Alphabet (GOOGL) and Qualcomm (QCOM), which delivered mixed results.Tech earnings are tracking higher, at 9.6%, than the 6.6% expected at the start of the Q4 season, according to CFRA Research. And XLK's 4.3% year-to-date gain, vs. 1.8% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), reflects investors's optimism about improving industry fundamentals.While earnings season has put technology companies under a spotlight, the macro outlook is driving interest too.Technology stocks are expected to benefit from the economic strength that tends to go hand-in-hand with periods of rising interest rates.""As business spending picks up, as consumer confidence grows and consumption increases, tech companies will be the beneficiaries of those trends,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA. Other tailwinds include the promise of corporate tax reform and repatriation of foreign cash under President Trump, which disproportionately benefits the tech sector, Rosenbluth pointed out.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted at Tuesday's earnings call that 94% of his company's record $246.1 billion cash pile is stashed abroad. Under a Trump proposal, the iPhone maker could potentially bring home foreign earnings at a special tax rate of 10%, instead of up to 35%. That tax holiday could be one of the single biggest catalysts for the sector going forward, CFRA analysts say.Risks to the sector include the uncertainty surrounding Trump's vision for economic renewal, the crimp that a strengthening dollar could put on global IT spending, and the onslaught of low-cost rivals such as Huawei in key foreign markets.Investors who remain bullish on the sector's outlook have four dozen ETFs to choose from. Many of the new launches make extremely focused bets in extremely small industry niches — 3D printing or Big Data or wearable devices, for example.In Rosenbluth's view, most investors would do well to stick with a technology ETF offering broadly diversified exposure to the sector, and to then layer on thematic ETFs in specific tech industries.Investors have been seeking diversification. Two tech ETFs far outpaced their peers last year by gathering more than $1 billion apiece in fresh assets, and both hold a broad basket of tech stocks. But they take markedly different approaches to investing in the sector.Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of U.S. tech companies, including more small- and microcap stocks than most other broad tech ETFs. It invests $10.75 billion in assets across 366 stocks for an extremely low 0.10% expense ratio.First Trust Nasdaq-100 Tech Sector (QTEC) follows an equal-weighted index of Nasdaq-listed U.S. technology stocks. It has virtually no exposure to small- and microcap stocks, but has a significant midcap stake. At 0.60%, its expense ratio is among the highest in the segment.Investors should be aware that ETFs may sound alike but offer very different exposures, which affects their performance, Rosenbluth says.QTEC rose 25% in 2016, nearly double the gains of its Vanguard peer. It benefited in part from its extreme overweight to the semiconductor industry.Looking ahead, Rosenbluth believes VGT may benefit more than other broad-based peers from an improving U.S. economy, given its larger stake in smaller tech companies.XLK and VGT made a 52-week high on the stock market on Jan. 27.RELATED:High-Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risk7 Best ETFs For Your Growth And Income Needs As Trump Takes The Wheel

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also hit record highs, up 1.9% and 1%, respectively, amid a slew of earnings, including Intel (INTC), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alibaba (BABA) and Boeing (BA).

Sales missed forecasts with customer traffic down 2%. The coffee shop giant, which also cut its revenue outlook, said its mobile order and pay was so popular that it created bottlenecks at order pick up, turning off some patrons. Starbucks shares fell 4% on Friday. Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) topped EPS and sales targets but U.S. comps fell as investors questioned if the momentum from the all-day breakfast menu has run out.

152,TXN,"Investment bank RBC Capital Markets has come out with its top tech stock picks for 2017 and the list includes such big names as Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA).In a research report Thursday, RBC analysts Amit Daryanani and Mitch Steves chose those companies along with Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Texas Instruments (TXN) as their top large-cap stock ideas for 2017 in the tech sector.They also made five small and midcap picks: Amphenol (APH), Analog Devices (ADI), Arris International (ARRS), CDW (CDW) and Microsemi (MSCC).RBC likes Apple because of the potential for an iPhone 8 supercycle of upgrade activity, as well as its growing services business (Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, etc.) and the possible repatriation of foreign profits.It has a price target on Apple of 125. Apple stock rose 0.2% to 116.52 on the stock market today. Apple is building a cup-shaped base with a 118.79 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Among RBC's top 10 tech stock picks for 2017, two are on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks: Nvidia and Microsemi.Chipmaker Broadcom is likely to benefit from deal integration and an improved capital structure, RBC said. Broadcom merged with Avago Technologies in February. It is in the process of acquiring Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD).RBC has a price target on Broadcom of 200. The stock rose 0.74% Friday, to 181.94. Broadcom broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 179.52 on Dec. 9 and is trading within a buy range.Cisco is attractive because of its mix shift away from switching and routing, continued M&A and the potential for repatriation, the analysts said. RBC has a price target on Cisco of 35. It rose 0.23% to 30.53 on Friday.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia offers the ""cleanest secular growth story"" in the group, enjoying tailwinds from virtual reality, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, RBC said. It has a price target of 115 on Nvidia stock, which jumped 2.5% Friday to 109.78, touching an all-time high for the seventh day in the past eight trading days.Chipmaker Texas Instruments is well positioned for gross-margin upside and sales growth acceleration driven by market share gains, RBC said. It has a price target on TI of 80. The stock rose 0.24% Friday, to 74.38.RBC predicts that ""Trumponomics"" will help many tech companies in 2017. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to push for lower corporate tax rates and a tax holiday on repatriating foreign profits parked overseas. Apple and U.S. semiconductor firms would be key beneficiaries, they said.""Trumponomics should drive the narrative for 2017 given widespread implications for our coverage group,"" Daryanani and Steves said. ""Beyond that, we think fundamentals will enable a better revenue and margin narrative for most companies in 2017 with continued focus on M&A.""The iPhone 8 could trigger a supercycle given the aging installed base of iPhones in use, RBC said. The supercycle also should benefit component suppliers such as Broadcom.Chip suppliers also will be aided by the launch of Samsung's Galaxy S8 handset and growing smartphone sales in India, RBC said.Potential headwinds in the New Year for IT companies include a possible U.S.-China trade war, given Trump's rhetoric about imposing tariffs on imports. Political turmoil in Europe is another possible headwind, RBC said. RELATED:Apple Seen Offering iPhone 7S, iPhone 8 Models In 2017Nvidia Nails Record High, Inphi Gets Price-Target Hike

Nvidia tumbled 6.9% on Wednesday, with its biggest point loss and heaviest volume of its powerful run, including a 29% surge in the prior 10 days. That action, triggered by negative comments from short-seller Citron Research, is a big sell signal and suggestive of a climax run.Citron, in its call for Nvidia to fall to 90 next year, cited competitive pressure from Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). AMD slid 2.3% Thursday after losing 4.3% on Wednesday.

155,TXN,"A week ago, semiconductor ETFs were selling off and looking dangerous. But now, they've bounced back impressively.The sector was roiled Dec. 1, with many chip stocks suffering their worst drops in months. The exact cause was unclear. Worries over soft iPhone demand contributed to the selling.The sell-off caused the three chip ETFs in IBD's ETF Leaders screen to fall to their 50-day moving averages, but at that key level shares found support and have been rising. That's a bullish recovery. However, the quick rebounds have left the ETFs largely extended from proper buy areas. Investors must wait for a new pullback or another type of follow-on entry to find another chance to invest.In all three cases, the funds broke out of bases in mid-November and made only modest progress before they got pulled down by the undertow of the Dec. 1 sell-off.SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) made a record high this week. It had broke out past a 53.88 buy point Nov. 17. The fund is primarily a smaller-capitalization vehicle in the chip space, with about 40 stocks averaging about $7 billion in market cap.Its three largest holdings — Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsemi (MSCC) — have produced stupendous returns since November and reached new highs this week. In fact, their advances may be getting overheated.IShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) also is at all-time highs, tracing a chart quite similar to SPDR S&P Semiconductor. The fund tracks the Philadelphia semiconductor index, a well-known sector gauge that often goes by the nickname ""Sox.""It is a more-focused portfolio, with 30 components that form a blend of mid- and large-cap stocks. The fund also has been well-served by owning Nvidia — the largest holding, at 10.6% weighting. But other major holdings, such as Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Qualcomm (QCOM), have had much more sedate price performance the past few months.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) started trading in May 2000, when the tech bubble was bursting. It has yet to reach the record levels that it achieved back then. But today it's acting as well as the other chip ETFs. At 4% above the 50-day moving average, it  is not yet extended.The fund owns about 25 companies in semiconductor production and equipment, with Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) the biggest components, at 14% weighting each.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

The stock closed Friday at 110.06.The sell-off of major consumer tech stocks since the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president has created a buying opportunity for investors, investment bank Piper Jaffray said in a research report Thursday, naming Apple, Facebook, Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX).IBD 50 chip equipment maker Applied Materials is just 1.4% below a 31.17 buy point after Friday's fractional gain. Applied Materials actually rose as high as 31.25 intraday Friday, but settled for a 1-cent gain.

AMD is trying to gain ground in that market as Nvidia (NVDA) already serves Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, Microsoft (MSFT) cloud offering Azure and others. AMD and Nvidia are longtime rivals in graphics chips, which have turned out to have uses in many new fields such as cloud computing, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.Nvidia shares added 2% Thursday afternoon to 93.43, hitting another high intraday as they soar nearly 40% since Nov. 10, when Nvidia announced blowout earnings. Nvidia is greatly extended from any proper buy point and is hitting the upper end of its channel line.

160,TXN,"When financial advisors shop for technology to improve their practice, they often draw two conclusions: It's expensive. And it's complex.But some of the best financial advisor technology tools come at a low cost. Better yet, they're easy to learn and fun to use.Online financial calculators enable advisors to enter client data and get quick results or recommendations. These tools can compute everything from life insurance needs to mortgage payments to required minimum distribution from a tax-deferred savings vehicle such as a 401(k) or IRA.At their best, calculators allow advisors to make reasonable financial projections well into the future. Retirement planning calculators, for example, show clients how much money they might need after they quit working — and whether their current saving and spending plan can advance them toward their goal.The interactive nature of these tools can heighten client engagement in the financial planning process. In examining their retirement plan, individuals can compare their projected savings with their goal and then test different scenarios to see how tweaking the numbers might influence long-term results.Advisors can use calculators to illustrate how certain actions, such as sticking to a budget, can increase a client's financial security for decades. In annual reviews, they can run updated simulations based on a client's recent life events or changes to retirement goals.Anna Sergunina, a certified financial planner in Burlingame, Calif., favors Bankrate.com's mortgage calculator. She uses the free program to estimate a client's monthly amount due, assess affordability and explore the impact of making extra principal payments.""I like it because it's clean and simple,"" she said. ""It helps me show clients how their mortgage can be paid off. We do it together the first time and we have an answer. Then we can revisit it later.""Unlike more elaborate technology platforms and products, online calculators are fairly easy to design. Some advisors build their own calculator and hire a tech-savvy programmer to help develop it.But if you intend to use a calculator created by someone else, do due diligence. Check its validity by researching users' experience and confirming that it performs as promised.Insurance expert John Ryan suggests that advisors consider four factors when evaluating an online calculator, especially those that focus on life insurance and long-term-care insurance.""You want to see if it has any bias built into it, if it's accurate in terms of its needs analysis and conclusions, and what assumptions it uses,"" said Ryan, principal at Ryan Insurance Strategy Consultants in Greenwood Village, Colo. ""Also, how does it capture information? Will a salesperson follow up with you?""Ryan created his own insurance-needs calculators for advisors to use with their clients. Initially, his online tools did not list assumptions that went into the calculations, such as whether one's children would attend public or private schools and the resulting cost differential.""Several years ago, we improved our calculators to explain our assumptions,"" he said. ""It's important for an advisor to know what assumptions are used and whether they are explained and defined.""Like deciding how much life insurance to buy, estimating tax liability or withholdings becomes more manageable with a reliable calculating tool. Some online calculators help advisors with number-crunching exercises such as tax planning.Ray Evans, a certified financial planner in Overland Park, Kan., likes TaxCaster, a free income-tax calculator on the TurboTax website. Evans says it helps him address issues such as computing capital gains tax on a potential stock sale and forecasting how much a client will owe in taxes. He uses other calculators to guide clients' decisions on whether to refinance a mortgage or buy or lease a car.Despite the ever-growing number of online calculators, some advisors opt for offline resources. Patrick Dougherty, a Dallas-based certified financial planner, covets a handheld financial calculator called the BAII Plus, made by Texas Instruments (TXN).""I find it so intuitive and easy to use,"" he said. ""It's actually easier than using a computer. I know it sounds old school, but clients appreciate how I can answer their questions really quickly"" on everything from mortgage amortization to calculating the rate of return on a real estate investment over many years.Dougherty teaches financial planning courses to students interested in becoming advisors. He urges them to get acquainted with the BAII Plus and even use it during their test to earn the certified financial planner certification. He adds that it's one of the few devices that they're allowed to have during the exam.

163,TXN,"Tech names Alibaba (BABA), Facebook (FB), Best Buy (BBY), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Broadcom (AVGO) lead your stocks to watch this week, with the Chinese e-commerce giant and social media leader providing buying opportunities and the rest nearing buy points.Alibaba, a member of IBD's Leaderboard, entered a follow-on buy zone after finding support at its 50-day moving average near the 100 price level, marking the first buying opportunity since its August breakout.Fellow Leaderboard member Domino's Pizza (DPZ) recently presented a similar buy zone with a bounce from the 50-day before zooming higher on earnings.Facebook, another Leaderboard member, is trading back in buy range from an entry at 128.43 after finding support at its 50-day line. The stock topped its all-time high of 131.98 and closed Friday just a penny below a secondary buy point of 132.08.Ahead of the holiday shopping season, big-box consumer-electronics retailer Best Buy is 2% below a 40.31 buy point as it works on the handle of a cup-with-handle base.Texas Instruments found support at the 50-day line and is 3.8% below a potential buy point at 72.68, ahead of its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Chip peer Broadcom also got support at its 50-day and is 3.7% below a 179.52 buy point.

164,TXN,"Stocks remained mildly in the red at lunchtime on Monday. Big-cap techs showed mixed action, but Tesla Motors (TSLA) was showing decisively negative action again.The EV maker fell more than 2% to 192.29, taking out a recent August low of 193.45. The stock is now 29% below a 52-week high of 269.34.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials all sank 0.1% or less. Volume in New York was running at a slower pace vs. the same time Friday, despite Bank of America's (BAC) surprise rise in Q3 earnings to 41 cents a share, up 8%. The Street was looking for 34 cents, or a 10.5% decline vs. a year ago.Bank of America initially rallied more than 1% but backtracked to a 0.5% loss in fast turnover. The stock is near a 16.34 buy point within a long bottoming-style cup with handle pattern. BofA's Relative Price Strength Rating is not shabby at 75, meaning it's now outperforming 75% of all companies in IBD's database.Meanwhile, among top-performing big caps, Texas Instruments (TXN) rallied nearly 0.6% to 68.88. The chipmaker has formed a nearly three-month-old flat base with a 72.68 buy point. Texas is in the IBD Big Cap 20, which has as many as 15 companies that showed double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, bucking the slow gains in the U.S. economy.Texas is part of the market-leading semiconductor manufacturing industry group, which ranks 12th out of 197 IBD industry groups in 12-month relative price-weighted performance.Tesla is pushing back its new product announcement from Monday to Wednesday after CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet that the company needed time for ""refinement,"" without getting more specific.The stock had gotten a nice boost in mid-September to early October thanks to better than expected deliveries for Q3, giving investors confidence in Tesla making its full-year goals. But the stock's rebound stopped short of rebounding back above its 50- and 200-day moving averages — a key ingredient in developing a new base and potential breakout to new highs.As seen in a daily chart at Investors.com, Tesla's RS line (seen in blue), which compares a stock's price change vs. the S&P 500, has been falling again in the past two weeks.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Hasbro (HAS) leapt 7% to 81.72, rebounding back above its 50- and 200-day moving averages simultaneously in heavy volume.The toy maker, which makes a variety of Star Wars-themed games, devices and action figures, announced a 28% jump in third-quarter earnings to $2.03 a share, sharply beating the $1.74 consensus estimate. That marked the fifth quarter of profit growth and followed robust gains of 81% and 24% in the prior two quarters. Sales grew 14% to $1.68 billion, accelerating from a 10% increase in Q2.On average, sales have now grown 13% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. In Q2, growth in the U.S.-Canada region of 16% exceeded the international region's 13% increase, which includes currency factors.The stock has been constructing a long flat base since its peak of 88.53 on April 19. The weak 22 RS Rating, according to IBD Stock Checkup, reflects the stock's sideways movement since late July. Watch to see if this rating can improve; also, a continued rally into the 85-87 price area would give the stock a shot at a breakout.RELATED:Musk: Tesla Delays 'Unexpected' Product News To Wednesday For 'Refinement'Do You Know How To Identify The Bottoming Base?Seek Speedy Cheetahs Among Big Cap Stocks In This Slowpoke EconomyThank You, Walt Disney: Hasbro Reports A Solid Third Quarter

167,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN) could be a surprise candidate to step in and acquire NXP Semiconductor (NXPI), a move that would leave Qualcomm (QCOM) in the dust, says Nomura.""It almost seems inevitable that NXP will be acquired,"" wrote Nomura analyst Romit Shah in a research note Tuesday. Dow Jones last week was first to report that Qualcomm is looking to acquire NXP for about $30 billion.Like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments is one of the top 10 chip companies worldwide. TI specializes in analog chips and embedded processors. NXP makes high-performance mixed-signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications, and its shares quintupled 2012-2014 before slowing in the past 16 months.""Most investors expect Qualcomm to win the process,"" Shah wrote. ""While we don't disagree, we also see Texas Instruments as a dark horse that hasn't been seriously thought of and could rush past the field in triumph.""Shah says Texas Instruments is overdue to make a big acquisition, having made 33 over the past 20 years but none in the past five years.Buying NXP would boost Texas Instruments' microcontroller market share to No. 1 from No. 7. NXP is the leading supplier of non-automotive microcontroller units and second in industrial and automotive application processors, says Shah. Also, NXP would lift Texas Instruments from the fourth-largest to the second-largest non-memory semiconductor company by revenue, Shah wrote.Moreover, NXP CEO Rick Clemmer and Chairman Peter Bonfield are former TI employees, says Shah.""We believe that Clemmer maintains close ties with the TI management team, while Bonfield has spoken publicly about his affection for Texas Instruments,"" Shah wrote.NXP stock closed at 103.23, up a fraction, in the stock market today. Shares jumped 17% on Thursday, on reports of Qualcomm's interest, and have risen another seven percentage points since then. Texas Instruments slipped a fraction Tuesday, to 69.59.IBD'S TAKE: Big mergers often come with big challenges, and many never pan out. For an example of huge deal that so far is working out, look no further than the latest IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks. Broadcom, a product of a merger completed early this year between Broadcom and Avago, resides at No. 36. More than that, Broadcom also is among IBD's Sector Leaders.Assuming NXP gets acquired, it would be part of a wave of consolidation occurring in the chip sector.RELATED:NXP Hires Adviser To Field Offers As Qualcomm CirclesTexas Instruments, Inphi, Yum Lead Wednesday Investing Action Plan

168,TXN,"With chipmakers the No. 2 sector in IBD's tables, three semiconductor ETFs have earned spots in the ETF Leaders screen.All three ETFs are tracing similar chart patterns: After strong gains from July breakouts, they are pausing at the 50-day moving average. A rise from the line would provide ETF traders with a chance to buy shares. While tactically there's a buy opportunity, keep in mind that these ETFs have already made a big jump -- up 18% to 28% this year. Thus, investors have a difficult decision on whether to use one of these ETFs to gain exposure to the hot sector.VanEck Vector Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) bulk up on the industry titans. Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) are among the largest holdings of both funds.Those stocks have made moderate to solid gains this year, and are no doubt largely responsible for the ETFs' advance. But Nvidia (NVDA), another top holding of the funds, has had a superlative 2016, more than doubling since a breakout in mid-March. Best known for graphics chips, Nvidia is now a big player is the technology to design self-driving cars.The iShares Semiconductor ETF mimics the Philadelphia semiconductor index, or SOX as it's best known. It has 30 companies, which include the industry heavyweights.SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) ETF has a markedly different composition than the other two. That may explain why the ETF has lagged the other two. It's up 18% year to date (through Thursday's close), while VanEck Semiconductors has climbed nearly 28% and iShares Semiconductors 23%.The major components of SPDR S&P Semiconductor aren't all big-capitalization stocks, but also include small-caps and midcaps such as Synaptics (SYNA) (market cap of $2.4 billion), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) ($3.4 billion) and solar-power module maker First Solar (FSLR) ($4.3 billion).SPDR S&P Semiconductor tracks an index of chip companies selected mainly for their revenue but also earnings, market capitalization and ""market perception,"" as the prospectus says.IBD's chip sector is up about 17% this year, thanks in part to higher-than-expected demand for the new Apple iPhone 7, increasing use of electronics in the home (the Internet of Things) and chips in cars. Even with the flop of the Samsung Note 7, the chip sector has been one of 2016's winners. Broadcom and Qualcomm are suppliers to iPhone and Samsung smartphones.The information technology sector continues to lead with the most positive earnings guidance. For Q3, that includes eight of 15 S&P 500 companies in semiconductor and chip equipment, according to a Sept. 28 report by FactSet.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

171,TXN,"Seattle-based Impinj (PI), a provider of inventory-tracking technology using radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, has been a hot stock since its initial public offering this summer.Impinj went public on July 21 at 14 and climbed as high as 37.86 on Sept. 14. But shares tumbled 6.2% to close at 32.13 on the stock market today, even though Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson late Sunday reiterated his overweight rating on Impinj stock and raised his price target to 36 from 29.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market's newest companies are where you find some of the biggest winning stocks. Check out IBD's IPO Leaders stock list for a proprietary screen of recent IPOs with strong fundamental and technical traits.""After hosting PI's management team for investor meetings last week, we came away incrementally more confident in its competitive moat, near-term inventory levels and the likely critical need for its software,"" Erickson said in his research report.Impinj is a player in the Internet of Things (IoT). It sells systems that use RAIN RFID to track items for retail, pharmaceutical, health care, food and beverage, manufacturing and other industries. RAIN RFID is a wireless technology standard for connecting items to the internet, enabling businesses to identify, locate and check the status of each item. RAIN is an acronym derived from radio frequency identification.The biggest concerns related to Impinj are commoditization and product differentiation, Erickson said.""We came away more confident that attributes like read range, patented chip design and antenna tuning have led to its 65% market share,"" he said.Larger companies such as Texas Instruments (TXN) and Microchip (MCHP)-owned Atmel have tried their hand at UHF RFID and failed, so Impinj's technology likely solves more challenging problems than many investors realize, he said.RELATED:Impinj Soars To New High As First Earnings Since IPO Connects

172,TXN,"Scanning IBD DataTables for income ideas was a lot easier earlier this year.Even the IBD 50, the premier list of strength in the stock market, was littered with stocks sporting healthy dividends, especially from the utilities and real estate investment trusts (REITs).Contrast that to today, when a screen of utilities leaders only yielded a couple names as of Wednesday's close, both of them breaking support levels. A screen of REIT leaders offers a dozen names but only one is above its 50-day moving average and none has a Relative Price Strength Rating above 80.The Dividend Leaders screen, however, does have a few ideas of interest. Particularly, noteworthy are a couple chip stocks, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM).Qualcomm is still a dominant force in the mobile-phone market with its chip designs in mobile products of Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and now Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Pixel. While, no one is expecting Qualcomm to ""party like its 1999"" when it ran up over 2,000%, it still offers an attractive dividend with the potential for capital appreciation.Granted, Qualcomm doesn't have the triple-digit earnings growth it had in its youth. In fact, prior to its 17% growth for its fiscal Q3 in 2016, the company saw four consecutive quarters of profit declines. Qualcomm is scheduled to report its fourth quarter, ended in September, on Nov. 2 after the close.March 2016 saw a completion of a one-year commitment to repurchase $10 billion in stock and the quarterly dividend was raised to 53 cents earlier this year. That was the 15th dividend increase since 2003, putting the annualized yield at 3.2%.The most recent news on Qualcomm is the rumors of a potential acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). NXP makes high-performance mixed signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications. An acquisition of NXP offers more diversity for Qualcomm beyond the heavy reliance on mobile. Particularly interesting is the exposure to the auto-related chips, a fast-growing field.Meanwhile, Maxim is noteworthy for the current base its carving out. The stock is working on a base-on-base structure with its current flat base showing support right on top of the cup with handle formed earlier. The stock is currently trying to get back above its 50-day moving average, closing right at the line on Thursday.Maxim is a chipmaker specializing in integrated circuits for autos, cloud data centers, industrial and mobile applications. It has an annualized dividend yield of 3.3%. The company is reporting Q1 fiscal 2017 earnings on Oct. 20.Earlier this year, Maxim was also in the takeover buzz as a possible acquisition by Texas Instruments (TXN).The chart might seem like a real bore since there have actually been multiple bases formed at this point that haven't seemed able to launch. However, that action is not without precedent.Before Qualcomm's huge run in 1999, it also had multiple bases that didn't go anywhere, until it formed a near-perfect cup with handle that launched the stock for good. Of course, that was a different time with not only Qualcomm's earnings growth acting as a catalyst but also a strong market providing a powerful tailwind.RELATED:NXP Hires Advisor To Field Offers As Qualcomm CirclesQualcomm Gets More Upbeat Reviews on NXP Semi Merger RumorWhere Are Chipmakers In The Cycle

The maker of Monster Rehab and other drink brands is set to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 8, with analysts expecting 21% EPS growth. Note that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports.DowDuPont received the biggest investment of any stock on the list, as 73 funds purchased $16.7 billion worth of shares. But that number is skewed by the merger of Dow Chemical Co. and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. that was just completed in September to create the new entity. The chemical giant's market cap stands at just over $88 billion, and the stock has eased back into the buy zone after become extended from a breakout in September.Forty-two funds invested just over $1.7 billion in leading chip stock Intel, which broke out on Oct. 2, then soared over 7% on Oct. 27 after reporting third-quarter earnings. Intel is now about 22% above the initial buy point.UnitedHealth (UNH) was the only other company to join the billion-dollar club, with 67 funds investing $1.2 billion.  The megacap managed-care stock has continued to climb since a breakout in March 2016, clearly boosted by seven quarters of rising fund ownership.Semiconductor stocks like IBD 50 members Applied Materials and Lam Research (LRCX) have been on a tear since the beginning of 2016, but it's a cyclical industry, so investors should be ready to lock in gains if the stocks begin to show topping action.In addition to Applied Materials, Lam Research, IBD Big Cap 20 stock Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel, six more semiconductor-related companies made this month's list, a sign that institutional investors are continuing to put their chips on the table, so to speak. Time will tell if, in the short term, that turns out to be a good bet.Applied Materials is 19% above its recent 47.69 buy point in a later-stage cup with handle, putting just below a potential profit-taking zone. Lam Research is already in the 20% - 25% profit-taking area.Banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and automaker General Motors (GM) topped the list of new sells this month. JPMorgan showed 42 net sellers (89 selling minus 47 buying), while GM had 29 (43 selling, 14 buying).Megacap medical stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) came in third, with 24 net sellers (68 selling, 44 buying).Despite the selling, Johnson & Johnson is still within buy range after retaking a 137.18 entry on Oct. 17 after reporting a 13% rise in Q3 earnings.JPMorgan has continued to climb beyond a 95.32 buy point, but after reporting earnings on Oct. 24, General Motors has been giving back a chunk of the 25%-plus gains it made from a breakout in September.

With Apple up 2.6% to an all-time high Friday, shares are now extended from the 5% buy range.After a wild session Thursday, Broadcom is trading back above a 259.46 buy point initially cleared on Oct. 30. Friday's 5.4% gain puts shares at an all time high, with Broadcom just above the 5% buy range.Broadcom said Thursday morning that October-quarter revenue will be at the higher end of its range. On Friday, shares rallied on Apple's earnings as well as a report that Broadcom may make a bid for wireless chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM), which has been feuding with Apple and many countries around the world over its licensing agreements. Qualcomm leapt 13% to 61.81 Friday, its best level since January.Skyworks Solutions cleared a cup buy point of 110.71 on Oct. 30, and holding within its buy zone. Skyworks, which issues its quarterly results on Monday, seems to be hitting some resistance around the 114 price level.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is on a hot streak.

But it should benefit from the use of OLED screens by Apple (in the Phone X) and other top manufacturers.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments is extended 16% from a cup-with-handle buy point of 84.34. The stock has been on a steady climb since clearing that level in heavy volume on Sept. 15.Qorvo tried to clear a 76.57 buy point from a sloppy cup-with-handle base this past week, but never closed above that level.

185,TXN,"The proliferation of semiconductors in electric vehicles is creating a big market opportunity for numerous suppliers, a Wall Street analyst said Thursday.X The report by Nomura analyst Romit Shah says the average semiconductor content per electric vehicle is about $924, more than triple what is in standard internal combustion gas-powered automobiles, based on data from STMicroelectronics (STM).Shah projects the category of alternative electric vehicles will grow to 53 million units by 2030, up from 3.4 million units in 2017, implying a compound annual growth rate of 23%.""This is significantly higher than the overall automotive compound annual growth rate, which our Nomura colleagues estimate to be 2.2% over the same time frame,"" Shah wrote. ""We believe that there are a number of major shifts in transportation technology that will expand the demand for automotive semiconductors by orders of magnitude.""Some of the companies set to benefit from the growth in auto electronics include NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as STMicroelectronics and Analog Devices (ADI).Among recent events about these companies, NXP on Friday announced new chip products for radar applications in automated driving. Analog Devices received at least six price-target increases to its stock after delivering a beat-and-raise quarterly report on Nov. 22.In addition, Texas Instruments is currently trading near a record high, while STMicroelectronics is forming a base with a 24.90 buy point as it gets set to report quarterly earnings on Jan. 24.Shah said he spent his summer at electric-car company Tesla (TSLA), where he also spent significant time analyzing the supply chain for alternative energy vehicles. The category includes hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, such as Tesla, which is in the process of rolling out its mass-market Model 3.He expects advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous driving, and powertrain electrification to be the biggest drivers of chip content. His report focused on the electrification of the powertrain, which is the primary piece of an electric vehicle, housing the batteries and other technologies that provide the power for vehicle performance.IBD'S TAKE: Never has the chip sector been more competitive, with more than 750 companies vying globally to build the insides of the next hot device or power future megacomputers.

191,TXN,"In a strong market, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) would be looking very attractive. The search giant's stock is close to a potential buy point, consolidating near record highs.In the current shaky market, investors should be cautious about making any purchases. But you should always be looking for quality stocks forming sound consolidations.Among those bullish patterns is the flat base, where leading stocks can catch their breath for several weeks before trying to make a new advance. Flat bases are common now given the market's subdued, sideways action until the last week or so.Alphabet leads four top-rated stocks that are in flat bases. All four -- the others are Nvidia (NVDA), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Equifax (EFX) -- have found support at or near the 50-day moving average recently.IBD'S TAKE: The flat base is a sideways pattern, with a smaller decline than in other patterns. It can be of short duration (minimum five weeks) and often forms after a breakout from a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base. Here's a quick explainer on how to identify a proper flat base.Alphabet is a fairly typical example of a flat base. The stock broke out of a double-bottom base with a 753.58 entry in late July. Shares peaked at 813.88 on Aug. 11, then began consolidating in a sideways.

199,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and 6 Pluses are dying of ""Touch Disease,"" an ailment resulting from the phones' thin frame -- also known as the 2015 ""Bendgate"" scandal -- rendering two touch chips unusable, according to repair expert iFixit.Touch Disease first manifests as a flickering gray banner across the top of the screen. Later, it causes glitches in a phone's touch function, and eventually, the phone stops responding to touch. That's a big deal when unlocking the screen requires touch.Repair shops see hundreds of Touch Disease-afflicted iPhones a month, says iFixit. Apple Geniuses -- support staff at the Genius desks at Apple stores -- reportedly acknowledge the problem but can't perform the hardware fix, according to complaints on Apple's forum.The problem seems to be structural. In 2015, Apple strengthened weak points in the iPhone 6 frame to resolve Bendgate -- the phones' penchant for molding to a user's backside while in his or her pocket.Still, the iPhone 6 is highly bendable. Through regular use, the solder beneath two touch chips tends to crack, says iFixit. When those chips lose contact with the logic board, touch functionality goes out the window.Flexing the phone allows the chips to regain contact, but it's a temporary fix. Apple will replace the iPhone 6 while still in warranty, but outside that can only recommend buying a new phone at full price or a third-party repair, iFixit says.Apple didn't immediately return a request for comment.IFixit identifies the touch chips as U2402 Meson and Cumulus U2401, but doesn't note the suppliers. In an earlier teardown, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN) were seen to supply a touch controller and a touch transmitter, respectively.Apple closed down 0.75% to 108.03 in the stock market today, but is forming a handle in a 4-month consolidation. Broadcom lost 1.15% to 175.30, a day after hitting a record high. Texas Instruments dipped 0.1% to 69.90.IBD'S TAKE: Apple has been rallying since hitting a two-year low in May. The iPhone maker is a long way from its all-time highs and the company is set to report its third straight quarter of falling earnings and revenue, but shares are near a buy point.

203,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S demand improved in July, but a shift to the lower-end iPhone SE could pressure Apple's component suppliers such as Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Synaptics (SYNA), Pacific Crest analysts said Friday.Meanwhile, Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom (AVGO) and InvenSense (INVN) will withstand a looming 15%-20% cut on iPhone 7 component orders, but not because of any changes in Apple trends.In July, carriers had six days of iPhone 6S inventory on hand, dropping from a year-high of nine days in April, the investment bank said in a research note. Meanwhile, iPhone SE demand normalized, rising from north of one day in May and June to six days in July.Pacific Crest targets six to 10 days of on-hand inventory for carriers. Inventory rocketed early in the year, as Apple experienced its first dip in iPhone sales.""Carrier store inventory declined month over month to the low end of our target,"" Pacific Crest analysts wrote in a research report. ""We view this as encouraging ahead of the iPhone 7 launch in September.""But that launch, expected next month, comes with a muted forecast. Pacific Crest sees component orders declining 15%-20% for the iPhone 7 vs. its predecessor iPhone 6S in 2015.Many chipmakers, including Apple suppliers Analog Devices, InvenSense, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN), during their most recent earnings calls, predicted slower year-over-year demand for their consumer/mobile units.""We're not expecting ... any outlandish unit growth in the mobile market,"" Cirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode said on the company's fiscal Q1 earnings conference call on July 27. ""We've got something of a content story this year.""IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom ranks No. 1 in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. The group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 65 only 13 weeks ago. Get IBD's Stock Checkup to examine individual chipmakers.Pacific Crest maintained sector weight ratings on Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, Skyworks Solutions and Synaptics. The likely transition to digital headsets is already baked into Cirrus Logic stock, and the more conservative iPhone 7 cycle will offset content gains for Qorvo, analysts wrote.Synaptics, on the other hand, is poised for share loss at Apple, Pacific Crest predicted. Synaptics supplies a touch-chip for Apple iPhones, but that could be at risk as Apple reportedly makes the move to OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screens in 2017.OLED technology allow for thinner and more flexible screens, but they are also double the cost of LCD (liquid crystal diode) screens, which Apple uses now. The switch will likely add $30 to $35 to the total bill of materials for the iPhone 8, analysts say.""We believe there could be risk that Apple looks to squeeze its other component suppliers on price in order to recoup the incremental BOM associated with the OLED display,"" the Pacific Crest analysts wrote.In the meantime, Apple suppliers such as Analog Devices, Broadcom and InvenSense stand to outperform, Pacific Crest said. It has overweight ratings on all three stocks.Broadcom is positioned to benefit from the carrier aggregation trend as more infrastructure is built to support 4G and LTE, says Pacific Crest. Analog Devices recently announced its $14.8 billion plan to acquire Linear Technology (LLTC), a move that cuts its Apple exposure. InvenSense is gaining on augmented reality trends such as with the mobile game ""Pokemon Go,"" they said.On the stock market today, Analog Devices rose 0.4% and Synaptics 0.2%.

204,TXN,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) is making a grab for NXP Semiconductors' (NXPI) piece of the autonomous-driving market, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said Wednesday after Nvidia unveiled the guts of its self-driving engine.On Monday, Nvidia revealed its Parker mobile processor, which the company said is 50%-100% more powerful than other mobile processors. Two Parker chips and two Pascal graphics processing units (GPUs) run the Drive PX 2 system for self-driving.Nvidia beat NXP to the market with its Drive PX 2 platform launch in January. But NXP has the largest share of any single player on the market, at 14.2%, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics, Gill wrote in a research report Wednesday.Infineon, Renesas (potentially attempting to acquire automotive-chip firm Intersil (ISIL)), STMicroelectronics (STM), Texas Instruments (TXN), Robert Bosch, ON Semiconductor (ON), Micron Technology (MU) and Toshiba each have 10% or less of the market, he said.The remaining 39% of the $27.4 billion global advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) market is made up of players with less than 1%. That's likely where Nvidia lands. But Nvidia won't stay there for long, Gill predicts.""Capitalizing on the trend toward connective self-driving cars, Nvidia is well positioned to gain not only market share, but also increase its (average sales prices) as autonomous applications should command a higher premium than infotainment computing,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Mobileye, too, is shoring up its autonomous-driving offerings by partnering with Delphi, the company said Tuesday. The duo plans to release a Level 4/5 automated driving system to integrate into vehicles in 2019.Parker chips are scalable and can be used to host infotainment, digital instrument clusters and ADAS platforms. Drive PX 2 synthesizes information from sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle information, high-definition mapping and algorithmic processing.Together, that's enough for Level 5 automation, which can run a vehicle without any human intervention. The market is largely focused on Level 2 and 3 automation, which can handle adaptive cruise control and parking assistance, among other functions.But tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have big dreams for full automation. During the recent Intel (INTC) Developer Forum in San Francisco, the No. 1 chipmaker delved deeper into its partnership with BMW (BMWYY) and Mobileye (MBLY) for autonomous driving.In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, Nvidia stock was down a fraction, above 62.50, but its shares have soared more than 75% the past three months, and it's an IBD 50 stock.

206,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN) outplayed Apple (AAPL) iPhone weakness on strong automotive growth in Q2, prodding its shares to a 16-year high early Tuesday. But analysts were leery about Q3, even with the iPhone 7 expected to be released Sept. 16.Analog chip sales rose 9% sequentially, but they declined 0.2% vs. last year's Q2, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer noted in a research report. But without Apple, he said, analog sales would have grown 4% on a year-over-year basis.Still, ""Texas Instruments should be viewed as a positive barometer for the industry... emblematic of the early stages of an upturn despite continued investor concerns related to the macro,"" Pitzer wrote.Texas Instruments stock rocketed 7.85% to 71.42 on the stock market today. Early gains to 72.58 touched a 16-year high achieved in July 2000.IBD'S TAKE: Texas Instruments shares are about 17% extended from a 60.09 entry point touched June 28 out of a flat base. Investors are typically advised to take profits at 20%. Broadcom stock is about 2% from a 166 entry point. Cirrus Logic stock is about 8% extended from a 38.24 buy point.For Q2, Texas Instruments reported $3.27 billion in sales and 76 cents earnings per share, up 1% and 17%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics topped the consensus of 33 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $3.2 billion and 72 cents.Embedded processing sales grew 9% vs. last year and 4% sequentially. The automotive end-market was strongest in Q2, led by infotainment. Personal electronics grew sequentially but declined year over year, led by a dip in mobile phones.Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell expects personal electronics to topple again in Q3, even as Apple's iPhone 7 ramps.For Q3, Texas Instruments guided to $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion in sales and 81-91 cents EPS, up 1% and 13%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier period. On the low end, the guidance topped analysts' views for $3.34 billion and 81 cents, McConnell noted in a report.McConnell rates Texas Instruments stock at sector weight. Pitzer boosted his price target on Texas Instruments stock to 77 from 65, but kept his neutral rating.

207,TXN,"Analog Devices' (ADI) $14.8 billion acquisition of longtime rival Linear Technology (LLTC) will cut its Apple (AAPL) exposure to 5%, Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach said Wednesday.The deal also could spur more consolidation in the semiconductor industry, says Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer. Last year, chip sector M&A hit a fever pitch as deals topped $100 billion, including Intel's $16.7 billion Altera buy and Broadcom's $37 billion merger with Avago Technologies.""With structurally slowing supply, rising barriers to entry, consolidation and a mix shift in end demand away from consumer, we continue to see scarcity value in semiconductor IP and assets and except M&A to continue to be a prevalent theme,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report.Hettenbach places Analog Devices among the company of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Broadcom (AVGO) and Microchip Technology (MCHP) as ""playing acquirers who can deliver above average (earnings per share) due to synergies.""But unlike most recent chip M&A, Analog Devices' move to acquire Linear is largely a technology play, he says.Analog Devices leads the data converter market with 40%-50% share, double that of closest rival Texas Instruments (TXN), though that company will remain much larger than the combined Analog Devices-Linear.Linear, meanwhile, is No. 3 in power management chips.""One of the long-standing knocks on Analog Devices was its lack of power management presence, the fastest-growing segment within analog,"" Hettenbach wrote in a report. ""But the Linear deal would clearly change this.""IBD'S TAKE: Analog Devices stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 60, meaning it performs in the top half of stocks in terms of key metrics. But it trails Linear stock, which has a CR of 79. Texas Instruments stock, though, leads the group with a CR of 96.Together, Analog Devices and Linear are expected to bring in $5 billion in annual sales, nearly 11% of the total $45.7 billion analog-chip market, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Tore Svanberg wrote in a report. The companies see $150 million in cost savings from their merger.Hettenbach expects those savings to yield $4.45 EPS ex items in 2018. Rosenblatt analyst Kinngai Chan sees $5 EPS ex items by the end of 2020.The acquisition cuts Analog Devices' Apple exposure by a third, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer wrote in a report. Schafer downgraded Analog Devices in December on its growing exposure to ""the inherent volatility"" associated with Apple.The Linear deal trims Analog Devices' consumer segment to 12% of sales, Schafer says.Non-consumer end markets industrial, automotive and communications have been key to Analog Devices' economic recovery over the past five years, Stifel Nicolaus' Svanberg said.After the acquisition closes, expected in mid-2017, those segments will comprise 82% of total sales, Credit Suisse's Pitzer said.Morgan Stanley's Hettenbach upgraded Analog Devices stock to overweight and boosted his price target to 78 from 56.Svanberg rates Analog Devices stock a buy, and he upped his price target to 78 from 68. Oppenheimer's Schafer has an outperform rating and 80 price target on Analog Devices stock.At the close on the stock market today, Analog Devices shares ended the day up 0.7% to close at 63.33.

212,TXN,"SoftBank's (SFTBY) announcement late Sunday of its $32 billion deal to acquire Apple (AAPL) iPhone component supplier ARM Holdings (ARMH) could stoke further M&A activity, with top-five chipmakers -- Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO) -- cited as potential acquirers.Any company with a $10 billion to $15 billion market capitalization is on the table, says S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino. Companies valued around $5 billion are in the ""sweet spot."" Recent rumors have targeted Xilinx (XLNX), which is valued above $12 billion.Marvell Technology (MRVL), Cavium (CAVM), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) also fit the bill for possible acquisitions, Zino told IBD.Of IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, five names top $15 billion in market valuation: Qualcomm, Broadcom, ARM, Nvidia (NVDA) and NXP.At the close on the stock market today, ARM stock catapulted 40.6% to 66.17 and at an all-time high. That helped pull the IBD Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group up 2%, hitting a 13-month high. Meanwhile, Apple gained 1.1% to 99.88. Qualcomm, which reports earnings later this week, also added 1.1%, and ended the day at 55.35. Broadcom advanced 0.7% to 162.33. Intel, which has struggled to enter the low-power microprocessor market dominated by ARM, ticked down 2 cents to 35.05.IBD'S TAKE: The Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry ranks No. 24 out of 197 groups tracked and includes leaders like Nvidia, the group's No. 1-ranked Monolithic Power Systems, Silicon Motion Technology, Broadcom and MaxLinear. All five have Composite Ratings of 99, meaning they perform in the top 1% of all stocks in key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.""Intel and Qualcomm are sitting on a hoard of cash, and both have concerns with regards to growth,"" Zino said. ""Broadcom, formerly Avago, has done a phenomenal job with acquisitions over the last three years. They're at a point now where they're looking to increase their war chest over the next 12 to 18 months.""Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay puts Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), Cavium and GoPro (GPRO) supplier Ambarella (AMBA) on his potential takeover list, but says he doesn't see ARM as a target. U.K.-based ARM treats its licensees with a very ""vendor neutral approach"" and wasn't bandied on the typical rumor mill.""After last night's news, I wouldn't put anything (in M&A) past anybody,"" Ramsay told IBD. ""I don't think anything is off the table. Bigger companies buying differentiated tech is not off the table.""What's newer is companies doing more financial-engineering-type mergers, where it's a merger of equals to protect earnings growth and cash flow growth.""But 2016 M&A won't resemble the frenzy of 2015 chip-sector deals, when the value of M&As rocketed above $115 billion. In 2015, companies were buying innovation. Such was the case when Intel spent $16.7 billion to acquire field-programmable gate array (FPGA) maker Altera. This year, companies will be buying earnings leverage.""The semiconductor space has seen a dramatic slowdown in growth, and there's going to be a move by larger players to generate growth and earnings leverage via acquisitions,"" Ramsay said. ""You've got fairly healthy balance sheets across the sector here, and because of that, you're going to see more M&A.""Zino added: ""But in terms of dollar amount, you're not going to see what you saw in 2015 again.""Smartphone growth slowed to 10% in 2015 from 29% in 2014, Zino said. That's tugged at the bottom line for Apple iPhone suppliers like Qualcomm and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), which analysts expect to report a respective fifth and sixth quarter of decline later this week.This year, Zino expects smartphones to decelerate to 5%-6% growth. Canaccord's Ramsay is less bullish -- he views flat growth for 2016. For 2017, though, Apple's iPhone 8 ""super cycle"" could lend itself to 5% growth, Ramsay told IBD. And niche sectors like video, gaming and automotive will continue to growth.On the latter point, the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January used to be all about smartphones, but automotive and self-driving efforts by Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) have pressed chipmakers into a new role, Ramsay says, noting, ""Now, there's a car in every booth.""

214,TXN,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp and ""less bad"" PC sales will lead to an in-line second quarter for chipmakers, but Brexit-fostered macro worries could play out in October-quarter earnings, Credit Suisse and MKM analysts said Friday.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer's top picks include Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC), Analog Devices (ADI), Lam Research (LRCX), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX).""Importantly, (the second half of 2016) should be up 2.5% year over year after four quarters of year-over-year declines,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report. But overall he expects 2016 chip sales will be flat vs. earlier expectations for 3.8% growth.IBD's TAKE: IBD's 33-company Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group is currently No. 48 out of 197 groups tracked, having made big moves over the last eight weeks from No. 169. It's led by ASML in market value, but KLA-Tencor tops the group in terms of Composite Rating. KLA has a CR of 92, meaning it outperforms 92% of all stocks in key metrics.Apple iPhone suppliers -- including Broadcom and Analog Devices -- could benefit from a ""lackluster iPhone 7 cycle"" still likely to grow 55%-60% from 80 million units shipped in the first half of the year.""Overall, handsets (are) better,"" he wrote. ""Slowing Samsung Galaxy S7 and weak high-end China (are) offset by mid- to low-end iPhone 7 builds.""More PC-oriented Intel and Microchip could benefit from marginal improvements in shipments, Pitzer wrote. During Q2, units declined 4.5% vs. last year, but topped the four-quarter average of a 12% decline. Still, expectations for PC builds to fall 8% this year would be conservative.Industrial trends improved modestly over the last 90 days, but appear seasonally weaker in the second half of 2016 -- likely impacting Lam. Lam, which is trying to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), competes against ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) in the chip gear-making sector.Mellanox, on the other hand, could benefit in the second-half on infrastructure improvements by Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Mellanox's products are used to connect servers, provide storage and tie hyper-converged infrastructure -- a necessity for major cloud operations.The real risk is in Q3, when the effect of the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union are likely to play out, Pitzer says. Global stock markets toppled on the Brexit vote and Q3 expectations that are already above seasonal quarter-over-quarter growth leave plenty of room for disappointment.MKM analyst Ian Ing sees the Brexit effect slugging Xilinx (XLNX), Texas Instruments (TXN), Intersil (ISIL), ON  Semiconductor (ON) and Analog Devices -- which have high distribution-channel sales ""which are a proxy for European and industrial market exposure.""Xilinx and Texas Instruments derive about 60% of their sales through the channel, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Intersil, ON and Analog Devices take in more than half of their revenue from distribution.""Industrial markets which are served by distributors are expected to have seasonally weaker second half of demand compounded by perceived Brexit risk and uncertainty,"" Ing wrote in a report. ""Q3 and Q4 are expected to be down seasonally and likely further exacerbated by customers' Brexit uncertainties.""The most obvious effect is in currency adjustments. Following the vote, the British pound fell 9.3% vs. the U.S. dollar to its lowest point in decades. The euro fell 1.6%. That could result in some inventory destocking followed by customers scrutinizing order run rates, Ing predicts.Competitively, U.S. semiconductors have a small advantage post-Brexit.""U.K. semiconductor markets were already soft before the Brexit event,"" Ing wrote. ""Longer term, we think Brexit has some offsetting impacts on U.K. semiconductor design and activity.""

215,TXN,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (TSM) Q2 sales are expected to inch up as Apple (AAPL) prepares to introduce its iPhone 7 -- expected in September and likely to lead to a blowout Q3 for TSM, according to analysts polled by FactSet.For Q2, analysts model TSM pulling in $6.79 billion in sales, up 2% vs. last year, and 41 cents earnings per American Depositary Receipt ex items, down 18% on a year-over-year basis. The company is slated to post Q2 earnings early Thursday, the kickoff to tech's Q2 earnings season that gets into gear next week.Wall Street's model is in line with TSM's earlier guidance for 215 billion to 218 billion Taiwan dollars, about $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion at today's exchange rate.But Q3 will be key. Samsung and TSM have been locked in a long battle to win the contract to manufacture Apple's processors. But according to several reports, Samsung stepped out of the A10 processor race, which analysts say could lead to record sales for TSM.Q3 sales expectations for $7.75 billion would be up 16% year over year. Analysts also project TSM to report 55 cents earnings per ADR minus items, which would be up 20% vs. last year and reverse four quarters of declines.TSM's U.S. stock ended down 0.3% at 26.89 on the stock market today. But shares have been in a buy zone for four days with an entry point at 26.68 reached on July 8. TSM stock hit an all-time high at 27.37 on Monday.TSM has an IBD Composite Rating of 74, meaning it outperforms nearly three-quarters of its rivals in terms of sales growth and earnings power.

Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qualcomm (QCOM) stocks followed, down a respective 2.2%, 2.3% and 2%.McConnell downgraded Cirrus Logic and Skyworks stocks to sector weight. He cut his price target on Broadcom to 180 from 185, on Analog Devices to 60 from 62, and on Qualcomm to 59 from 61.Cirrus Logic will benefit from Apple's transition to digital headsets, and Skyworks is likely to gain 10%-15% radio frequency content in the iPhone 7, but ""we ultimately don't believe this will be enough to offset a 15%-20% decline in iPhone 7 shipments,"" McConnell wrote in a research note, comparing it with the iPhone 6S.He has a 40 price target on Cirrus Logic stock and a 90 price target on Skyworks stock.Slowing iPhone sales will similarly slug InvenSense (INVN), Qorvo (QRVO), Synaptics (SYNA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), McConnell wrote, also cutting his estimates on these companies. Qualcomm will continue to struggle to re-sign Chinese licensees under new agreements, he said.But No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC), which will reportedly supply a third of the Apple iPhone 7 modems, got a price target boost to 37 from 35 on better-than-seasonal notebook forecasts for Q3, up 7%-10% sequentially vs. typical 6% growth, he said.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) garnered higher estimates on its July GeForce 1060 launch date to compete with rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

He estimates that all three are 75% tied to the smartphone market, unlike radio-frequency chip competitor Broadcom (AVGO), which is 22% exposed.Also, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani cut his price targets and estimates for chipmakers Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), noting the likelihood of stalled IT spending, and industrial and automotive demand in the wake of Brexit.On the stock market today, Qorvo stock fell 1.4% and Qualcomm 1.1%. Broadcom, Skyworks and Texas Instruments were down 0.8%, 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively, while Analog Devices dipped 1 cent to 56.63 and Intel 0.15% to 32.75. Apple rose 0.3%.""While the iPhone 7 is ramping and our checks indicate (China smartphone maker) Huawei is comfortable with its 2016 outlook, the demand uncertainty combined with a seasonally weaker Samsung/China handset market makes for a challenging second half of the year,"" Rakesh wrote.That will impact Qorvo, Qualcomm and Skyworks to a greater degree than Broadcom, he wrote. Since merging with the former Avago, Broadcom has reduced its smartphone exposure, which had accounted for half of its revenue. That lower exposure will be key amid slowing smartphone sales.Rakesh suggested Skyworks tackle M&A again after its failed attempt to buy PMC-Sierra. He cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 68 from 99, but he said the company, a key Huawei supplier, could see strength as that company ramps its newest flagship.Meanwhile, he says, Intel's likelihood of taking 30% of the iPhone 7 mix will boost Qorvo ""given its legacy relationship"" in making chips compatible with Intel chips. And Qorvo will enjoy gains on better-than-expected strength in the Samsung Galaxy S7. Rakesh kept his 55 price target on Qorvo stock.RBC's Daryanani, in his separate report, said Apple likely accounts for 10% of revenue for Texas Instruments and Analog Devices. He cut his price target on Texas Instruments to 66 from 68, and cut his PT on Analog Devices to 63 from 65, to reflect Brexit's impact. But he kept an outperform rating on both stocks.""This could offset some softness in other markets,"" he wrote. ""While it is early to access any sizable impact from Brexit, we think it is prudent to adjust expectations for Europe.""Gartner estimates that global enterprise IT spending will rise 1.2% in 2016 vs. its earlier views for 1.6% growth, Daryanani pointed out, but in the U.K., IT spending will decline 1.5% vs. prior expectations for 1.7% growth. Europe's spending is expected to dive ""modestly.""In automotive chips, RBC sees North American production as flat and European production declining 1.4% in 2017 vs. earlier projections for 2% and 2.9% growth, Daryanani wrote.Texas Instruments' automotive sales have grown at an 11% four-year compound annual growth rate, while Analog Devices has had a 14% five-year CAGR. For both, investors should now expect single-digit growth, Daryanani wrote.

220,TXN,"Applied Materials (AMAT) is capable of sourcing 100 million Apple (AAPL) iPhone screens amid its OLED push, a UBS analyst said Thursday as chipmakers Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) got sell ratings from Goldman Sachs on their Apple exposure.Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari initiated coverage of Analog Devices stock with a sell rating, noting the company's 10% Apple exposure, but is neutral on shares of 20%-Samsung-exposed Maxim Integrated Devices (MXIM). Sell-rated Texas Instruments is 30% exposed to consumer sales, Hari said.Investors have ""punished"" analog chipmakers with high mobile exposure, Hari wrote in a research report, as sales of iPhones and other smartphones slow. To that point, Analog Devices stock is in a 253-day period of consolidation, trailing Texas Instruments stock which is now 3% extended beyond its 291-day consolidation period.""The opportunity to take on Apple business is hard for analog companies to turn down given relatively high margins and incremental revenue opportunities, (but) investors have been critical of such moves and we do not expect this trend to reverse in the near future,"" he wrote.Margin expansion, not sales growth, drives analog outperformance, Hari wrote. Texas Instruments has aggressively reduced costs, but Maxim still has some ""juice to squeeze"" and Analog Devices' gross and operating margins have stagnated since 2010, he says.Among chip stocks, Hari prefers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), radio-frequency suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), and ""growth stock"" Nvidia (NVDA), a Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner. The four buy-rated stocks have weathered volatile consumer sales better than analog chipmakers, he says.Hari boosted his price target on Applied Materials stock to 27 from 25 and kept his buy rating, noting the company's OLED (organic light-emitting diode) and 3D Nand (flash memory) push and Chinese business could drive earnings per share minus items to $1.81 and $2.10 in calendar years 2016 and 2017. For its fiscal 2015 ended Oct. 25, Applied reported EPS minus items of $1.19.UBS analyst Stephen Chin sees Applied Materials bolstering its EPS by 80 cents annually, assuming the TV market, like the smartphone market, also adopts OLED screens. OLED screens are thinner and more flexible than other display screens, and is expected to be a feature in Apple's iPhone 8, expected to be released in the fall of 2017. So far, Apple uses OLEDs on just one product, the Apple Watch.Chin has a buy rating and 28.50 price target on Applied Materials stock.In total, Applied Materials could pump out 33 million OLED screens for the iPhone each month, Chin estimates.""We estimate Applied can generate incremental EPS of 15 cents next year just from selling its OLED equipment to Apple iPhone,"" Chin wrote in a report. ""We estimate this base case OLED EPS impact from smartphones is sustainable for a few years as more customers possibly adopt OLED screens.""Applied Materials stock finished 0.5% higher on the stock market today. Analog Devices stock dipped 0.65%.

221,TXN,"Broadcom (AVGO) stock rocketed late Thursday after its first post-merger earnings report, topping Wall Street's earnings view by 15 cents and edging revenue views despite Apple's (AAPL) first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales.In after-hours trading, Broadcom stock was up more than 6% following its fiscal Q2 earnings release. Shares rose a fraction in Thursday's regular session, to 154.91, and are up 6% for the year.For its Q2 ended May 1, Broadcom reported $3.56 billion in sales minus items and $2.53 earnings per share ex items, up 117% and 19%, respectively, vs. last year, and leading the consensus estimate of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $3.55 billion and $2.38.Current-quarter guidance for $3.75 billion in sales ex items, plus or minus $75 million, would be up 114% on a year-over-year basis, topping analysts' model for $3.71 billion. The non-GAAP guidance includes $10 million in licensing revenue.The quarter was Broadcom's first reporting combined Broadcom and Avago metrics, while the year-earlier figures were for Avago only. The former Avago bought Broadcom for $37 billion, a deal that closed on Feb. 1, keeping the Broadcom name and Avago's ticker. Now, analysts say Broadcom could deleverage and seek more M&A.Broadcom competes against fellow Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) to provide radio-frequency chips for smartphones, including the iPhone.A UBS analyst was bullish earlier Thursday on RF names vs. analog names like Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), both also Apple suppliers who've seen investors pull back because of the companies' consumer exposure.
"
222,TXN,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's pledge to make 1 million electric cars by 2020 could be a boon for chipmakers clobbered by the first decline in sales of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone, a major hit product that fueled growth for many Apple suppliers since 2007.Now, hunger for the next growth vector has many chipmakers eyeing the automotive and Internet of Things markets, even as smartphones will remain a key profit center for some semiconductor companies.""I view the IoT market as a massive opportunity, and the autonomous vehicle is a part of that,"" Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher told IBD. ""Over time, this market will experience widespread adoption. Simply, the promise of greater productivity will drive demand over the long run.""The deck is always reshuffled every few years and always to the most innovative technology. We think the IoT is the next battleground.""Kreher expects the IoT industry overall, including automotive, to grow 10% to 15% annually in the next three years.Sensor makers like Analog Devices (ADI), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Texas Instruments (TXN); analog chipmakers like MaxLinear (MXL) and Maxim Integrated Devices (MXIM); and graphics-chip companies like Nvidia (NVDA) are among those seen as especially primed in these fields.But not everyone is as hot on the Internet of Things. Robert Maire, president of tech research and consulting firm Semiconductor Advisers, calls today's cars ""PCs on wheels"" and ""smartphones on steroids,"" but he says other IoT fields typically use cheaper chips than the higher-end chips powering smartphones.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) CEO David Aldrich said in April that the IoT opportunity is ""measured in the tens of billions of units,"" but Maire says that doesn't mean huge revenue growth.""It won't be the Internet of Things (replacing smartphones), because Internet of Things is based on typically trailing-edge semiconductor technology,"" Maire told IBD. ""About $5 worth of semiconductors go into an Internet-connected thermostat that sells for $75-$100.""The Qualcomm (QCOM) chip content alone in Apple's iPhone 6 has been estimated at $20 to $22 per unit by teardown specialist iFixit.But companies such as Qualcomm and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) are looking beyond the smartphone era to a future dominated by smarter cities, smarter devices and smarter cars -- and are eagerly watching efforts by tech heavyweights Tesla, Apple and Google (GOOGL) to make it happen.Still, estimating the size of the IoT chip market is like a game of pin the tail on the donkey. The numbers are high but cover a lot of ground.Last year, research firm McKinsey pegged revenue for the total IoT market at $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion a year by 2025. At the highest end, that means IoT could account for more than 10% of the total world economy.In April, Business Insider estimated there will be 24 billion IoT-connected devices by 2020. More than $6 trillion will be invested in IoT solutions over the next five years, the online news site's Business Intelligence research unit estimates.Many of Apple's chip suppliers want a bite of IoT, but not all. Broadcom (AVGO) in April sold its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) for $550 million. The unit generated just $189 million in revenue in the past 12 months, 3% of Broadcom's total sales.Broadcom declined to comment on the IoT unit's sale or on slowing smartphone sales. In its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, Broadcom reported that its wireless business (which includes smartphone sales) pulled in $578 million in sales, about a third of total revenue. MKM analyst Ian Ing estimates 10% of Broadcom's mobile sales stem from smartphone-saturated China.Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks, Broadcom's rival makers of the radio-frequency chips that go inside smartphones, are buying into the IoT market -- Qorvo doing so literally with its April acquisition of IoT supplier GreenPeak. GreenPeak makes ultra-low-power, short-range wireless chips for smart homes.The acquisition should help Qorvo diversify. Qorvo didn't return requests for comment about slowing smartphone sales. For its fiscal Q4 ended April 2, Qorvo's mobile product sales accounted for $465 million, or about 76%, of total revenue.As for Skyworks, its integrated mobile systems and power amplifiers segments accounted for 73% of its total sales last quarter. Apple's iPhone 6S uses two Skyworks power amplifier modules, teardowns show.But Skyworks' broad markets division, which includes IoT-related sales, grew 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and made up 25% of sales, Aldrich said on the company's earnings conference call in April. He estimated the IoT opportunity growing at an 83% compound annual growth rate through 2020.Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy supplier Integrated Device Technology acknowledges the smartphone slowdown but says its future is in wireless charging. IDT's chips are used inside portable devices to enable wireless charging, which will become ever more important as Apple reportedly prepares to eliminate wired charging entirely from the iPhone 8 in 2017.IDT is about 17% exposed to the mobile market, CTO Sailesh Chittipeddi told IBD.Smartphones have reached a saturation point. But not every piece of accompanying technology has peaked, Chittipeddi said. RF suppliers Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks also say that while unit shipments might stagnate, dollar content will grow. In January, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said RF content has grown 20%-plus every year regardless the number of units shipped.Qualcomm -- doubly exposed through its chip sales and licensing business -- is also bullish on continued growth of its smartphone business. The breadth of technology on a smartphone will only continue to grow, CEO Steven Mollenkopf told analysts during the company's February analyst day.""The smartphone ecosystem is going to continue to grow, as wireless charging penetration of that market continues to increase,"" Chittipeddi told IBD. ""People still sell over 1.2 billion smartphones per year and not every one of them today has wireless charging.""And there are other demands for wireless charging. In March, IDT hosted a Hackster challenge, instructing participants to come up with new uses for wireless charging. Er Bharath Ram came up with an on-the-go coffee maker, beating out oddities like a tiny remote-controlled tank, a ""magic toothbrush"" and shoes for Alzheimer's sufferers.""Furniture, automotive applications, headsets, warmers, drones ... will provide growth,"" Chittipeddi said, though he concedes not as much growth as a new, high-volume smartphone.Last year, IDT expanded into sensors with the $310 million acquisition of ZMDI, Chittipeddi said. IDT plans to leverage that sensor business within the burgeoning automotive and infotainment market competing against NXP Semiconductors.About the same time IDT wrapped its ZMDI acquisition, NXP finished up its nearly $13 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductors. NXP now boasts a $28.5 billion market cap to IDT's $2.7 billion. NXP CEO Rick Clemmer estimates 40% of his company's sales stem from the automotive segment.Clemmer says NXP spotted the smartphone's deceleration well ahead of time. Although, like Chittipeddi, he still sees growth for specialized smartphone tech. NXP chips are used to encrypt mobile payments for systems like Apple Pay, Samsung Wallet or Google Wallet.""Maybe 15% to 20% of smartphones have mobile wallets (and) we think that can go up to 60%,"" he said. ""We see a tripling of our volume because of the increased share that has the mobile wallet technology.""Buying Freescale helped de-emphasize mobile. In Q1, NXP's $471 million in secure connected devices (mobile) accounted for 21% of sales. But Clemmer says that exposure, on average, is about 15%. It also allowed the combined company to become the top automotive chip player, he says.NXP is also working with Tesla, Google, Apple and  Ford (F) as they work to develop self-driving cars, Clemmer says, another key push for NXP.That automotive opportunity will be huge, says Nvidia's director of automotive, Danny Shapiro. In April, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang unveiled a trio of autonomous cars code-named BB8, C3PO and R2D2 -- a riff on the popular ""Star Wars"" franchise.Like NXP, Nvidia has developed an autonomous-driving platform for carmakers. Unlike NXP, Nvidia only briefly dabbled in smartphones for which graphics only need to be ""good enough,"" Shapiro told IBD. Nvidia, he says, is angling for the bleeding edge of tech.So, no smartphone chips from Nvidia. ""There's no value there for us,"" Shapiro said. But ""I believe the car will be the most powerful computer you will ever own. ... We've moved beyond the graphics in your vehicles to being able to process the data. And for that, you need a supercomputer.""

223,TXN,"Chinese Huawei's P9 is a ""new dog with old iPhone tricks,"" beating Apple (AAPL) to the smooth-backed punch, but including the usual chip suspects -- Broadcom (AVGO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN).But the iFixit teardown of the P9 smartphone did little for Broadcom stock was down a fraction in late-afternoon trading Friday, while NXP and Skyworks were both up a fraction. Texas Instruments stock, however, was up 1% on the stock market today.The Huawei P9 looks familiar, iFixit wrote, wondering, ""just how far did Huawei go to imitate, and perhaps surpass, the iPhone?"" IFixit notes the Huawei P9 camera is embedded within the body -- as opposed to the bump in the iPhone 6S.Apple suppliers fill the inside of the Huawei P9, but their functions can vary from the iPhone 6S. Samsung supplies both -- but it has a flash-memory chip inside the P9 as opposed to a RAM (random access memory) offering within the 6S, says iFixit.Huawei tapped SK Hynix for its RAM. Apple used Toshiba for its 6S flash memory.Texas Instruments supplied a fast-charging chip for the Huawei P9 vs. a power-management chip for the Apple 6S. And Huawei's audio codec by HiSilicon is mirrored by Cirrus Logic's (CRUS) chip inside the Apple flagship.Broadcom provides two chips for Huawei as opposed to a single chip for Apple. NXP, a single chip for the P9 and two chips for the 6S. The Huawei phone has three Skyworks chips vs. two Skyworks power amplifiers within the iPhone 6S.Huawei's and Apple's flagship phones both scored a 7 out of 10 on iFixit's scale of repairability.

224,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN) joined NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) late Wednesday, weathering an Apple (AAPL) iPhone shipment dip by bolstering embedded-processing sales to top Wall Street's first-quarter expectations.On Thursday, at least eight analysts boosted their price targets on Texas Instruments stock. On the stock market today, Texas Instruments shares were up a fraction intraday. The stock has been on a run since Jan. 15, climbing 25% after a two-week fall.NXP and Cirrus Logic stocks split the difference in Thursday trading, up 0.2% and down 2.1%, respectively. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) were up 1.6% and 0.3%, respectively, after Apple reported its first ever year-over-year iPhone shipment decline late Tuesday.For the first quarter, Texas Instruments reported $3.01 billion in sales and 65 cents earnings per share, down 5% and up 7%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures topped the consensus of 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.98 billion and 62 cents.Analog sales -- which includes power management chips used in the iPhone 6S -- declined 8% year over year to $1.88 billion. The drop was expected MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a research report. Apple comprised 15% of Texas Instruments' 2015 sales.""While the year-over-year shortfall in smartphones was $150 million, the inclusion of (a) weak PC (segment) results in an even greater shortfall,” he wrote in a research report. ""The year-over-year revenue gap is expected to decline somewhat in June, but still be significant.""Embedded-processing revenue grew 8% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $729 million in sales. Sales of custom integrated circuits drove a 10% year-over-year decline in Texas Instruments' other sales.Texas Instruments' current-quarter guidance for $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in sales and 67 cents to 77 cents EPS would be flat and down 1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. But that outlook topped analyst views for $3.18 billion and 71 cents at the midpoints.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer noted that Texas Instruments is ""consistently executing on consistent execution."" He boosted his price target on Texas Instruments stock to 65 from 60, but reiterated his neutral rating.During Q1, Texas Instruments hit a record 60.6% gross margin. Pitzer and RBC analyst Amit Daryanani expect that to continue, driven by better manufacturing gains, improved mix and impressive execution.Daryanani upped his price target on Texas Instruments stock to 68 from 65, but kept his outperform rating.

225,TXN,"Sony (SNE) PlayStation 4 chip supplier Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) topped Wall Street's Q1 expectations after the close Monday and issued current-quarter sales guidance that beat the consensus at the midpoint.Monolithic Power stock rose 1.75% in Monday's regular session to 63.51, and was flat in after-hours trading. Shares are even for the year, but have recovered from an 8% dip through mid-February. Monolithic stock broke out of a cup-with-handle based last month at 65.36, so it's down nearly 3% from the buy point.For Q1, Monolithic Power reported $84.5 million in sales and 45 cents earnings per share minus items, up 15% and 22%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.IBD Take: Monolithic Power gets great ratings of late, as you can see from IBD Stock Checkup.Both measures topped the consensus of eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $83 million and 44 cents per share, and the midpoint of Monolithic Power's earlier sales view for $81 million to $85 million.Current-quarter sales guidance for $91 million to $95 million would be up 12%-17% and beat analysts' model for $91.5 million at the midpoint.Monolithic Power stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, out of a best-possible 99, trailing Nvidia (NVDA), Silicon Motion Tech (SIMO) and Maxlinear (MXL). Its chips are used in Sony's PlayStation 4, Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox One and Blu-ray/DVD players.It competes against tech majors like Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Qualcomm (QCOM), all Apple (AAPL) suppliers.

226,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) late Monday reported first-quarter earnings that fell a little less than estimates, a day before Apple itself is expected to report declining profit and a sharp drop in iPhone sales. NXP Semi gave guidance that was in line to slightly above forecasts.Earnings per share fell nearly 16% to $1.14 a share excluding various items vs. $1.35 a year earlier. Revenue, fueled by acquisitions, climbed about 52% to $2.224 billion from $1.467 billion a year earlier. Economists had expected EPS of $1.09 and sales of $2.21 billion.Comparable revenue fell 11% vs. a year earlier, NXP said, citing ""semiconductor industry weakness that accelerated throughout the second half of 2015.""For Q2, NXP Semiconductors sees revenue of $2.295 billion to $2.395 billion, with the midpoint at $2.345 billion. It expects EPS of $1.30-$1.40, with the midpoint at $1.35.Analysts expected EPS of $1.32 and revenue of $2.34 billion.NXP Semiconductors is a leading chip supplier for the Apple iPhone and Samsung smartphones. But it's also a major supplier of chips for the auto industry, especially after its recent acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor.Auto-related chip sales hit $805 million, up 167% vs. a year earlier on a reported basis, or just 1% with Freescale's year-earlier results included. But auto-related sales should rise in the ""mid- to high-single digit"" percentages in Q2, NXP said in its Tuesday morning conference call.NXP is aiming for a long-term gross profit margin of 51%-55 and an operating margin above 30%. In Q1, NXP's gross profit was 26.8% on a GAAP basis and 50% non-GAAP.

228,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) stock tumbled to its lowest level in nearly two years on Thursday, following a report that Asian component suppliers are seeing weak orders related to the upcoming iPhone 7.Japanese business publication Nikkei Asian Review reported Thursday that Taiwan-based tech suppliers expect to get significantly fewer orders from Apple in the second half of this year compared with the year-earlier period. They cited the ""ongoing slump in demand for premium smartphones and a lack of groundbreaking features for the upcoming iPhone 7.""Nikkei Asian Review this week also reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) expects its iPhone chip shipments for the June-to-December period will be about 70% to 80% of the level reached in the second half of 2015.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said the market overreacted to the Nikkei report.The prediction that iPhone builds would be down 20% to 30% in the second half of the year vs. the same period in 2015 was expected and already should have been baked into the stock’s price.“While the news is clearly disappointing, it was already largely included in our iPhone unit estimates,” he said in a report Thursday.Elsewhere, Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group said its first-quarter net profit fell 9.2% from a year earlier, as it was hit by a slowdown in iPhone sales, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Foxconn is Apple’s main iPhone assembler.Apple stock fell 2.4%, to 90.32, on the stock market today, and fell as low as 89.47. TSM stock fell 1%, to 22.99.IBD's Take: How healthy is Apple's stock and how does it stand up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup.Other Apple chip suppliers also fell Thursday, including InvenSense (INVN), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Apple stock has risen in only four of the last 20 trading sessions. Since hitting its 2016 high of 112.39 on April 14, Apple stock has fallen about 20%.Most of the decline happened after the Cupertino, Calif.-based company reported March-quarter results and gave June-quarter guidance on April 26. For its fiscal Q2, Apple posted its first year-over-year sales decline since 2003 and its first-ever drop in iPhone unit sales. For the current Q3, Apple is targeting sales of $42 billion, down 15% from the same period last year.Demand for Apple's latest handsets, the iPhone 6S series, has been relatively weak, and hopes for a return to unit sales growth have shifted to the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September.The iPhone 7 is predicted to feature a slimmer design, a speedier processor and a better camera. It also might be waterproof for the first time, according to tech news reports. But it is expected to look pretty much like the current models, with tweaks like the lack of an audio headset jack.RELATED:Apple Stock Gets Price-Target Cut On Longer iPhone Upgrade Cycle.

229,TXN,"HTC Vive pummels Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus Rift in terms of memory, but both tapped Apple (AAPL) supplier Texas Instruments (TXN) to lead their virtual reality headsets, teardowns from iFixit show.On Tuesday, iFixit unveiled its ""Vive-section,"" gutting HTC's VR device to discover four Texas Instruments chips, including a variant on the 16-channel LED driver discovered inside the Rift.But the devices diverge largely on memory. Micron Technology (MU) supplies four Vive chips accounting for 72 megabits of flash memory vs. a single Winbond 64-MB chip supplying memory for the Rift.Vive and Rift both employ STMicroelectronics (STM) for an ARM-based microcontroller, and the former added in an STM transceiver for speed data transmission. Both also use a Toshiba converter.C-Media supplied an audio controller for the Vive, whereas Oculus tapped Apple supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS) for the Rift audio codec. HTC chose InvenSense (INVN) for its two gyroscope/accelerometer combos, vs. a Bosch Sensortec inertial sensor inside the Rift.HTC also added three NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) microcontrollers and a Broadcom (AVGO) Bluetooth smart system-on-a-chip. Nordic Semiconductor provided Bluetooth for the Rift.After broadly falling 1.3% Monday on Wall Street, IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group was up nearly 2% in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Micron stock was up more than 9.5%, after rival SK Hynix reported Q1 sales and earnings that fell sequentially and year over year in a tough DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) PC environment.NXP stock was up 4.5% after topping Q1 earnings views late Tuesday and ahead of Apple's fiscal Q2 report late Tuesday. On Monday, NXP stock fell 1.2% on after an iFixit teardown showed Apple included Intel (INTC) and Broadcom inside its Retina MacBook 2016, but not NXP.Shares of fellow Apple suppliers InvenSense, Cirrus Logic and Broadcom were up a respective 4.5%, 2% and 1.5%.STMicroelectronics stock was up nearly 3%, and Texas Instruments stock was up a fraction.

230,TXN,"Amazon.com (AMZN) tapped Texas Instruments (TXN) to lead its ""hockey-puck-sized"" Echo Dot Alexa-infused speaker, and incorporated Apple (AAPL) suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) in its portable Tap stereo, iFixit teardowns show.But the teardowns did little to help chipmakers Thursday on Wall Street. Chip stocks were broadly down in afternoon trading on the stock market today, in conjunction with fractional dips for the major indexes.Texas Instruments won five chips -- including a digital media processor -- inside the Echo Dot, but that total was skimmed down from eight chips inside the larger Echo. Also, Samsung succeeded SanDisk (SNDK) as the flash memory supplier.Echo Dot also features a DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) chip from Micron Technology (MU), apparently replacing a Samsung RAM chip in the Echo. Qualcomm (QCOM) re-won the Bluetooth function from the Echo.The smaller Echo Dot earned a six out of a best-possible 10 in its repairability rating, dropping from seven in the earlier Echo iteration.Amazon's Tap won a seven out of 10. It's Amazon's first Alexa-equipped portable speaker vs. the Echo Dot and Echo, according to iFixit.Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) topped the Tap with two chips -- an audio codec and a power management chip. Texas Instruments supplied an amplifier. Apple suppliers Broadcom and NXP won a chip apiece -- WiFi/Bluetooth and an applications processor, respectively.The device is powered by a lithium-ion cell, such as those used in Tesla Motors (TSLA) vehicles, iFixit notes. It provides for nine hours of music playback, according to Amazon, vs. the iPhone 6S Plus, which has ""a battery with a similar output for a radically different job.""

231,TXN,"What does it take to survive in a top job in a competitive, bottom-line industry? Win, baby! Long term.Larry Puglia has been at the helm of $30.7 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) since mid-1993 and has been sole manager since May 1997.In that span, the fund has racked up a 9.97% average annual gain through April 29 vs. 9.02% for the S&P 500, says Morningstar Inc.Over the past three and five years through April 29, his fund's performance tops 94% and 97% of its direct rivals, respectively.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large-caps.Puglia is himself among the tops in sheer longevity. He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests.IBD: What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry?Puglia: We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Categories' PerformanceWe paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like Amazon (AMZN) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis.IBD: What does ""Blue Chip"" in your fund's name say about your overall approach?Puglia: As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon ""worsified,"" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries.Home Depot (HD) is important to us, but so is Lowe's (LOW). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed.IBD: You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions?Puglia: We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and O'Reilly (ORLY) over a decade and Facebook (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by Roche (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth.IBD: Is Ross Stores (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters?Puglia: Historically, Ross and TJX Cos. (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy?Puglia: This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with Visa (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as Uber and Airbnb).IBD: Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become?Puglia: In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS’ margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that.IBD: Are you bothered by Broadcom's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth?Puglia: The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like Texas Instruments (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago).IBD: O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like?Puglia: They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise.AutoZone (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same.IBD: Does Constellation Brands' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions?Puglia: The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow.IBD: Some people love to doubt Facebook (FB). You like the stock, right?Puglia: Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18.IBD: Can Alaska Air (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the Virgin America (VA) takeover?Puglia: This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because JetBlue (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive.IBD: If you had a mentor, who was it?Puglia: I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, ""It can't innovate, it can't grow."" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.

232,TXN,"Petering Apple (AAPL) and Samsung demand prodded a Raymond James analyst to downgrade suppliers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and others, even with the iPhone 7 launch expected in September.Apple suppliers broadly fell in morning trading on the stock market today. Radio-frequency chip companies Qorvo and Skyworks were down 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively, on the downgrade, tugging rival Broadcom (AVGO) down 1.3%.Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) stock was down more than 1%, while Apple suppliers Analog Devices (ADI), NXP and Texas Instruments (TXN) stocks were all down roughly 1%.In all, Raymond James analyst Steven Smigie downgraded six semiconductor stocks to outperform from strong buy, citing likely in-line earnings and minimal upside to June guidance.Following a January drop in the stocks, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has rebounded 20% since mid-February, Smigie wrote in a research report. Some stocks have run up 40%, he noted.But ""with only modest signs that there is the potential for near-term upside to (earnings per share), and some signs of modest downside, we worry that shares have a limited upside, with reasonable downside risk,"" he wrote.Confidence could improve in the seasonally stronger second half of 2016, when Apple typically launches its newest iPhone flagship. But ""Apple is seeing modestly lower demand,"" said Smigie, who questioned the likelihood of a positive June guide by Apple. He also noted some pain points for radio-frequency suppliers that have more than 45% exposure to Apple.""Even if the Apple guide is healthy, we think skepticism will remain until the summer when we start to get evidence of the iPhone 7 ramp and questions about iPhone SE cannibalizing other iPhone models get resolved,"" he wrote.Samsung sales zoomed on its Galaxy S7 flagship, but pre-orders were likely influenced by free Gear VR (virtual reality) giveaways, Smigie wrote. Huawei, on the other hand, is a ""bright spot"" and recently guided to 120 million to 140 million units in 2016. The lion's share of those units will be high-end smartphones, Huawei said.Outside mobile, PC and industrial results have been weak, offsetting some strength in the growing automotive and infotainment arenas -- the latter being NXP's bailiwick following its acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor.But even in the automotive segment, ""we have heard concerns from a number of investors on subprime lending,"" Smigie wrote. Until those fears level out, automotive-exposed semiconductors could face some headwinds.Respective estimates from industry trackers Gartner and IDC show the PC segment saw 9.6% and 11.5% year-over-year declines in Q1 shipments. And March industrial production fell 0.6% vs. expectations for a 0.1% decline, says Smigie.Smigie notes positively, ""we still like many of the stories, however, so all else being equal, on a pullback we could look to get more aggressive again.""

The results were similar to fellow Apple supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which late Monday reported consensus-topping Q1 earnings that also fell year over year.Cirrus Logic's current-quarter guidance lagged analyst consensus on softening iPhone sales. Late Tuesday, Apple said that it had shipped 51.19 million iPhones in the March quarter, down 16% from the year-earlier quarter.Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill cut estimates on Apple suppliers Skyworks and Qorvo ahead of their earnings reports, slated for after the market close Wednesday. Apple's June-quarter revenue guide for $41 million to $43 million implies 38 million iPhone shipments, Gill wrote in a research report.Analyst consensus currently estimates 44 million iPhone shipments for the June quarter, he wrote.""While we expect iPhone unit shipments to grow seasonally beyond the June quarter, we believe overall shipment levels are likely to be below our prior estimates,"" he wrote. He cut his price targets on Skyworks and Qorvo stocks to 70 and 50 from 77 and 54, respectively, but kept his buy ratings.But Gil retained his buy rating and 50 price target on Cirrus Logic stock.Cirrus Logic reported $232 million in sales for the quarter that ended March 26 and 38 cents earnings per share ex items, down a respective 9% and 42% vs. the year-earlier quarter. The consensus of nine analysts polled by Thomson Reuters called for $226.2 million and 21 cents.Cirrus Logic wrapped up fiscal 2016 with $1.2 billion in sales and $2.40 EPS minus items, topping Wall Street for $1.16 billion and $2.22. Sales climbed 31% but EPS fell 10%.On a year-over-year basis, portable audio product sales -- which would include mobile -- fell 11% in fiscal Q4 but rose 34% in fiscal 2016.For the current quarter, Cirrus Logic expects $220 million to $250 million in sales, which at the midpoint would be down 17% and missing expectations for $258 million.But Cirrus Logic is gaining content at Apple, ""thus insulating it from potential unit shipment declines,"" Gill wrote. Outside Apple, he estimates that Cirrus Logic's total addressable digital solutions market could reach $420 million over the next four years, up from just $21 million.Besides Skyworks and Qorvo, fellow Apple supplier Texas Instruments (TXN) is also slated to post financials late Wednesday. Shares for the three companies were down a respective 1.5%, 2% and fraction midday Wednesday.For fiscal Q2, the consensus of 25 analysts expects Skyworks to report $775.6 million in sales and $1.24 EPS minus items, up a respective 2% and 8% year over year.Wall Street calls for Qorvo to report $600 million in sales and 92 cents EPS minus items for its fiscal Q4, and $2.6 billion and $4.26 for its fiscal 2016. Across the board, every metric would fall vs. the year-earlier period.Texas Instruments is expected to wrap Q1 with $2.98 billion in sales and 62 cents EPS, down 5% and up 2%, respectively.

236,TXN,"Heavyweight chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN) again dominated as chip suppliers for the Apple (AAPL) Retina MacBook 2016, according to an iFixit teardown, which notes the MacBook finally joined its iPhone and iPad cousins in rose gold solidarity.The 12-inch MacBook comes equipped with ""a faster processor and zippier flash memory."" Intel again supplied the core processor and an HD graphics card, and both flash-memory NAND chips (256 gigabytes) came from Toshiba.Samsung and Micron Technology (MU) split the difference in other memory vectors. Two Samsung chips provide a total 8 GB of RAM, and Micron supplied a single 4-gigabit DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) chip.Broadcom re-won its touchscreen controller and what iFixit believes to be a wireless chipset, and STMicroelectronics (STM) again supplied a microcontroller.Texas Instruments supplied a total of four chips, including a system management controller. The Dallas-based chipmaker showed up six times in the earlier iteration, but the 2016 teardown wasn't as extensive as the 2015 teardown, iFixit said.Fellow Apple supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) was seemingly ousted from the Retina MacBook 2016 logic board. In the 2015 model, the teardown showed NXP supplied a microcontroller and two interface expanders.Like its 2015 counterpart, the Retina MacBook 2016 earned a 1 out of a possible 10 in repairability from iFixit. The main reason is because the display is a single, fused unit, so ""if the display needs replacing, it'll cost a pretty penny.""In afternoon trading on the stock market today, shares of both NXP and STMicroelectronics were down 2%, while Intel stock was down nearly 1% and Micron down more than 1%. Broadcom stock was lower by a fraction, and Texas Instruments stock was up a fraction.

237,TXN,"Facebook (FB) lost its first game in the virtual reality field, as its Oculus VR unit announced that a shortage of parts will delay some shipments of its high-tech Rift headsets.The Rift goggles began shipping to more than 20 countries and regions one week ago. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe acknowledged the delay in a tweet: “First set of Rifts are going out slower than we originally estimated, so we're giving free shipping for all preorders, including international.”Facebook stock fell 3% to 112.55 in the stock market today, though it was not clear if the market action was related to the shipment delays. Facebook has said Oculus will not be material to its bottom line this year.Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler said in a research note Monday that Facebook's first-quarter results ""may come in light,” in what he described as a “potential growth reset.” Sandler maintained a buy rating on Facebook with a 145 price target.Oculus did not say how many Rift shipments were delayed or when the problem might be fixed. It said buyers hit with the delay will receive an update by April 12.Preorders for the $599 Oculus Rift headsets began in January. Facebook has not said how many orders it's received. So far, 30 games are available for the Rift, with more than 100 games expected by year-end. Game prices range from $9.99 to $59.99. Facebook sees Oculus Rift as a game changer, starting with games but soon extending to other areas such as sports events, as users put on the Rift goggles for deep-seated immersion.A dismantling of the Rift by iFixit showed the Oculus contained chips from STMicroelectronics (STM), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Cypress Semiconductor (CY).STMicroelectronics supplied the Rift with an ARM (ARMH)-based microcontroller. Cypress supplies a hub controller, which allows for multiple USB-connected devices to be plugged in at once. Texas Instruments is supplying an LED driver, which controls for image brightness and grayscale.STMicroelectronics rose 0.5%.

238,TXN,"Apple’s (AAPL) new iPhone SE probably has a gross profit margin of about 35% for the entry-level model, which is well below the mid-40% margins enjoyed by the rest of the iPhone family, RBC Capital Markets said in a research report Thursday.But the new phone, which starts at $399, will still give a lift to revenue and profit, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in the report.The iPhone SE could provide $6.8 billion in revenue and 23 cents in earnings per share this calendar year, assuming Apple sells an incremental 15 million units, Daryanani said.He reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 130. Apple was down a fraction, below 109, in morning trading on the stock market today.Based on teardown reports, the 16-gigabyte model iPhone SE has a bill of materials cost of about $260, Daryanani said. The 4-inch iPhone uses many of the same components found in the larger-screen, higher-priced iPhone 6 and 6S series phones.The iPhone SE likely benefited from cheaper components that were the result of Apple suppliers left with excess inventory after the iPhone 6S underperformed, he said.Chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) topped content in the iPhone SE, but Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) gained new chips in the refreshed 4-inch smartphone, a Chipworks teardown found.The iPhone SE went on sale Thursday. It was a low-key product launch for Apple, with few stores seeing lines forming outside, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a report Thursday.Also, a check of 100 Apple stores in the U.S. found 90% availability for the iPhone SE, he said.“We view both the lack of lines and the high level of product availability as in line with expectations, reinforcing our view that the SE will be largely incremental to the model in replacing the low-end iPhone 5S,” Munster said.RELATED:Middle-Aged Apple Might Get A Sports Car, New Girlfriend.

239,TXN,"Wall Street largely yawned Thursday after an iFixit teardown showed that Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus Rift totes chips from STMicroelectronics (STM), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Cypress Semiconductor (CY).In afternoon trading on the stock market today, STMicroelectronics stock was up 1%, but shares of Texas Instruments and Cypress were down 1%. Shares of graphics chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) were both down a fraction. Their GPUs (graphics processing units) are recommended for installation in PCs running the Rift headset.Oculus' virtual reality headset has been in development for four years, according to iFixit, which also dismantled two earlier developmental versions. Facebook acquired Oculus in July 2014 for $2 billion.The Rift was finally unveiled March 28. On Wednesday, iFixit's teardown sent shares of Cypress and Texas Instruments up as much as 5.8% and 2.4%, with both ending the day up about 1.6%.Cypress supplies a hub controller, which allows multiple USB-connected devices to be plugged in at once. Texas Instruments' input comes in the form of an LED driver, which controls for image brightness and grayscale.STMicroelectronics supplied the Rift with an ARM-based microcontroller. But STMicroelectronics stock fell 1.1% Wednesday.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia flew as much as 4.2% and 2.4% Wednesday, before closing flat and up 1.1%, respectively.Image provided by Shutterstock.

240,TXN,"You probably won't need to hold onto your socks during Apple's (AAPL) spring product launch event on Monday. That's the message from Wall Street analysts trying to set realistic expectations for what's likely to be announced.The tech press has been reporting for weeks that Apple will unveil a new 4-inch iPhone, a new 9.7-inch iPad and new Apple Watch bands at the media event Monday at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.“While we expect to see several ‘under the hood’ improvements across devices, we are not expecting the same exuberance as last year when Apple shared final details of the Apple Watch,” Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said in a report Friday. “Moreover, we worry investors will find the next several Apple media events underwhelming.”Uerkwitz rates Apple stock as outperform with a 12- to 18-month price target of 120. Apple shares rose 12 cents to 105.92 on the stock market Friday.Apple has a bunch of innovations in the works for release in 2017 and 2018, he said. They include possibly an iPhone with an OLED display, a virtual reality headset, 360-degree camera, and a hub for smart-home products using Siri, Uerkwitz said.Any surprises at Monday's event likely will revolve around pricing for the new products and possibly the Apple Watch or the introduction of new MacBook or Mac Pro computers.Apple CEO Tim Cook also is likely to use the event as a platform to reinforce the company's argument that the federal government has overstepped its legal bounds by demanding Apple hack its iPhone security. Apple and the Justice Department are set to square off in a federal court on Tuesday in a criminal case where the FBI wants Apple to develop software to bypass its password security measures.Because Apple gets most of its revenue from the iPhone (68% of sales in the December quarter), most of the attention Monday will be focused on the rumored iPhone SE. The new 4-inch iPhone will replace the same-size iPhone 5S, which was introduced in September 2013 and is still on sale.The new model is expected to sport an A9 chip, NFC technology to enable Apple Pay and a 12-megapixel, rear-facing camera to bring it up to snuff with the other iPhones. But it reportedly won't have a pressure-sensitive screen like the premium models, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which have 4.7- and 5.5-inch displays, respectively. The SE will be targeted to customers who prefer a smaller size handset as well as emerging markets because of its expected lower price.The iPhone SE “is likely to be a low-volume (for Apple) product that has minimal effect” on its earnings and stock price, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a note Thursday.Hargreaves is bullish on Apple with a price target of 127 because of likely growth in the iPhone 7 cycle starting this fall.“Investors are not excited about this new phone,” Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a research note Tuesday.Zhang is “bearish” on prospects for the new iPhone SE because he expects that its price will be similar to second-hand iPhone 6 handsets in large emerging markets.“Second-hand iPhone 6’s are sold online at $350 in China, which we believe will be same price range of the iPhone (SE),” he said, adding that the price difference is such that many users will go with the larger display phone.Apple faced a similar pricing problem when it launched the iPhone 5C handset alongside the iPhone 5S. The 5C was priced only $100 cheaper than the 5S but had a cheaper-looking plastic casing.Sales of the iPhone SE are likely to be ""modest"" at 10 million to 15 million units annually, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research note Thursday. Still, the new phone could provide a buffer ahead of the launch of the iPhone 7, he said.Component suppliers likely to benefit from the iPhone refresh cycle include Jabil Circuit (JBL), Broadcom (AVGO), Amphenol (APH) and Texas Instruments (TXN), he said.Broadcom and fellow Apple chip supplier Microsemi (MSCC) both hit new buy points late last week.Also Monday, Apple is expected to unveil its third-generation 9.7-inch iPad Air, which will be given similar functionality and accessories to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The current iPad Air 2 was launched in October 2014. The iPad Pro with its Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil debuted last September.But the tablet business has been in decline at Apple and the new iPad is unlikely to change that, analysts say.""We do not expect the updates to materially change our outlook for iPad units, which seem likely to continue declining through fiscal 2016, but at a moderating rate,"" Hargreaves said.Apple holds an IBD Composite Rating of 66 out of a possible 99, factoring in earnings growth, stock performance and several other metrics. Chipmaker Broadcom gets a 98, Amphenol a 91 and Texas Instruments an 84. Jabil is not currently highly rated by IBD, with a Composite Rating of just 47. 
"
241,TXN,"Chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) topped content in Apple’s (AAPL) newly launched iPhone SE, but Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) gained new chips in the 4-inch smartphone, a Chipworks teardown found Thursday.Apple's iPhone SE is ""the most powerful 4-inch phone ever,"" the smartphone giant says. It was unveiled March 21 and began shipping today, the same day Tesla Motors (TSLA) began taking orders for its less expensive Model 3.Researchers with Chipworks and iFixit classified the iPhone SE, the first to not have a number in its name, as the iPhone 6S squeezed into the iPhone 5S body.""There are very few new parts, but that hardly means there is no innovation,"" Chipworks wrote. But Apple engaged in ""serious economical re-use"" of many radio-frequency (RF) chips, excepting the Skyworks and Texas Instruments additions.New to the iPhone SE, Skyworks gained a power amplifier module and Texas Instruments earned a power management chip. Privately-held Toshiba and Epcos made new appearances with a flash-memory chip and an antenna switch module.A new power management chip could also be an Apple-Dialog Semiconductor mash-up, Chipworks wrote.Qualcomm and Qorvo each have four chips in the phone, leading Skyworks, which contributed three iPhone SE chips. Broadcom (AVGO) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) each supplied two chips. Texas Instruments, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) and InvenSense (INVN) all brought one apiece to the table.The A9 processor was supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), in this particular phone. But Apple dual-sourced the A9 in the iPhone 6S, splitting share between Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung.Samsung reportedly has since said that it would yield the A10 processor to Taiwan Semiconductor. The A10 processor is scheduled to make its debut in the iPhone 7, likely to be launched in September.
"
242,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) ought to acquire Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) to diversify from the slowing smartphone and radio-frequency market, Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell suggested Thursday.Maxim has long been takeover bait with sharks Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) reportedly eyeing the $10.5 billion-market-cap chipmaker in October. But sources told Bloomberg that Maxim might not sell without a high premium.Skyworks could provide that premium, McConnell wrote in a research report. Maxim stock rose a fraction Thursday, to 36.78. Skyworks was flat. An offer of $44 per share would be a 20% premium to Maxim stock, McConnell points out.Acquiring Maxim would help Skyworks diversify beyond its 80% exposure to the struggling mobile market, McConnell wrote. Maxim has ties to the data center and automotive markets.Though Maxim makes the most sense -- McConnell rates both a buy -- Skyworks could also diversify by acquiring Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) or Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), McConnell wrote.RF, Skyworks' bread and butter, is slated for a compound annual growth rate of 11% over the next several years vs. historical 18% growth, McConnell wrote. Skyworks competes in the RF ring with Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO), both Apple suppliers.The number of bands -- a spectrum of RF -- rocketed between 2005 and 2015, Brent Dietz, Qorvo director of corporate communications, told IBD. In 2005, there were two bands. By 2015, there were 43.McConnell sees little opportunity for continued band acceleration. And Dietz offered a similar growth view for the RF market -- a $10 billion market opportunity with a 10%-15% growth rate.But Dietz notes that the RF content in smartphones has gapped up this century. Less complex 2G phones had about 80 cents worth of RF content. Today, most smartphones have about $16 worth of RF.To that point, Broadcom's mobile RF content grows in excess of 20% every year, CEO Hock Tan said during the company's Q1 earnings conference call. He expects 2016 to be no different.This year, Qorvo and Skyworks offered similar views of growing dollar content in marquee smartphones. Recent teardowns show that Samsung completely replaced three Skyworks chips in its Galaxy S7 and that Qorvo twice replaced Broadcom.
"
243,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) quintupled its content in the Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone as radio frequency-chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) repeatedly lost share to rival Qorvo (QRVO), a ChipWorks teardown shows.The ChipWorks teardown was last week, but it was highlighted in a research report Monday by Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.InvenSense (INVN), another Apple supplier, apparently lost the GS7 gyroscope to STMicroelectronics (STM). InvenSense stock was down 1.5% in midday trading on the stock market today. STMicro stock was up a fraction.Three Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) chips were completely replaced in the GS7.Key winners in getting their chips inside the new phone, besides Qualcomm and Qorvo, included NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM).Although Broadcom retained a power amplifier, rival Qorvo swiped two Broadcom components from the GS7. But Broadcom replaced a Skyworks multiband module (a power amplifier).Last week, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan bragged that the chipmaker has increased its content by 20% every year for its ""North American customer,"" which analysts said is the Apple iPhone, and that another bump is expected with the release of the next iPhone, the iPhone 7, due out in September. Meanwhile, though, Broadcom is de-emphasizing its mobile unit, which will comprise 23% of Q2 sales, down from 32% in Q1, as smartphone shipments slow amid a saturated market.Samsung lowered its own chip content in the GS7 vs. the GS6. Qualcomm took four chips (including the application processor) from Samsung and replaced Cirrus Logic (CRUS)/Wolfson on an audio chip. SK Hynix, NXP and Maxim each replaced a Samsung component.But Samsung swapped STMicroelectronics' touch controller in the GS6 for its own controller in the GS7.And Texas Instruments (TXN) lost the wireless power receiver to Integrated Device Technology (IDTI).

254,TXN,"Stock futures pointed to a slightly higher open Thursday, with some key stocks to watch.Apple (AAPL) is in a buy zone, but that hasn't yet provided big coattails for iPhone chip stocks. Apple suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) are all worth watching, though. Meanwhile, Boeing (BA), which has outflown Apple as 2017's top performer on the Dow Jones industrial average, is finally creating a new possible entry.Boeing is benefiting from strong demand for civilian aircraft as well as improving prospects for defense and other government contracts. Boeing has been one of the hottest stocks in 2017, rising 53% vs. 38% for Apple. Over the past year Boeing has skyrocketed 77% against Apple's 47%. Boeing broke out of a consolidation in late January and again in May. Since then, the aerospace giant has run sharply higher, finding support at its 10-day moving average.But over the past few weeks Boeing has consolidated. It's now formed a three-weeks-tight pattern with a potential buy point of 246.59. A three-weeks-tight offers a new entry for existing shareholders to add slightly to their holdings, but they should try to buy as close to the trigger point as possible.It's not a proper buy zone for new investors, but if Boeing continues to consolidate a flat base could develop.Boeing dipped 0.8% to 238.09 in Wednesday stock market trading.Apple rose 0.1% to 159.98 on Wednesday, still in range from a 156.75 flat-base entry. Apple is a big buyer of chips, so what's good for Apple should be good news for iPhone suppliers and stocks. But so far Apple chipmakers have not joined Apple in buy range.Broadcom: Broadcom rose 0.7% to 256.92, briefly hitting a record high intraday. Broadcom does not have a proper buy point. In late July it just topped a 256.88 buy point from a flat base. But the stock then retreated, falling more than 7%, making that entry invalid. If Broadcom consolidates for a few more days, it will have a new valid flat base. But that's a big if, given that the chipmaker reports earnings late Friday.Analysts expect to see revenue up 18% to $4.458 billion with earnings jumping 39% to $4.03 a share, according to Zacks Investment Research.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report.

255,TXN,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average fell slightly early Thursday morning.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) outperformed yet again, edging higher but staying in buy range.XApple is the largest company by market capitalization in the world, so it has a huge impact on the major market averages. Adding to Apple's impact is the broader iPhone ecosystem of suppliers. But despite Apple's strong earnings last week and hefty stock gains, there haven't been big coattails for iPhone chipmakers.At least not yet. Several iPhone plays are near breakouts, including chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).On Wednesday, stocks initially sold off amid North Korea nuclear tensions as well as declines in Priceline (PCLN), Netflix (NFLX) and the Dow's Walt Disney (DIS).

Dow futures slid 0.2%.Apple shares rose 0.6% to 161.06 in Wednesday's stock market trading, about 3% above the 156.75 flat-base buy point. Apple cleared that entry last week following its better-than-expected earnings and guidance. Apple's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, is just below a record high. Apple's RS line has been soaring since the post-earnings rally, but has been trending up since mid-June.Apple is the largest company by market capitalization in the world, so it has a huge impact on the major market averages. But another reason  strong earnings and stock performance hasn't had big coattails for iPhone chipmakers, but these three are close to buy points.Broadcom is working on a flat base with a 256.88 buy point. The chipmaker closed just into the buy zone on July 26, but turned lower the next session. Broadcom crossed the entry point intraday again on Aug. 2, as Apple popped on earnings, but closed below the key level.Broadcom fell 0.9% to 249.17 on Wednesday.Texas Instruments is moving through a cup-with-handle pattern with an 84.24 buy point. Shares found support at their 200-day line in late June during the tech sector's retreat.Texas Instruments dipped 0.2% to 82.28 on Wednesday.Skyworks also is in a cup-with-handle base, with a 104.74 potential entry. Shares didn't get much support from Skyworks' strong beat-and-raise earnings report last month, and slipped in the days after Apple's strong results. Skyworks has moved back above its 50-day moving average after dipping below that key support for a few days.Skyworks rose 1 cent on Wednesday to 104.74, after testing its 50-day line intraday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Will Apple Get Extended?5 Stocks That Broke Out WednesdayFANGs Loom Large For These 6 Earnings Reports: Investing Action PlanStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

(TOL) and KB Homes (KBH), as well as construction equipment maker Graco (GGG), wood products producer Louisiana-Pacific (LPX) and steel maker Allegheny Technologies (ATI).XMastec (MTZ) and manufactured-home builder Patrick Industries (PATK) also earned a spot on the list, as did Kimball International (KBAL), which makes furniture for the office and hospitality industries, and home furniture maker Bassett Furniture Industries (BSET).Institutional investors also continued to show demand for top chip stocks, with IBD 50 members Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) making the cut, along with Cohu (COHU) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Cohu and Lam Research can also be found on IBD's latest list of stocks expecting 50% earnings growth in Q3.With tensions rising in North Korea and President Trump promising to significantly boost defense spending, it's no surprise that major defense contractors Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Heico (HEI) are also found on the list.In last month's report, top fund managers invested over $1 billion each into four stocks: United Health (UNH) ($1.39 billion), Apple (AAPL) ($1.36 billion), Electronic Arts (EA) ($1.25 billion) and Celgene (CELG) ($1.07 billion).The latest list doesn't include any $1 billion-plus bets. The largest total investment was in Boeing, with 23 funds picking up approximately $223 million of shares.Next in line was Bank of America (BAC), with 27 funds investing $178 million. The company got an additional vote of confidence from Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett, who told CNBC on Oct. 3 that he would hold BofA shares for a ""long, long, long time.""Bank of America reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 13.Boosted by recent institutional buying, most stocks on the list — including Thor Industries (THO), Winnebago Industries (WGO) and KB Homes — have already broken out and are now extended.But several remain in or near a potential buy zone, including Mastec, Boeing, Toll Bros. and the New York Times (NYT), which has pulled back in recent days and is now testing support at the 50-day line. Note that Toll Bros. is trading at the upper limit of its buy range, while Boeing is now extended.While General Motors (GM) made the list of new buys, with five funds investing $1.2 million, it also led the list of new sells. The net number of funds selling GM (16 selling minus 5 buying) was 11.Diesel and gas engine maker Cummins (CMI) had the second-most net sellers (10), followed by axle and suspension maker Dana Inc. (DAN) (9).Despite the number of funds selling, each of these stocks has been rising, and Cummins entered a 170.78-179.32 buy zone last week.RELATED:Q3 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus GrowthU.S. Small Caps, Foreign Stocks Favored By FundsFind And Track The Best Mutual FundsLooking For The Next Nvidia?

257,TXN,"Stock futures rose modestly Monday morning vs. fair value, suggesting continued momentum heading into this week's Federal Reserve policy meeting after the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all hit record highs on Friday.XApple (AAPL) broke out to a buy point in early August, but key iPhone chip suppliers struggled to break out. On Friday, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) surged past entry points. Keep a close eye on fellow Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Applied Materials (AMAT), as well as giant Intel (INTC), which are approaching buy zones.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC) reached a $9.2 billion deal to buy aerospace and defense firm Orbital ATK (OA).Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve will hold a policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with wide expectations that the central bank will begin to pare its massive balance sheet. Treasury yields have rebounded from 2017 lows in the past few weeks, with several bank stocks nearing buy points.S&P 500 futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures also advanced 0.2% Dow futures climbed 0.25%.Asian markets rallied Monday as North Korean tensions receded, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 1.3%. European bourses rose modestly intraday.Several chip stocks broke out in Friday stock market trading, including a pair of iPhone chip stocks clearing cup-with-handle buy points in strong volume. That's notable because Apple suppliers had been building sound bases, sometimes flirting with buys, but not really joining their key customer in the buy zone. That raised some doubts about Apple's own breakout, especially with the stock moving sideways for several weeks.Skyworks, which briefly topped a 108.65 buy point intraday on Sept. 5, advanced 2.3% to close at 109.55. Texas Instruments rose 1.8% to 84.78, above an 84.34 entry and hitting a 17-year high.Are these just brief forays into buy zones or the start of a broad advance? One sign will be whether other iPhone chip plays follow suit.Broadcom briefly topped a buy point in late July but then reversed, falling sufficiently to make the old entry point invalid. Broadcom has since formed a new flat base with a 258.59 buy point. Broadcom tested that entry point late last month as the flat base was forming, but didn't close above it. Shares climbed 1.5% on Friday to 250.55, moving back above it 50-day moving average.Qorvo is in a cup base, and just completed a handle, giving it a lower entry point of 75.81. Qorvo jumped 2.7% to 75.49 on Friday, just below that entry.Applied Materials is a chip- and design-equipment giant. It's not a direct iPhone supplier. But some analysts have pegged it as an iPhone play, citing its OLED-related operations. The Apple iPhone X will boast an OLED screen, which is already being used by Samsung on some handsets.Applied Materials tried to break out of a cup-with-handle base on Friday, rising to just hit the 47.69 buy point. But shares pulled back, closing up 0.2% at 47.14.Intel has become a recent supplier of iPhone chips, though you wouldn't want to call the world's largest semiconductor maker an ""Apple play."" But you can say that Intel is near a buy point. Intel surged 5% last week to 36.96, just 2% below a 37.60 double-bottom base. Intel's Relative Strength line has been lagging in 2017 and really for the last several years, reflecting the stock's underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.For its part Apple rose 1% to 159.88 on Friday, finding support near its 10-week line. That snapped a three-day mild decline following mild disappointment over the late release date for iPhone X. Apple remains in range from a 156.75 flat-base entry.Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus preorders began on Friday. While the tech giant may not indicate how those orders went, big wireless operators, electronics retailers and analysts may give their own estimates of demand. The iPhone X won't go on sale until Nov. 3.RELATED:The Big Picture: More Breakouts Ahead Of Fed Meeting These Chip Stocks Broke Out In Bullish Trading ActionTwo Chip Equipment Stock Breakouts: Similar Bases, With Key DifferencesChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry NewsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple RoutineStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

258,TXN,"A bunch of big-name stocks in the semiconductor sector busted out of bases in bullish trading action on Friday.Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) started the parade, jumping to a record high right after the opening bell. Nvidia stock broke out of a six-week flat base with a buy point of 174.66.Nvidia rose 6.3% to 180.11 on the stock market today. In intraday trading, it hit an all-time high of 179.97. Nvidia received a bullish report from Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse, who said the company's opportunities in artificial intelligence haven't been fully appreciated by the market.Muse reiterated his outperform rating on Nvidia and raised his price target to 250 from 180.Other semiconductor industry stocks moving higher on Friday included chipmakers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as chip-gear makers Applied Materials (AMAT) and Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT).IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the next Nvidia, start with this simple investing routine.Skyworks soared back into the buy zone for the first time since clearing a buy point of 108.66 out of a cup-with-handle base on Sept. 5.Skyworks climbed 2.3% to 109.55 Friday.Woburn, Mass.-based Skyworks gets an estimated 40% of its revenue from Apple (AAPL), which started taking pre-orders Friday for its iPhone 8 smartphones.Texas Instruments broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 84.34. TI stock was up 1.9% to 84.84 at the close.Applied Materials broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 47.69. But it couldn't hold on to that level. Shares, which hit 47.69 intraday, closed up just 0.2% at 47.14.Ultra Clean Holdings stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 26.30. Ultra Clean closed up 3.9% to 26.96.RELATED:Nvidia Stock Breaks Out, Hits All-Time High On Bullish ReportChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

260,TXN,"Key U.S. index funds were narrowly mixed in afternoon trading in the stock market today as disappointing jobs data weighed.XSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) were down 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively, while PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) climbed 0.3%. ETFs tracking overseas markets fared better as iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) rose 0.7% and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) added 0.6%.Gold plays advanced with SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) up 0.8% apiece. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) rallied 1.9%; VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) advanced 1.4%. Gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,349.40 an ounce.Health care, real estate and utilities also led the upside among sector funds. But financials, energy and telecom lagged.Oil funds slipped along with West Texas intermediate crude prices. United States Oil (USO) fell 0.3%, SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) slid 0.9% and VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) gave up 0.7%.The stock market's been a bit rocky lately, but that has helped create some new buy opportunities.The two biggest semiconductor exchange traded funds (by assets) appear poised to do just that.First up is iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX), which has amassed $1.1 billion since its July 2001 launch. The fund tracks the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index and bears a 0.48% expense ratio.The ETF was featured in this column in late June as shares sought support at the 50-day moving average. It fell below the line but recovered to form a shallow cup with handle. The ideal buy point is 151.75, or a dime above the high of the handle. SOXX rose 13% from a prior flat-base breakout to the left-side high of the current pattern.SOXX has returned 22.9% year to date through Sept. 5, according to Morningstar Direct, doubling the S&P 500's 11.3% gain. It's outpaced the benchmark index over the longer haul with three-, five- and 15-year returns of 20.8%, 24% and 10.7%, respectively, vs. 9.3%, 14.3% and 9.3% for the S&P 500.Top holdings as of Sept. 5 included graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), Apple chip supplier Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel (INTC). Nvidia has surged more than 50% this year. Investment research firm CFRA on Wednesday suggested investors shift from growth stocks like Nvidia to value plays such as Broadcom and Intel.But valuations in the semiconductor industry overall remain reasonable, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said in his report: ""While the popular PHLX Semiconductor Index is up over 70% in the last two years, our analysis shows that valuations remain healthy and actually reside slightly below historical levels.""VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH), which tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, has gathered $761.4 million in assets. Like SOXX, the ETF slipped below its 50-day line in late June but has since recovered near its all-time highs. It's shaping a flat base with an 89.82 buy point.Its top 10 holdings as of July 31 included Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), as well as Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom and Texas Instruments. The nearly 6-year-old fund has returned 23.1% year to date and a respective 20.7% and 23.4% over the past three and five years. SMH's expense ratio is 0.36%.Wednesday's picks drew closer to their buy points as the broader market rebounded. Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) closed just shy of an 81.31 entry and Vanguard Health Care Index Fund (VHT) ended near a 151.39 buy point.RELATED:Amazon Deal Boosts This Sector; Will 2 Equity Plays Break Out?Think You Missed The Big Biotech Rally?

261,TXN,"The cup-with-handle base is a classic setup that appears over and over again throughout the years. Stocks change, but investor psychology doesn't.XTesla (TSLA) now has a proper handle to go with its cup base, giving it a lower entry point. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) chip plays Texas Instruments (TXN), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Applied Materials (AMAT) also are in cup-with-handle patterns, as is LogMeIn (LOGM).During Tuesday's session, the S&P 500 index fell a fraction and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.1%. The Dow industrials closed just above break-even, helped by Apple's rise to a new high.Tesla has been working on a cup base going back to late June. As of Tuesday's close, Tesla's handle has reached the minimum five days to create a cup-with-handle pattern. Tesla, which dipped 0.4% to 362.33 on Tuesday, is just 2% off the new potential buy point of 370.10. Until Tuesday's close, the buy point was 387.09, just above the left side of the cup and the all-time high.The cup with handle, which should look a lot like a tea cup, must be at least seven weeks long. (A cup-without-handle pattern must be six weeks.) The midpoint of the handle must be in the upper half of the overall pattern. The handle should be flat to downward-sloping, ideally on light volume. A slight downward drift helps shake out weak holders before a new uptrend. If and when a stock breaks out from the handle, new buyers must bid up the price because existing investors aren't eager to sell.Tesla has a good-but-not great Composite Rating of 82 out of 99, with its strong share price performance somewhat offsetting continued losses. All-time winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 as they begin big price moves.Texas Instruments makes chips for automotive and wireless industries, among others. Its products can be found in the Apple iPhone.The stock is in a cup-with-handle pattern going back to early June. The handle is nearly three weeks long with the buy point at 84.34, 10 cents above the top of the handle. Volume has generally been light in the handle.TI has rebounded from its 50-day moving average after closing just below that level on Friday. Shares fell 0.1% to 81.95 on Tuesday.Texas Instruments has a strong-but-not-stellar 89 Composite Rating.As for Apple itself, the tech titan cleared a 156.75 flat-base buy point earlier this month following its strong quarterly earnings and guidance. Apple hit a record high Tuesday, still within the 5% chase zone. So far iPhone suppliers haven't followed suit. Apple has a 94 Composite Rating.Skyworks is another Apple iPhone chipmaker. Its buy point is 108.66 in a base going back to early June. The stock has dipped below the 50-day line a couple of times in the handle, but is back above that area, rising 0.3% to 105.80. Skyworks has a Composite Rating of 95.Applied Materials is not an Apple supplier per se. But the chip- and display-equipment maker has been touted as a beneficiary of Apple and other handset makers choosing to use OLED screens in future smartphones.The stock is in cup with handle, though the handle is large relative to the size of the cup base that started in early June. But the midpoint of the handle is above the midpoint of the pattern, so it's valid. The buy point is 47.69. Applied Materials, which has a 98 Composite Rating, advanced 0.2% to 43.88 on Tuesday.Applied Materials will report earnings Thursday evening.LogMeIn offers online meeting connection services, including freemium products such as Join.me.The stock is in a shallow cup-with-handle going back to early May, finding support recently at its 50-day line. LogMeIn has a 121.35 entry.

262,TXN,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rallied solidly Tuesday morning. Wall Street will get July data on U.S. manufacturing and domestic auto sales this morning, but many investors are looking ahead to Apple (AAPL) earnings after the market close.XFour Apple iPhone chip plays are in bullish bases near buy points: Broadcom (AVGO), Applied Materials (AMAT), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).During Monday's session, the Dow industrials rose 0.3%, hitting a new record high. But the S&P 500 index slid 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite 0.4%. The Dow's Apple fell 0.4% to 148.85, closing just below its 50-day moving average after testing that support level several times in recent days. Meanwhile, Broadcom, Applied Materials, Skyworks and Texas Instruments also faced 50-day tests on Monday, with different outcomes.Apple is in a flat-base pattern of its own with a potential buy point of 156.75. Apple did trade slightly above 149 in premarket action, indicating a move back above its 50-day line.S&P 500 index rose 0.3% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.4%. Dow futures rose 0.5%, or more than 100 points, on the cusp of hitting 22,000 for the first time.In overseas trading, Asian markets closed higher: Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.3%, China's Shanghai composite 0.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.8%. Major European bourses were rallying intraday: The U.K.'s FTSE was up 0.7%, Germany's Dax 0.5% and France's CAC 0.5%.Broadcom is in a flat base with a buy point of 256.88. The communications chipmaker closed slightly above that mark on July 26 but reversed lower the next day. On Monday, shares fell 1.5% to 246.66, approaching their 50-day moving average.Broadcom gets about 15% to 20% of its revenue from Apple, RBC Capital recently estimated.Applied Materials is a chip-equipment giant, so it doesn't directly supply Apple. But Pacific Crest recently pegged Applied Materials as benefiting from the shift by Apple and other smartphone makers toward OLED screens.Applied Materials is in a flat base with a 47.96 entry. Applied Materials fell 2.1% to 44.31 on Monday, falling below its 50-day moving average.Texas Instruments is in a short cup base with an 84.75 buy point. Texas Instruments rose intraday to 84.24 on July 26 after topping earnings views the night before, but it closed near session lows and then declined the next two sessions, testing its 50-day line. TI rallied 0.8% to 81.38 on Monday.Skyworks also is in a short cup base with a potential buy point of 112.21. Skyworks fell 0.8% on Monday to 104.87, nearing its 50-day.Skyworks reported better-than-expected earnings and raised guidance late on July 20. Shares initially sold off on that report, but closed little changed on July 21.As for other Apple-related earnings news, chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) reports on Aug. 2. Qorvo is in a consolidation but has been trading below its 50-day line nearly 14% below a possible entry. Universal Display (OLED), a notable OLED play, reports Aug. 3.

263,TXN,"The Dow Jones industrial average was in the driver's seat again for the second straight session Wednesday, helped by a strong move by shares of Boeing (BA).The maker of commercial and military aircraft soared 9% after the company topped earnings estimates, while raising its full-year earnings and cash flow guidance.XBoeing was well-extended from a proper buy point headed into earnings. In fact, its rally has been so strong, it triggered an IBD sell rule that says to generally take profits in a stock when the gain hits 20%. The rule is there because after a stock rallies 20% past a buy point, it's usually around the time it starts to pull back in price and build a new base.With about one hour remaining in the session, the Dow was up 0.5%; the while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 added 0.1% each. Small caps lagged after a solid performance Wednesday, falling 0.3%. Volume was lower on the NYSE and slightly higher on the Nasdaq.The two-day FOMC ended today. The decision to keep interest rates steady at 1% to 1.25% was unanimous, and the Fed said the process of selling bonds to shrink its bloated $4.5 trillion balance sheet will begin ""relatively soon,"" perhaps as early as the September meeting.In the stock market today, technical breakouts for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Texas Instruments (TXN) looked good for a while but faded.AMD gapped up over a 14.77 buy point, rising 5% to 14.81, but the stock was near its session low after early strength. Ditto with Texas Instruments. Shares broke out early over an 82.91 buy point, but the stock was recently trading around 82.45, up 1%.Advanced Micro has the look of a turnaround story after the company reported its fourth straight quarter of double-digit sales growth. Nvidia is a daunting competitor for AMD, but AMD's graphics cards for gaming continue to see strong demand, and the company is making inroads in the nascent field of artificial intelligence.Inside the IBD 50, China-based education stocks saw the most interest. TAL Education (TAL) jumped nearly 4% to 149.71 ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. New Oriental Education (EDU) gained 3% to 83.04, following through nicely after Wednesday's upside reversal. New Oriental is still in buy range from an 82.72 cup-with-handle buy point.September West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rose almost 2% to 48.75, after data showed domestic crude supplies falling by 7.2 million barrels in the latest week, more than expected, and the fourth straight weekly drawdown.Watch for earnings reports after the close from solid performers like Fortinet (FTNT), Facebook (FB), ServiceNow (NOW) and and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), among others.RELATED:The Fed Leaves Balance Sheet Unchanged, Will Act 'Relatively Soon'Here Are Key Areas To Focus On When Facebook Reports Earnings

265,TXN,"When a market becomes mature and commoditized — the way much of the semiconductor market is — one way to kick growth into higher gear is to find an advanced niche where there's little competition.That's the route Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) has taken to turn its financial performance around.The company long has supplied semiconductors to mature markets, such as automotive navigation systems. But most of its growth is expected to come from advanced applications for the communications and defense industries, where customers include big tech names such as Cisco (CSCO) and leading military suppliers like Northrop Grumman (NOC).Because of the advanced technologies involved with it, it's not a niche just any company can enter.""Our recipe for growth is identifying areas of new technologies, new materials and new markets that require our technology,"" Chief Executive John Croteau told Investor's Business Daily.While mainstream semiconductor companies such as Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN) have struggled with sluggish revenue growth for several years, Macom has run off five straight quarters of double-digit sales gains.Gains Of 20%Macom has boosted revenue at least 20% the past four quarters. Compare that with the preceding 12, when Macom logged only one quarter of double-digit revenue growth accompanied by five quarters of declines.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Macom's annual earnings to grow 52% this fiscal year and 30% next year. The company's stock price trades near 43 and is up more than 50% since Aug. 24.""Specialized design capabilities and proprietary, advanced manufacturing processes allow Macom to maintain high barriers to entry,"" JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur noted in a recent research report.Macom makes semiconductor products that cover high-speed optical, satellite, radar, wired and wireless networks. Their products can be found in automotive, industrial, medical and mobile devices.Macom gear also will show up in unusual places. It recently won a technical Emmy award for providing video switching gear.But Macom operates in a pretty narrow sector of the semiconductor market, says Croteau.""It's a relatively esoteric niche,"" he said. ""We specialize in very high-performance semiconductors designed to achieve everything from radio frequency to lasers. This is not your mainstream commodity semiconductor business.""Optical NetworkingThe first growth market Macom identified was optical networking. In this market, the firm's portfolio includes components for optical communications that range from data center networks to long-haul and metro core networks designed to accommodate a wide area.Part of Macom's growth in the market for optical fiber networks is expected to come from China, where Croteau said the company has ""established a strong position.""Fi-Best BuyThat position was strengthened further earlier this month, when Macom closed its acquisition of FiBest, a supplier of optical subassemblies, in nearby Japan.Croteau says the deal gives Macom a new sales channel in an estimated $500 million radio-frequency and microwave-component market in Japan, plus easier access to China's market.""You need to have a strong channel in position, and one of the secondary benefits of the FiBest buyout is that it establishes an indigenous position in Japan where we are able to service China,"" he said.Another growth area is the market for gallium nitride semiconductors used in bright, light-emitting diodes, where Croteau says the company has established a leadership position in terms of commercializing next-generation technology.A third area of growth is in radar systems, where Macom and MIT's Lincoln Laboratory — a federally funded research and development center — are jointly developing a multifunction phased-array radar panel designed for civil and military radar applications.""It's a new way to build defense and civil radar,"" Croteau said.He says each of these three growth areas — optical, gallium nitride and radar — has the potential to double Macom's size.Expanding Via AcquisitionsMeanwhile, Macom has used buyouts to expand into new markets and product areas. Its latest deal came Dec. 14, when it announced the acquisition of Aeroflex's diode business for $38 million in cash.JPMorgan's Sur said in a note to client the deal helps Macom's leadership position in radio frequency and microwave diodes, rectifiers and power transistors.""Aeroflex is currently the second-largest supplier of (radio frequency) and microwave diodes and is a large player in the high-reliability rectifiers and power transistors (radio frequency) and microwave business,"" Sur said.Macom, however, will slow its acquisition pace in 2016, Croteau said: ""We are now at the stage where 100% of the challenge before us is operational and execution. It's a lot of work — being able to double, triple or quadruple your output is not a trivial task. The right thing to do now is focus on that rather than M&A.""While Macom itself would make a logical acquisition target for a larger semiconductor company, Croteau doesn't expect the company to be gobbled up soon.""You hear a lot of chatter about Macom being the last one standing in the space, which makes us a potential target for acquisition,"" he said. ""But we operate in a space that is really not considered to be a primary area of focus for the guys with deep pockets. If what we did was important to them, they probably would have (acquired us) a long time ago. So we would expect to still be Macom five years from now.""

275,TXN,"Flipping The Paradigm
"
276,TXN,"China plans to flip a longstanding paradigm. The country consumes roughly half the world's $350 billion in chips, but only accounts for 2.5% of the sector's revenue, according to Nanochip Fab Solutions . Chips, in fact, are China's biggest import, says Nanochip.
"
277,TXN,"In June 2014, the government pledged to curb China's reliance on foreign semiconductors.
"
278,TXN,"By 2020, China aims to generate 350 billion yuan ($55 billion) in domestic chip revenue, seeking a compound annual growth rate of 20%. No more than 10 years later, the country wants a top-tier semiconductor company. Thus, the National Semiconductor Industry Investment Fund was born.
"
279,TXN,"Tsinghua is one of 16 shareholders of the fund — a $100 billion pot of which 60% will be directed toward manufacturing acquisitions, according to Semi.org. Groups in Shanghai and Beijing, too, have planned hefty chip investments.
"
280,TXN,"But Tsinghua has been particularly vocal about its goal. Last month, Chairman Zhao Weiguo told Reuters the group will invest $47 billion over five years to become the world's No. 3 chipmaker, behind No. 1 Intel (INTC) and Samsung.
"
281,TXN,"""If you can't be the top-three giant, it will be very hard to develop your business in the chip industry,"" he told Reuters. ""The next five years is key. ... there is an enormous market there.""
"
282,TXN,"Intel and Samsung Electronics have market valued near $164 billion and $160 billion, respectively. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) follows in value at $118 billion, but it's a manufacturer that doesn't design its own chips, so it's in a little bit of a different market, with thinner profit margins. Qualcomm is No. 4 in chip company market value, near $73 billion.
"
283,TXN,"""Qualcomm is most at risk because they are already seeing their dominant position in cellphones being challenged, with Samsung and Apple and in the Chinese smartphone market,"" Lidow said. ""They are most vulnerable, for sure.""
"
284,TXN,"Tangling With U.S. Government
"
285,TXN,"Tsinghua already has invested billions in chip acquisitions, buying China chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications for $1.8 billion and RDA Microelectronics for $900 million in 2013 and 2014. But getting its hands on a U.S. company is much more difficult, since the U.S. aims to protect its chip industry trade secrets and intellectual property.
"
286,TXN,"In August, Tsinghua made an unsolicited $23 billion bid for Boise, Idaho-based Micron, showing its serious interest in flash memory technology. Wall Street scoffed, saying the U.S. Department of Defense would block that transaction. And the informal bid seemingly has gone nowhere.

287,TXN,"""That's one of the reasons Chinese fabs aren't up to par with U.S. fabs, because they're somewhat restricted as to the technology they have access to,"" Semiconductor Advisors analyst Robert Maire told IBD.

"
290,TXN,"Last month, Tsinghua invested $3.8 billion in Irvine, Calif.-based Western Digital (WDC), a month after Western Digital agreed to buy Milpitas, Calif.-based flash chip maker SanDisk (SNDK) for $19 billion.
"
291,TXN,"By investing in Western Digital, Tsinghua got itself that much closer to U.S. chip patents, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD.
"

"
293,TXN,"China could also make a play for Milpitas, Calif.-based GlobalFoundries, the manufacturing spinoff of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) with fabs in Singapore, Germany and the U.S. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi owns the company and might be looking for a buyer.
"
294,TXN,"To compete with the mature U.S. semiconductor market, Tsinghua ""needs to bulk up,"" Maire said. Fabs such as GlobalFoundries and Taiwan Semiconductor carry significant heft.
"
295,TXN,"""With Micron, U.S. legislators would never let that go through,"" he said. ""But (Tsinghua) could get around (U.S. regulations) and get around the technological hurdles by cutting a deal with GlobalFoundries.

417,TXN,"IIntel (INTC) needs to hit a home run with its Altera acquisition, says a Morgan Stanley semiconductor M&A; report, which adds that deals focused on cost savings and profit margins have proved the most successful for chipmakers.Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore says chip industry consolidation appears to be ""in the middle innings,"" with more acquisitions to come. Moore views Qualcomm (QCOM), Texas Instruments (TXN), Micron Technology (MU) and Microchip (MCHP) as potential buyers.Among potential targets, Moore cites Atmel (ATML), Inphi (IPHI), SanDisk (SNDK) and Cavium (CAVM).In a separate research report Thursday, FBR also identified companies such as Atmel and Cavium as buyout candidates in the consolidating chip industry.Intel announced its $16.7 billion purchase of Altera, a programmable chip specialist, on Monday. The deal follows an acquisition spree by Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago Technologies (AVGO). Avago in May agreed to buy Broadcom in a $37 billion cash-and-stock deal, marking the biggest chip industry merger ever.""Acquisitions made on the basis of operational synergies and margin enhancement have the best shot to succeed,"" said Moore in his report. ""Avago is our top way to play industry M&A;, while we are negative on Intel's approach.""Besides Altera, Intel has recently acquired Lantiq and Axxia, and has bought stakes in Spreadtrum and Cloudera. But ""Intel's objective of diversifying its core microprocessor business through M&A; has not gelled,"" Moore wrote.The Morgan Stanley analyst warned that many past chip industry mergers failed to create revenue synergies. Moore says a combination of factors will drive more M&A.;He wrote: ""Intel is looking to continue monetizing its manufacturing leadership and add to its portfolio; Qualcomm may look to defend its turf and possibly look at data center opportunities; Avago has been looking for value-accretion and cost reduction-portfolio improvement opportunities; and Texas Instruments will look to add to its analog portfolio.""He also wrote, ""Micron will look to continue to consolidate memory suppliers, while Microchip will continue to diversify.""

Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) also raised their full-year earnings outlooks after reporting Q2 earnings results above estimates. Northrop said its aerospace-system sales climbed on higher manned-aircraft demand, including work on its E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. Raytheon saw higher air-defense missile and smart bomb sales and General Dynamics' revenue got support from strong Gulfstream and defense-product demand.Boeing shares soared 14% for the week.

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December. The real uncertainty, hinging on the inflation outlook, is what Fed policy will look like in 2018.A flurry of chip-industry players posted beat-and-raise June-quarter results including chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as chip-gear suppliers Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).AMD earned an adjusted 2 cents a share on sales of $1.22 billion in Q2, when analysts expected it to break even on sales $1.16 billion.

Concerns about mass-market gaming in Macau weighed on Wynn, whose Q2 results nonetheless beat estimates. MGM offered a weak revenue-per-available-room outlook. It also cited ""higher-than-anticipated disruption"" at the Monte Carlo, which is being revamped into Park MGM, and a ""challenging comparison"" on the Las Vegas Strip in Q3. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped; results from Melco and U.S.-focused Boyd Gaming (BYD) and Penn National Gaming (PENN) were mixed.Shares in AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) soared after the telecoms reported better-than-expected wireless results amid stiff competition.

Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled after fiscal-Q3 same-store sales and revenue missed; EPS matched views. The coffee chain said it would close all 379 Teavana retail stores.Several industrial Dow giants rolled past Q2 estimates Tuesday thanks in part to improved global growth.

United Technologies (UTX) saw earnings climb 1.6% to $1.85 per share on a 2.7% revenue rise to $15.28 billion. Shares tumbled to their lowest level since May despite raised full-year EPS and revenue guidance. DuPont (DD) also beat on the top and bottom lines. Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed. The outlook for providers of computer-security software has yet to improve despite recent  ransomware attacks. Fortinet shares tumbled.TAL Education (TAL) topped earnings and sales estimates, as per-share profit of 43 cents and revenue of $321.9 million came out ahead of forecasts for 28 cents and $307.8 million.

Jefferies maintained its buy rating on Nvidia and upped its price target to 180 from 140.Mizuho Securities kept its neutral rating on Microchip, but increased its price target to 82 from 80.Nvidia soared 4.7% to 153.70 on the stock market today. Microchip rose 0.5% to 78.76.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill increased his price target on Nvidia stock on expectations that the company's recent deal with Toyota Motor (TM) will generate ""meaningful revenue over the next 24 months.""Toyota is using Nvidia chip sets for advanced driver assistance systems and eventually self-driving cars.Gill estimates that the Toyota deal could generate an incremental $1 billion to $1.7 billion in revenue and 35 to 65 cents in earnings per share over 2.5 years.Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis sees Nvidia as a ""key beneficiary of the 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing"" because it supplies systems for deep learning applications.""Nvidia's decadelong investment in CUDA, its proprietary GPU-processing language has resulted in a multiyear competitive advantage, that has yet to be fully appreciated by investors,"" Lipacis said in a note to clients. Nvidia is a leader in graphics processing units, or GPUs.Previous shifts in computing included the move from mainframes to minicomputers, minicomputers to PCs, and PCs to mobile phones and data centers. The latest shift is to parallel processing, artificial intelligence and the internet of things, Lipacis said.In addition to Nvidia, other chipmakers likely to benefit from the growth of parallel processing include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cavium (CAVM) and Xilinx (XLNX), he said.Lipacis upgraded Cavium and Xilinx to buy from hold. He raised his price target on Cavium to 79 from 73 and upped his price target on Xilinx to 77 from 68.Likely beneficiaries of the internet-of-things trend include Analog Devices (ADI), Microchip Technology, Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Intel (INTC) has ""the most to lose"" in the shift from traditional data centers to parallel processing and internet of things. As such, Lipacis downgraded Intel stock to underperform from hold and slashed his price target to 29 from 38.Intel dropped 0.7% to 33.65 on Monday.Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh updated his ratings on a host of semiconductor stocks on Monday.He raised his price targets on AMD, Microchip, Texas Instruments and Xilinx, but cut his target on Qorvo (QRVO).Rakesh reiterated his buy rating on AMD and upped his price target to 15 from 14. AMD is seen benefiting from second-half 2017 game console sales and improved demand for PCs and graphics processors.Microchip is continuing to see strong orders from automotive and industrial markets, Rakesh said.Texas Instruments also is benefiting from growth in the automotive and industrial markets. Rakesh rates TI as neutral, but upped his price target to 82 from 78.Xilinx is seeing opportunities in automotive and 5G wireless deployments, but trades at a premium multiple, Rakesh said. He rates Xilinx as neutral, but raised his price target to 68 from 64.Qorvo is likely to be impacted by near-term weakness in the China mobile phone market and faces high expectations for wireless revenue in the September quarter. Rakesh maintained his hold rating on Qorvo and cut his price target to 70 from 72.RELATED:Apple-Qualcomm Legal Dispute Likely To Be 'Long And Ugly'Chipmakers Microsemi, Skyworks Solutions Snare Fresh Buy Ratings

421,TXN,"The Nasdaq fell for a second straight week, with many big-cap techs struggling, while the Dow industrials edged higher for a fourth straight weekly gain. It's an uneven market. With the uptrend under pressure, investors should be especially cautious about buying even leading stocks.X In a choppy market, breakouts are more apt to fail. Apple (AAPL) chipmakers Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS), along with NetEase (NTES) and Ciena (CIEN) have all seen their breakouts fail in recent days.IBD'S TAKE: The ""M"" in CAN SLIM stands for market. Here's why market direction is key to winning in stocks.Analog Devices broke out of a cup base on May 30. The next day, Analog Devices reported strong earnings, and shares sprinted almost 7% soon after the open to 90.49. But Analog pulled all the way back to 85.76 by the close. In the next three sessions, Analog plunged through its buy point and then its 50-day moving average. Since then shares have been up and down, though they are currently just above their 50-day line.Texas Instruments tried several times to clear an 82.54 buy point, finally appearing to do so last week. But the stock plunged 4.1% last Friday. This week, TI is down 2%, moving below its 50-day line. While Texas Instruments hasn't fallen 7%-8% below the entry points, the technical action has not been encouraging.Cirrus Logic initially cleared a cup-base entry on April 7, but moved in and out of a buy zone until after a May 18 rebound from the 50-day line. Cirrus Logic then steadily rose, even becoming extended in early June. But shares tumbled 5.4% on Friday and 4% on Monday, dropping below their buy point and the 50-day line. The stock is now 12% off its high, making that old entry point invalid.The iPhone chipmakers' stumbles come amid Apple's own stock woes. Apple consolidated for several weeks, and appeared to be on its way toward sketching a short flat base. But shares crashed 3.9% last Friday. This week, the stock has fallen 4.5%. And unlike many leading techs, Apple hasn't found support at its 50-day moving average.The Chinese mobile-gaming platform broke out of a cup-with-handle base on June 5. NetEase was clearing a late-stage base, which is more likely fail. Still, shares extended gains the next session. But after hitting an all-time intraday high on June 7, shares began to reverse hard, falling below the entry area on Tuesday and continuing to fall. The depth of NetEase's decline from the high and the buy point both make the old buy point invalid, even with Friday's modest rebound.NetEase's retreat came amid a pullback by many Chinese internet giants. YY (YY), a live group video-chat player, saw its own late-May breakout trigger a sell signal this week.The fiber-optic gear giant gapped out of a cup base on June 1 on earnings, soaring 16% to 27.19, just above a 26.94 buy point. But two sessions later, Ciena was below the entry, and shares have now fallen far enough to make the buy point invalid.RELATED:The Big Picture: Two Sectors Move Up3 Chip Stocks Are Plays On iPhone 8-Led Wireless Charging Shift3 China-Based Leaders, 2 Sell Signals And Signs Of StrengthTired Of Tech Swings?

Still, those sales grew 15% sequentially, meaning Cirrus Logic is on track to hit its 15% target for fiscal 2017, Gill says.Cirrus Logic stock jumped 19% to close at 49.82 on the stock market today. Shares are 30% extended from a 38.24 entry point out of a cup-with-handle base achieved July 8. Investors are typically advised to take some profits at 20%.IBD'S TAKE: Cirrus Logic stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, meaning it performs in the top 20% of all stocks in terms of key metrics. It's in IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which ranks No. 23 out of 197 groups tracked.For its fiscal Q1, Cirrus Logic reported 44 cents earnings per share ex items on $259.4 million in sales, down a respective 19% and 8% vs. last year. But both metrics crushed the consensus for $236.4 million and 28 cents.Current-quarter sales guidance for $380 million to $410 million would grow 29% at the midpoint, beating analysts' model for $322.6 million. Cirrus Logic didn't provide an EPS estimate, but the consensus put earnings at 66 cents a share, up a penny year over year.That guidance indicates a 40% dollar-content increase in Apple's iPhone 7 vs. the iPhone 6S which debuted in September 2015, Gill wrote in a research report. He reiterated his buy rating and boosted his price target to 55 from 50 on Cirrus Logic stock.Gill expects Cirrus Logic to see another 30% increase in chip content in the iPhone 8, expected to launch in fall 2017. Analysts have long-speculated Apple will eliminate the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack in the iPhone 7 and introduce noise-cancelling headphones in the iPhone 8.""At Apple, we believe Cirrus Logic is also well-positioned next year for the iPhone 8, which we believe will be the 'super' upgrade cycle,"" he wrote. ""Units should grow year over year.""Cirrus Logic could also see $450 million to $500 million in incremental Android sales over the next several years, Gill predicted. For fiscal 2018, Cirrus Logic will likely expand into mid-tier smartphones, see higher sales of noise-cancelling chipsets and additional amplifier sales.He forecasts 12% sequential growth in the September quarter as Apple ramps the iPhone 7 and a 30% sequential decline in March as it comes off that ramp.Pacific Crest's John Vinh agrees on Cirrus Logic's likely dollar-content gain in the iPhone 7 -- he models a 70% increase at an additional $2.50 per unit -- but isn't as bullish on Apple's upcoming smartphone.""Consistent with results seen from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Texas Instruments (TXN), AMS AG, Knowles and Dialog Semiconductor, Cirrus noted that it was seeing a more cautious iPhone 7 ramp compared to last year,"" he wrote in a report.Last week, Skyworks offered September-quarter EPS and sales guidance in line with Wall Street estimates, but which would both decline 6% vs. last year. Texas Instruments' Q3 guidance  this week topped analysts' views, but its strength in Q2 was largely on automotive sales. Personal electronics declined vs. last year, led by a dip in mobile phones.Component orders for the iPhone 7 are down 15%-20% vs. the iPhone 6S ramp in the second half of 2016, Vinh wrote. He kept his sector weight rating on Cirrus Logic which, he says, already reflects Wall Street speculation of boosted iPhone 7 dollar content.Cirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode told analysts late Wednesday he doesn't expect ""outlandish unit growth in the mobile market,"" but he still sees a strong content-growth story.

425,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is expected late Wednesday to report Q2 sales that more than doubled vs. a year earlier, following its Freescale acquisition, but which also declined for the third consecutive quarter.At the closing bell on the stock market today, NXP stock was down 0.5% to 83.95. Shares are flat for the year vs. an 11% rise for IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group.NXP Semi rose nearly 2% in late trading, likely on Texas Instruments (TXN), which reported better-than-expected earnings and guidance following the market close. Texas Instruments, which also is an Apple chip supplier, cited strong demand for auto-related chips.IBD'S TAKE: NXP stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 65, meaning it outperforms nearly two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key metrics like earnings power. The group is topped by ARM Holdings with a CR of 99. ARM is soon to be acquired by SoftBank.For Q2 ended in June, NXP is expected to report $2.35 billion in sales and $1.35 earnings per share ex items, up 56% and down 6%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. NXP earlier guided to $2.29 billion to $2.39 billion and $1.30 to $1.40.NXP's sales also doubled in Q1 following its acquisition of automotive-chip leader Freescale Semiconductor. Following the Freescale deal, 36% of NXP's Q1 sales were tied to automotive vs. 21% in the mobile sector where NXP supplies chips for Apple and others.The consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects NXP's sales to double again vs. last year, with earnings re-accelerating after three quarters in decline. Apple is expected to roll out its iPhone 7 on Sept. 16.

426,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) chip supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) late Wednesday reported second-quarter earnings of $1.39, down 3.5% vs. a year earlier. Revenue rose 57% to $2.365 billion, helped by its recent Freescale acquisition.Analysts had expected NXP Semiconductors to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.35, down 6%, on revenue of $2.35 billion.NXP Semi sees Q3 revenue of $2.415 billion to $2.515 billion, a 62% year-over-year gain at the midpoint.NXP Semi's report came so late that investors will have to wait until Thursday morning to weigh in on the chipmaker's results. NXP Semi closed down 0.5% to 87.44 on the stock market today. NXP rose 4.7% on Tuesday, gapping above its 50-day moving average.Auto-related chips are now NXP's top sector thanks to its Freescale buy, 36% of total Q2 revenue. Auto sector demand has surpassed chips for the Apple iPhone and the broader mobile sector.NXP CEO Richard Clemmer said in a statement: ""On a comparable basis, total revenue was down approximately 8 percent year on year, notwithstanding our Automotive operating segment which delivered positive year-on-year comparable growth.  We believe we have begun to see incremental positive trends in a number of our businesses, with comparable sequential revenue up approximately 6 percent into the second quarter.  While we anticipate many of the headwinds experienced in the second half of 2015 should begin to generally subside in the coming quarters, the overall demand environment currently continues to be subdued.""IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is another Apple supplier that has made acquisitions to diversify. Broadcom broke out of a base Wednesday.Apple shares rose 6.5% Wednesday after earnings and iPhone sales fell less than expected, but it was still a sharp decline for both.Another Apple supplier, Texas Instruments (TXN), on Monday reported better-than-expected earnings and guidance, citing strong auto chip demand. Texas Instruments leapt nearly 8% Tuesday, hitting a 16-year high.Analog Devices (ADI) on Tuesday agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) for $14.8 billion. The Linear Tech deal will cut Analog Devices' Apple exposure to under 5%, Morgan Stanley estimated.
"
427,TXN,"The iPhone SE helped Apple (AAPL) edge Wall Street's June-quarter smartphone unit sales projections, but shares of iPhone chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) lazed Wednesday.Analysts continue to have modest expectations for the iPhone 7, set to launch Sept. 16.Late Tuesday, Apple said it sold 40.4 million iPhones in its fiscal Q3, topping analyst models for 40 million but still declining 15% vs. the year-earlier period. Apple's revenue fell 23% to $24.05 billion. The company saw broad demand for the less-costly and smaller SE model.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which includes leaders like ARM Holdings, Nvidia and Monolithic Power Systems, ranks No. 21 out of 197 groups tracked. But the other chip group, the 39-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group, is moving up. It ranks No. 70 and has climbed from No. 163 over the past eight weeks.FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi models 46 million iPhones shipments in fiscal Q4, which would be roughly flat year over year. Revenue, though, would decline 16% on demand for the iPhone SE, he predicts.Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay expects iPhone sales to be down year over year for the next couple quarters. For the September quarter, he models 44.4 million iPhones sold, but with improving average sales prices.Apple's fiscal Q4 guidance implies 44 million units, which tops the consensus for 43 million, Ramsay wrote in a research report. Fewer units sold would be bad news for Apple's slew of chip suppliers. Some, however, have said increasing content in the iPhone 7 could offset slower sales. Apple shares jumped 6.5% to 102.95 Wednesday.Qorvo (QRVO) stock rocketed as much as 7% in early trading before settling back to a 4.4% gain at the close to 63.01 on the stock market today. Shares are about 22% extended from a 52.05 entry point achieved July 6 out of a cup-with-handle base. Investors are typically advised to take some profits at 20%.Texas Instruments (TXN) stock edged down marginally to 71.27, but Tuesday it hit a 16-year high on strong Q2 growth tied to sales of automotive chips. Shares are about 17% extended from a 60.09 entry point hit June 28 out of a flat base.Broadcom shares climbed 1.4% to 165.66 at the close, flirting with a 166.10 entry point out of a cup-with-handle base. Earlier, shares rose as much as 3%. Qualcomm stock also was up a fraction. It reported consensus-topping fiscal Q3 sales last week.Skyworks stock jumped as much as 4% early Wednesday, but settled for a 0.9% gain to 66.47. That led to a fractional dip in shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) to 87.44. NXP stock has been forming a cup base over the last eight weeks.

428,TXN,"Apple (AAPL) is looking to bolster its iPhone profits by pressuring component suppliers for price discounts, says RBC Capital Markets.""We think Apple has been pushing for price discounts from multiple suppliers as a way to dampen foreign-exchange headwinds Apple is facing on their own P&L heading into the iPhone 7 ramps,"" RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research report Tuesday.As a result, Apple could see upside to its gross profit margin, which it guided as flat for the September quarter, he said.Some Apple suppliers could see downside to their earnings, especially where multiple vendors supply the same component, he said.Single-source suppliers to Apple should be more resilient, Daryanani said. They include Broadcom (AVGO) and Analog Devices (ADI), he said.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Broadcom is also on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.A consistent trend from the June-quarter earnings season was Apple component suppliers guiding gross margins lower, Daryanani said.""Ten out of 11 suppliers that we tracked saw gross margins head lower for second-half 2016 vs. prior expectations (the only exception was TTM Technologies (TTMI)),"" he said.Daryanani rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 115. Apple stock rose 0.4% to 108.81 on the stock market today. Apple has risen for eight of the last 10 trading sessions, since reporting better-than-expected June quarter results and guiding Wall Street higher for the September quarter.Some chip companies get a majority of their revenue from Apple. And quite a few firms get 10% or more of their sales from supplying Apple. In his report, Daryanani spelled out which companies get the most business from Apple.Companies with the greatest exposure to Apple business include Dialog Semiconductor (75% of revenue), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) (66%), Foxconn (over 50%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) (44%), Qorvo (QRVO) (32%), Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASX) (31%) and InvenSense (INVN) (30%).Companies with less exposure to Apple, but which still get a significant share of sales from the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, include: Knowles (KN) (25%), Jabil Circuit (JBL) (24%), TTM (20%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) (16%), Pegatron (15%-25%), Broadcom (15%-20%), Analog Devices (13%), Qualcomm (QCOM) (13%), Texas Instruments (TXN) (11%) and Amphenol (APH) (10%).Companies with small exposure to Apple business include Intel (INTC) (3%-5%), Flextronics (FLEX) (3%-4%) and Nvidia (NVDA) (3%-4%), Daryanani said.

432,TXN,"Wall Street expects Apple (AAPL) to post modest revenue and earnings growth in the June quarter, despite worries about slowing iPhone sales ahead of the launch of the company's 11th-generation model.XAnalysts say Apple is likely to give conservative guidance for the September quarter, given uncertainties around the launch date and initial supply of the rumored iPhone 8 and other new handsets. Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple is scheduled to deliver its fiscal third-quarter results and give fiscal fourth-quarter guidance after the market close on Aug. 1.Wall Street is modeling for Apple to earn $1.57 a share, up 11% year over year, on sales of $44.92 billion, up 6%, in the June quarter. For the current quarter, analysts are looking for Apple to earn $1.85 a share, up 11%, on sales of $49.94 billion, up 7%.""For fiscal Q4, we expect the outlook to be in-line to slightly below estimates,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said in a note to clients Thursday.He rates Apple stock as neutral with a price target of 150.""We remain on the sidelines given our view that the large upcoming (iPhone) cycle is already baked into the stock,"" he said.Apple was down a fraction to close at 150.27 on the stock market today.

434,TXN,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average edged higher early Wednesday ahead of a new wave of big earnings and the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement.Strong results late Tuesday from Texas Instruments (TXN) and AT&T (T), are good news for Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem ahead of Apple's own earnings. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are among four IBD 50 stocks with earnings due Wednesday, with Facebook providing further evidence that is beating back Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).XThe Dow industrials rose 0.5% in Tuesday's regular session, led by earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD) as well as strength in financials. The Nasdaq composite, weighed down by Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), closed just above break-even, but did hit a new all-time high. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3% to a fresh record.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit yet another record intraday low on Tuesday. VIX lows are a sign of investor complacency and often associated with at least short-term market tops.Still, S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures 0.2% as equities generally advanced across the globe. Crude oil prices continued to climb after big gains Tuesday.The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes Wednesday afternoon, though policymakers could surprise and announce a plan to let the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet start to decline. Most analysts see that shift happening at the September meeting.President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple will build three plants in the U.S. Trump has made similar statements before. Apple had no comment Tuesday. U.S. operations would ease political pressures, but would likely be more expensive. It's possible that Foxconn, a key assembler of iPhones, could set up some plant in America.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday and gave bullish guidance. Texas Instruments is big in automotive chips and many other segments, as well as in mobile devices like the Apple iPhone. But TI follows a beat-and-raise last week from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone chipmaker and an IBD 50 member.AT&T reported better-than-expected wireless subscriber figures, while churn hit a record low. That's a good sign for Apple iPhone sales during what could be a spring lull ahead of the iPhone 8 later this year. Relatively strong iPhone 7 demand is key, given the likelihood that the next-generation iPhone will be delayed.Apple shares edged higher in premarket trading. Apple closed up 0.4% to 152.73 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple is approaching a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Facebook, PayPal, Lam Research (LRCX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) are IBD 50 stocks reporting earnings on Wednesday. Also, Facebook, PayPal and Lam Research all boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means they outperform 99% of all other stocks based on proprietary fundamental and technical ratings. Big stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big price runs.Facebook will be the third FANG (Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet) stock to report Q2 results, following Alphabet late Monday and Netflix last week. Amazon is set to close out FANG earnings on Thursday.Facebook will presumably provide some new figures about the growing popularity of Instagram Stories and other offerings that clone Snapchat features. But here's a stat that's already out. Since Snap's March 1 IPO, Facebook's market capitalization has increased by about $81 billion to $479 billion. Snap's market value has retreated to just $16.4 billion. So Facebook has added the equivalent of nearly five Snapchats in Snap's brief history as a public firm.Facebook dipped 0.4% to 165.28 in Tuesday stock market trading after hitting a fresh record high on Monday. Facebook is extended from any possible entry.

435,TXN,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turn higher Friday after the Nasdaq composite closed Thursday below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell back below their 50-day lines, joining Apple, Netflix and many others. Some stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), are holding support. But they are fighting against the tide.Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value after falling for much of the overnight session. Futures for the S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and Dow futures climbed 0.35%. Crude futures rose nearly 1% after gaining for several days in a row.XThis year's broad tech rally was fueled by several big trends: FANG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet, plus Apple), China internets, chipmakers, optical gear plays and, more recently, enterprise software firms.But more and more stocks are breaking 50-day lines or round-tripping on breakouts.Apple tumbled below its 50-day moving average on June 10 and hasn't found a way back. Even with recent struggles, including Thursday's 1.5% loss, Apple is still up 24% in 2017, the third-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Microsoft and Alphabet on Tuesday closed just below their 50-day lines and bounced back on Wednesday. On Thursday, both Microsoft and Google's parent fell more decisively below that key support line. Microsoft and Alphabet are among the biggest cloud-computing rivals to much-larger Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: The market direction is still uptrend under pressure, which means investors should be cautious about taking new positions and ready to take profits and cut losses quickly. Pay attention to the leading stocks and major averages and read The Big Picture daily.Facebook traded below its 50-day line intraday for the fifth time in June, but once again closed above that line. Facebook announced this week that it has topped two billion monthly users. What makes that even more amazing is that the social giant is blocked in China, the world's largest internet market.Amazon has pulled back toward its 50-day line but has found support so far. Amazon continues to roil the retail, apparel and broader consumer fields, with Nike (NKE) confirming in its Thursday night earnings call that it will sell some shoes directly via the e-commerce giant.Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) have fallen below their 50-day lines. NetEase (NTES) is once again round-tripping its late-stage breakout. And Tencent (TCEHY) pulled back into its three-weeks-tight pattern.But Alibaba (BABA) remains strong, and YY (YY) found support above its 50-day and is still in buy range.IBD's semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor fabless groups have fallen below their 50-day moving averages, a few days after the chip equipment group undercut that level.Apple iPhone chipmakers in particular are struggling. Broadcom (AVGO) finally fell below its 50-day line on Thursday after several other Apple chip plays did the same, including Skyworks (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI).A slew of top-rated chip equipment makers, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), are below their 50-day lines.Nvidia (NVDA) remains a standout.Fiber-optic stocks have been volatile leaders over the past year, as internet giants ramp up data centers, China beefs up infrastructure and Verizon (VZ) expands its high-speed metro broadband networks.But the Telecom-Fiber Optic group has fallen through its 50-day line. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), one of the hottest stocks in the group, is finding resistance there this week. Lumentum (LITE), which is seen as a possible Apple iPhone 3D sensor play, is close to round-tripping.Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) and SAP (SAP) are all below their 50-day moving averages.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both had strong earnings last week, are holding up well so far.While many techs are weak, financials are making gains, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) a notable breakout this week. Big banks announced huge dividend hikes and stock buybacks late Wednesday after passing the second round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Meanwhile, higher Treasury yields, while a negative for the broader stock market (and housing stocks in particular), also are giving a lift to financials.Meanwhile, biotechs have been big winners in June. Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN) are two big-name breakouts, but there have been others.Defense and aerospace firms like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have held up well, either within buy range or just extended.In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 1.7% but China's Shanghai composite rose 0.1% 0.2%.

436,TXN,"Two key semiconductor ETFs are setting up an opportunity to buy shares as they bounce off their respective 50-day moving average lines.IShares PHLX Semiconductors (SOXX), which sank nearly 3% Tuesday to its 50-day line amid a tech sell-off, rebounded off the support line Wednesday. That gives investors a chance to buy shares, though the market uptrend under pressure heightens risk of all buys.X The ETF ran up 13% from an early May breakout past a 138.06 flat-base buy point before pulling back. It rallied 21% after breaking out from a prior flat base late last year.SOXX, which marks its 16th anniversary July 10, has attracted nearly $1.1 billion in assets. The fund tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index. U.S. stocks accounted for 82% of assets as of June 26, according to Morningstar Inc. It carries a 0.48% expense ratio.Top holdings included Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (BRCM), Qualcomm (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel (INTC). Nvidia provided a big boost Wednesday with a 3.5% gain in above-average volume. Mizuho maintained a buy rating and raised its price target on the graphics chip designer to 170 from 145.SOXX has outperformed the broader market year to date (through June 27) with a 16.4% gain vs. the S&P 500's 9.1% advance. It boasts three-year and five-year average annual returns of 20.1% and 24.7%, respectively, vs. 9.5% and 15.1% for the benchmark index. The S&P 500 closes the gap with an 8.3% to 8.2% return over the 10 years.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH), which tracks the Market Vectors US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, also bounced off its 50-day line Wednesday. The $678 million fund, launched in December 2011, has 71% of its assets in U.S. equities.Its top names include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Intel, Qualcomm, Nvidia and Broadcom. Taiwan Semiconductor fell Monday and Tuesday, but also rebounded off support at it 50-day line Wednesday, setting up a buy opportunity. HSBC on Friday lowered its rating to hold from buy but raised its price target on the Taiwanese chipmaker.Like SOXX, SMH has beaten the broader market with respective YTD, three-year and five-year returns of 15.7%, 20.7% and 23.5%. The fund's expense ratio is 0.36%.Wednesday's foreign picks remain in a buy zone from their 50-day lines: iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) and iShares Core MSCI EAFE (IEFA) advanced nearly 1% each, while Vanguard FTSE Europe (VGK) also bounced about 1%.RELATED:Nvidia, Goldman Sachs Get PT Hikes; Expedia Is A BuyIs It The Right Time To Add Foreign Stocks To Your Portfolio?2 Income Plays Near Buy Points Own This Big Dividend Stock

437,TXN,"Chipmaker Cree is focusing more intently on its LED (light-emitting diode) strategy, announcing the $850 million sale of its power and RF (radio-frequency) division to Infineon Technologies -- news that sent Cree stock flying.On the stock market today, Cree lifted 10.6% to 27.74, hitting a 14-week high. Cree is now up for the year after being down 6% as of Wednesday vs. a 2% rise for IBD's 38-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group.The group ranks just No. 96 out of 197 groups tracked, but it's climbed from No. 169 in the past eight weeks. Leaders in the group include Apple (AAPL) suppliers Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel (INTC) which have Composite Ratings of 86 and 81, meaning they perform in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales and earnings growth, among other key metrics.IBD'S TAKE: Cree has a very low CR of 18, meaning it performs in the bottom 20% of all stocks in key metrics. But group leader Intel has made strong moves in recent days on speculation that it might take a chunk of Apple's iPhone 7 business.For Cree, moving further into LED-lighting taps into its 2015 strategy. At that time, Cree had planned to launch an initial public offering for Wolfspeed, its power and RF division. But now, Infineon plans to buy it by year's end in an all-cash offer.""Selling Wolfspeed to Infineon speeds our transition to a more-focused LED lighting company while providing significant resources to accelerate our growth,"" CEO Chuck Swoboda said in a statement.Divesting Wolfspeed will generate $585 million in net proceeds after taxes and other costs, Cree said.Under the terms of the deal, Infineon will acquire Cree's silicon carbide substrate business for power and its RF and gemstone applications. Both Cree's board of directors and Infineon's supervisory board have approved the transaction.The unit brought in $173 million in pro forma revenue for the 12 months ended March 27, Cree said. But it was Cree's smallest unit, accounting for only 7% of total sales vs. its bread-and-butter lighting unit (57%) and its LED unit (36%).Cree also preannounced its June-ended fiscal Q4 results, with $388 million in sales topping the consensus of 16 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $382.85. That would be up by single digits on a year-over-year basis vs. earlier expectations for flat sales and vs. declines in fiscal Q1 and Q3.LED lit the way for Cree's fiscal Q4 with $160 million in sales beating expectations. Lighting pulled in $197 million and was in line with projections. Wolfspeed met views at $31 million. Cree is slated to release its full fiscal Q4 results after the close Aug. 16.

538,TXN,"Computer-chip maker Monolithic Power Systems might not be a household name, at least compared to rivals such as Intel, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments.But anyone who has fired up Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 or Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One video game consoles or used a Blu-ray or DVD player has used Monolithic Power's (MPWR) state-of-the-art technology.The San Jose, Calif.-based company designs semiconductors, integrated circuits and other building blocks found in computers, medical equipment, LCD monitors, flat-panel TVs, set-top boxes and many other consumer electronics.One of Monolithic's advantages over rivals is its ability to get more from less, analysts say. Some of its modules are 90% smaller than those of competitors, use less energy and work faster.""I characterize their growth as growth by a thousand cuts, because they have so many design wins across so many different end markets,"" said Michael Lucarelli, an analyst at Evercore Partners.Lately, Monolithic's growth has moved into a higher gear. The company has run off three straight quarters of double-digit revenue gains, which hadn't happened in years.Outpacing Its IndustryDuring this year's first quarter, Monolithic logged revenue of $60.1 million, a gain of 17% from the previous year. That growth rate far outpaced the industry's average sales growth rate of 10%, according to Thomson Reuters.Meanwhile, Monolithic's stock price touched an all-time high of 43.49 on July 1 and is up about 20% since the beginning of the year.Using a fabless business model, Monolithic focuses solely on design and engineering. It outsources manufacturing to a third party to keep costs low.This model has helped Monolithic produce steady profits through the years, even though profit growth has fluctuated. First-quarter earnings this year more than doubled from a year earlier to 39 cents a share, topping analyst views for 33 cents.Monolithic is due to report second-quarter results on July 24. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 35 cents, a gain of 46% from the prior year. Sales are seen rising 16% to $67.1 million.On June 9, the company announced that it will pay a dividend of 15 cents per share for the second quarter.""Their dividend initiation is a signal to the investing world that they're confident in their near-term and long-term outlook,"" Lucarelli said. ""They plan on growing that as the design wins turn into revenues. They want to make shares more attractive to shareholders.""More Growth AheadAngelo Zino, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ, says that Monolithic can generate sales growth at an annualized rate of over 20% per year over the next three to five years.""There has been a major transformation that's taken place since 2011,"" Zino said. ""They've been able to diversify their market to new areas: industrial, automotive, cloud computing.""Consumer products used to account for about 70% of Monolithic sales. But by next year, they should account for around 50% as the company develops more components for commercial products, which carry higher profit margins, Lucarelli says.Although the consumer electronics market grows quickly, the products are not always profitable and may have short life cycles.One product that the company is bullish about is a high-current battery charger for tablets and battery packs, introduced a few quarters ago.These new chargers ""deliver the best efficiency performance in the market, which equates to faster time to charge for users,"" Monolithic Chief Financial Officer Meera Rao said.In addition, she says, Monolithic introduced the industry's first massive 900-volt flyback regulator designed specifically for industrial power-grid applications supporting wireless communication.""This product saves our customers from having to include a high-voltage blockage device,"" Rao said. ""And due to its high integration, it allows for improved ease of use, high reliability and the lowest overall solution cost.""Monolithic Power Module (MPM) solutions are roughly two years ahead of the competition and are expected to help drive Monolithic's growth over the next several years, Anil Doradla, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in a client note last month.""While the company's competition is able to offer only discrete solutions (that include multiple chips and are less power-efficient), Monolithic Power is able to differentiate its products by providing customers integrated solutions with superior performance,"" Doradla added.One risk for Monolithic is that its design wins don't guarantee that manufacturers will use its chips in their end products, and the company does not receive any payments up front.130 Days Of InventoryManufacturers might not need as many chips as they initially ordered, which can leave chipmakers with a glut of inventory. Monolithic currently has about ""$40 million in inventory, or about 130 days' worth, which is about average for them,"" Lucarelli said.The chip industry globally is split between five major players: Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Texas Instruments (TXN) and SK Hynix.These five accounted for about 30% of industry sales and half of its profits as of 2013's third quarter, according to AlixPartners' 2014 Global Semiconductor Industry Outlook.The industry struggles with heavy price competition, high production costs and products with a short shelf life, the AlixPartners report said.Monolithic's own sales prospects are sensitive to ebbs and flows in consumer spending because of its heavy focus on consumer electronics.""If we see significant downturn in the economy or in consumer spending, that would likely have a bigger impact on Monolithic than your typical semiconductor company,"" Zino said.

613,TXN,"Wireless charging of mobile devices has been slow to take off, but Apple's (AAPL) upcoming smartwatch could change that.Market research firm IHS (IHS) says global sales of wireless power receivers and transmitters in wearable applications will surge to $481 million in 2015, up from $14.5 million last year. The release this spring of the Apple Watch will spur the market, IHS predicted in a recent report.The market for wireless power and charging in wearables could approach $1.2 billion in 2019, IHS said.""Growth this year will be remarkable for wireless charging in wearable electronic devices, even if in reality the overall penetration of wireless charging into wearables is relatively low given the billions of wearables that are shipped into the consumer market every year,"" IHS analyst Vicky Yussuff said in a statement. ""Still, interest in the use of wireless charging remains high on the part of wearable technology providers and device original equipment manufacturers. As a result, penetration is expected to escalate rapidly over the next five years.""The Apple Watch could account for more than 70% of revenue this year from wireless charging-enabled wearable devices, IHS said.Apple's smartwatch will use the company's proprietary MagSafe inductive charging technology. With this system, the smartwatch is tethered to the charger and held in place by a magnet.Other wireless charging technologies today typically consist of a pad or mat on which consumers place an enabled device for charging. This method is often called ""drop and charge.""But new technologies will give users greater freedom on where they can charge their devices. These include wireless charging through surfaces like a desk and wireless charging over distances.By the end of 2017, shipments of wearable-technology wireless charging receivers that allow charging over distances will overtake inductive or tightly coupled solutions, IHS predicts.The wireless charging market is in its infancy, Yussuff told IBD. Companies angling for a share of the market include wireless technology licensors and semiconductor and component suppliers for wireless power transmitters/receivers, she said.Licensors in the market include WiTricity, Powermat Technologies, ConvenientPower, PowerbyProxi and Energous (WATT).Chip and component suppliers include Freescale Semiconductor (FSL), Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Mediatek, Texas Instruments (TXN), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (BRCM) and TDK.Wireless charging also is starting to take off in the mobile phone market.Samsung's next-generation flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S6, might debut with built-in wireless charging when it is announced in March, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a report Wednesday. If this happens, IDT has good odds of being the supplier, he said. Also in the running are TI, Broadcom and On Semiconductor (ONNN).""The highest-profile smartphone to date using wireless charging has been the LG G3, which split the socket between IDTI and TI based on geography,"" Anderson said. ""Our sense is that Broadcom's focus is wearables as opposed to smartphones at the moment. On Semi's competitive position is mostly unknown at this point other than the reference design with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 SoC.""The Samsung Galaxy S6 wireless charging business could be worth $112.5 million to $135 million annually, assuming Samsung sells at least 45 million of the handsets in 2015, he said. Anderson estimates wireless charging chip revenue per phone would be $2.50 to $3 ($1 for the receiver and $1.50 to $2 for the transmitter).RELATED:Apple Watch has no peer at CES 2015, analyst says.

The lost plane, which was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, remains a mystery, leaving co-workers to wonder about their lost colleagues. Twelve of those employees are from Malaysia and eight are from China, according to the company. They were working as engineers or specialists on efficiency and production-planning projects at manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and China.
"
651,TXN,"Freescale spokeswoman Jacey Zuniga said there was no additional information to report and that the company declined to comment further on the matter. But the loss surely is proving to be a distraction within the company's ranks, analysts said.
"
652,TXN,"""Any time a company has employees flying for travel, they are clearly important employees,"" Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview.
"
653,TXN,"Freedman said that, after talking with Freescale management following the plane's disappearance, it was clear to him that executives were devoting a lot of time to the matter, working to help the vanished employees' families. That, of course, is a necessary distraction.
"
654,TXN,"But Freedman said that, in the big picture, he is not concerned that it will affect the company's overall performance.
"
655,TXN,"""It won't impact their competitiveness in any way, shape or form,"" he said, noting that a group of 20 employees represents a ""tiny fraction"" of Freescale's global workforce of some 18,000. He said Freescale has a deep lineup of engineering talent that can step in and seamlessly pick up the slack in workload.
"
656,TXN,"He said it was legitimate to ask whether 20 employees should all travel together. But unless the group includes top executives, it is not common for companies to stagger travel plans.
"
657,TXN,"None of the 20 employees on the lost plane were high-ranking executives, he said. ""You can't plan for every black swan event, and if you tried, that would probably be something that would cut into your efficiency,"" Freedman said.

"
662,TXN,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average forecast first-quarter earnings of 25 cents per share.
"
663,TXN,"Freescale's earnings are driven in large measure by the technology it develops for the automotive industry (44% of revenue in 2013) and the digital networking arena (25% of revenue), Campbell said.
"
664,TXN,"The company produces radio-frequency power amplifiers and digital communication processors for the networking market, and makes microcontrollers and other products for autos.
"
665,TXN,"The networking market benefited from 2013 growth in wireless infrastructure spending, notably in China. On the auto side, the business was boosted by strong production and sales levels in North America and China, as well as by modestly improving conditions in Europe, the company said on its last earnings call.
"
666,TXN,"Harsh winter weather dampened auto sales early in 2014, with U.S. sales falling short of expectations in January and February. Sales slid in the first month of the year and were flat in February. But they rebounded in March — sales climbed 6% to 1.5 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. — and provided analysts reason to think auto sales could remain strong for much of 2014.

But the loss surely is proving to be a distraction within the company's ranks, analysts said.""Any time a company has employees flying for travel, they are clearly important employees,"" Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview.Freedman said that, after talking with Freescale management following the plane's disappearance, it was clear to him that executives were devoting a lot of time to the matter, working to help the vanished employees' families. That, of course, is a necessary distraction.But Freedman said that, in the big picture, he is not concerned that it will affect the company's overall performance.""It won't impact their competitiveness in any way, shape or form,"" he said, noting that a group of 20 employees represents a ""tiny fraction"" of Freescale's global workforce of some 18,000. He said Freescale has a deep lineup of engineering talent that can step in and seamlessly pick up the slack in workload.He said it was legitimate to ask whether 20 employees should all travel together. But unless the group includes top executives, it is not common for companies to stagger travel plans.None of the 20 employees on the lost plane were high-ranking executives, he said. ""You can't plan for every black swan event, and if you tried, that would probably be something that would cut into your efficiency,"" Freedman said.Freedman is bullish on the stock. He said efforts to reduce debt costs are notable and ongoing. ""It's a great deleveraging story,"" he said. ""It has played out quite nicely.""Revenue-growth projections, he added, are encouraging and should continue to prop up interest in Freescale's shares. Freedman rates the stock ""outperform.""Of 18 analysts who cover the company, according to Thomson Reuters, 12 have ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings, five recommend investors hold the stock, and one has an ""underperform"" rating on Freescale. None recommends selling the stock.Earnings EnginesAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average forecast first-quarter earnings of 25 cents per share.Freescale's earnings are driven in large measure by the technology it develops for the automotive industry (44% of revenue in 2013) and the digital networking arena (25% of revenue), Campbell said.The company produces radio-frequency power amplifiers and digital communication processors for the networking market, and makes microcontrollers and other products for autos.The networking market benefited from 2013 growth in wireless infrastructure spending, notably in China. On the auto side, the business was boosted by strong production and sales levels in North America and China, as well as by modestly improving conditions in Europe, the company said on its last earnings call.Harsh winter weather dampened auto sales early in 2014, with U.S. sales falling short of expectations in January and February. Sales slid in the first month of the year and were flat in February. But they rebounded in March — sales climbed 6% to 1.5 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. — and provided analysts reason to think auto sales could remain strong for much of 2014.Car Sales ConnectionAlec Gutierrez, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, estimates full-year U.S. auto sales at 16.3 million vehicles. That would top last year's actual sales of 15.6 million cars and trucks. He said buyers are expected to come out in greater numbers as spring weather improves, with many of the same drivers of demand over the last couple of years still in place: Low interest rates that make auto financing affordable and improving employment conditions that increase the number of Americans in position to shop for a widening array of appealing new vehicles.That, he said in an interview, is good news for firms such as Freescale with close links to the car sector. ""For many related to the auto industry,"" Gutierrez said, ""2014 is shaping up to be a good year.""

693,TXN,"Most new CEOs like to hit the ground running. Rick Clemmer had no choice.When he became president and chief executive officer of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) in January 2009, the debt-ridden company was struggling to survive more than two years after separating from parent Philips Electronics. NXP was born in 2006, when Philips sold its semiconductor unit to a group of private equity firms.""We were at the abyss,"" Clemmer recalled. ""We could've fallen in. We had $6 billion in debt and were losing money.""Clemmer sought to save the company by adopting what he calls ""a maniacal focus"" on propelling NXP into dominant leadership in certain product and market segments. That meant a series of rapid decisions to pounce on promising market niches such as auto electronics. Specifically, NXP has produced chips for passive, keyless entry and in-vehicle networking.Based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, NXP has roughly 27,000 employees in more than 25 countries. Clemmer, 62, has set a high bar for their performance.His 21 years at Texas Instruments (TXN) shaped his leadership. He especially admired TI's organizational culture.""Texas Instruments was very performance-based,"" he said. ""Poor performance was not accepted. It was also highly entrepreneurial. And it was built on the highest ethics and integrity.""He remembers a TI executive who exhibited extreme focus in implementing a few strategic priorities. As CEO, Clemmer follows suit. He likes to ask employees, ""How are you spending your time?"" and review their calendars to ensure that they're prioritizing well.""Focus is so important,"" he said. ""But really, it's deciding what you're not going to do so that you assign adequate resources to what you want to do.""Soon after becoming CEO, Clemmer concluded with the help of consultant Bain & Co. that true market leaders, defined by relative market share, drove more consistent results than companies that didn't seek dominance. So he announced that NXP needed to change — and fast.""I said, 'We want to be one and a half to two times larger than the No. 2 player in the markets where we choose to participate,'"" he said. ""'We want to be No. 1 in those markets by at least 50% more than the No. 2 player.' Our employees were a little bit surprised,"" but NXP's dire situation motivated them to buy into Clemmer's bold strategy.Five years later, NXP's debt has fallen by more than half, and it has grown selected businesses dramatically. For example, its security identification unit, which develops chips for passports, driver's licenses and bank cards, has mushroomed from about $350 million in 2009 to $1.4 billion today.""Semiconductor companies usually say they want to be No. 1 or No. 2 in the marketplace,"" Clemmer said. ""But for the most part, we got out of areas where we couldn't be a true leader. A (dominant) No. 1 can truly outdo the competition, and customers have to think about you.""

783,TXN,"After months of rhetorical tariff threats between Washington and Beijing, the world’s two largest economies have declared a trade war. This is especially true as Trump’s 25% tariff on $34 billion in Chinese goods, including auto, electric cars, aerospace, communications tech, new materials and robotics became reality at 12:01 A.M. on Jul 6 and another $16 billion is expected to go into effect in two weeks.China also hit back with the same scale and strength, slapping charges on American goods targeting heartland staples like soybeans, corn, pork and poultry. The United States has violated World Trade Organization rules and ignited the largest trade war in economic history,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. With retaliation from Beijing, Trump has issued warnings of additional tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods.The latest move marked the escalation of the trade war from threat to reality and would result in a global recession. It would hurt global supply chains, increase costs for businesses and consumers and slow down investments. Canada, Mexico and Europe are also engaged in tit-for-tat tariff exchange with the United States. As a result, the ongoing development suggests that the worst, which could send shockwaves across stock markets, is yet to come.Against such a backdrop, there are a few places where investors can stash their cash in the stock world and a few that should be avoided.Best ZonesGoldIn difficult market environments, gold is considered a great store of value and hedge against market turmoil. Acting as a leveraged play on the underlying metal prices, metal miners tend to experience more gains than their bullion cousins in a rising metal market. Hence, mining stocks could outperform in the current trade turmoil. As such, Yamana Gold Inc. (AUY) seems a lucrative pick as it carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A. The stock has risen 8.1% over the past month.Consumer StaplesThe consumer staples sector is defensive as it includes a variety of items like food & beverages, non-durable household goods, hypermarkets and consumer supercenters that are every-day essentials. These products see steady demand even during an economic downturn due to their low level of correlation with economic cycles. As such, these generally act as a safe haven amid political and economic turmoil. Stocks in these sectors generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty. Among these, B&G Foods Inc. (BGS) has gained 12% over the past one month. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Momentum Score of B.Small CapsSmall-cap stocks have been the winners amid trade and tariff threats, and are likely to continue their outperformance. This is because small-cap stocks have less international exposure and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. These pint-sized stocks are less vulnerable to a trade war or any other political issue and could better insulate investors from Trump’s protectionist stance. Rent-A-Center Inc. (RCII) having a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A is among the biggest gainers in a month’s time, rising 42.5%.  High DividendThe dividend-paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. These stocks offer the safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis. While there are several top-ranked options available in the space, Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report) looks impressive given its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and one-month return of 13.5%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Worst ZonesFarm BeltU.S. farmers and food producers are in the crosshairs of a global trade conflict. Tariffs were already imposed by Canada on beef and by Mexico on pork and ham imports. Another round of tariff from China on soybeans and pork also come into effect in response to Trump’s latest tariff implementation. Soybean exporters like Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) and meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) would be hit. ADM has a Zacks Rank #2 and added 3.6% in a month while the other two has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). TSN is down 2.3% and HRL is up 1.7%.AutoThe potential tariffs on cars and auto components are the greatest threats to the auto industry. Global Automakers President and CEO John Bozzella warned “tariff hikes would raise prices, make it more expensive to produce cars and trucks in the United States. He said the tariffs could cause a slowdown in sales and production, which would not be good for either American consumers or autoworkers.” BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report) shed 13.9% in a month and has a Zacks Rank #3.SemiconductorsTrump’s import tariff on Chinese products will compel American semiconductor companies to pay duties on their own products. This is because chips are manufactured in the United States but are shipped to the Asian nation for assembly, testing and packaging due to its favorable labor costs, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Some of the worst-hit chip stocks include Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). INTC, MU and TXN were down 12.9%, 12.9% and 5.9%, respectively. However, these stocks have a favorable Zacks rank.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

784,TXN,"Shares Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) surged 2.49% Thursday on the back of continued speculation that the chipmaker will release the much-anticipated update to its GeForce GPU line, sooner than later. Now the question for investors is should they consider buying NVDA stock now, ahead of any official GeForce announcement.GeForceBrand new reports surfaced on Thursday that suggested that Nvidia is stockpiling roughly one million GeForce GTX 11s in order to meet the demand for a Q3 or Q4 2018 launch. “It has been two years since the Pascal-based GeForce GTX 10 Series landed, so there is pent-up demand for this family's successor to fuel the 4K gaming craze,” Hot Hardware’s Brandon Hill wrote.A new GeForce line would help create even more demand for Nvidia’s widely popular graphics cards that help fuel the video gaming industry. The success of the company’s GeForce GTX 11 line will be hugely important for Nvidia because, despite the growth of its other segments, its Gaming division is still by far the company’s biggest revenue generator (also read: Nvidia Stock Gains as Rumors of Gaming GPU Launch Heat Up).Last quarter, Nvidia’s Gaming revenues skyrocketed 68% to hit $1.72 billion, accounting for roughly 54% of the company’s $3.21 billion in total Q1 revenues. Investors will also be pleased to note that Nvidia’s Datacenter revenue soared 71% to $701 million, while Automotive revenues climbed by just 4% to $145 million.Stock Price MovementNvidia’s massive year-over-year revenue growth is what has driven shares of NVDA up so high over the last few years. In fact, Nvidia has seen its stock price climb roughly 1,100% over the last three years, which destroys the S&P 500’s 31% growth, as well as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 290% climb and Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) 321% surge. Investors will note that over the last two years Nvidia stock has continued to skyrocket. With that said, shares of fellow semiconductor powerhouse Micron (MU  -  Free Report) have outpaced Nvidia over the last year, up 75% compared to NVDA’s 69% climb. It is also worth pointing out that NVDA stock currently sits roughly 10% below its 52-week high.ValuationNvidia’s impressive run hasn’t stretched the company’s valuation picture as much as some might assume. NVDA is trading at 33.1X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates at the moment, which marks a significant premium compared to its industry’s 11.2X average—this industry includes the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Diving a little deeper, Nvidia stock has traded as high as 57.4X over the last year, with a one-year median of 44X. NVDA is currently trading just above its year-long low of 32.9X. Therefore, investors should be able to say with some confidence that Nvidia stock is hardly expensive and it might even appear relatively attractive at its current level.Growth OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Nvidia second-quarter revenues to climb by roughly 39% to hit $3.11 billion. For the full-year, Nvidia’s revenues are expected to surge nearly 36% to touch $13.18 billion.Moving on, Nvidia looks as though it is set to post much bigger profits this year, with its adjusted Q2 earnings expected to expand by over 81% to touch $1.83 per share. Meanwhile, its full-year ESP figure is projected to reach $7.93 per share, which would mark a 61% surge. Bottom LineNvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. NVDA has also earned 11 upward earnings estimate revisions for Q2, against zero downward changes, all within the last 60 days. More importantly, during this same timeframe, Nvidia has received 12 earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside, for both its current fiscal year as well as the following year.Nvidia’s solid forward P/E, top and bottom line growth projections, and its positive earnings estimate revision activity, coupled with what could be a major product launch all signal that now might be a great time to buy NVDA.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

785,TXN,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) both surged on Monday, which helped buck a recent downward trend for the two chip makers. Both of the semiconductor powers are also currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks. So let’s dive into some of Micron and Nvidia’s current fundamentals to see if either stock looks more appealing at the moment.Stock MovementOne of the best places for investors to start when evaluating a stock is its price movement. Before today’s climb, Nvidia had seen its stock price soar 1,079% over the last three years, which outpaces Micron’s 185% climb. Over the last two years, the stocks are a little more evenly matched, with NVDA up 416% compared to MU’s 332% expansion—both of which crush Wall Street darling Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 135%  climb as well as fellow chip giant Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) 52%.Narrowing down our focus, MU stock has climbed above NVDA over the last year, up 85% compared to roughly 73% for its peer. Investors should also note that 2018 has not been as kind to either Micron or Nvidia. Still, Micron has seen its stock price surge roughly 32%, while Nvidia has jumped 24% since the start of the year.More recently, MU and NVDA have both sunk roughly 9% during the last month, with both sitting below their 52-week highs. This should be good news since both stocks could be purchased at a lower price than they have traded at recently. But investors also need to understand their current valuation picture.ValuationComing into Monday, Micron stock was trading at 4.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared the S&P 500’s 16.8X and its industry’s 11.3 X—which includes Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Over the last year, Micron stock has traded as high as 6.8X, as low as 4.1X, and rocks a one-year median of 5.5X.At 33.1X, NVDA is trading at a significant premium compared to Micron, its industry, and the S&P. With that said, Nvidia stock has traded as high as 57.4X over the last year, with a one-year median of 44.1X, and it is currently trading just above its year-long low of 32.9X Stepping out a bit further, investors should be able to see that it is not too much of a stretch to say that Nvidia stock appears rather attractive at this current valuation. Meanwhile, Micron stock looks like one of the stronger value plays on the market, especially considering its growth projections.OutlookNow let’s look ahead because there is little reason to buy stocks that don’t seem to present any real ability to keep on climbing based on expanding top and bottom lines.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues to hit $8.22 billion, which would mark over a 33.8% climb from the year-ago period. Micron’s fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to soar over 48% to reach $30.13 billion. Moving onto the other end of the income statement, the company’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 136% to reach $11.72 per share, while its Q4 EPS figure is expected to expand by 63% to hit $3.30 per share.Transitioning to Nvidia, the company is projected to report Q2 fiscal 2019 revenues of $3.11 billion, representing a roughly 39% jump from the year-ago period. For its current full-year, Nvidia’s revenues are expected to surge nearly 36% to touch $13.18 billion. The company’s adjusted earnings are expected to expand by just over 81% this quarter and 61% for the year.Bottom LineBoth Nvidia and Micron are currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, with MU sporting an overall “A” VGM score and NVDA rocking an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Investors will also be pleased to note that NVDA and MU have received a ton of earnings estimate revisions recently.Micron has earned eight upward earnings estimate revisions for the full-year, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 30 days. Likewise, Nvidia has received 12 full-year revisions against zero downgrades, over the last 60 days.Clearly, it is hard to go wrong with either stock at the moment as both are projected to experience strong top and bottom line growth. The companies also operate in a growth industry and have set their sights on new areas just starting to boom, from AI to self-driving vehicle technology. Still, at the moment, the advantage has to go to Micron because of its outstanding value.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

786,TXN,"Investors looking for stocks in the Semiconductor - General sector might want to consider either Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) or Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Intel has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that INTC likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TXN has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.INTC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.41, while TXN has a forward P/E of 20.39. We also note that INTC has a PEG ratio of 1.47. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.12.Another notable valuation metric for INTC is its P/B ratio of 3.31. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TXN has a P/B of 10.26.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to INTC's Value grade of B and TXN's Value grade of D.INTC is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that INTC is likely the superior value option right now.

787,TXN,"Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) are trading over 12% higher in today’s pre-market trading as the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The upswing is also attributable to the encouraging outlook and hefty dividends.The company’s non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 34 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents and also came toward the higher end of management’s guidance range of 20-24 cents. However, on a year-over-year basis, the figure declined 24.4%.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 89 cents from continuing operations compared with 16 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, it compared favorably with the guided range of 1-5 cents. The better-than-expected bottom-line performance primarily stemmed from increased revenues, cost savings and lower tax rate.RevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues from continuing operations (which includes Enterprise Group and Financial Services) of $7.674 billion, up 11.2% from the year-earlier quarter’s revenues of $6.902 billion. Further, quarterly revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.025 billion.Adjusted for currency-exchange rates and divestures, the company’s revenues from continuing operations were up 9% year over year.During the reported quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance in the Americas grew 3% mainly due to “strength in core compute and campus switching combined with a recovery in the organic storage results.” Revenues in Europe went up 11% in constant currency mainly due to strength in core compute and storage, and higher growth in Germany and Scandinavia. The Asia Pacific witnessed strong core server sales, with growth in Japan, Australia and China.Segment wise, revenues at the Hybrid IT increased 10% year over year to $6.331 billion. Adjusting for currency, segment revenues were up 9% year over year. Revenues from the Intelligent Edge and Financial Services segments climbed 8.8% and 7.9%, respectively.Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise’s gross margin contracted 370 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 28.4%. This contraction resulted from competitive pricing, elevated DRAM pricing and unfavorable currency.In addition, the company’s non-GAAP operating margin shrunk 180 bps to 7.7%, primarily due to a lower gross margin, which was partially offset by a decline in non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues resulting.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended the fiscal first quarter with $7.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from $9.6 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter.

(PFPT  -  Free Report) reported solid results for fourth-quarter 2017 earlier this week, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of better-than-expected performance for both, the top as well as the bottom line. Also, revenues and earnings came in ahead of the company’s guidance ranges. Apart from this, Proofpoint witnessed significant year-over-year improvement in revenues and earnings.However, the company’s outlook for the current quarter and full-year 2018 has made investors a little cautious over Proofpoint’s long-term prospects, resulting in a dip of approximately 2.4% in the company’s share price during after-hour trading yesterday.Nonetheless, the company has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to over the past year. The stock has rallied 26.1% in the said period, while the industry registered 7.9% growth. Let’s now discuss quarter results in detail.Quarter in DetailProofpoint reported total revenues of $145.4 million, up 36.1% year over year, mainly driven by customer additions, improved add-on-sales and strong renewal rate.

Also, renewal rates remained well more than 90% during the reported quarter.Non-GAAP gross profit advanced 37.1% from the year-ago quarter to $112.9 million. Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 77.6%, primarily driven by higher sales and efficiency improvements across the company’s cloud operations. Total non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 32.9% year over year to $96.2 million mainly due to increased spending on hiring sales personnel. However, as a percentage of revenues, it decreased to 66.2% from 67.8% in the year-ago quarter.Proofpoint’s non-GAAP operating income for the quarter increased to $16.6 million from $9.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In addition, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 11.4%, mainly benefiting from higher revenues, improved gross margin and decreased operating expenses as a percentage of sales.Non-GAAP net income increased to $16.4 million from $9.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter. It also came in ahead of the company’s guidance of $9.5-$10.5 million.On a per share basis, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 29 cents, marking an impressive year-over-year jump of 61%. Quarterly earnings also came in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents as well as the company’s guidance range of 19-21 cents per share.Proofpoint, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Proofpoint, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Proofpoint, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowProofpoint exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $331.6 million, up from the previous-quarter balance of $459.6 million.

Free cash flow for the year came in at $106.7 million.OutlookDespite a stellar fourth-quarter performance, Proofpoint’s guidance for first-quarter and full-year 2018 is not so encouraging.For 2018, the company raised its outlook for revenues but lowered the same for non-GAAP earnings. Proofpoint now expects revenues in the range of $660-$665 million (mid-point $662.5 million), up from $644-$648 million (mid-point $646 million) predicted earlier. However, guidance range at the mid-point is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $663.5 million. Billings expectations has also been raised to $828-$833 million from $798-$802 million projected earlier.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now anticipated in the band of 95 cents to $1.02 (mid-point 98.5 cents), down from the previous guidance range of 96 cents to $1.03 (mid-point 99.5 cents).

The company’s continued focus on launching products, acquisitions and partnerships have helped it register more than 35% revenue growth consistently for the last eight quarters.The company did disclose it is adopting ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018, which is a newly required accounting standard, which results in a $10 million impact to revenue. Adjusted for this under previous ASC 605 methodology, the company's guidance would have been $672.5 million midpoint.  Currently, Proofpoint carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

789,TXN,"Two major developments dominated market proceedings on Wednesday. On the one hand, tech stocks suffered losses, with chip stocks in particular bearing the brunt. Meanwhile, a nationalist stance on trade and the dollar emerged in Davos through statements of key members of the Trump administration.On the one hand, a section of analysts believe that tech stocks are running out of steam and would find it difficult to replicate last year’s gains in 2018. On the other hand, a weaker dollar is likely to weigh on U.S. exports.Chip Stocks Weigh on the MarketsTech stocks weighed on the bourses over the last session with chipmakers in particular feeling the heat. Shares of Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) lost 8.5% after the company released dismal projections for the current quarter. Other chipmakers followed suit, with Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) declining by 1.6%.Meanwhile, shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) also lost 1.6% after Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said iPhone sales might come in weaker than expected in the coming spring. Also weighing of the broader index was a decline of 1.5%, 0.4% and 0.4%, respectively, in shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Over the last few months, chipmakers have made massive strides. For instance, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is up 5.9% year to date and has gained 40.9% over the last one year.However, a section of analysts believe that it may be difficult for the sector to sustain such gains. Analysts from Citi Investment Research feel that chipmakers’ business conditions have softened after a series of strong results.Nationalist Position EmergesMeanwhile, key members of the Trump administration espoused a nationalist position on trade and the dollar at the World Economic Forum in Davos. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross firmly elucidated the current administration’s muscular stance on trade. Ross also blamed China for been hiding its practice of trade protectionism under the veil of free trade.Even more noteworthy comments were heard from his colleague U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who said that the Trump administration favored “bilateral trade agreements.” Mnuchin added that any weakness in the dollar was beneficial for trade. His comments led to the ICE U.S. Dollar Index falling below the 90 mark for the first time since December 2014.Can Chip Stocks Gain from a Weaker Dollar?Mnuchin’s comments are something of a first, more so from a Treasury Secretary. In the past, U.S. administrations advocated a stronger dollar and urged other countries to work toward lowering their barriers to free trade. This new protectionist stance is a double edged sword. It could trigger off a trade war, leading to retaliations from the likes of China.Further, a fall in the dollar could lead to a contraction in capital inflows which in turn could send yields shooting upward. This in turn could lead to unwelcome shocks for equity markets. Of course, Ross tried to backpedal on the Treasury Secretary’s remarks later, telling CNBC television that Mnuchin wasn’t calling for a weaker dollar.However, such a scenario seems to be a little far-fetched at the moment. If a sovereign bond selloff does come about, it will be triggered by China which recently denied Bloomberg reports on the matter. In any case, such a move would be against China’s own interests in the long run.So, as of now a weaker dollar would only be beneficial for major U.S. exporting sectors like semiconductors. In 2016, semiconductors were the third-largest exports, amounting to around $43 billion. This was likely the case for last year as well and despite alarms being raised over exorbitant valuations and a weaker business environment, chipmakers are likely to have another banner year.Our ChoicesChipmakers have got off on the wrong foot in 2018. But this false start in no way detracts from their astounding performance last year as well as their future prospects. The slump in the dollar is likely to add to the luster of this major exporting sector.Adding select chip stocks to your portfolios continues to make for a profitable option. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) has established itself as one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions.Micron Technology has a VGM Score of A. The company has expected earnings growth of 98.1% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 28.3% over the last 60 days. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1.

The company has expected earnings growth of 1.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 0.4% over the last 30 days.Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. Its products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in front-end and WLP processes, creating memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a broad range of electronic devices.Lam Research has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The company has expected earnings growth of 48.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 0.5% over the last 30 days.Xcerra Corporation (XCRA  -  Free Report) engages in designing, manufacturing, and marketing automatic test equipment for the semiconductor industry.Xcerra has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The company has expected earnings growth of 98% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 38.6% over the last 60 days.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

790,TXN,"The semiconductor corner of the broad technology market continued its last year’s winning streak at the start of 2018. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products, owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies, is fueling huge growth in the space (read: Two Blockchain ETFs Go Live for The First Time).In particular, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Fund (PSI  -  Free Report) have been hitting multiple highs this year and are again leading the tech surge. These funds have been up 11.1%, 10.9% and 10.4%, respectively, so far, and have crushed the broad technology fund (XLK  -  Free Report) by a wide margin. XLK has gained 7.5% in the same time frame.A combination of other factors like a stabilizing PC market, waves of consolidation and expectation of solid corporate earnings are propelling semiconductor stocks higher. Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) reported its quarterly results after the market close on Jan 23, where it met the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and surpassed the revenue estimate. Shares of TXN were down about 7% in after-hours trading (read: Texas Instruments Dips As Tax Charge Digs Into Q4 Earnings).However, most of the other chipmakers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) are poised to surprise this quarter. Let’s delve into the earnings picture of those that have a higher allocation to these ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q4 earnings unfold. SOXX has the largest concentration in the four firms with a combined share of 29.1%, followed by 26% for SMH and 21% for PSI.According to the our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.What’s in Store?Intel is slated to release earnings after market close on Jan 25. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.17%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates this quarter. The stock has seen a negative earnings estimate revision of three cents over the past 90 days for the to-be-reported quarter but delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.72% on average over the last four quarters. It has a VGM Style Score of B (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks).NVIDIA, expected to report on Feb 8, has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +1.93%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates this quarter. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 33.51% and saw positive earnings estimate revision of 19 cents over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter. The stock has a VGM Style Score of C.Applied Materials has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. Its earnings surprise track over the past four quarters is good, with an average beat of 2.82%. Additionally, the stock witnessed a solid earnings estimate revision of six cents over the past 90 days for the to-be-reported quarter. The stock has a VGM Style Score of C. The company will report on Feb 21.ConclusionGiven the fact that most of the companies in the space are poised to beat earnings estimates and saw positive estimate revisions, semiconductor ETFs will see prolonged bullishness. Further, SOXX, SMH and PSI have a Zacks ETF Rank #1, suggesting that their outperformance will continue (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

791,TXN,"NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) shares fell almost 8% to close at $225.52 on Mar 27, after the chip-maker announced that it suspended all self-driving car tests across the globe.The announcement follows last week’s Uber crash that killed a woman in Arizona. The ride-hailing firm already halted self-driving car tests in all locations, including San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Phoenix and Toronto.NVIDIA’s decision to halt tests reflects concern about the findings of the ongoing crash investigation. It is widely perceived that the crash resulted from the malfunctioning of either the hardware or the software within Uber’s system.NVIDIA, being the hardware technology provider to Uber, remains susceptible to the findings of the investigation. Velodyne, which provided Lidar with laser sensing technology, already stated that they were cooperating with the ongoing investigation.NVIDIA Halts to Slow Down CommercializationNVIDIA’s decision to halt tests doesn’t bode well for the nascent self-driving car technology. The company is a major supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips which present self-driving capability to cars. Notably, NVIDIA is working with over 320 companies, globally, on automotive applications.Apart from Uber, NVIDIA supports autonomous vehicle projects of Volkswagen and China’s Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report) through its new augmented reality, driverless car technology, DRIVE AR. The company, in partnership with Aurora, is building a “Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving hardware platform”, which will integrate its Xavier processor.NVIDIA has returned 110.1% in the past year, significantly outperforming 55.5% rally of the industry. The outperformance can be attributed to its growing dominance in the chips for self-driving cars, data centers and AI. However, a halt on test-run will slow down commercialization process doesn’t bode well for the company’s top-line growth. Automotive revenues in the last quarter were $132 million, reflecting an increase of 3% year over year.New Simulator to Solve Test Driving Issues?At the ongoing GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, CA, NVIDIA unveiled Constellation driving simulator that allows companies to test self-driving systems in a virtual environment. Per MarketWatch, early-access partners will get access to the solution in the third-quarter.Although NVIDIA doesn’t expect the new simulator to fully replace real-world testing of self-driving cars, it is expected to lower the number of trials, significantly.Moreover, we believe that the new simulator will improve NVIDIA’s competitive position in the self-driving car market space, particularly against chip-makers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report).Intel’s acquisition of MobilEye now enables it to offer almost anything related to self-driving vehicles – cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management.Moreover, in August 2017, the chip-maker announced plans to build 100 “level 4” vehicles to test its self-driving technology. The company has also been a long-time supplier to Alphabet’s Waymo division.In 2017, Texas Instrument also launched a portfolio of chips that include sensors for driver assist and autonomous driving.Currently, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

792,TXN,"With the oldest members being 37 years old and the youngest just 18, millennials believe that they have a long way to go before they reach retirement. But time flies faster than one thinks and when their retirement age arrives, these millennials may not have sufficient savings.Some experts believe that given their current lack of savings, the majority of this generation won’t be able to retire even in their 70s. This has also been supported by a recent study from National Institute on Retirement Security, which states that two-thirds of the working millennials have saved nothing for their retirement.Some experts believe that the generation’s interest on holidaying rather than saving is the main reason for their failure to save. Others believe that millennials are overburdened with their monthly payments like education loan and credit card bills. Apart from these, one-fifth of the generation supports aging parents by paying for their medical bills and other expenses.All these circumstances have made it tougher for the generation to set aside money for their sunset years.Likely Challenges for MillennialsThe generation is expected to have a longer life span — thanks to the continuous advancements in medical science and healthier lifestyles — which means they will need more funds. Escalating healthcare costs also pose a challenge.Although U.S. citizens will have social security but it is difficult to say whether it will be adequate to maintain their lifestyle. Their woes will mount if the U.S. government closes this facility after 25-30 years. It already costs the federal government more than $1 trillion, which will increase exponentially as the majority of the citizens will fall under the senior category by that time.It’s Never Too Late to Start SavingWhatever small amount you save today, if invested wisely, it can give you a healthy return in the long run. There are plenty of investment options available but given the young age of millennials and their risk taking capabilities, we suggest investing in equities as these offer maximum returns. The improving domestic as well as global economic scenario is likely to have a positive impact on the market. Additionally, with Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policies, the manufacturing sector is poised to witness huge investment in the next few years, thereby generating employment and increasing wage rate opportunities. All this is likely to further strengthen the U.S. economy, which will tend to reflect in the stock market.Considering an annual return of 8%, a monthly investment of just $100 in equities by a 25-year old till his 65th birthday will save him or her approximately $341,120.However, investing in equities has its own share of risks. Not every stock will have a remarkable run. Also, the risk of a market crash remains.Therefore, investing in stocks that generate solid regular returns with minimum associated risks is prudent. Also, the return should cover the investment and inflation costs.Blue Chip Dividend Stocks are the Best ChoiceBlue chip dividend stocks boast solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals, and are less affected by market turbulence. Such stocks are believed to be safer and more durable than an average stock. Most of these companies consistently raise dividends and are typically large in size.The companies’ dominating market position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity help them offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis, irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and offer continued income for investors, as well as more scope for capital appreciation.Choosing the StocksIt is difficult to pick the right stocks from a wide range of available investment opportunities.This is where the Zacks Stock Screener comes in handy.

793,TXN,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT. Vishay markets its portfolio to manufacturers of everything from biometric monitoring systems to fitbands and smart appliances.VSH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is a hot momentum play, with shares adding more than 10% in the past four weeks to test new 52-week highs. Analysts have also become more bullish on the company’s earnings outlook, with full-year EPS estimates improving nearly 36% in the trailing quarter. Bottom LineThe Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world.  And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

794,TXN,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) climbed nearly 2% on Monday despite news last week that a Chinese court ordered the semiconductor giant to stop selling some of its memory chips in the world’s second-largest economy. So let’s see why Micron stock looks like such a great buy right now, allowing investors to feel comfortable shrugging off the recent Chinese ruling.Recent NewsLast week, a Chinese court ruled in favor of Taiwanese firm United Microelectronics’  patent infringement lawsuits against the American chip company. But Micron’s leadership was quick to assure investors that the affected products—Crucial and Ballistix-branded DRAM modules as well as solid state drives—make up just over 1% of the company’s annualized revenues.Micron noted that it continues to expect its fiscal fourth quarter revenues to fall within its previously guided range of $8 billion to $8.4 billion. “Micron has a long-standing history of successful business operations in China, including a significant assembly and test manufacturing facility in Xi'an, as well as deep relationships with many valued China customers,” Micron senior VP of legal affairs Joel Poppen said in a statement.“Micron will continue to aggressively defend against these unfounded patent infringement claims while continuing to work closely with its customers and partners.”Stock MovementThe fact that the Chinese court ruling is not expected to present a significant impact on Micron’s top line came as welcome news to investors and might help its stock bounce back after a rough stretch. In fact, prior to Monday’s climb, shares of Micron had sunk roughly 11% over the last month.Still, Micron stock has been on a stellar run over the last two years, with its stock price up 330% since July 2016. This climb crushes the S&P 500’s 86% surge as well as fellow growth giant Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 130%. Investors will also see that Micron has outpaced its industry’s average—which includes the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report)—since the start of the year. ValuationNow that we have touched on MU’s recent performance, it’s time to take a look at its current valuation picture. Right off the bat, shares of Micron currently rest roughly $10 below their 52-week high, meaning that MU stock technically costs less than it has over the last few months.Diving a bit deeper, Micron stock might be one of the best value plays on Wall Street, for the simple fact that it is currently trading at 4.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. This marks a significant discount compared to its industry’s 11.5X average, the S&P’s 17X, and blows away fellow chip power Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) 34.5X.Furthermore, Micron stock has traded as high as 6.9X and as low as 4.1X over the last year, and sports a one-year median of 5.4X. Therefore, investors should be able to say with a great degree of confidence that Micron stock presents solid value and is even cheaper than it has been throughout much of the last year.OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s quarterly revenues to hit $8.22 billion, which would mark a roughly 34% climb from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s full-year revenues are projected to soar nearly 48% to reach $30.13 billion.Moving onto the bottom line, Micron’s quarterly earnings are projected to surge roughly 63% to touch $3.30 per share. The company’s full-year earnings are expected to soar 136% to reach $11.72 per share.Bottom LineMicron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system as well as an overall “A” VGM score. MU has also earned six upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter, against zero downward changes, all within the last 30 days. More importantly, during this same timeframe, Micron has received eight earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside, for its current fiscal year.The company is positioned to expand further as the need for memory chips grows rapidly with the AI and self-driving vehicle revolutions set to heat up. Micron is also expected to continue to capitalize on the growing cloud computing industry, which the company noted is projected to see total capital expenditure jump from $50 billion this year to $108 billion by 2021.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

795,TXN,"Sandwiched in between Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) strong quarterly earnings report after the bell yesterday and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) and United Air Lines (UAL  -  Free Report) following today’ close, we see a fresh group of Q4 earnings hitting the tape. This week marks the first of several where hundreds of publicly traded companies bring out their results from last quarter.Healthcare drug, device and packaged goods giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) put up a mixed Q4 report, with earnings beating estimates but revenues falling a tad short. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported $1.74 per share, surpassing the Zacks consensus by 2 cents, whereas revenues in the quarter of $20.20 billion fell slightly beneath the $20.22 billion we had been looking for.However, its Pharma unit grew 17.6% year over year to $9.7 billion, with full-year 2018 earnings guidance between $8.00-8.20 well ahead of the $7.86 expected. That said, revenue guidance for the full year is currently $80.6 billion-81.4 billion, below the $81.55 billion in the Zacks consensus. For more on JNJ’s earnings, click here.J&J’s competitor Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) reported positive results in its fiscal Q2 report ahead of today’s opening bell. Earnings of $1.19 per share beat our consensus estimate of $1.15, on revenues of $17.4 billion outpacing the $17.34 billion anticipated. The Zacks Rank #3 company reported organic growth of 2% on both revenues and volume. For more on PG’s earnings, click here.Domestic telecom leader Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) also posted a mixed outcome for its Q4 period, but in reverse: the company missed bottom-line expectations of 88 cents per share by 2 cents, while quarterly sales of $33,955 million surpassed the Zacks consensus of $33,146 million. Verizon, also a Zacks Rank #3 stock, reported post-paid churn coming down while total retail connections rose 1.8% year over year. For more on VZ’s earnings, click here.Paper and sanitary products manufacturer Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) also beat bottom-line expectations, reporting $1.57 per share on $4.58 billion. We had been looking for $1.54 per share and $4.60 billion, which the Zacks Rank #3 company fell just short of. Full-year guidance between $6.90-7.20 is well ahead of the $6.56 in the Zacks consensus. For more on KMB’s earnings, click here.Finally, Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated insurer Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) far outpaced expectations of $1.64 per share when it reported $2.28 per share this morning. This is roughly down 29% year over year, however. Revenues of $7.5 billion topped the $7.1 billion expected. While these headline numbers were solid, underwriting profit for the company fell 55%. For more on TRV’s earnings, click here.

796,TXN,"Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) has seen its stock price soar over the last year, driven in large part by cloud computing growth. On Monday, shares of Microsoft climbed to a new all-time high as investors begin to prepare for the company’s upcoming earnings report.Microsoft stock hit $91.34 per share after gaining over 1.45%. As of today, the company has already added a total of about $43 billion to its market capitalization since the start of 2018.Now, with Microsoft set to close the day as just the third public U.S. company in history with a market value of $700 billion or more—joining fellow tech powers Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report)—let’s take a look at why Microsoft is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Estimates  Microsoft is projected to see its quarterly sales climb to $28.35 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, which would mark an 8.77% year-over-year climb. The company is expected to see its bottom-line expand by 3.61% to reach $0.86 per share.The company is projected to see its full fiscal year 2018 revenues hit $105.97 billion. This estimate represents an 11.81% jump over 2017 and would represent outstanding full-year top-line growth for a company of Microsoft’s age and size. Looking even farther down the road, the company is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 12.60% over the next three to five years.Investors should also be happy to note that Microsoft has topped or matched earnings estimates in 15 of the last 17 quarters, including the trailing six periods. Last quarter, Microsoft posted a 16.67% earning beat after topping estimates by 38% in its previous quarter.Current Fundamentals Last quarter the company’s sales popped 12% year-over-year to reach $24.5 billion, while its net income rose 16%. Microsoft also posted operating income of $7.7 billion, which marked a 15% jump.Microsoft’s top and bottom-line growth can be attributed in large part to the company’s ability to expand its “Productivity and Business Processes” division, driven by 10% growth in Office commercial products and cloud services revenue. On top of that, the company’s “Intelligent Cloud” division sales hit $6.9 billion, which marked a 14% jump from the year-ago period.Microsoft’s server products and cloud services revenue experienced a 17% gain, driven by Azure revenue growth. “This quarter we exceeded $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR, outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago,” CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.The company is now trying to compete directly against Amazon’ (AMZN  -  Free Report) Web Services division. Microsoft compares AWS directly to its Azure business on its own website: “When you compare AWS versus Azure, you’ll find that Azure has more comprehensive compliance coverage with more than 70 compliance offerings, and was the first major cloud provider to contractually commit to the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).”Global Software-as-a-Service revenue is predicted to grow from $57 billion in 2017 to nearly $100 billion in 2020. This is a great sign for Microsoft, which now relies on its clould computing and service-based business more than ever, as its traditional personal computing business slows down.Microsoft is currently trading at 26x earnings, which is well below the “Computer – Software” industry average. On top of that, the company has seen its cash flow growth rate hit 17.18%. This crushes the industry average and should help Microsoft further invest in new technologies such as artificial intelligence.Microsoft is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is set to report its Q2 fiscal 2018 earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, Jan. 31.Fellow tech giants Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) are set to report earnings later this week (also read: Upcoming Tech Earnings Reports to Watch: NFLX, TXN, INTC).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

797,TXN,"As the fourth-quarter earnings season is warming up, the focus is back on the major S&P 500 sectors. Earnings growth is expected to be strong for the technology sector, with total earnings expected to be up 14.1% on the back of an 8.6% increase in revenues. (Read More)Strong earnings outlook from the tech sector puts the spotlight on one of its best-performing sub-sectors, semiconductors. The semiconductor sector has performed favorably over the last one year, with iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) rising 6.2%. The leading sector gainers for the period are Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Micron (MU  -  Free Report), which have increased 49.5% and 98.3% in the past year, respectively.   Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) and Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report earnings on Jan 23 and Jan 25, respectively. In this context, comparing these two stocks from the broader industry would be pertinent. Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Texas Instruments carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceThe broader industry has performed strongly over a year, increasing 52.3% versus the S&P 500’s 23.6% gains. Texas Instruments has outperformed both the broader industry and the S&P 500, increasing 55.7% over the same period. In contrast, Intel has posted an increase of only 20.4%. EBITDA MarginThe most appropriate profitability ratio to evaluate these two semiconductor giants is EBITDA margin. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is ideal to compare two companies from the same industry but with different capital structures. Thus, EBITDA margin shows what percentage EBITDA makes up of total revenues. It provides investors with a good idea about both the cash flow and the operating profitability of a company. For the last year, the broader industry has an EBITDA margin of 42.2%. Coming to the individual EBITDA margin ratios, Intel’s reading of 41.43% is lower than that of Texas Instruments’ 46.47%. Clearly, Texas Instruments stands out in terms of profitability.Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term liabilities. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and compares it to that of the current level of liabilities. In the last 12 months, Intel has a current ratio of 1.6, which is lower than the industry average of 1.7 as well as Texas Instrument’s reading of 3.99. It is evident that Texas Instruments is more solvent than Intel. ValuationThe most appropriate valuation metric for a capital-intensive industry like semiconductor is the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio. This ratio successfully captures the fluctuation in earnings experienced by the sector. First, it is important to consider where the industry as a whole stands from a valuation perspective. Here, we can see that with a Price-to-Book ratio of 4.56, the broader industry is marginally overvalued compared with the S&P 500, which has a value of 3.95. Coming to the two chipmakers, Texas Instruments is overvalued relative to the broader industry, while Intel is less pricey than the same. Texas Instruments has a P/B ratio of 10.44, while Intel possesses a P/B ratio of only 2.94. On the valuation count, Intel holds a strong edge over its smaller rival Texas Instruments.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, both Texas Instruments and Intel have delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters. However, Intel stands out with an average earnings surprise of 9.8%, which is higher than Texas Instrument’s level of 9.2%.When considering Earnings ESP, Texas Instruments is better placed with a value of 1.06% while Intel has an ESP value of -0.9%. At the same time, Texas Instruments’ earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 1% over the last 30 days, while that for Intel has remained unchanged. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Intelholds an edge over Texas Instruments when considering dividend yield and valuations. However, when considering price performance, current ratio and EBITDA margin, Texas Instruments is clearly a better stock.Moreover, although Texas Instruments’ earnings performance is marginally lower than that of Intel, it has a strong ESP and witnessed better earnings estimate revisions. What clinches the case for Texas Instruments is the fact that it holds a higher Zacks Rank and better ESP value than Intel.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

798,TXN,"Being on the building-block side of technology, the industry will continue to benefit from the proliferation of the Internet and the growing digitization of our lives in the foreseeable future.Moreover, because of the growth potential in emerging markets, regulatory (and/or political) issues, particularly in places like China, can play an increasingly important role.At the same time, because end devices have to be priced lower to reach more people, the pressure on companies to bring down cost will remain.So companies will find it advantageous to move operations to places where labor may be cheaper or the proximity to manufacturing facilities can lower transportation and other cost. Industry consolidation is also likely to continue as the cost of developing new designs has increased manifold.Another feature we are likely to see more often is close collaboration with device makers facilitating quicker consumption and better inventory management.    Industry Offers Solid Shareholder ReturnsThe Zacks Semiconductor-General Industry, which is a stock group within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.So we see that the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 55.5% over the past year, while the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer and Technology Sector have rallied 13.2% and 17.9%, respectively.While the industry is small, players like Intel, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics are very important sector players, contributing to the performance of both the sector and the S&P 500. One-Year Price Performance Semi-General Stocks Look ExpensiveThe strong run in share prices over the past year have, however, led to a relatively rich valuation.Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of price to forward 12 months’ earnings, we see that the industry’s 17.5X is ahead of the S&P 500’s 17.1X.  It does, however, compare favorably with the sector’s 19.7X. Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of price to forward earnings growth, we see that the industry’s 2.1X is again ahead of the S&P 500’s 1.8X. It is also ahead of the sector’s 1.7X. Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of price to free cash flow, we see that the industry’s 29.1X is again ahead of the S&P 500’s 22.5X. It is also ahead of the sector’s 19.4X. So any way you cut it, the industry is overvalued.Outperformance May Continue Due to Solid Growth PotentialWith no end in sight to top line expansion from cloud computing, big data, IoT, auto and other mass market adoption, the main concern for stocks in this industry is the bottom line. Because of the high level of differentiation inherent in the business, profit margins may be expected to remain attractive. But companies will continue to invest in the business because of growing competition and the constant need to innovate (among other things).The above-ratio analysis shows that investors are upbeat about the solid prospects but the real question for them is whether this group has the potential to continue performing better than the broader market in the quarters ahead.One way to find out is by taking a look at the earnings outlook for the constituent companies since empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences its stock’s performance. In this respect, a comparison of the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with last year’s reported number may be indicative of its prospects.The charts below show the magnitude and direction of change in earnings estimates. The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Semi-General industry of $4.06 per share implies a strong double-digit year-over-year improvement, with the trend in earnings estimate revisions remaining positive throughout.Price and Consensus: Semi-General Industry Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts remain confident about this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year is up 11.5% since Mar 31, 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Semi-General industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #10, which places it at the top 4% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows a very slight deterioration in the industry’s rank over the past five weeks. Semi-General Stocks Promise Long-Term GrowthWhile the near-term prospects look attractive for investors, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Semi-General industry appears unclear. This could be because it is hard to project what exactly will happen 3-5 years out at the cutting edge of technology. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate of 8.3% is therefore unchanged since the beginning of the year. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate The long-term growth is a continuation of strong performance over the past few years. Take revenue for example, which has gained momentum since 2016. Or the EBIT, which shows an attractive upward trend. Investments are clearly continuing with the book value per share rising steadily. At the same time, the tangible book value is trending down, as most of the value is locked in patents, with manufacturing and other facilities being managed efficiently. Bottom LineThis is a great place to invest in right now, both with respect to the near term and the longer term. While valuations do appear rich, there are indications that the momentum will continue. So while the more cautious of us might wait for a better entry point, here are some stock picks for the rest-NVIDIA Corp (NVDA  -  Free Report): The stock has gained 64.9% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up 12.5% in the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: NVDA Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report): The stock has gained 43.6% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is unchanged in the last 60 days and up 10.3% in the last 30 days.Price and Consensus: TXN Xcerra Corp (XCRA  -  Free Report): The stock has gained 44.1% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up 4.0% in the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: XCRA The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

800,TXN,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) reported stellar sales and profits in the fiscal third-quarter 2018, fueled by high demand for chips that store data in mobile devices and components. The chipmaker’s upbeat performance once again crushed all doubts surrounding the stock and restored faith in the semiconductor market amid trade war concerns.Thus, investing in solid chip stocks that display this kind of resilience seems like a foolproof plan.Micron Assures That Chip Demand Remains High Despite OddsMicron, yet again, quashed all doubts surrounding the company’s growth prospects. Its sales decline in China with the absence of ZTE due to a U.S. Commerce Department ban and China’s close watch on higher chip prices were supposed to be a huge setback.But the U.S. maker of memory chips registered solid gains in profits and revenues and gave a strong forecast. This shows that demand for memory chips will continue to improve along with higher prices of these components.Micron’s chief executive Sanjay Mehrotra aptly stated that they “see robust demand drivers for DRAM (dynamic random access memory) whether in the data center or mobile or graphics.” He added that the current trends in artificial intelligence and new high-resolution imaging will drive the requirement for more and more memory.Escalating trade tensions between United States and China, by the way, is one of the greatest risks faced by chipmakers. After all, semiconductor companies generate highest revenues from the Asian nation at 52%, as per Morgan Stanley research estimates.Morgan Stanley, however, did mention that semiconductors are components of products that are sold elsewhere. Thus, the adverse effect of high revenue exposure to China “is not as meaningful” as it can be for other industries. Lest we forget, Trump has time and again showed that his approach toward tariffs is all bark and no bite.Micron’s Blockbuster PerformanceComing back to Micron’s performance, the chipmaker’s fiscal third-quarter 2018 profits more than doubled from the year-ago levels, while sales surged 40%. The chipmakers net income of $3.82 billion, or $3.10 per share, on sales of $7.8 billion, was up from $5.57 billion in the year-ago quarter.The Boise, ID-based company’s chief financial officer Dave Zinsner forecast fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.23 to $3.37 a share on revenues of $8 billion to $8.4 billion, better than analysts’ average projection of $3.16 a share on sales of $8.02 billion.Shares gained as much as 3% as soon as Zinsner made the forecast. The company’s expected growth rate for the current year is 132.5% compared with the broader S&P 500’s estimated rally of 24.5%. In fact, Micron’s shares have been on a tear, soaring 84.2% in a year’s time, way higher than the S&P’s gain of 14%.Micron is a Screaming BuyWith its share prices climbing north on broad and sustained demand for its products, Micron has earned a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.To top it, nine earnings estimates moved north over the last 60 days, while none moved south for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings jumped 4.9% in the same period.Buy 4 More Chipmakers for Outstanding ReturnsBut, why just buy Micron? Semiconductor chips are very much in demand largely due to gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and automation. E-sports, a multiplayer video game for professional gamers, needs thousands of semiconductor chips for production, while chips are an essential part of crypto mining as these provide the processing power needed for decoding blockchain algorithms.Banking on such broad-based bullish trends, here we present four other chipmakers that promise stellar returns in the near future. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) operates as a visual computing company worldwide.

801,TXN,"Shares of Wall Street superstar Micron (MU  -  Free Report) opened slightly lower on Monday, just two days before the company is set to release its third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results. So let’s take a look to see why the semiconductor giant looks like a strong buy stock that investors might want to consider scooping up before Micron reports on Wednesday afternoon.Recent News J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) analysts reiterated their overweight rating for Micron stock on Monday, pointing directly to strong demand for memory in the cloud computing market. The analyst also reaffirmed his $82 price target, which marked a 41% upside from Friday's closing price of $58.23 per share.""Stay long Micron heading into earnings,” Harlan Sur wrote in a note to clients. “We see further upside in Micron shares as the team is executing well in an overall constructive S/D [supply/demand] memory environment… demand fundamentals likely to remain strong driven by robust cloud data center spending.""The banking power’s Micron update comes just a few weeks after Micron announced that it is set to produce and ship the “industry's first 4bits/cell 3D NAND technology” along with Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). Micron also said it would repurchase $10 billion of outstanding common stock as part of a new plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders starting in fiscal 2019. “The data-driven economy will transform nearly every industry, and drive secular growth in demand for memory and storage,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement.Investors should remember that stock repurchase plans often indicate that a company’s executives and board members believe shares are relatively cheap or at least a solid deal at their current price.Stock MovementMicron stock has skyrocketed nearly 371% over the last two years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 34% climb. Shares of Micron have also greatly outperformed its industry’s roughly 105% surge, which includes the likes of Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Year to date, Micron stock has surged 41%, compared to its industry’s roughly 17% climb. Investors should note that MU has dipped 4.2% over the last three months, against its industry’s 6.5% gain. This recent dip helps make Micron stock look more attractive simply because it is cheaper, but that’s just the start.ValuationComing into Monday, Micron stock was trading at 5.5X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a huge discount compared to its industry’s 12.7X and the S&P’s 17.3X. If we dive a little deeper, Micron’s valuation picture looks even better. Over the last two years, Micron stock has traded as high as 32.5X and as low as 4.2X, with a two-year median of 6.2X. Furthermore, Micron stock looks like a steal compared to Nvidia’s two-year median of 38.6X. With all that said, investors should be able to say with confidence that Micron stock is a great value investment, and it looks even better based on its impressive growth prospects.OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s quarterly revenues to pop 38.3% to hit $7.7 billion. Meanwhile, the company’s full-year revenues are projected to soar nearly 46% to reach $29.62 billion.Transitioning to the other end of the income statement, Micron’s quarterly earnings are projected to skyrocket nearly 94% to touch $3.14 per share. And if that growth projection didn’t impress investors enough, Micron’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 132% to reach $11.53 per share.Earnings Revision Activity Investors should also note that Micron’s earnings estimate revisions activity has been extremely positive recently. MU has earned eight upward earnings estimate revisions for its third-quarter, against zero downward changes, all within the last 30 days. This helped lift Micron’s Q3 estimate by $0.28 per share. Within this same timeframe, Micron earned the same upward revisions ratio for its full-year earnings, which lifted its estimate by $0.49 per share.Bottom Line Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” Grade for Value and “Bs” for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. Investors should remember that not only does MU stock present great value at the moment, it also sits below its 52-week high. Lastly, Micron is expected to expand both its top and bottom lines in a major way, while looking poised to surge in a growth industry.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

802,TXN,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT. Vishay markets its portfolio to manufacturers of everything from biometric monitoring systems to fitbands and smart appliances.VSH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is a hot momentum play, with shares adding more than 10% in the past four weeks to test new 52-week highs. Analysts have also become more bullish on the company’s earnings outlook, with full-year EPS estimates improving nearly 36% in the trailing quarter. Bottom LineThe Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world.  And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

804,TXN,"Keeping its positive surprise history alive, Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report) reported solid results for fourth-quarter 2017 earlier this week, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of better-than-expected performance for both, the top as well as the bottom line. Also, revenues and earnings came in ahead of the company’s guidance ranges. Apart from this, Proofpoint witnessed significant year-over-year improvement in revenues and earnings.However, the company’s outlook for the current quarter and full-year 2018 has made investors a little cautious over Proofpoint’s long-term prospects, resulting in a dip of approximately 2.4% in the company’s share price during after-hour trading yesterday.Nonetheless, the company has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to over the past year.

806,TXN,"Trade disputes between the two biggest economies escalated after the United States and China engaged in a tariff war. In his pledge to punish the alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property, Trump finally unveiled the list of $50 billion worth of Chinese goods targeted for 25% tariff to be applied in two phases.The first round of tariff will apply to 818 imported Chinese goods worth $34 billion, including auto, electric cars, aerospace, communications tech, new materials and robotics and will go into effect on Jul 6. The second wave of 284 goods worth another $16 billion is under review and will go into effect after a public comment. This includes semiconductors, and a broad range of electronics and plastics related to China's Made in China 2025 strategic plan, aiming to dominate the emerging high-technology industries that will drive future economic growth for China (read: Trump, Tariff & Geopolitics Lead May: 10 Top ETF Stories).In retaliation, the second-largest country announced that it will slap a 25% tariff on 659 American goods for a similar amount. The list of goods was more than six-fold from an earlier version released in April. Penalties on 545 American goods worth $34 billion will be effective Jul 6 and targets agricultural products, autos and seafood. The 545 products include lobsters, soybeans, electric cars, orange juice, whiskey, salmon and cigars, according to the Ministry of Finance. Notably, most items are food and other farm goods hitting American farmers the most.The new tariffs will hit hard the American seafood industry. The United States imported more than $2.7 billion in Chinese seafood, and exported more than $1.3 billion to China last year. In particular, the Maine lobster industry will be hurt the most as it was worth more than $430 million at the docks last year. Chinese imports of American lobster have grown exponentially in recent years, rising to $142.4 million last year from $108.3 million in 2016. Then, Salmon is the biggest seafood item being exported to China and accounted for $318.5 million of the total seafood last year.The implementation date for the remaining 114 products will be announced later and will include chemical products, medical equipment and energy products.As Trump threatened to pursue an additional tariff if China retaliates, he is seeking for another tariff on $100 billion in Chinese goods, according to Reuters. The intensifying tariff talks could trigger a full-fledged trade war between the world's two largest economies and hit hard various corners of the economy. Below we have highlighted ETFs & stocks from those areas:Farm BeltAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States exports about $14 billion worth of soybeans to China.

The stock has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. Fortinet has appreciated 43.1%, while the industry has gained 23.9% during the same time period.A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the recently-reported quarter proved conducive to top-line growth. The company’s bottom line benefited fromhigher revenues and improved gross profit due to sales mix shift to higher-margin subscription services, which were partially offset by elevated operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing (S&M).In fact, Fortinet has an impressive earnings surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 26.2%. Backed by the impressive results, the company issued upbeat outlook for the second quarter and full year. Let’s take a look at what factors are driving Fortinet’s back-to-back robust quarterly performances.Shift in Business Model Driving Revenues & MarginsFortinet is currently focusing on selling more subscription-based services. This unique business model is helping the company generate stable revenues while expanding margins. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates more than 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 70-bp gross-margin expansion in 2017 and 220 bps (basis points) in the first quarter of this year. We believe the strategy will continue to improve the company’s top and bottom-line performances.Gaining Market Share in UTM SpaceAccording to industry analysis, Unified Threat Management (UTM) is believed to be one of the fastest growing segments in Network Security with high-single to low-double digits projected growth. Given Fortinet’s sustained focus on enhancing its UTM portfolio through product development and acquisitions, we believe the company will continue to increase its market share in the segment and retain its leadership position.Fortinet has a diversified product portfolio for PCs, mobile and enterprise security. This apart, its partnerships with Exodus Intelligence, Cisco ACI, NTT Communications and VMware NSX Partner Ecosystem have been helping it gain market share. Notably, the company holds a market share of 18-20% in the space.Impressive ValuationsThe stock currently trades at a forward earnings estimate at 40.9x, which is way lower than the industry to which it belongs to average of 82.9x. Given its recent track record of revenues and earnings growth, as well as the long-term forecast, the stock is highly undervalued which indicates that it still has significant upside potential.Moreover, Fortinet has a VGM Style Score of B. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive its price.Consequently, we believe the stock has huge potential to surge higher and therefore, investors should consider it for near-term opportunities. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

814,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 23 after the bell.We expect the company to perform well driven by strength in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. It continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars in these areas. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.We observe that shares of Texas Instruments have gained 60% over the past 12 months, outperforming the industry’s 49% rally.Expectations From AnalogTI’s analog business has been witnessing both sequential and year-over-year growth for the last four quarters. This was driven by strong performance in almost all the product lines. Last quarter, this segment generated $2.7 billion, up 12% sequentially and 16% from the year-ago quarter.We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter, given TI’s compelling product line and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $2.5 billion.Expectations From Embedded ProcessingThis segment has also been growing sequentially and year over year for the last four quarters, driven by growth across all product lines. Last quarter, it generated $931 million, up 7% sequentially and 17% year over year.This segment is also expected to do well in the to-be-reported quarter, as product lines remain strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $853 million.Overall The company has always executed well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices.Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even when it is expanding. Management remains focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

817,TXN,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT. Vishay markets its portfolio to manufacturers of everything from biometric monitoring systems to fitbands and smart appliances.VSH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is a hot momentum play, with shares adding more than 10% in the past four weeks to test new 52-week highs. Analysts have also become more bullish on the company’s earnings outlook, with full-year EPS estimates improving nearly 36% in the trailing quarter. Bottom LineThe Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world.  And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Per management’s anticipation, revenues declined 2.8% sequentially, primarily due to seasonal weakness in demand for broadband access and set-top box products.Broadcom stated that a slowdown in demand for optical products from access and metro networks hurt the top line. However, demand from data centers was strong in the quarter.Wireless Communications (37% of total revenues) were up 33.4% year over year and 40% quarter over quarter to roughly $1.80 billion.

However, the downside trend is projected to improve beyond the quarter, primarily driven by increasing traction of 10G technology to support broadband video delivery.Wireless Communications revenues are projected to grow sequentially owing to strong demand from the large North American customer. For the rest of 2018, Broadcom expects significant increase in FBAR content driven by the need for additional filtering at the antenna.Moreover, the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth driver for the segment.Management stated that Enterprise Storage segment results in the first-quarter of fiscal 2018 will benefit from the Purley product cycle and recovery in HDD demand.

819,TXN,"At times, it is prudent to retain certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors should retain if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.Factors In Favor of Cirrus LogicCirrus Logic is a premier supplier of high-performance analog circuits and advanced mixed-signal chip solutions. The company has broadened product portfolio. Its chips are used in DVD players/recorders, disc drives, sound chips for computers, XBox, professional audio, mobile technologies and voice transmission.  Notably, the company is a major chipset provider to Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Samsung as it generates a significant portion of revenues from them. Consequently, we believe that new products are likely to drive sales in the near term.Notably, Cirrus Logic reported better-than-expected second-quarter results and provided encouraging third-quarter revenue guidance. This can be attributed to higher adoption of its products and strength in customer relationships.Continued investments in the audio segment have also helped the company to come up with innovative products from time to time. This aids it in attracting new customers and brings in additional revenues. Additionally, expansion in the LED market continues to drive growth.The company also has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.1%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 18.3%.Moreover, from a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate, which signifies a huge upward potential. Cirrus Logic currently trades at a forward P/E of 12.63x as compared with the industry group average of 40.20x.Factors Against Cirrus LogicNotably, shares of the company have gained 2.6% in the last one year, significantly underperforming the industry’s growth of 48.3%.As Cirrus Logic generates a significant portion of revenues from Apple, there is always an inherent risk of losing an Apple design contract, which will significantly hurt financials. Moreover, sluggish economic growth, as well as IT spending may affect performance, going forward.Furthermore, the company faces competition from the likes of Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) and STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM  -  Free Report), which remains a concern.Currently, Cirrus Logiccarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public. Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

820,TXN,"Being on the building-block side of technology, the industry will continue to benefit from the proliferation of the Internet and the growing digitization of our lives in the foreseeable future.Moreover, because of the growth potential in emerging markets, regulatory (and/or political) issues, particularly in places like China, can play an increasingly important role. At the same time, because end devices in these markets have to be priced lower, the pressure on companies to bring down cost will remain.So companies will find it advantageous to move operations to places where labor may be cheaper or the proximity to manufacturing facilities can lower transportation and other cost.Another feature we are likely to see more often is close collaboration with device makers facilitating quicker consumption and better inventory management.     Industry Offers Solid Shareholder ReturnsThe Zacks Semiconductor-General Industry, which is a 7-stock group within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.So we see that the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 53.2% over the past year, while the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer and Technology Sector have rallied 13.9% and 16.1%, respectively.While the industry is small, players like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), NVIDIA, Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report) are very important sector players, contributing to the performance of both the sector and the S&P 500.  One-Year Price Performance Semi-General Stocks Look ExpensiveThe strong run in share prices over the past year have, however, led to a relatively rich valuation.Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of price to forward 12 months’ earnings, we see that the industry’s 19X in ahead of the S&P 500’s 17.1X.   It does however compare favorably with the sector’s 19.3X. Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of price to forward earnings growth, we see that the industry’s 2.3X is again ahead of the S&P 500’s 1.8X.   It is also ahead of the sector’s 1.7X. Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of price to free cash flow, we see that the industry’s 30.7X is again ahead of the S&P 500’s 22.6X.   It is also ahead of the sector’s 19.8X. So any way you cut it, the industry is overvalued.Outperformance May Continue Due to Solid Growth PotentialWith no end in sight to top line expansion from cloud computing, big data, IoT, auto and other mass market adoption, the main concern for stocks in this industry is the bottom line. This could be impacted among other things by growing competition between players and the constant need to innovate. But because of the high level of differentiation inherent in the business, profit margins may be expected to remain attractive.  The above ratio analysis shows that investors are upbeat about the solid prospects but the real question for them is whether this group has the potential to continue performing better than the broader market in the quarters ahead.One way to find out is by taking a look at the earnings outlook for the constituent companies since empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences its stock’s performance. In this respect, a comparison of the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with last year’s reported number could be indicative of its prospects.The charts below show the magnitude and direction of change in earnings estimates. The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Semi-General industry of $3.96 per share implies a strong double-digit year-over-year improvement, with the trend in earnings estimate revisions remaining positive throughout.Price and Consensus: Semi-General Industry Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts remain confident about this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year is up 8.8% since Mar 31, 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Semi-General industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #11, which places it at the top 4% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the improvement in the industry’s rank has been more or less consistent over the past five weeks.  Semi-General Stocks Promise Long-Term GrowthWhile the near-term prospects look attractive for investors, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Semi-General industry appears unclear. This could be because it is hard to project what exactly will happen 3-5 years out at the cutting edge of technology. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate of 8.3% is therefore unchanged since the beginning of the year. This compares to 9.7% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate The long-term growth is a continuation of strong performance over the past few years. Take revenue for example, which has gained momentum since 2016. Or the EBIT margin, which shows an attractive upward trend. Investments are clearly continuing with the book value per share rising steadily. At the same time, the tangible book value is trending down, as most of the value is locked in patents, with manufacturing and other facilities being managed efficiently. Bottom LineThis is a great place to invest in right now, both with respect to the near term and the longer term. While valuations do appear rich, there are indications that the momentum will continue. So while the more cautious of us might wait for a better entry point, here are some stock picks for the rest-NVIDIA Corp (NVDA  -  Free Report): The stock has gained 64.8% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up 12.5% in the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: NVDA Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report): The stock has gained 37.5% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up 10.3% in the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: TXN Xcerra Corp (XCRA  -  Free Report): The stock has gained 41.0% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up 4.0% in the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: XCRA Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

821,TXN,"Ambarella Inc. (AMBA  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for first-quarter fiscal 2019, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but revenues marginally fell short of the same. Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, its top- and bottom-line results registered declines mainly due to a substantial decline in chip sales to GoPro Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report), along with the prevalent softness in the drone market. Earnings were also affected by elevated operating expenses.Furthermore, the company provided a soft outlook for the current quarter which hurt investor’s confidence, resulting in a sharp decline in its stock price during yesterdays’ after-hour trade.The company’s share price plunged nearly 9% in the late-hour trade on Tuesday. Notably, the stock has underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the past year. Ambarella has lost 17.3% of its value in the said period, while the industry has gained 6.7%.Let’s discuss the quarterly results in detail.Quarter in DetailThe company’s fiscal first-quarter revenues slipped 11.2% year over year to $56.9 million, mainly due to the decline in drone, sports and VR camera revenues, partially offset by strong performances in the IP security and auto markets. Moreover, quarterly revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $58 million. However, the company’s revenues came toward the higher-end of management’s guided range of $54.5-$57.5 million.Excluding sales to GoPro (GPRO  -  Free Report), revenues dipped 12.5% year over year.The company’s three largest customers who contributed more than 10% to its fiscal first-quarter revenues were WT Microelectronics, Hakuto and Chicony. WT Microelectronics’ contribution totaled 58.3%, while Hakuto and Chicony contributed 12.3% and 11.2%, respectively.On a non-GAAP basis, the company reported gross margin of 61.8%, which came in 250 basis points (bps) lower than the year-ago quarter. The figure contracted 290 bps from the previous-quarter tally. The decline in gross margin was mainly due to an unfavorable product mix. The company noted that sales of lower-margin China security products increased, while the high-margin drone sales declined in the reported quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $31 million, up from the $25.7 million incurred in the year-ago quarter and $29.5 million reported in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Operating expenses flared up mainly due to increased headcount costs as the company continues to invest in development and support headcounts to grab the growing opportunities in the computer-vision market. However, non-GAAP operating expenses remained within the company’s previously guided range of $30-$32 million.Non-GAAP operating income slipped to $4.2 million from $15.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin shrunk to 7.5% from 24.3% reported in the year-ago quarter, chiefly due to dismal revenues, reduced gross margin and soaring operating expenses.Non-GAAP net income plunged to $4.5 million from $15.3 million reported in the year-earlier quarter. On per-share basis, the company’s earnings came in at 13 cents, witnessing a substantial decline from the year-ago quarter’s level of 44 cents. This year-over-year fall resulted from lower revenues and elevated operating expenses. However, the figure came well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents.Balance SheetAmbarella ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents & marketable securities of $414.1 million, down from $434.6 million recorded in the previous quarter.During the reported quarter, the company bought back 437,448 shares, for a total cash consideration of $20.6 million. Since the inception of its share-repurchase programs in June 2016, the company has bought back a total of 1,708,975 shares for a total consideration of $102.4 million. Ambarella has approximately $11.1 million remaining under the $50-million repurchase program, which commenced on Jul 1, 2017.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2019, revenues are expected between $60 million and $64 million (mid-point $62 million), down 10.6-16.2% from the year-earlier quarter. The guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $68.8 million.The company anticipates GoPro revenues to be immaterial to the current-quarter financial results. Non-GoPro revenues are projected to decline 8.6% on a year-over-year basis.The company predicts that the considerable decline in revenues from the drone market will adversely impact the ongoing quarter’s top-line performance. Additionally, it believes revenues from wearable and non-GoPro sports cameras will decline, particularly in the second half of the fiscal. Furthermore, the company is closely monitoring the trade war between the U.S. and China, the more it intensifies, the more it is a risk for the company’s growth prospects.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected between 59% and 61%, as compared with 63% recorded in the year-ago quarter. The contraction will be due to increase in China security revenues and decline in drone revenues.Non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated between $32 million and $33.5 million, up sequentially due to increase in “increased chip tape out fees and engineering headcount.”Currently, Ambarella carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of top-ranked stocks in the broader tech space are Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

824,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) designs and manufactures semiconductor solutions for analog and digital embedded and application processing. It has two major segments: Analog & Embedded Processing. The Analog segment semiconductors change real-world signals such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Embedded processing segment designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.Earnings Results The company recently reported Q1 18 earnings results where they beat the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates.  This was the ninth consecutive quarter where they either met or beat on both ends.  Overall, the results were quite impressive.  On a year over year basis, revenues rose by +11%, and EPS increased by +39%.  Further, the company posted a +19% improvement in cash flow from operations while free cash flows grew by +17%.  On a segment basis, Analog revenues increased by +14% while Embedded Processing revenues rose by +15%. Management cited high demand for its products in both the Industrial and Automotive markets, and broad-based order strength as the big drivers behind the impressive quarterly results. Most importantly for the long term outlook for the company, the Q1 results eased fears that semi demand was decelerating.  In the previous quarter there had been some concern that the semiconductor demand was hitting its peak cycle, but Q1’s performance, and strong Q2 guidance has eased those fears. Looking AheadGoing forward, management’s Q2 EPS and revenue guidance was just above the midpoints of the consensus estimates; EPS now between $1.19-1.39, and revenues ranging from $3.78-4.1 billion.  Further, management commented that its operating tax rates would be lower for both 2019 and 2020 than previously expected; 16% for 2019 down from 18%, and 20% in 2018 down from 23%. Performance YTD vs. S&P 500As you can see in the chart below, TXN has more than tripled the performance of the S&P 500 index since the beginning of the year.Increasing Earnings EstimatesAs you can see in the table below, earnings estimates have increased for Q2 18, Q3 18, FY 18 and FY 19 over the past 30 days.Lastly, TXN has returned $5.1 billion to its shareholders over the past 12 months in the form of dividends, and share repurchases.  Moreover, the dividend payments represented 45% of free cash flows.  These payments to holders is expected to continue through 2018 as the company has several billion remaining in its repurchase program. Currently, TXN has an annual dividend yield of 2.24%BG Staffing Inc. (BGSF  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is a national provider of temporary staffing services across a diverse set of industries. Its present business segments offer temp services in the Multi-Family, Professional and Commercial sectors. In the Multi-Family segment BG offers temporary workers that perform front office and maintenance personnel in 18 states (Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, N. Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island); temporary skilled contract labor for Finance & Accounting and also for IT implementation and maintenance projects nationwide from offices in 5 states (Texas, Louisiana, N. Carolina, Maryland, Rhode Island); temp labor services in various skilled and unskilled positions to primarily distribution and logistics customers in its Commercial segment in 5 states (Texas, Wisconsin, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi).The impressive employment numbers and current unemployment rate have brought staffing companies into focus.  We received two reports that confirmed the jobs situation this week; the ADP jobs report, and the initial jobless claims report.  The ADP announced that the private sector added 178,000 new jobs while jobless claims fell by 14,000.  The unemployment rate held steady at 3.9%, and remains on track to meet the Fed’s expected level of 3.8% by the end of 2018.This means that the tight job market is expected to continue into 2019 which is great news for staffing firms as companies need help filling many open positions. BG Staffing is well positioned to take advantage of this situation as they fill many different job needs in a vast array of states.  The company’s success was seen in its last earnings report where revenues grew by +17.6% YoY, and net income jumped up by +89.4% when compared to the year ago quarter. L. Allen Baker Jr, President and CEO commented on the impressive quarterly results, “I'm very pleased with our 1st quarter 2018 financial results - they are a reflection of BG Staffing's unique value proposition, the solid performance from our recent acquisitions, and our disciplined approach to cost control. We met or exceeded our goals in every significant category.”To add to all the positives surrounding BGSF, the company currently pays a +6.43% annual dividend yield, which is well above the S&P 500’s 1.85%.Price and Earnings Consensus GraphAs you can see in the graph below the company has been doing very well since the second half of 2017, and its year over year consensus earnings estimates have risen as well.Bottom lineThe strong jobs and employment situation is a huge tailwind for the company, and is expected to remain a driver for the next several quarters.  Further, the company’s wide range of staffing services in a multitude of different states will enable it to capture several growing job sub-segments as more companies turn to staffing firms for their employment needs.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

825,TXN,"The popular adage “Sell in May and Go Away” proved wrong this year as Wall Street is on track to log the best May in nine years. With just one trading session left to the month, the S&P 500 gained 3.3%, Dow Jones is up 3.1%, and Nasdaq Composite Index has moved up by 5.1% in May.Power-packed earnings and easing U.S.-China trade fears led to the rally though bouts of political news like deepening crisis in Italy and renewed sanction on Iran as well as higher yields continued to keep the market at check. In particular, rising oil prices infused optimism in the energy sector and gave a huge boost to the broad stock market.That said, a few sectors have easily crushed the market this month. Below we have highlighted such sector ETFs that have gained handsomely in May and could be better plays in the months ahead should the trends prevail.ARK Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF (ARKG  -  Free Report)The biotech sector got a dual boost from encouraging fundamentals including a wave of mergers & acquisitions, and its non-cyclical nature, which provides a defensive tilt to the portfolio in a turbulent market. Additionally, Trump’s most-awaited plan to lower drug prices has added to the strength. While almost all the healthcare ETFs surged, ARKG emerged as the winner, climbing 13.6% (read: Pharma & Biotech ETFs Soar on Trump's Drug Plan).This is an actively managed ETF focusing on companies that are expected to benefit from extending and enhancing the quality of human and other life by incorporating technological and scientific developments, improvements and advancements in genomics into their business. The fund holds 38 stocks in its basket with heavy concentration on the top firm at 11.2%. Other firms hold no more than 7.52% share. The product has amassed $176.2 million in its asset base and trades in a good average daily volume of around 93,000 shares. The expense ratio comes in at 0.75%.First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL  -  Free Report)After taking a huge beating, the semiconductor corner of the broad technology market once again heated up in May due to reduced tensions between the United States and China. This is because U.S. chipmakers have the largest sales exposure to China. Additionally, the string of better-than-expected results from industry players such as Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), MKS Instruments (MKSI  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report) instilled optimism in the space.FTXL offers exposure to the most-liquid U.S. semiconductor securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Semiconductor Index.

827,TXN,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) both surged on Monday, which helped buck a recent downward trend for the two chip makers. Both of the semiconductor powers are also currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks. So let’s dive into some of Micron and Nvidia’s current fundamentals to see if either stock looks more appealing at the moment.Stock MovementOne of the best places for investors to start when evaluating a stock is its price movement. Before today’s climb, Nvidia had seen its stock price soar 1,079% over the last three years, which outpaces Micron’s 185% climb. Over the last two years, the stocks are a little more evenly matched, with NVDA up 416% compared to MU’s 332% expansion—both of which crush Wall Street darling Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 135%  climb as well as fellow chip giant Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) 52%.Narrowing down our focus, MU stock has climbed above NVDA over the last year, up 85% compared to roughly 73% for its peer. Investors should also note that 2018 has not been as kind to either Micron or Nvidia. Still, Micron has seen its stock price surge roughly 32%, while Nvidia has jumped 24% since the start of the year.More recently, MU and NVDA have both sunk roughly 9% during the last month, with both sitting below their 52-week highs. This should be good news since both stocks could be purchased at a lower price than they have traded at recently. But investors also need to understand their current valuation picture.ValuationComing into Monday, Micron stock was trading at 4.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared the S&P 500’s 16.8X and its industry’s 11.3 X—which includes Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Over the last year, Micron stock has traded as high as 6.8X, as low as 4.1X, and rocks a one-year median of 5.5X.At 33.1X, NVDA is trading at a significant premium compared to Micron, its industry, and the S&P. With that said, Nvidia stock has traded as high as 57.4X over the last year, with a one-year median of 44.1X, and it is currently trading just above its year-long low of 32.9X Stepping out a bit further, investors should be able to see that it is not too much of a stretch to say that Nvidia stock appears rather attractive at this current valuation. Meanwhile, Micron stock looks like one of the stronger value plays on the market, especially considering its growth projections.OutlookNow let’s look ahead because there is little reason to buy stocks that don’t seem to present any real ability to keep on climbing based on expanding top and bottom lines.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues to hit $8.22 billion, which would mark over a 33.8% climb from the year-ago period. Micron’s fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to soar over 48% to reach $30.13 billion. Moving onto the other end of the income statement, the company’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 136% to reach $11.72 per share, while its Q4 EPS figure is expected to expand by 63% to hit $3.30 per share.Transitioning to Nvidia, the company is projected to report Q2 fiscal 2019 revenues of $3.11 billion, representing a roughly 39% jump from the year-ago period. For its current full-year, Nvidia’s revenues are expected to surge nearly 36% to touch $13.18 billion. The company’s adjusted earnings are expected to expand by just over 81% this quarter and 61% for the year.Bottom LineBoth Nvidia and Micron are currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, with MU sporting an overall “A” VGM score and NVDA rocking an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Investors will also be pleased to note that NVDA and MU have received a ton of earnings estimate revisions recently.Micron has earned eight upward earnings estimate revisions for the full-year, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 30 days. Likewise, Nvidia has received 12 full-year revisions against zero downgrades, over the last 60 days.Clearly, it is hard to go wrong with either stock at the moment as both are projected to experience strong top and bottom line growth. The companies also operate in a growth industry and have set their sights on new areas just starting to boom, from AI to self-driving vehicle technology. Still, at the moment, the advantage has to go to Micron because of its outstanding value.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

828,TXN,"Micron Technologies, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) shares rallied to close at $62.62 on May 29, reaching an 18-year high. The semiconductor giant has been on a steady growth track despite slight weakness witnessed in the semiconductor industry, owing to selloffs in the broader tech market. Micron’s growth definitely proves the increasing demand for micro chips despite rising prices. Moreover, semiconductor stocks have been driving markets for a while now and are poised to perform well in the coming days.Micron’s Shares Hit 18-Year HighShares of Micron climbed 2.1% to $62.62, registering its highest close in 18 years on Tuesday. In the past one month, Micron’s shares have increased 33.8%, especially after the semiconductor giant raised its quarterly outlook and announced a $10 billion share buyback.Micron seems to be on solid ground although chip stocks have taken a hit lately. That said, the overall semiconductor market seems to be bouncing back after President Donald Trump last week tweeted that he is working with China’s president Xi Jinping to get Chinese company ZTE back into business after the Commerce Department last month imposed a ban on American companies from selling components to it for seven years.Understandably, there are enough reasons for investors to feel confident about Micron given that it has added $20 billion in market value in the past month, primarily because of predictions of a better-than-expected financial performance. Micron’s 36% gain in May is its best monthly performance since 2009.Micron has grown from strength to strength over the past few years and has emerged as an NAND and DRAM powerhouse. Micron has an expected earnings growth of 132.5% for the current year.Moreover, eight analysts have upwardly revised their estimates over the last 30 days with no downward revision. The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 4.9% over the last 30 days. Currently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Semiconductor Industry on Solid GroundChina is the largest memory chip importer accounting for 20% of 25% NAND chip sales and 20% of DRAM chip sales. However, rising prices of memory chips have been hurting Chinese phone and PC makers. This somewhat hit semiconductor stocks lately.Also, the Commerce Department last month imposed a ban on American companies from selling components to Chinese company ZTE for seven years, accusing it of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against North Korea and Iran.This lead ZTE to announce that it was ceasing operations, which had been worrying American chipmakers, as an export ban would mean lower revenues for U.S. chipmakers. However, with Trump tweeting on Sunday that he is working with Xi Jinping to get ZTE back into business, U.S. chipmakers have ample reasons to party.Given this upbeat scenario you can also consider four other semiconductor stocks to your portfolio. Now, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a Zacks Rank #1 and other relevant metrics.Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) is a global semiconductor design and manufacturing company that develops analog ICs and embedded processors. The company has expected earnings growth of 27.8% for the current year.

830,TXN,"Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results on Nov 8, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.67%. It is worth noting that Rockwell Automation has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.02%.We believe continued focus on Connected Enterprise (CE) integrated supply chain management system, and growth in transportation and consumer verticals and heavy industries have lifted investors’ sentiments for Rockwell Automation. Year to date, the company’s shares have yielded a return of 47.6%, outperforming 42.9% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Rockwell Automation is likely to beat estimates in the fiscal fourth quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: Rockwell Automation has an Earnings ESP of +1.94% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.75 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company’s favorable Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. Moreover, its positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Rockwell Automation, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Rockwell Automation, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Rockwell Automation, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayRockwell Automation expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.60-$6.80 for fiscal 2017. The mid-point of the guidance range reflects year-over-year growth of 13%. The company forecasts reported sales growth and organic sales growth to be in the range of 7-6%, respectively. The company anticipates continued growth in transportation and consumer verticals for the current fiscal. It also projects heavy industries to be up in low-single digits.Further, Rockwell Automation is increasing the number of industries, applications and geographies, as well as improving its investments to expand the value of CE. The company has made inroads with its pilot program, working with customers in a wide range of applications, including remote-asset monitoring and predictive analytics. These initiatives will drive double-digit growth in fiscal 2017.Notably, Rockwell Automation’s Control Products & Solutions segment, which generates around 54% of the company’s revenues, is anticipated to benefit from strategic acquisitions. Our consensus estimates reflect that net sales of the segment will reach $904 million in the fiscal fourth quarter, indicating 7.4% year-over-year growth.Again, the Architecture & Software division, which generates around 46% of the company’s revenues, will benefit from focus on core developments in its Logix and intelligent motor-control platform.

831,TXN,"Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) is riding high on robust performance from the data-centric portion of its business. Data Center Group, Internet-of-Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group form the crux of the company’s data-centric business model.The data-centric part contributed almost 44% of revenues, up from roughly 40% reported in the previous quarter. Additionally, strong growth from this part of the business fully offset PC market weakness which affected Client Computing Group (CCG) revenues. CCG accounted for almost 55% of the top line in the quarter.Intel’s initiatives in the data center, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles and Internet of Things (IoT) is lowering dependence on the PC market. These rapidly-growing market segments present significant prospects for the semiconductor giant in the near future.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for 2017 and 2018 earnings have increased significantly over the last 30 days, primarily driven by strong third-quarter results.Moreover, Intel currently has a trailing 12 month P/E ratio of 14.04, which compares favorably with what the S&P 500 index has witnessed over the last year. Additionally, the company’s dividend yield of 2.44% makes it an attractive investment.Intel’s shares have returned 23.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 16.5% rally of the S&P 500 index.  Autonomous Vehicles: A Key CatalystIntel is striving to penetrate the rapidly-growing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Per Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035. By 2035, more than 12 million fully autonomous and 18 million partially autonomous cars are expected to be sold per year, globally.The acquisition of MobilEye now enables Intel to offer almost anything related to self-driving vehicles — cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management.Management noted that in 2017, Mobileye has won 14 ADAS designs across 14 automakers, better than the 12 wins the company recorded in 2016.Intel has been a supplier to Alphabet inc’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Waymo self-driving car unit, which was revealed in the last quarter. Additionally, per Bloomberg, Intel will now be supplying the chips powering the infotainment systems in Tesla Model 3s and new versions of other cars. This is significant because Intel displaces NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), which has been making waves in the automotive segment.Intel’s automotive partner base has also expanded in the last two quarters. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has joined the company’s team, which also includes BMW and Mobileye.Intel intends to bring its highly-automated driving (Level 3) and fully-automated driving (Level 4/5) solutions into production by 2021. Moreover, in August, the chip-maker announced plans to build 100 “level 4” vehicles to test its self-driving technology. The company also partners automotive manufacturers like BMW and Fiat Chrysler.Intel also formed the Automotive Edge Computing Consortium which aims at developing an ecosystem for connected cars to support emerging services such as intelligent driving, the creation of maps with real-time data and driving assistance based on cloud computing.We believe that the company’s focus on the self-driving car market will boost sales of processing chips, sensor-chips, cloud software and many more, which will ultimately drive the top-line growth.Zacks Rank & Key PickIntel currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Although, Intel and Texas Instruments have advanced 30.6% and 35.4%, respectively in the last one year, both the companies underperformed the industry. NVIDIA is a clear winner on this count.Earnings History and Estimate RevisionsAll the three major chipmakers delivered positive surprises in each of the last four quarters. Intel, NVIDIA and Texas Instruments posted an average positive earnings surprise of 9.8%, 33.5% and 9.2%, respectively.In the last 30 days, Intel’s current-quarter estimates increased by 4 cents to 86 cents per share, while that for the current year advanced from $3.00 to $3.23 per share. NVIDIA’s current-quarter estimates advanced from $0.96 to $1.13 last month while current-year estimates jumped by 52 cents to $4.13 per share.Texas Instruments’ current-quarter estimates rose 7 cents to $1.08 last month and current-year estimates climbed from $4.13 to $4.33 per share. NVIDIA holds an edge over the other two companies with respect to both earnings history and estimate revisions.ValuationThe price-to-sales ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer-focused industry like semiconductor manufacturing, the fortunes of which are dictated by the variation in sales. This ratio is ideal for comparing companies from same sector by dividing the stock price of the company with its sales.Coming to the three stocks under consideration, NVIDIA and Texas Instruments are overvalued than the industry, which has a P/S ratio of 4.59. NVIDIA is also pricier than the other two, since it has a P/S ratio of 11.76, higher than Intel’s and Texas Instruments’ respective reading of 3.36 and 6.25. Clearly NVIDIA is overvalued than both Intel and Texas Instruments.ConclusionIn our comparative analysis, we find that the P/S ratio of NVIDIA is higher than both Intel and Texas Instruments. However, when considering price performance, NVIDIA holds a strong edge over Intel and Texas Instruments. Moreover, in the third quarter, NVIDIA witnessed considerably better year-over-year earnings growth than the other two chipmakers.Additionally, when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ previous earnings performance and estimate revisions, NVIDIA is clearly the best stock among the three chipmakers. In this respect, it can be concluded that NVIDIA is clearly a better investment proposition than Intel and Texas Instruments.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

835,TXN,"SINA Corporation (SINA  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.38%. Moreover, it has delivered positive earnings surprise in all the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive earnings surprise of 59.85%.SINA’s second-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 70 cents per share surged a massive 159.3% from the year-ago quarter while non-GAAP net revenues grew 48% to $356.3 million.Notably, SINA’s shares have gained 80.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s gain of 55.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderSINA’s user base has increased driven by growth in the number of mobile users. According to CNNIC report, mobile users in China accounted for 96.4% of total 751 million Internet users as of August 2017. We believe that SINA’s popular mobile portal and service offerings will enable the company to capitalize on the growing mobile market.Notably, strong performance of SINA’s Weibo platform continues to be a key growth driver. Advertising as well as non-advertising revenues continue to be driven by the momentum of the Weibo segment.Moreover, SINA’s initiatives to place itself as a leading video platform in the region are expected to increase user engagement and drive growth for the company.However, continuing investments in other verticals like Internet finance, automobile and sports will hurt profitability. Soft macroeconomic conditions in China and significant restrictions on online search and other social networking activities in the region remain concerns.Further, the company is also seeing some headwinds with regard to obtaining new media rights for sports in China. Moreover, it faces tougher year-over-year comparison. In third-quarter 2016, the company’s revenues were largely driven by Olympic Games. The soon-to-be reported quarter did not see an event of such magnitude.Additionally, SINA faces stiffening competition in most of its operational markets from companies including Tencent Holding Ltd., Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU  -  Free Report) and NetEase Inc. (NTES  -  Free Report), which pose a severe threat.Sina Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Sina Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sina Corporation QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

836,TXN,"Twilio Inc. (TWLO  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8. Notably, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in four straight quarters with an average beat of 61.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayTwilio offers multiple products which are broadly classified in three categories — Programmable Messaging, Programmable Voice and Programmable Video. The company has been witnessing tremendous demand for its programmable voice and messaging products, which is driving top-line performance. Furthermore, Twilio’s consistent efforts toward developing innovative use case products will continue to boost its revenues.Furthermore, Twilio’s strategies for expanding global footprint are commendable. The company has been continuously making investments to meet the requirements of a broader range of global developers and enterprises. Also, it is making strategic alliances and has employed more employees outside the U.S. office to enhance international operations.These efforts have paid off well for the company as evident from the rise in revenue contribution from outside the U.S. market to 16% in 2016 from 13% in 2013. The global expansion initiative is likely to drive the company’s top-line performance in the quarter.However, Uber’s strategy of managing communication services in-house will have a negative impact on Twilio’s overall prospects throughout this year. Furthermore, intensifying competition in the communications market and growing prevalence of in-app push notifications are major concerns.Twilio Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Twilio Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Twilio Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Twilio will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Twilio is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 8 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Twilio carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though this increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Year to date, the stock has gained 29.1%, underperforming its industry’s 31.1% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderTrueCar's revenues improved year over year in the last four quarters while its losses narrowed. The company’s second-quarter 2017 revenues increased 23% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, non-GAAP net income per share was a penny against net loss per share of 5 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.TrueCar’s core auto buying offering, inventory and pricing solution have been gaining strength. The company is currently working on a number of initiatives that are helping it to grow traffic, raise conversion rates and improve close rates. It is steering upstream into the research and discovery phase of the car buying process, and downstream into the transaction phase. Driven by these, market share and revenue gains are anticipated in the to-be-reported quarter.Truecar’s business remains strong on both new car and used car fronts. While used car is benefiting from transition to Capsella technology and SEO efforts, new car is riding on dealer network growth and improvement. These factors are expected to contribute to margin expansion in the to-be-reported quarter.The company made progress with its dealer pledge (reforming, product, advertising and business practices), launched in the first quarter of 2016, which is helping it to attract high quality franchise dealers to its platform. The company is expected to grow on the number of dealers in the to-be-reported quarter.

838,TXN,"TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 6.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upcoming quarter is pegged at $328 million. Also, average monthly unique hotel shoppers reached 153 million, increasing 11% year-over-year and click-based and transaction revenues per hotel shopper decreased 2% year-over-year. Lately, the company has been making efforts to get travelers to book hotels directly on its website instead of just using it as a review site. These efforts will continue to boost the company’s clicked-based advertising and transaction revenues, expanding its top-line growth in the upcoming quarter.TripAdvisor’s Non-Hotel segment revenues of $98 million increased 69% sequentially and 31% from the year-ago quarter. The growth will continue to accelerate, driven primarily by continued strong traction of attractions and restaurant businesses.However, mounting expenses due to new initiatives and investments are hurting the company’s profits. Also, management has been spending huge amounts on acquisitions. Though these continued investments could boost the top line, it can have a negative impact on the company’s near-term profitability.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

839,TXN,"Yesterday, after the bell, NVIDIA Corp (NVDA  -  Free Report) announced solid results, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9% on the top line and 41.5% on the bottom line. Both numbers were up strong double-digits from the same quarter last year.The Gaming segment that contributes more than two-thirds of its total volume, grew 25%, as the company saw strength across regions and form factors. Management also called out strength in the Nintendo Switch console and cryptocurrencies as drivers. The Data Center segment, which accounts for most of the balance, saw the strongest growth of 109%, testimony to NVIDIA’s growing position at cloud service providers and prowess in high performance computing (HPC). The emerging Professional Visualization segment grew 15%, as VR adoption at defense and automotive customers increased and demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations and grew.Coming off the strong results, management raised the quarterly dividend and promised to return $1.25 billion in 2019 through dividends and share repurchases.Guidance was also encouraging with revenue expectations of $2.65 billion for the January quarter bettering the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 billion.Investors responded to the news by sending share prices up 3.2% in extended trading. But is the stock a buy at these levels? Let’s find out:The share price has increased 8.7% over the past month compared to the industry’s 13.6%. The S&P 500 has however has grown much slower, at 1.9%. Over the past year, the S&P 500 has gained steadily to trade close to its 52-week high, but NVIDIA shares have been far more volatile. Significantly, its median value of 94.3% is higher than the S&P 500’s 91.6% although both NVDA and the S&P 500 are currently trading considerably higher than their median levels.The industry has a much lower median value, although it is currently trading closer to its 52-week high. These comparisons seem to indicate that there is room for further upside in NVDA shares. P/EThe forward 12 months price-to-earnings ratio for NVDA is currently 53.3X compared to the S&P 500 average of 18.8X and the industry average of 20.0X. The high, low and median values are also higher. Moreover, the trend lines indicate that NVDA is clearly overvalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry. P/SThe trailing 12 months price to sales ratio tells the same story. The P/S ratio for NVDA is currently 15.6X, which is higher than the S&P 500’s 3.15 but much lower than the X industry’s 6.25. The median of 3.34 is slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s 3.4 and the industry’s 5.0X. The highs and lows also indicate that NVDA is overvalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry. P/CFIn terms of cash flow, NVDA’s valuation of 56.4X is much higher than the S&P 500’s 23.1X and the industry’s 25.0X. Moreover, the highs, lows and median values are also much higher. Look at Its Peers…While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) is NVIDIA’s closest competitor when it comes to GPUs, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) is the one that it is increasingly pitted against as both companies look for growth in the data center, self-driving cars and other IoT. So let’s compare the two first.Intel’s current P/E based on forward 12 months earnings is just 14.2X, its price to sales ratio is 3.6X and its price to cash flow is 18.4X. So NVDA is obviously overvalued compared to Intel. A comparison with another semiconductor company Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) shows that this chipmaker has a P/E based on forward 12 months earnings of 21.7X, a price to sales ratio of 6.7X and a price to cash flow of 21.6X. Here too, NVDA looks overvalued. ConclusionIt’s true that NVDA has a solid pipeline that should continue to generate strong growth for years to come. But given the strong competition from companies like Intel and ongoing consolidation in the space, it could soon see many other competitors in Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), etc.So the high valuation with respect to the S&P 500, the industry in which it operates and a couple of its semiconductor peers, is good reason for caution. Or at least, it’s good reason to go for Intel or Texas Instruments instead. Both these companies have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here - that’s better than the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) assigned to NVIDIA.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

840,TXN,"A few worries beginning to creep into the market as the bulls couldn’t keep us going today.

841,TXN,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT. Vishay markets its portfolio to manufacturers of everything from biometric monitoring systems to fitbands and smart appliances.VSH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is a hot momentum play, with shares adding more than 10% in the past four weeks to test new 52-week highs. Analysts have also become more bullish on the company’s earnings outlook, with full-year EPS estimates improving nearly 36% in the trailing quarter. Bottom LineThe Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world.  And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Accretive acquisitions have been a key driver in this regard.The company’s recent acquisition of Conexant Systems and Multimedia Solutions Business of Marvell Technology Group expands its offerings in the smart home market and therefore is expected to increase its total addressable market. The company expects the acquisition of Conexant to drive gross margin in the September quarter.Moreover, we believe that Synaptics is now well positioned to capitalize on the growing voice interface modality. On the last conference call, management noted that collaborations with leading companies like Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Harman were a positive.However, sluggish display driver (DDIC) products business and smartphone demand in China are headwinds for Synaptics. In the last reported quarter, its revenues declined sequentially primarily due to a 6% decrease in mobile revenues as a result of continued weakness in the China mobile market.Further, competition from Atmel, Elan Microelectronics, Focaltech Systems, Goodix remains a concern for the company.Synaptics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Synaptics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Synaptics Incorporated QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

850,TXN,"The technology sector has been leading this month buoyed by soaring FAANG stocks — Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — and encouraging fundamentals like improved overseas demand, Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario.Notably, the semiconductor industry has been outperforming the broad sector buoyed by innovative technologies. New areas such as autonomous cars, cloud computing, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence are fueling exceptional growth in the industry, offsetting struggling traditional businesses like PCs and smartphones.Further, the industry is benefiting from an astronomical surge in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that has pushed semiconductor stocks to record highs. This is because mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors. A hardware known as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) has been designed exclusively for mining bitcoin (read: ETFs Riding High On Bitcoin Surge).Moreover, the deluge of strong earnings reports from the major players such as Micron MU, Texas Instruments TXN, Intel INTC, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) added to the strength.Given this, investors might want to tap the space with the top-performing semiconductor ETFs and stocks of this month.

851,TXN,"Fitbit Inc. (FIT  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 46.7%.Notably, Fitbit's results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four quarters. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 11.7%.The company's shares have lost 17.2% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 17.9%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fitbit Ionic & Others to Drive 3Q RevenuesThe company has been introducing new products to increase its revenue base. In late August, Fitbit introduced its first smartwatch, Ionic, a powerful, health-centric wearable. Ionic is a cheaper option to the Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Watch Series 3. We believe this new product, which focuses on health and wellness, should help the company to drive revenues in the upcoming third quarter.For the third quarter of 2017, Fitbit expects revenues to remain in the range of $380-$400 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $390.9 million.Increasing Competition from Apple and OthersDespite the wide range of devices Fitbit provides at different price points, it faces competition in both its high and low-end products. At the high end, there is Apple’s multi-functional Apple Watch. Also, other big manufacturers are developing connected devices on Alphabet-owned Google's Android operating system. At the lower end, there are fitness-tracking devices from competitors such as Jawbone and Garmin, which also give it strong competition.Other Growth InitiativesHowever, Fitbit is taking initiatives that are expected to pull the company out from slow growth. These steps include offering a streamlined set of products, improving software and services to offer more personalization to customers and achieving greater integration into the healthcare ecosystem.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.Fitbit has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +3.23% which indicates a likely positive surprise.

Where should investors look who want a little bit of extra income?Shareholders Finally Get Their PayoutIn 2017, companies spent over $900 billion on dividends and buybacks. This was the sixth year of increases. In 2018, 169 companies have announced dividend increases, with none reporting a decrease. That is the first time that has happened since 2003. Additionally, there have been some huge announcements, including Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) $100 billion share buyback program. Screening for DividendsIt’s not all about what pays out the highest yield. Investors also want companies with solid fundamentals, including rising earnings estimates.Brian screened for that by screening for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) stocks, both of which should have rising earnings estimates. He also included a dividend yield of 2% or higher, which is above that of the S&P 500 which is currently yielding 1.84%. The screen returned 206 stocks. If you are a premium member, you can replicate this screen on Zacks.com using the screening tool.  Here are five of Tracey and Brian’s favorites.5 Dividend Stocks to Keep on Your Shortlist1.      Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) is cashing in on the global economic boom thanks to its casinos in Macau. The stock is yielding 3.78%. 2.      Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) is no longer your father’s calculator company. It has shown strength in the auto and industrial sectors. TXN pays a dividend yielding 2.2%. 3.      Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) has great cash flow generation and is one of the few technology companies paying a dividend. It’s currently yielding 2.3%.4.      Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) just posted one of its strongest quarterly earnings reports in years but shares sold off anyway. A buying opportunity? It’s currently yielding 2%. 5.      Occidental Petroleum (OXY  -  Free Report) never cut its dividend even when crude plunged into the $30s. Even though the stock has soared in 2018 it is still yielding 3.7%. What about small cap stocks?Are there any dividend opportunities there or is it all about the large caps?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out what small caps you should be looking at for income, including one that has a yield over 5%.

853,TXN,"On Dec 13, Qorvo Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Why the Downgrade?The downgrade can primarily be attributed to Qorvo’s unimpressive revenue guidance for the next two quarters.Management cited delayed product cycle at its largest customer to be one of the major reasons that will hurt Mobile Products (MP) revenues in the current quarter. Moreover, fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to decline sequentially.Additionally, Qorvo anticipates gross margin to be flat sequentially in the current quarter, primarily due to unfavorable product mix.  Qorvo’s stock has gained 28.4% year to date, slightly outperforming the 23.7% rally of its industry. Mix Improvement Not ImminentWe note that consumer preference for mid-tier phones, which have lower dollar content, in India and China are affecting Qorvo’s growth trajectory. Management doesn’t expect 50% gross margin, while exiting fiscal 2018, primarily due to the aforementioned reason.However, Qorvo anticipates gross margin expansion to restart in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 and continue throughout the next fiscal driven by improving mix, ongoing productivity efforts and increasing fab utilization.Qorvo expects revenues to decline less than seasonally over the December-March time frame. In the second half, management expects double-digit year-over-year growth, with gains on new mobile platforms and continued strong IDP growth.Operating expenses in dollar terms are also expected to decline from fiscal 2017 level.Estimates Remain SteadyThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has been steady at $5.47 and $6.43, respectively.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.10 billion for fiscal 2018 and $3.37 billion for fiscal 2019.Other Stocks to Consider Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) are stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector. While Intel and NVIDIA sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long term earnings growth for Intel, NVIDIA and Texas Instruments is currently pegged at 8.42%, 10.25% and 9.60%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

854,TXN,"Launched on 06/23/2005, the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio (PSI  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Technology ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by Invesco Powershares. PSI has been able to amass assets over $355.81 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Technology ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index before fees and expenses.The index is comprised of stocks of semiconductor companies. The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factors.Cost & Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.63% for PSI, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.19%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.PSI's heaviest allocation is in the Information Technology sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.When you look at individual holdings, Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) accounts for about 5.85% of the fund's total assets, followed by Micron Technology Inc (MU  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments Inc (TXN  -  Free Report).PSI's top 10 holdings account for about 45.68% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF return is roughly 8.46%, and it's up approximately 23.33% in the last one year (as of 05/25/2018). PSI has traded between $41.30 and $57.37 in the past 52-week period.PSI has a beta of 1.26 and standard deviation of 22.90% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a high choice in the space. With about 30 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Technology ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) tracks MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index and the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) tracks PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF has $1.54 B in assets, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF has $1.68 B. SMH has an expense ratio of 0.35% and SOXX charges 0.48%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Technology ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

857,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts.Earnings of $1.26 per share beat the consensus mark by 14 cents, increasing 34% year over year and 22.3% sequentially. Revenues of $4.15 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $199 million and were up 12% on a year-over-year basis and 11.5% sequentially. It came ahead of the guided range of $3.74–$4.06 billion.Despite strong results, shares fell 1.5% in afterhours trading possibly due to a sluggish top-line outlook. Texas Instruments shares have rallied 31.5% year to date, underperforming its industry’s gain of 35.7%.The strong results were mainly driven by strength in auto and industrial markets. The communications market and enterprise systems also grew year over year. Personal electronics revenues were flat.Segment wise, growth of analog and embedded processing applications business was strong. These typically yield a more stable business as well as strong margins. The Other segment declined year over year.Texas Instruments Incorporated Revenue (TTM) Texas Instruments Incorporated Revenue (TTM) | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteTexas Instruments continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.Internally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on an expansion plan.The company remains focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages. Notably, free cash flow over the past 12 months was $4.25 billion or 29% of revenues. Overall, we remain optimistic about TI’s compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. However, risks associated with a high debt level persist.Let’s see what the numbers say.Revenues in DetailAnalog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated 65%, 23% and 12% of quarterly revenues, respectively.Analog, which includes Power, Signal Chain and High Volume products, was up 12% sequentially and 16% from the year-ago quarter to $2.7 billion. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong performance in product lines — power and signal chain.The Embedded Processing segment, which includes Connected Microcontrollers and Processors, was up 7% sequentially and 17% year over year to $931 million. The year-over-year growth was driven by stronger sales across both product lines — processors and connected microcontrollers.The Other segment, which includes DLPs, custom ASICs and calculators, was up 18% sequentially but down 13% year over year.

However, the same increased 1% sequentially on better-than-expected demand at the SSD (Solid-State Drive) segments along with increased demand from enterprise.The networking business (24%) increased 3% year over year and 2% sequentially mainly due to increase in the network of processor product line.Revenues from connectivity (17%) increased 19% year over year and 4% sequentially, primarily driven by wins in gaming and home media streaming applications. Other product (8%) revenues during the quarter declined 22% year over year.Marvell’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $379.5 million, up 5.7% on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin also increased from 57.2% to 61.3% on a year-over-year basis, primarily buoyed by a favorable product mix and higher revenue base.Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 13.8% year over year to $204.5 million. As a percentage of revenues operating expenses contracted 480 basis points to 33.2%. Marvell’s non-GAAP operating margins came in at 28.4% compared with 19.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. The results were positively impacted by lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.The company reported non-GAAP net income (excluding stock-based compensation and all one-time items) of approximately $171.8 million during the quarter as compared with $111.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Marvell exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.732 billion as compared with $1.574 billion in the previous quarter.

Moreover, the company provided encouraging fourth-quarter earnings guidance.Though the macro headwinds and stringent regulations might put the financials under pressure in the near term, we believe that the strong demand for Marvell’s 4G LTE products could be a catalyst. This will be supported by growth from the company’s wide range of newly-launched Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.In an effort to expand offerings beyond hard disk drives to high growth areas such as data centers and wireless communications, Marvell recently entered into an agreement to acquire Cavium. The buyout will provide the company an opportunity to expand offerings and access newer markets.Going forward, the company’s current restructuring initiative will help Marvell improve cloud infrastructure and applications, which are projected to drive the top line. The latest buyback scheme also reflects sound financial position and favorable prospects.However, competition in the semiconductor market from major players such as Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) remains a headwind.Currently, Marvell carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock in the technology space is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

860,TXN,"The Q3 earnings season has reached its tail end, with 90.3% of the S&P 500 index market capitalization that has reported so far up 6.8% on 6.2% revenue growth. The beat is impressive with 73.4% surpassing EPS estimates and 67% coming ahead of top-line expectations.  Revenue growth represents acceleration and is widespread.

It acquired FORTRUST for $128 million. The acquisition will add 9 MW of existing capacity and opportunity for further expansion in the future.Combined with the data center facility in North Virginia, the company will have 30 megawatts of capacity by year end, per management. Moreover, the company's recent announcement to acquire data centers in London and Singapore will help it gain ground in the international markets.However, Iron Mountain’s Service revenues remain modest due to falling activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. Besides, forex fluctuations, fragmented nature of the industry and stiff competition continue to be overhangs. Further, the company’s highly-leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Currently, Iron Mountain carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderTop-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) and Jabil Inc (JBL  -  Free Report).

862,TXN,"Shares of Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) have slipped since the company reported strong first quarter financial results on May 10. This slight post-earnings dip might present investors the best chance to buy Nvidia stock at this price for some time. Let’s take a look why.Q1 To briefly recap Nvidia’s first quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings skyrocketed 141% from the year-ago period to $2.05 per share. Meanwhile, the Santa Clara, California-based tech power’s revenues soared 66% to $3.21 billion. Furthermore, Nvidia’s crucial Gaming revenues popped 68% to touch $1.72 billion.Future Looking quickly ahead, Nvidia is projected to report second-quarter revenues of $3.11 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. This would mark over a 39% climb from the prior-year quarter. For the full-year, Nvidia’s revenues are expected to surge nearly 36% to touch $13.18 billion.Moving on to the opposite end of the income statement, Nvidia’s bottom line is projected to expand by more than 81% in the second quarter to reach $1.83 per share. This outsized growth is expected to continue for the full-year, with Nvidia’s earnings projected to soar just over 60% to reach $7.90 per share.Price MovementOn top of Nvidia’s strong first quarter and its impressive growth outlook, investors will want to take a quick glance to see how its stock has performed recently.Shares of Nvidia have soared nearly 79% during the last year, which crushes the S&P 500’s 13.5% climb. Nvidia’s performance also outpaces its industry’s roughly 56% growth. For reference, Nvidia’s industry includes the likes of Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). NVDA looks even better against the broader semiconductor market’s roughly 36% climb.Jumping back over the last three years, Nvidia’s shares have skyrocketed 1,085% as its GPUs become more and more important in the multibillion-dollar gaming industry, data centers, and more. But even in the near-term, Nvidia’s stock price performance looks strong. Shares of NVDA have climbed nearly 28% since the start of the year, against its industry 18% climb and the S&P 500’s 2% expansion.Despite Nvidia’s insane run of success and strong first quarter, shares of Nvidia closed Wednesday at $247.54 per share, which sits roughly 5% below its 52-week high of $260.50 per share.ValuationNow that we have looked at Nvidia’s recent quarterly performance and stock price movement, let’s get a feel for its current valuation picture. Coming into Thursday, Nvidia stock was trading at 34.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant premium compared to its industry’s 18.3X and the S&P 500’s 16.9X.But, Nvidia investors understand that the stock is a growth play at the moment and are likely not concerned about the company’s current valuation picture, especially considering its massive climb over the last several years. With that said, NVDA has traded as high as 57.4X forward 12-month earnings estimates over the last year, with a one-year median of 45.6X.As investors can see, Nvidia stock is currently trading just above its year-long low and well below its high and median. Therefore, investors should be able to say with some confidence that Nvidia stock is not expensive at the moment. To some, Nvidia’s valuation might even appear rather attractive at its current level.Bottom LineNvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for growth in our Style Scores system. Investors should also be pleased to note that Nvidia has received 11 earnings estimate revisions for its second quarter, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 30 days. During this same timeframe, NVDA earned 12 full-year revisions, with the same 100% upside agreement.  Lastly, aside from data centers and gaming, Nvidia is ready to benefit from its presence in booming growth industries from artificial intelligence to self-driving vehicles. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

863,TXN,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 12.6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TXN due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Texas Instruments Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat EstimatesTexas Instruments’ first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.11 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Earnings increased 36% year over year and 11% sequentially.Revenues of $3.79 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.65 billion, up 11.4% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. Also, it came at the higher end of the guided range of $3.49-$3.79 billion, driven by strong demand for Analog and Embedded Processing products in the auto and industrial markets.Following first-quarter results, shares rose 5.62% in after-hours trading, driven by strong demand in the auto and industrial markets. Also, strong top-line outlook could be one of the reasons for surge in the share price.Segment wise, growth of analog and embedded processing applications business was strong. These typically yield a more stable business as well as strong margins. The Other segment declined year over year.Texas Instruments continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually expanding its exposure to industrial and automotive markets, while reducing the same in volatile consumer/computing markets, and increasing dollar content at customers..Internally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales, even while expanding its business.The company remains focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages. Overall, we remain optimistic about its compelling product line, differentiation in business and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. However, risks associated with a high debt level persist.Let’s see what the numbers say.Revenues in DetailAnalog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated 68%, 25% and 7% of quarterly revenues, respectively.Analog, which includes Power, Signal Chain and High Volume products, was up 14% from the year-ago quarter to $2.6 billion. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong performance in the product lines — power and signal chain.The Embedded Processing segment, which includes Connected Microcontrollers and Processors, was up 15% year over year to $926 million. The year-over-year growth was driven by stronger sales across both the product lines — processors and connected microcontrollers.The Other segment, which includes DLPs, custom ASICs and calculators, was down 13% from the prior-year quarter to $297 million.MarginsTexas Instruments’ gross margin of 64.6% was down 48 basis points (bps) sequentially but up 156 bps from the year-ago quarter.

867,TXN,"The third-quarter reporting cycle will be seeing releases from 722 companies, including 180 S&P 500 members, this week (Oct 23-27).Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) and Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR  -  Free Report) are set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24.Let’s find out what these companies have to offer investors in this quarter.Corning is well known for the Gorilla Glass that has gained significant traction from increasing usage in smartphones.We expect strong demand for fiber products to primarily drive growth, which will boost Optical Communications revenues.Additionally, Gorilla Glass 5 is also anticipated to contribute significantly. We believe that a likely increase in dollar content from Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) newly launched iPhones will benefit Corning’s top-line growth in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Optical Communications and Specialty Materials (Gorilla Glass is reported under this segment) revenues are currently pegged at $878 million and $340 million, respectively.However, weakness in the Display Technologies segment is a headwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment is currently pegged at $752 million.Shares of Corning have returned 23.9% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 21% rally.On the other hand, Juniper is expected to disappoint investors due to sluggish sales in its cloud computing segment. The weakness is likely to hurt switching business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Switching segment is currently pegged at $276 million.Moreover, Juniper is facing significant pricing pressure amid intense competition in the network equipment market from the likes of Arista Networks Inc, Cisco Systems Inc and others including white-box vendors. This has hurt the company’s competitive position in the router market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Routing segment is currently pegged at $589 million.Additionally, Juniper’s expansion into low-margin Asia-Pacific market adversely impacted customer mix. Further, growing proportion of low-margin switch business in the product mix as compared with high-margin router business is a headwind for gross margin expansion. Additionally, higher DRAM memory prices are expected to hurt gross margin in the quarter.Juniper’s shares have lost 7.9% of its value year to date compared with the 3.1% decline of its industry.Unfavorable Rank, Negative ESPWe believe both Corning and Juniper are unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the third quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.A Stock to ConsiderHere is a stock you may consider as our proven model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

868,TXN,"NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 19.7%. Notably, NXP Semiconductors has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice for as many misses over the trailing four quarters. However, it has an average positive earnings surprise of 1.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNXP Semiconductors, a global semiconductor company, is known for its automotive and chip identification business, and has recorded massive growth in the portable device segment in the few quarters.With the Freescale Semiconductor acquisition, NXP Semiconductors has become the world’s leading provider of automotive semiconductor solutions and general purpose microcontroller products. It should be noted that continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics, and the emergence of the new category of wearables have been boosting the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them. We believe this should benefit NXP Semiconductor’s third-quarter revenues.Nonetheless, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) and Lattice Semiconductor Corp., consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market remain headwinds.NXP Semiconductors N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  NXP Semiconductors N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | NXP Semiconductors N.V. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NXP Semiconductors is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: NXP Semiconductors’ Earnings ESP is -1.18%.

869,TXN,"Microchip Technology Inc. (MCHP  -  Free Report) announced the pricing of two sets of unsecured senior notes offering totaling $2 billion. A $1 billion principal amount of senior notes due on Jun 1, 2021, will carry an interest rate of 3.922%. Meanwhile, the second $1 billion senior notes due on Jun 1, 2023, will carry an interest of 4.333%.The offering, subject to the fulfillment of customary closing conditions, is expected to close on May 29, 2018. The notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers only and in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.The company plans to utilize the net proceeds from the proposed offering of the notes along with cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and its latest term loan facility, to fund the cash concerns and other amounts payable in respect of its previously announced Microsemi Corporation acquisition.Microchip expects to improve its liquidity and strengthen balance sheet through prudent investment decisions. The move provides flexibility to the company and helps meet its financial obligations in an efficient way.Also, since unsecured notes can be borrowed at lower rates, this new debt will result in lower funding cost. This is likely to boost the financial flexibility of the company which already enjoys a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity.The company exited fiscal 2018 with $2.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microchip generated $359.6 million of operating cash flow.We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet which will help it in capitalizing on investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions, improving growth prospects. Moreover, the senior notes offering will lower the company’s cost of capital, consequently strengthening balance sheet and supporting growth.Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and Consensus Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and Consensus | Microchip Technology Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMicrochip has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) and Groupon, Inc.

871,TXN,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) opened lower on Wednesday after two days of gains on the back of some major announcements, including a new deal with Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). With that said, let’s dive into why the chip giant’s stock might be worth buying right now.Stock Price MovementMicron stock has skyrocketed 408% over the last two years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 31% climb. Shares of Micron also greatly outperformed its industry’s 99% surge, which includes the likes of Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), and more.Over the last year, Micron stock has soared 101%, compared to its industry’s roughly 35% surge. Furthermore, shares of Micron have climbed over 21% in the last three months, while its broader industry is up just 3.5%.Micron’s run of success might deter some investors since it could be hard to replicate this kind of growth. Still, despite Micron’s insane and sustained run, investors should note that the company closed Tuesday below its 52-week high. And there are plenty more reasons to be excited about Micron stock, including its growth prospects and current valuation picture.Recent NewsBut before we jump into growth, it is worth taking a look at some company updates. Micron and Intel announced on Monday that they will produce and ship the “industry's first 4bits/cell 3D NAND technology,” while also noting that they made progress on the development of the third-generation 96-tier 3D NAND structure—which provides a 50% increase in layers.The company also said it would repurchase $10 billion of outstanding common stock as part of a new plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders starting in fiscal 2019. “The data-driven economy will transform nearly every industry, and drive secular growth in demand for memory and storage,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said.Furthermore, Micron upped its guidance and now expects current quarter revenues to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion, up from its previous guidance of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion.Growth OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates don’t necessarily reflect Micron’s updated quarterly revenue outlook just yet. But investors will be pleased to note that our current estimate of $7.44 billion, would mark a nearly 34% climb from the year-ago period. Looking a bit further ahead, the company’s full-year revenues are projected to soar nearly 44% to reach $29.22 billion.Transitioning to the other end of the income statement, Micron’s quarterly earnings are projected to skyrocket roughly 81% to touch $2.93 per share. And if that growth projection didn’t impress investors enough, Micron’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 127% to reach $11.27 per share.ValuationNow that we have covered Micron’s recent business updates, stock price movement, and growth outlook, it’s time to move onto its current valuation, which is impressive, to say the least.Coming into Wednesday, Micron stock was trading at 5.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a massive discount compared to its industry’s 13.2X. Over the last two years, Micron stock has traded as high as 32.5X and as low as 4.2X. Micron stock has traded at a one-year median of 5.5X, against its industry’s 13.9X. Furthermore, Micron stock looks even cheaper compared to Nvidia’s one-year median of 45.6X. Therefore, investors should be able to say with confidence that Micron stock is a great value investment at the moment in a semiconductor market that is set to keep on booming.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

The Zacks Consensus estimate for the upcoming quarter for AGS is pegged at $812 million.Strength in Display to Drive RevenuesThe company has gained considerable success in expanding beyond semiconductors, particularly in display. New display technologies such as OLED are opening new market opportunities for Applied Materials. The available market opportunity is now more than 10 times that of the traditional LCD. In the last quarter, the Display segment was up 4.9% sequentially and 31.0% from the year-ago level. The segment is further expected to perform well driven by significant opportunities coming from investments in areas such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality and smart vehicles. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the upcoming quarter for Display segment is pegged at $676 million.However, increasing competition, high fixed-cost structure and customer concentration remain major concerns, which could affect the results in the upcoming quarter.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if these have a negative Earnings ESP.

873,TXN,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) reported non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 34 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents and exceeded the guided range of 29-33 cents. On a year-over-year basis, the figure almost doubled.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 49 cents from continuing operations against a loss of 37 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, it compared favorably with the guided range of 10-14 cents. The company attributed the better-than expected results to separation related tax indemnification adjustments.RevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues from continuing operations of $7.468 billion, up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Further, quarterly revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.326 billion.Adjusted for currency-exchange rates, the company’s revenues from continuing operations increased 6% year over year.The company witnessed particular tailwinds in Intelligent Edge, High-Performance Compute, Storage, Hyper Converged and Composable Infrastructure.During the reported quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s revenues in the Americas grew 3% in constant currency, primarily due to strength in storage and the Intelligent Edge. Revenues in Europe were up 9% in constant currency, with UK, France and Italy registering double-digit growth. EMEA performed pretty well with double-digit growth in compute, storage and Aruba Products and Services. Asia Pacific revenues were up 9% at constant currency, with impressive growth in Singapore, Australia and China.Segment wise, Hybrid IT revenues increased 7% year over year and 4% at constant currency to $6.023 billion. Revenues from the Intelligent Edge and Financial Services segments climbed 17.2% and 5%, respectively.Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise’s gross margin expanded 90 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 30.4%. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP operating margin increased 270 bps to 8.6%.The improvement in margins was primarily attributed to cost savings from HPE Next. Management was also positive about pricing and DRAM was less of a negative aspect compared to the previous quarters.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended fiscal second quarter with $6.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $7.7 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt at quarter end was $9.970 billion compared with $10.040 billion recorded in the first quarter.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise generated $200 million of cash flow from operational activities. However, free cash flow was negative $269 million. Additionally, during the reported quarter, the company returned $1 billion to shareholders, of which $907 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteGuidanceThe company issued an encouraging bottom-line guidance for the third quarter and raised its outlook for fiscal 2018.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, Hewlett Packard Enterprise projects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 35-39 cents (mid-point: 37 cents), which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company guides the bottom line to be in the range of 19-23 cents.Hewlett Packard Enterprise now expects non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.40-$1.50 (mid-point $1.45), up from the previous range of $1.35-$1.45 (mid-point $1.40). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.40. On a GAAP basis, the company now projects the bottom line to be in the band of $1.70-$1.80 per share, up from the prior range of $1.35-$1.45.ConclusionHewlett Packard Enterprise posted impressive financials for the second-quarter of fiscal 2018 on the back of robust performance of most of its segments. The portfolio mix was also impressive with HPE Next driving margins northward.Management is particularly optimistic about its recent acquisitions of Cape Networks and RedPixie, which are expected help the company penetrate deeper and wider into the market, thereby boosting the top line.Management is also positive about the newly launched complementary AI-based assurance and analytics solution called NetInsight, meant for optimizing network performance. The company is enhancing its capabilities in the hybrid IT model, which will drive revenue growth going ahead.Nonetheless, we remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to the three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from competitive pricing, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues.Currently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

874,TXN,"Wall Street’s biggest dampener for the last few months will be offset now as the United States and China put trade war on hold. The world’s largest economies dropped their tariff threats and set up a framework to address potential trade imbalances in the future.China has promised to purchase more U.S. goods and services, including energy and agricultural products that would support growth and employment in the United States. Beijing has agreed to substantially reduce America's massive trade deficit but did not commit any specific amount. The Trump administration wanted to slash the deficit by $200 billion.Though the talks are in the initial stage, it has cooled down tensions, which have heightened since the Trump administration proposed tariffs of $50 billion on Chinese goods and threatened to extend the levies to an additional $150 billion. China retaliated with its own measures targeting U.S. agriculture (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Potential Trade War With China).As such, the news has instilled fresh optimism into the stock market with the major index closing the day at a two-month high. With both the United States and China working to avert trade war, the strong momentum in the stock market is likely to continue in the near term. This coupled with a growing economy and strong earnings will help the stocks to move higher.This is especially true given that the U.S. economy has entered its second-longest expansion phase since 1785, thanks to higher consumer spending, rising consumer confidence, low borrowing cost, growing wages, 17-year low unemployment, and solid hiring. Total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 23.9% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues. This represents the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years. Further, the euphoria surrounding the tax reform has been the biggest catalyst this year, as it will perk up the economy and save billions for corporations, leading to reflation trade and higher earnings.While almost every corner of the market is set to surge, sectors that were at risk from China trade will likely benefit most. The U.S. information technology, materials, and industrials sectors have relatively high exposure to China's economy with 14.2%, 7.1%, and 5.6%, respectively, and are poised to perform well in the renewed rally. In particular, chip stocks dominate the list of tech sector with large sales exposure to China.Below, we have highlighted ETFs & stocks from these sectors that are expected to outperform at least in the near term following the receding trade war fears:TechnologyVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report): This fund provides exposure to 26 securities by tracking the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index.

875,TXN,"The United States and China have agreed to “substantially” lessen trade deficit following two days of negotiations. China promised to “significantly” purchase U.S. goods and services that soothed investors’ nerves to a fair extent.Receding possibility of collateral damage from China trade war helped industrial, technology and energy stocks gain ground. Thus, investing in such stocks, for now, seems to be a wise choice.What’s Powering the Markets?Investors were perked up by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s statement that the White House will suspend tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese goods. The Trump administration will continue to work on the deal between the economies to “put the trade war on hold.”U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, however, said that Washington might impose tariffs. Nonetheless, Mnuchin insisted that the administration is unified on the China trade deal.Potential Winners as Trade War Fears EbbA truce between the nations has alleviated risks in the equity market for now. A full-blown trade war would have had rippling effects on the global economy growth, casting a pall over businesses. Let us now look at stocks that have benefitted from the easing of trade tensions with China:Industrials Lead the WayProgress in trade talks has helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average close above the coveted 25,000 mark on May 21. The biggest percentage gainer on the blue-chip index was The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), up 3.6%. After all, the aerospace giant sells about a fourth of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers.By the way, China was supposed to impose tariffs of up to 25% on 106 American products, including airplanes, with empty weights between 15,000 kg and 45,000 kg. This would have affected Boeing’s 737-800, 737-700 and 737-900 ER models as their operating empty weights fall in the range targeted by China. But, with tariff scares behind us for now, Boeing has ample reasons to rejoice.Chipmakers Tread Higher, Tech Stocks Make Merry!Within the Dow, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) also saw its shares jump 1.5%. And why not? Intel generated 22.9% of revenues from China in the last 12 months, per FactSet. In comparison, the semiconductor company’s 20% of revenues came from the United States.China, in fact, heavily relies on U.S. chipmakers, while semiconductors make up one of its largest import categories in terms of value. Hopes of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions provided strength to the chip sector. The PHLX Semiconductor Index advanced 1.1% compared with a 0.7% gain of the S&P 500.Elsewhere in the chip sector, shares of KLA-Tencor, Lam Research, Qorvo Inc and Micron Technology ended in the positive territory (read more: Chip Stocks Offer Upside Even After Red-Hot Years: 5 Picks).The broader tech sector has also a lot to gain from reduced trade war fears. The components of the SPDR Technology Select Sector had seen 9.6% of total revenues in the last 12 months come from China, per FactSet data. This puts China in the second place in terms of revenue generation, behind the United States.Oil Springs High, Energy Shares GainMeanwhile, Beijing promised to import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) and U.S. crude. This will, in fact, help the U.S. take the position of the third largest LNG exporter globally.Thus, an economic truce between the United States and China helped oil prices approach $72 a barrel. Energy shares are looking up after they fell out of favor when oil price slipped from $100 a barrel to under $30 in 2014. In fact, the energy sector of the S&P 500 has risen more than 10% in the past month to garner 9.2% so far this year (read more: Oil Hits $70 for First Time in 4 Years: 5 Top Energy Picks).5 Top GainersAs trade war worries dissipate and broader markets move north, investing in stocks from the aforesaid sectors making the most of the recovery seems judicious.

In the quarter, we expect strength in Core OTA, Trivago and Homeway segments to be offset by weakness in the Egencia business.We observe that shares of Expedia have gained 34.9% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s 50.7% rally.Core OTAIn the second quarter, this segment’s revenues were up 14.7% sequentially and 13.8% year over year to $2 billion. It is expected to perform well in the to-be-reported quarter as Expedia continues to see solid momentum in room night growth in all key regions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenue is currently pegged at $2.3 billion.Trivago Trivago revenues increased 21.1% sequentially and a massive 63.2% year over year to $328 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $292 million.EgenciaIn the second quarter, Egencia was up 4.8% on a sequential basis and 8% on a year over year basis to $135 million. This segment is however expected to be lumpy and partially offset strong performance of other segments in the to-be-reported quarter due to the impact of the churn of Orbitz for Business customers during last year's migration.Also, Expedia’s plan to ramp-up sales organization in the Egencia business will impact margins in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $123 million.Expedia, Inc.

878,TXN,"We are in the heart of the Q3 earnings season, with more than 700 companies, including 180 S&P 500 members, expected to come up with their financial numbers by the end of this week.The Picture Thus FarWe already have Q3 results from 87 S&P 500 members that combined account for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Per the latest Earnings Trends (as of Oct 20), total earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the prior-year quarter on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% positive earnings surprises and 70.1% beating revenue estimates.Revenues for this cohort were up 4.4% sequentially.So far, the results paint a positive and reassuring picture of corporate earnings, which is expected to strengthen and get reconfirmed through the remainder of this reporting cycle.Coming to the technology sector, we expect it to benefit from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Let’s take a look at these three companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Oct 24.Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI  is likely to beat third-quarter 2017 expectations as it has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of 0.07%.Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteWe expect TI to perform well driven by strength in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. It continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars in these areas. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the past four quarters, TI’s analog business has witnessed both sequential and year-over-year growth. We expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $2.6 billion.Given the strong product lines, we also expect Embedded Processing segment to perform well in the upcoming quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $904 million.We observe that shares of Texas Instruments have gained 30.4% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 33.8% rally. (You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Let’s take a sneak peek at Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report), the leading producer of microprocessors and chipsets in the world that is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.Notably, the company has a record of positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 35%. We note that AMD has introduced a host of new products during the quarter which is anticipated to give the top line a boost going forward. The company unveiled AMD4U comprising gaming applications and tools that are in compliance with AMD processors and graphics.The stock has an Earnings ESP of -7.90% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 7 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 8 cents. The stock’s negative ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) makes surprise prediction difficult.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD expects third-quarter 2017 revenues to increase 23% sequentially (+/- 3%). At the mid-point, this reflects 15% growth on a year-over-year basis. Further, gross margin is likely to be 34%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $400 million. (Read: What's in Store for Advanced Micro in Q3 Earnings?)We observe that shares of Advanced Micro have gained 21.8% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 27.9% rally.Lastly, Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) is a global provider of content delivery network (CDN) and cloud infrastructure services.Notably, the company has a record of positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 35%. However, Akamai has an Earnings ESP of -0.12%. Also, the company carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

We expect the newly launched products to take some more time to generate meaningful growth.However, in the last quarter, Akamai stated that it witnessed high level of network traffic on its platform, which is anticipated to be a major tailwind for the company’s revenues.For the upcoming third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $610 million, indicating 4.5% year-over-year increase. Revenues in the second quarter came in at $609 million. Earnings are projected to be 59 cents per share, lower than 62 cents per share reported in the last quarter.Notably, effective second-quarter 2016, Akamai started reporting its business under three main divisions – Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects Media division revenues to be around $271 million. Web division revenues are expected to be close to $327 million while Enterprise and Carrier division revenues are anticipated to be about $19.93 million for the third quarter.We observe that shares of Akamai have lost 22.2% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 27.5% rally.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

879,TXN,"Nielsen Holdings plc (NLSN  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 24.24%.Notably, Nielsen missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 26.48%.Also, shares of Nielsen have lost 0.45% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 25.3% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Watch Segment Strength to Drive RevenuesIn the second quarter, Watch business revenues of $821 million contributed 50% to the total top line and were up 10.3% on a year-over-year basis. This figure is expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter driven by continued strength in Audience Measurement and Marketing Effectiveness. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Watch revenues is currently pegged at $845 million.Partnerships & Agreements to Boost ResultsNielsen has been partnering with big companies to extend its TV ratings service beyond the Nielsen Local TV Ratings Service. Recently, Nilesen announced that it will start crediting Facebook, Alphabet (GOOGL) owned YouTube and Hulu distributed video content through its Digital Content Ratings system launched in September last year. With the new move, both digital and TV publisher clients of Nielsen will be able to get a comprehensive view of the different ways their digital content is watched across these platforms. These partnerships will help Nielsen to expand its client base and boost its Watch segment revenues in the upcoming quarter.Weakness in the Buy Segment Could Hurt ResultsIn the second quarter, Buy business revenues of $823 million declined 3.4% year over year and 2% on a constant-currency basis. The figure is further expected to decrease in the upcoming quarter due to softness in the U.S. market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Buy revenues is currently pegged at $798 million.Increased Investments Could Weigh On ProfitsIn the last quarter, the company’s diluted net earnings of 50 cents per share, missed the Zacks Consensus estimate by 16 cents. Nielsen has been making continuous investments to expand its client base and increase its international presence. Although these investments will increase the company’s top-line figures, it is likely to impact the company’s bottom line in the upcoming quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nielsen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 69 cents. Therefore, Earnings ESP for Nielsen is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nielsencarries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Nielsen N.V.

880,TXN,"Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 25. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this semiconductor company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in to-be-reported quarter. Notably, Xilinx has delivered positive earnings surprises for six straight quarters.  Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 7.4%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 62 cents, which is a penny higher than the year-ago figure of 61 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $620 million, up 7.1% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that Xilinx is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has highest chance of beating estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Xilinx currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an ESP of +0.22%.Xilinx, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Xilinx, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Xilinx, Inc. QuoteWhat’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Xilinx is set to capitalize on the global trend of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) replacing application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs). There are certain fundamental advantages of using FPGAs over low-cost ASICs. One of the basic reasons is the difficulty in getting suitable ASICs for design and the additional cost of re-certifying new ASIC-based designs.We expect FPGA products to drive the company’s revenues throughout fiscal 2018, aided by steady demand in communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors such as wired communication, data center and industrial will add to revenues.Furthermore, FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. These markets are strongly co-related with global GDP growth and spending behavior. Most of the emerging economies are seeing unprecedented demand for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, and are also getting increasingly connected via the Internet. This has compelled these countries to heavily invest in Telecom & Wireless infrastructure. We believe higher wireless deployments across the world will lead to increased demand for Xilinx’s 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, thereby positively impacting its overall fiscal second-quarter results.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Applied Materials, Inc.

881,TXN,"U.S. tech companies can finally breathe easy, at least for the time being. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday said that the U.S.-China trade conflict has been put on hold. This certainly is good news for U.S. tech companies, particularly chipmakers, which have been reeling under pressure since the two countries sparked fears of a trade war by imposing tariffs and counter tariffs on imports from the two countries.U.S. tech companies generate an estimated more than $100 billion in revenues from China annually. Understandably, the tech sector stands to suffer the most, as the trade war has increasingly focused on technology and intellectual property rights. However, both countries are now initiating talks and making efforts to pull back from an undesired trade war. Given this scenario U.S. chipmakers stand to gain the most. So, it makes good sense to invest in semiconductor stocks.Sigh of Relief for Tech Companies  President Donald Trump in late March announced that the United States would be imposing tariffs on Chinese imports worth $150 billion for alleged violation of intellectual property rights. Consequently, China too announced retaliatory tariffs. However, both countries since then have cooled down on their stance and are now negotiating to avoid a much-feared trade war. On May 20, Mnuchin said, “We are putting the trade war on hold.”This certainly will bring a sigh of relief for U.S. tech companies, as tech companies stand to suffer the most if trade war takes place. U.S. tech companies generate an estimated $100-$150 billion in revenues annually from China, with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) alone generating $105.5 billion from China. Other companies like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Qualcomm, Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) too make a significant portion of their revenues from China.U.S. tech companies have been reeling under fears of a trade war for quite some time now, which saw their shares taking a hit. However, now that both the United States and China are working on a possible solution to avoid a trade war, it definitely will boost the morale of tech companies.Biggest Gainers if Trade War is AvertedTech companies undoubtedly will be one of the biggest gainers if a trade war is avoided. From large caps to medium and small caps, a number of U.S. tech companies have operations in China. Naturally, companies who have their assembly plants in China stand to gain the most if the trade negotiations fall into place.Also, the Commerce Department last month imposed a ban on American companies from selling components to Chinese company ZTE for seven years, accusing it of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against North Korea and Iran.While this made the company announce that it was ceasing operations, the ban can also have an adverse affect on American chipmakers, as an export ban would definitely hurt the revenues of U.S. chipmakers. However, with Trump tweeting on Sunday that he is working with Chinese president Xi Jinping to get ZTE back into business, U.S. chipmakers have ample reasons to party.Our ChoicesIt goes without saying that after suffering over the last couple of months as a result of huge selloffs owing to fears of a trade war, U.S. chip stocks will stand to gain from a mutual agreement between Trump and Xi Jinping. While we wait for an amicable solution through negotiations, let’sadd tech stocks for quick gains.Now, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) is the worldwide leader in graphics processors and media communications devices.

883,TXN,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) seems to have lost favor with institutional investors who have reduced their holdings in the Cupertino-based company by almost 153 million in the first three months of 2018.According to regulatory filings, as of Mar 31, T. Rowe Price sold 35.6 million shares, or roughly half of its stake in Apple. Fidelity Investments, Wellington Management and JPMorgan Chase & Co. sold 21 million shares, 9.8 million shares and 8.7 million shares, respectively.This is exactly opposite to what the “Oracle of Omaha” Warren Buffett is doing with the stock. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) recently bought an additional 75 million shares of the iPhone-maker worth between $11 billion and $14 billion, making it the third largest shareholder.Buffett told CNBC that “Apple is an unbelievable company” and he thinks that “it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States.”Notably, Apple shares have returned 11.2% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming S&P 500’s increase of 1.8%.  Institutional Investors versus BuffettInstitutional investors’ skepticism around Apple can primarily be attributed to growing concern over iPhone demand. However, Buffett seems to be less concerned about the short-term weakness in iPhone sales.Notably, iPhone unit sales of 52.2 million in the recently concluded second-quarter fiscal 2018 were less than disappointing and it increased 3% on a year-over-year basis. Double-digit growth in several markets including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico and Vietnam was a tailwind.Moreover, revenues from iPhone (62.2% of sales) grew 14% from the year-ago quarter to $38.03 billion. The upside can be attributed to higher iPhone average selling price (ASP), which increased to $728 from $655 a year ago. Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc.

886,TXN,"If you are looking to invest in potential stocks from the semiconductor space, you can’t ignore NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report).For the past two years, NVIDIA has been impressing investors with its stellar performance, wherein the company’s quarterly revenues have been advancing at a rate more than 50%, earnings have tripled and shares have displayed more than six-fold growth, consequently.Moreover, in the year so far, the stock has rallied 26.9% as against growth of 1.4%, 8.1% and 8.3% recorded by the S&P 500, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK), respectively.The share price rally highlights that the slew of bad news related to the company, such as sluggish demand from cryptocurrency miners and Uber’s driverless-vehicle test incident, which prompted NVIDIA to suspend test drives for all its driverless vehicles, did not have any negative impact on investors.We also believe Uber’s driverless-test mishap will lead to increased investment by vehicle makers to make driverless cars safer. Hence, demand for NVIDIA’s chips will remain unaffected, in our opinion. Moreover, this March, the company unveiled the Constellation driving simulator which enables companies to test self-driving systems in a virtual environment.Although NVIDIA doesn’t expect the new simulator to fully replace real-world testing of self-driving cars, the number of trials will likely come down, significantly. We believe the latest simulator will enhance NVIDIA’s competitive position in the self-driving car market space, particularly against chip makers, like Intel and Advance Micro Devices.Furthermore, although NVIDIA predicts a slowdown in crypto-specific GPUs revenues in the near term, we believe this will be immaterial to its financials. The company foresees demand for its GPUs to shift from miners to gamers, going forward, which will boost the gaming business revenues and offset loss of revenues from miners.NVIDIA, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the preceding four quarters, the average positive surprise being 40.1%. The company witnessed sharp upward estimate revision over the past 7 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter increased 5.4% (9 cents) to $1.77 per share, during the same time frame, and reflects year-over-year growth of more than 75%.Of course, NVIDIA is our first choice in the semiconductor industry, however that does not mean the list ends here as several companies in the space are likely to benefit from the rising demand for chips.Solid Industry Growth ProjectionThe semiconductor industry has been benefiting from the rising demand for chips used in cloud-based platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017. It is believed the semiconductor industry will continue to witness growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017, but still at a respectable rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, marking 7.7% growth.Additionally, the U.S. chip-equipment makers’ earnings and cash flow are likely to get further boost from President Trump’s business-friendly tax-cut policies. The tax reform will make semiconductors repatriate significant amount of cash held abroad and eventually drive after-tax earnings. Chip makers can also use this extra cash for research and development, and mergers & acquisition activities.Therefore, it is wise for investors to have some semiconductor stocks in their portfolio which have potentials to provide better returns.4 Semi Stocks for Rest of 2018Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) takes the second position in our list after NVIDIA. Micron has turned out to be one of the best performers in the semiconductor industry, in the year so far. The company’s shares have appreciated nearly 31.3% during the period, a much better performance than the S&P 500, iShares PHLX Semiconductor and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETFs.This outperformance can be primarily attributed to Micron’s robust revenue and earnings growth, as well as expanding margins. We note that the company posted positive earnings surprise of 8% in the past four quarters.We believe the company will continue its splendid growth performance in the quarters ahead. The optimism surrounding the stock comes from the fact that the DRAM market is still witnessing a huge demand-supply gap which has been escalating prices.It should also be noted that as Micron generates nearly 70% of its revenues by selling DRAM products, the company is the biggest beneficiary of this supply shortage. In the last reported quarter, sales from DRAM products witnessed a massive 76% year-over-year increase.Micron, which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has also witnessed significant earnings estimate revision in the past 60 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 3% (8 cents) to $2.84 per share during the same period.Our next pick is Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report). The company is anticipated to benefit from the improving WFE market, elevated demand for server DRAM and increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology in the near future. This is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities, and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies.The company, which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, coming up with an average positive surprise of 9.1%. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 8.9% (41 cents) to $5.00 per share, in the last 30 days. The stock has ascended 9.8% in the year-to-date period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The next stock in our list is KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report). KLA-Tencor is likely to benefit from an expanding product portfolio. Furthermore, the technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are anticipated to drive growth for the company’s process control and yield-management solutions.KLA-Tencor’s shares have gained 6%, in the year so far. The company, which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, over the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 7.5%. Moreover, the EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 9.2% (18 cents) to $2.14 per share, over the past 30 days.The next stock on our radar is Texas Instruments, Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report). The company’s continued focus on adding new products in the industrial and auto space is estimated to effectively address the increasing demand for semiconductor content in these markets. Additionally, Texas Instruments’ solid presence in other end markets, stable revenue stream and rising demand for its products will broaden the company’s clientele and addressed market.Results of this Zacks Ranked #1 company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and came in line in the other, over the preceding four quarters. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 7.5%. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 5.7% (7 cents) to $1.30 per share, over the past 30 days. The stock has ascended 4.6% in the year-to-date period.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

888,TXN,"In the Global Week Ahead, keep your eye on the trade war ball(s).According to Scotiabank’s watchful FX team, markets will be gradually informed by developments in U.S.-China trade tensions over the coming weeks.China-U.S. trade war tensions likely begin to escalate this week.On Tuesday, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) will hold a public hearing addressing its proposed list of tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China. The comment period ends on May 22nd.Sometime over the first half of June, the USTR may revise its list of tariffs and send recommendations to President Trump who may then decide to enact the tariffs. Mixed into the fray will be the USTR’s next list of tariffs on another $100 billion of Chinese imports and more hearings in a similar process.Also, Friday will bring the Treasury’s deadline for proposals on restricting Chinese investment specifically related to intellectual property, which seems liberally interpreted. China’s potential retaliations against any U.S. moves would further inflame tensions.In addition, Reuters in London shared these five world market themes, operating across the Global Week Ahead.These themes are what traders and investors there are watching most closely there.(1) Fresh U.S. Retail Sales Numbers Come OutEconomists polled by Reuters see April U.S. retail sales — due this Tuesday, May 15th — growing just 0.4 percent, moderating from March’s 0.6 percent rise.But excluding the automobile sector, sales are expected to increase 0.5 percent, after 0.2 percent in March.The recent U.S. tax changes are estimated to have reduced annual personal taxes by $115.5 billion. That means more money in the pockets of consumers, who drive two-thirds of the economy. Now that the personal income tax season has come and gone, and the bulk of taxpayer refunds has found their way into people’s pockets, did consumers spend more?Economists reckon the data will help shape the debate over how many times the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Bond markets currently are betting on at least two more increases. The combination of extra spending and tax cuts frontloaded the positives, and now we wait to see if it translates into robust economic performance. Traders see the Fed on track to raise interest rates in June after U.S. consumer prices rebounded modestly in April.(2) Oil PricesOil prices are at the highest since 2014 and the surge shows no sign of waning. In fact, $80 a barrel is within sight for Brent crude.The U.S. decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions has pushed the Brent 3% higher this week, its biggest of five consecutive weekly rises. It is now up 60% over the past year.Iranian oil exports should start falling as the new sanctions take hold. Even if other OPEC countries manage to fill that gap, the global oil market is still pretty finely balanced. Brent could reach $90 per barrel in the second quarter next year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts, adding that $100-oil cannot be ruled out.The question is now how this will impact inflation and central bank policy. Inflationary pressures in the developed world remain muted, but economic textbooks suggest not for long.(3) European M&AM&A action has been heating up in Europe, with April recording the highest value of monthly deals in 10 years, according to Thomson Reuters data.This week, we’ve had a private equity firm agreeing to buy Zoopla-owner ZPG, sending its shares to a record high and lifting other online consumer-focused firms such as Auto Trader and RightMove.Japan’s Takeda is buying Shire for $62 billion, and U.S. cable giant Comcast is seeking approval for its bid to buy British pay-TV group Sky.The UK, in particular, is drawing attention from foreign buyers due to the still-depressed levels of the pound and the fact that stocks trade at a discount to their long-run average on a 12-month forward PE basis.Credit Suisse Wealth Management added UK equities to their most preferred markets, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch say they are rotating from Europe to the UK.The Euro Stoxx index is close to fully regaining all the ground lost during the February volatility shock, while the UK’s FTSE 100 is flat on the year, after being down as much as 10 percent some weeks back. Deal-making activity could provide the lift into positive territory for both benchmarks.(4) Italy Has a New GovernmentAfter weeks of wrangling, Italy may soon get a new government made up of the far-right League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.But for markets, which have so far taken Italian political risks in their stride, a League/5-Star tie-up is the worst-case scenario; both groups are hostile to EU budget restrictions and have made electoral pledges that would cost billions of euros to implement.No wonder the cost of insuring Italian debt against default have crept up, bond yields have hit 7-week highs and shares are set for their biggest weekly fall in seven weeks.The Italian/German bond yield gap, a key indicator of relative risks, has also widened. But it remains below levels seen before the March 4 election; clearly some investors are still willing to look beyond the politics.After all, a week is a long time in politics and the two parties are yet to agree on who will be prime minister. And a 5-Star member has even hinted the premier may be an independent figure not affiliated to either group.(5) Watch What Happens in Malaysia – After a Big Election WinMalaysian markets re-open next week after investors had two days to chew on a shock election result that saw incumbent prime minister Najib Razak lose to 92-year old Mahathir Mohamad, the end of an uninterrupted six-decade run for the ruling coalition.Offshore markets are uneasy: the ringgit lost 4 percent on the non-deliverable forwards market and an overseas Malaysian equity fund showed a 6 percent drop. The cost of insuring against default on Malaysian debt rose to more than 90 basis points from 78 before the election.The fear is that Mahathir, who was in power for 22 years until 2003, including during the late-1990s financial crisis, will fulfill pledges to remove the goods and services tax, scrap toll fees, reinstate fuel subsidies and renegotiate Chinese investment deals.That would hit budget revenues. Mahathir has also vowed anti-corruption reform, but whether better governance can be achieved remains to be seen. For now, uncertainty takes center stage.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—BP PLC (BP  -  Free Report): This $151B market cap oil stock has a Zacks long-term VGM score of A.

889,TXN,"Last year, the semiconductor industry outpaced the S&P 500’s astonishing returns, which made many believe that chipmakers do not possibly have any room to run this year. They however were largely mistaken. From high-end gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) to automation demand for chips, all are skyrocketing. Meanwhile, supply is low which spells a grand period for chip stocks.Given the bullishness, investing in solid semiconductor stocks seems like a foolproof plan.High Tech Industries Rely on SemiconductorsAt the end of 2017, financial holding company Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) said that semiconductor stocks have reached their peak and, thus, investors should have “increasingly negative prospects for the industry.” This resulted in a correction in the semiconductor industry, thereby, marring the prospects of chip makers entering 2018.The semiconductor industry, however, fought all odds and continued to expand, climbing 20% on a year-over-year basis in the first four months of this year. And this was possible because of tech behemoths’ dependency on semiconductors, something, which will propel the industry to even greater heights.And why not? Semiconductor chips are in demand for some of the fastest growing tech industries in the world like e-sports and crypto mining. E-sports, a multiplayer video game for professional gamers, needs thousands of semiconductor chips for production. These chips are an essential part of crypto mining as they provide the processing power needed for decoding blockchain algorithms.Demand-Supply DisparityBut, it’s not just e-sports and crypto mining, emergence of cloud data-centers and artificial intelligence (AI) to name a few have also driven demand for chips. Meanwhile, increased chip complexity has resulted in lack of supply.Higher demand along with low supply has pushed the prices of chips, giving chipmakers huge profit margins. This is the reason why iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF and Market Vectors Semiconductor ETFs have steadily outpaced the broader market. While the ETFs are up more than 25% over the past year, the S&P 500 gained 13.5%.Nvidia’s Stellar Performance Reflects High DemandNVIDIA Corporation’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) recent upbeat quarterly performance underlined the strong demand for semiconductors across the globe. Chipmakers’ first-quarter net income totaled $1.24 billion or $1.98 a share, way more than $507 million or 79 cents a year ago. Revenues too rose to $3.21 billion from $1.94 billion in the year-ago period. The results, by the way, topped Wall Street estimates.Nvidia founder and chief executive, Jensen Huang said that “our data-center business achieved another record and gaming remained strong. At the heart of our opportunity is the incredible growth of computing demand of AI, just as traditional computing has slowed.”5 Red-Hot ChipsWith demand showing no signs of weakness amid relatively constrained supply, chip stocks should continue to stay hot. And one of the hottest chip stocks in the past 12 months has been Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report).Micron’s shares surged 78.6% in the time frame. Even though high-end smartphone demand is declining, it is compensated by the increase in demand in high growth areas like cloud data-centers and AI. Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), in the meantime, might be facing a slack in its smartphone business but other products like smartwatches and tablets are making up for it. Hence, overall demand for Micron’s products remains robust. These factors should help Micron to keep climbing higher. The stock, which is part of the Semiconductor Memory industry, is expected to gain a whopping 121.6% this year.To top it, investors have seen nine earnings estimate revisions higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the current-year time frame. And the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Micron’s earnings has trended almost 4% upward over the past 60 days. If this wasn’t enough, Micron flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Some of the other chip stocks that have been red hot in the past year and should stay that way are Cabot Microelectronics Corporation (CCMP  -  Free Report), Diodes Incorporated (DIOD  -  Free Report), Ichor Holdings, Ltd. (ICHR  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report).Cabot Microelectronics manufactures and sells polishing slurries, and pads used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit (IC) devices in the semiconductor industry. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 4.2% in the last 60 days. The stock gained 44.9% in the said period. The stock’s projected growth rate for the current year is 37.9%, compared with the industry’s gain of 4.1%.Diodes manufactures and supplies application-specific standard products in the discrete, logic, and analog and mixed semiconductor markets. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 2.6% in the last 60 days. Shares of the company have climbed 24% in the past year.

890,TXN,"CA, Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 25. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this IT management software company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in to-be-reported quarter. Notably, CA has delivered positive earnings surprises for seven straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 7.6%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 62 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained nearly unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.05 billion, up slightly 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe expect CA’s acquisition and go-to-market sales strategies to drive the fiscal second-quarter top-line performance.Let’s discuss the aforementioned factors one by one.Acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of CA to enhance its IT management, software and services portfolio. The company in 2017 so far has completed the acquisition of Automic Holding GmbH and Veracode. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in virtualization, automation, assurance in the cloud computing environment. These are some of the broad-based acquisition strategies adopted by the company in the recent past. We believe the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.Furthermore, CA has adopted a “go to market” sales strategy. This brings together all the commercial functions including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps lower costs, consequently improving the bottom line.CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise        CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CA Inc. QuoteApart from pursuing growth through acquisitions, the company is leveraging cloud computing in a bid to enable organizations to source the best components — internal, external, private cloud, public cloud, mobile and more — to construct the most competitive business applications without wasting much time and resource.Further, the company is focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations to take complete advantage of this evolution.On the other hand, heightening competition from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), International Business Machines and HP Inc., as well as exposure to Europe remain near-term headwinds.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that CA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 62 cents. The combination of CA's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Avnet, Inc. (AVT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.24% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

891,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 24 after the bell.We expect the company to perform well driven by strength in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. It continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars in these areas. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.We observe that shares of Texas Instruments have gained 28.1% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 32.9% rally.Expectations from AnalogTI’s analog business has been witnessing both sequential and year-over-year growth over the last four quarters. This was driven by strong performance in almost all the product lines. Last quarter, this segment generated $2.4 billion, up 6.9% sequentially and 18% from the year-ago quarter.We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter given TI’s compelling product line and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $2.6 billion.Expectations from Embedded ProcessingThis segment has also been growing sequentially and year over year over the last four quarters driven by growth across all product lines. Last quarter, it generated $868 million, up 8.1% sequentially and 15% year over year.This segment is also expected to do well in the to-be-reported quarter as product lines remain strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $904 million.Texas Instruments Incorporated Revenue (TTM) Texas Instruments Incorporated Revenue (TTM) | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteOverall The company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices.Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on an expansion plan. Management remain focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank #1 and an Earnings ESP of +0.43% and that indicates a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks that you may also want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Extreme Networks, Inc., (EXTR  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +9.75% and a Zacks Rank #3.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

892,TXN,"Keeping its positive surprise history alive, Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report) yesterday reported solid results for third-quarter 2017, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of better-than-expected performance for both, the top as well as the bottom line. Also, revenues and earnings both came ahead of the company’s guidance ranges.Apart from this, Proofpoint witnessed significant year-over-year improvement in revenues and earnings. Buoyed by overwhelming third-quarter results, the company also raised the outlook for 2017.However, the company’s outlook for the next year is somewhat disappointing as its revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance ranges at mid-point came in below analysts’ estimates. This made investors a little cautious over Proofpoint’s long-term prospects, resulting in a plunge of approximately 4% in the company’s shares price in the after-hour trade.Nonetheless, the company has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. The stock has returned 34.6% in the said period, while the industry registered 27.6% growth.Let’s now discuss quarter results in detail.Quarter in DetailProofpoint reported total revenues of $134.3 million, up 34.6% year over year, mainly driven by customer additions, improved add-on-sales and strong renewal rate. The company’s revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $132 million as well as came ahead of its guidance range of $130-$132 million.Total billings during the quarter also jumped 33% year over year to $166.5 million. Renewal rates also remained well over 90% during the third quarter.Non-GAAP gross profit surged 35.9% from the year-ago quarter to $104.9 million. Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin expanded 100 basis points (bps) to 78%, primarily driven by higher sales and efficiency improvements across the company’s cloud operations.Total non-GAAP operating expenses grew 37% year over year to $91.6 million. In addition, as a percentage of revenues, it increased to 68.2% from 66.8% in the year-ago quarter. Increased spending on hiring sales personnel mainly escalated operating expenses.Proofpoint’s non-GAAP operating income for the quarter increased to $13.3 million from $10.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter. However, non-GAAP operating margin contracted 70 basis points to 9.9%, as benefit from higher revenues and improved gross margin were more than offset by increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales.Non-GAAP net income increased to $13 million from $9.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter. It also came ahead of the company’s guidance range of $8.0-$9.0 million.On a per share basis, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 25 cents, marking a year-over-year jump of 31.6%. Quarterly earnings also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents as well as the company’s guidance range of 16-18 cents per share.Proofpoint, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Proofpoint, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Proofpoint, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowProofpoint exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $459.6 million, up from the previous quarter balance of $429.5 million. Accounts receivable were $91.5 million compared with $75.6 million at the end of second-quarter 2017.During the first three quarters of 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $111.2 million. Free cash flow for the first three quarters came in at $76.4 million.OutlookBuoyed by better-than-expected third-quarter results, Proofpoint provided encouraging outlook for the fourth quarter and raised its guidance for the current year. For 2017, the company now anticipates revenues in the range of $508-$510 million, up from the earlier guidance range of $503-$506 million. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $506.54 million.Billings’ guidance for the year has also been revised upward and is now anticipated to come between $630 million and $632 million. Earlier, it was projected to remain in the range of $625-$628 million.Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now estimated to come between 73 cents and 75 cents, up from the previous guidance range of 62-64 cents.However, the company has revised the free cash flow estimate downward. Free cash flow for the year is now projected to be in the range of $101.5-$103.5 million (mid-point $102.5 million), down from the earlier projection of $100-$107 million (mid-point $103.5 million). The company intends to incur capital expenditure of approximately $48 million in 2017.Coming to the fourth-quarter outlook, the company anticipates reporting revenues in the range of $138-140 million, and billings between $182 million and $182 million. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $138.78 million.GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are estimated to be 72% and 77.5%, respectively.

The company’s continued focus on launching products, acquisitions and partnerships have helped it register more than 35% revenue growth consistently for the last few quarters.However, a pessimistic outlook for 2018 makes us slightly cautious about its long-term growth prospect. Additionally, since it continues to invest in sales and marketing, we anticipate this to remain a drag on the company’s bottom line in the near term. Intensifying competition and an uncertain macroeconomic environment add to its woes.Currently, Proofpoint carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Micron Technology, Inc.

893,TXN,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT. Vishay markets its portfolio to manufacturers of everything from biometric monitoring systems to fitbands and smart appliances.VSH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is a hot momentum play, with shares adding more than 10% in the past four weeks to test new 52-week highs. Analysts have also become more bullish on the company’s earnings outlook, with full-year EPS estimates improving nearly 36% in the trailing quarter. Bottom LineThe Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world.  And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

895,TXN,"The U.S. equity market maintained a steady momentum, rebuffing geopolitical threats related to North Korean missile tests and deadly terrorist attacks in the home soil in Las Vegas. As investors reposed their faith in riskier bets like equities, courtesy of strengthening dollar and sell-off in global bond markets, ‘cash cow’ stocks that offer higher returns have been sought after.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dallas, TX, Texas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.4% and long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.6%. Texas Instruments carries a Zacks Rank #2.Applied Materials, Inc.

896,TXN,"Technology is the best performing sector this year with more than 20% gain, while the S&P 500 index is up about 11.5%. Within the broader tech sector, semiconductor stocks have been among the best performers.There are many reasons behind this outperformance and why this trend could continue going forward. Most chip companies have reported better than results and this week’s results from Micron Technology (MU) confirmed the trend.While some of the traditional business areas face challenges, like PC sales are slowing down and smartphones sales are becoming flattish, newer growth areas have emerged for chipmakers, including Autonomous Cars, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Virtual Reality, Gaming, Wearables and Internet of Things (IoT). There is a lot of innovation going on in the industry; chipmakers are adopting new materials and technologies to manufacture smaller and more efficient chips.There are four semiconductor ETFs that investors need to know about.iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report)SOXX is the most popular chip ETF with $1.2 billion in AUM. It’s a modified market cap weighted ETF. It has 30 holdings with a cap of 8% on individual securities and holds not more than five securities at that cap. The expense ratio is 48 bps.Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) & Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) are the top three holdings.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report)SMH has $926.61 in AUM. It’s a market cap weighted ETF. The expense ratio is 36 bps. It has a more concentrated exposure with top three holdings--Taiwan Semi, Intel & Nvidia--accounting for almost 30% of assets.SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD  -  Free Report)XSD is an equal-weighted ETF with $306.69 M in AUM. It has an expense ratio of 35 bps. Equal weighting results in higher exposure to smaller companies than peers.PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio (PSI  -  Free Report)PSI is a smart beta ETF with $287.70 M in AUM. It evaluates companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value. It’s a bit pricey with an expense ratio of 63 bps, but has been the best performer this year.To learn more about these ETFs, please watch the short video above.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

897,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI recently announced a hike in dividend along with a share repurchase program. This time, the company plans to raise the quarterly dividend by 12 cents to 62 cents per share. This translates into a 24% increase from the prior dividend of 50 cents. The new dividend will be paid on Nov 13, 2017, to stockholders of record as of Oct 31, contingent upon a formal declaration by the board of directors at its regular meeting in October.    Moreover, Texas Instruments approved a share repurchase program worth $6.0 billion, in addition to approximately $4.8 billion already available. TI’s Cash position TI’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility for further dividend, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions.  Cash and cash equivalents were $3.0 billion at the end of second-quarter 2017. TI exited the quarter with $3.1 billion in long-term debt and $499 million in short-term debt.  Also, the company generated $917 million in cash from operations, spending $151 million on capex, $650 million on share repurchases and $498 million on cash dividends. Texas Instruments is one of the few chip making companies that returns a significant amount of cash to its investors. Over the trailing 12 months, the company returned $4.1 billion of cash through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Bottom Line Texas Instruments is one of the largest suppliers of analog and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company’s compelling product line-up, increasing differentiation in its business and low-cost 300-mm capacity should drive earnings over the long term.  Also, the company’s margins should continue to expand because of the secular strength in the auto and industrial markets, a stronger mix of analog and embedded processing products, benefits of restructuring actions and more 300mm capacity coming online. Moreover, the semiconductor giant is poised to gain from the growing market for Internet of Things.  We believe the increase in dividend and share buyback indicates that the company is confident about its steady cash flows. However, increasing competition from Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) remains a concern.      Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider.

899,TXN,"President Trump appears to have identified China’s Achilles’ heel, and he’s making the most of it.Accordingly, the President is doing everything he can to deny China the semiconductors it needs to get to “Made In China 2025” with the goal of forcing the Chinese administration to lower the country’s trade surplus with the U.S. by $200 billion.We’ve already seen ZTE as a casualty of this war, with management recently telling investors that the inability to access chips from companies like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) could be an existential issue.The U.S. has also blocked every deal China has attempted, directly or indirectly, to acquire American semiconductor companies or technology. Market research firm IC Insights’ president Bill McClean says that China doesn’t have the necessary technology to design and manufacture advanced chips today, even if it can muster the resources. So it’s believed that if the U.S. blocks China’s access to technology and prevents agreements to transfer technology as a condition of doing business in China, the country won’t be able to reach parity/lead in the market.Since this is exactly what China is looking for, we have the makings of a deal.So Mr. Trump took to tweeting again late Friday: “Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives. We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!”That result, according to state-run China Daily, is ""the constructive agreement between Beijing and Washington to keep discussing contentious trade issues, instead of continuing the two-way barrage of tariffs, which pretty much brought the two countries to the brink of a trade war.""In the meantime, China is not sitting around. There have been rumblings about a new fund to drive semiconductor innovation in the country and just as the U.S. delegation was meeting with the President, the Wall Street Journal reported that the government-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co. was getting ready to announce a 300 billion yuan ($47.4 billion) fund to drive development of its semiconductor industry. In 2014, it had raised 139 billion yuan ($21.8 billion) that was invested in over 70 projects across the country.Unlike last time when only the government and its agencies invested in the fund, this time, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has reportedly also invited U.S. chipmakers. It is, however, doubtful that they will invest in a fund set up to drive them out of business, especially given the current political environment. And also because an excessive supply of Chinese chips will drive down prices in the global market and affect profitability across the industry, thereby slowing down its pace of innovation.It’s hard to tell where the talks are headed but China is likely to agree to a compromise.RecommendationsBecause of the China related uncertainty on the segment, the semiconductor industry isn’t the best place to invest in right now. While some Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) options like Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report)) are there, it’s probably a better idea to take a look at the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

900,TXN,"This Global Week Ahead is the last big week of the U.S. earnings season. 144 S&P 500 firms release results this week, followed by 38 the following week, and 18 the week after that. Then, the Q1 earnings releases fizzle out.(1) The week’s key corporate names include Apple, Pfizer, Merck, Berkshire Hathaway, McDonald’s, Loews, Mastercard, MetLife, Kellogg and CBS.(2) Of four main geopolitical risks to equities, two could see further constructive developments this week. These events would be centered upon NAFTA and North Korea. Iran nuclear deal recertification and the critical U.S./China tariff deadlines loom further out, roughly at the mid-month mark.(3) The coming week holds two top-shelf U.S. macro events. The Fed’s latest policy decision comes out on Wednesday. April non-farm payroll data hits on Friday. Reuter’s in London writes to us about the underlying situation in the global fixed income markets. Rates should continue to cause concern in equity markets this week too, as the key rates-related macro and a Fed policy decision hits the tape. “As bond yields rise on expectations of higher interest rates, one thing that comes into focus is the equity risk premium (ERP) — the price paid to investors to compensate for the risk of investing in stocks rather than bonds. It was this issue that was core to February’s global equity selloff — the sudden realization by investors: that government bonds could soon provide a viable safer alternative to equities. Typically, first in line to be bruised by higher yields are consumer staples, which are known as “bond proxies” due to generous dividends and comfortable cash flows. So when U.S. 10-year yields rose above 3.0% last week, concerned clients called analysts asking what this meant for consumer staples stocks. Indeed, higher yields have already caused an adjustment in the price-earnings ratios of firms such as Nestle and Unilever. And $100 million flowed out of consumer stocks and utilities — another bond-proxy sector — this week, EPFR figures showed. But higher yields are not the only challenge: more salient might be the disruptive effect of Internet shopping, and companies’ waning pricing power in a more inflationary environment.” It’s always good to read rate statements from London, for a global view— Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report): This $101B market cap stock is leading the semiconductor season into greener pastures. The Value score of D is concerning, though.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report): Yes, the $240 a share investment bank makes our top list this week. But the Growth score of F is concerning.Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report): This $86B market cap stock looks like a lot better play than the former two stocks I mentioned this week. It has a B for Value and a B for Growth. With global growth stuttering, you might find a decent entry point here, in the coming weeks.Let’s move onto data events.Key Global Macro—Wednesday’s FOMC statement (out at 2pm ET) is likely to be a maintenance affair.

901,TXN,"This Global Week Ahead is the last big week of the U.S. earnings season. 144 S&P 500 firms release results this week, followed by 38 the following week, and 18 the week after that. Then, the Q1 earnings releases fizzle out.(1) The week’s key corporate names include Apple, Pfizer, Merck, Berkshire Hathaway, McDonald’s, Loews, Mastercard, MetLife, Kellogg and CBS.(2) Of four main geopolitical risks to equities, two could see further constructive developments this week. These events would be centered upon NAFTA and North Korea. Iran nuclear deal recertification and the critical U.S./China tariff deadlines loom further out, roughly at the mid-month mark.(3) The coming week holds two top-shelf U.S. macro events. The Fed’s latest policy decision comes out on Wednesday. April non-farm payroll data hits on Friday. Reuter’s in London writes to us about the underlying situation in the global fixed income markets. Rates should continue to cause concern in equity markets this week too, as the key rates-related macro and a Fed policy decision hits the tape. “As bond yields rise on expectations of higher interest rates, one thing that comes into focus is the equity risk premium (ERP) — the price paid to investors to compensate for the risk of investing in stocks rather than bonds. It was this issue that was core to February’s global equity selloff — the sudden realization by investors: that government bonds could soon provide a viable safer alternative to equities. Typically, first in line to be bruised by higher yields are consumer staples, which are known as “bond proxies” due to generous dividends and comfortable cash flows. So when U.S. 10-year yields rose above 3.0% last week, concerned clients called analysts asking what this meant for consumer staples stocks. Indeed, higher yields have already caused an adjustment in the price-earnings ratios of firms such as Nestle and Unilever. And $100 million flowed out of consumer stocks and utilities — another bond-proxy sector — this week, EPFR figures showed. But higher yields are not the only challenge: more salient might be the disruptive effect of Internet shopping, and companies’ waning pricing power in a more inflationary environment.” It’s always good to read rate statements from London, for a global view— Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report): This $101B market cap stock is leading the semiconductor season into greener pastures. The Value score of D is concerning, though.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report): Yes, the $240 a share investment bank makes our top list this week. But the Growth score of F is concerning.Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report): This $86B market cap stock looks like a lot better play than the former two stocks I mentioned this week. It has a B for Value and a B for Growth. With global growth stuttering, you might find a decent entry point here, in the coming weeks.Let’s move onto data events.Key Global Macro—Wednesday’s FOMC statement (out at 2pm ET) is likely to be a maintenance affair.

902,TXN,"The sudden return of volatility to global stock markets has created buying opportunities in large-cap tech stocks as the sector’s investors look to rebound from recent selloffs. The world’s tech leaders have dominated Wall Street over the past two years, and now, investors might have a fresh chance to buy a few previously red-hot stocks at a discount.Of course, this recent volatility has made some investors hesitant, with bearish traders quick to draw similarities between this latest tech rally and the infamous dot-com bubble of the late 90s and early 2000s.However, unlike the dot-com bubble, there is real earnings and revenue growth fueling this tech rally. In fact, the average P/E ratio of our “Computer and Technology” sector currently sits at 21.3, which compares favorably to the dot-com era’s average that routinely soared into the 200s.Another interesting trend in today’s tech rally is that, rather than obsessing over the next big thing, investors seem to rewarding tried-and-true brands for their respectable growth. This means that some of the strongest tech stocks are the household names that consumers already know and love.With that said, check out these three blue chip tech stocks to buy now:1. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report)Amazon does not need much of an introduction, but investors should always remember that the company has its hands in much more than just the e-commerce business that brought it fame. The Seattle-based firm is now a legitimate brick-and-mortar retailer, cloud computing provider, entertainment media publisher, and more. AMZN is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Amazon’s track record speaks for itself, as shares have gained nearly 70% in the trailing one-year period. The stock has shrugged off market-wide volatility and continues to test new highs. Earnings are expected to improve by a staggering 180% this year, with sales surging nearly 34%. AMZN is a staple stock that should appease investors looking for near-term strength and long-term, buy-and-hold gains. 2. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report)Thanks to its strategic investments in datacenters and artificial intelligence, Nvidia has emerged as one of Wall Street’s most popular stocks. Of course, the company’s industry-leading GPUs remain its backbone and are the number one choice for PC gamers worldwide. Nvidia shares have gained over 57% within the past year, and since the stock is still sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it is showing few signs of stopping.Nvidia is still in an aggressive growth cycle, with current estimates calling for the firm to see EPS and revenue growth of 61% and 36%, respectively, this fiscal year. And of course, Nvidia has made a habit out of crushing expectations. Management is also improving its finances, generating cash flow growth of nearly 67%. Valuations are stretched, but investors should be willing to pay a premium for a company with Nvidia’s proven success and continued potential. 3. Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report)Facebook found itself at a bit of an impasse earlier this year as its handling of user data garnered significant public and regulatory scrutiny. But the company never felt much in terms of actual regulatory action, and so far, its revenue growth has significantly outpaced new costs associated with upping security and vetting content.FB is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and looks like one of the internet industry’s top picks once again. Earnings and revenue are expected to improve by 24% and 41%, respectively, in 2018. Meanwhile, the stock has a PEG of just 1.1, so investors are getting a good price for that earnings growth. Plus, at 25.6x forward earnings, FB is the cheapest it has been in quite some time. Want more market analysis from this author?

903,TXN,"Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI recently took the wraps off a buck converter, which it claims to be the industry’s first 16-V input, 40-A synchronous DC/DC buck converter.Known as TPS543C20 SWIFT, it features an internally compensated advanced-current-mode (ACM) control topology that supports frequency synchronization. The converter offers improved efficiency by integrating low resistance high- and low-side MOSFETs into small-footprint package that is thermally efficient.Two converters can be stacked side by side for handling loads up to 80 A for processors in power dense and space constrained applications.How is TI Poised?The new buck converter finds use in several markets such as communications, cloud computing and enterprise and thus should strengthen the company’s presence in these markets.As the company continues to leverage on its expertise in analog and embedded products and systems to launch compelling products for different markets, we believe the move is intended to boost TI’s Analog segment revenues.In the last reported quarter, the segment was up 6.9% sequentially and 18% from the year-ago quarter. It generated 65% of quarterly revenues. (Read more: Texas Instruments Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenue Estimates)Wrapping UpThe move highlights Texas Instruments’ R&D investments in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.The company has been integrating different functionalities into single devices, encouraging customers to go for the simpler, more power efficient and smaller form factor products that could potentially lower the cost of ownership and could be used in the smallest of applications. For TI, this increases the dollar content per device, helping share gains and margin expansion. It also helps to fend off tough competition from the likes of Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

The machine will have a wider rollout in the United States and Canada this fall and in Europe early next year.We observe that Texas Instruments stock has gained 14.1% year to date, underperforming the 18.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.How Does It Work?Students can write programs on Rover’s graphing calculator based on which it moves and draws things. The basic idea is to help students learn science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects in an easy, interesting, enjoyable and interactive way.The machine helps students individually or collaboratively explore various STEM topics and concepts and efficiently work on basic as well as advanced STEM, coding and robotics projects. Even students less accustomed to coding and robotics, can use Rover through basic programs. It has been built particularly for classroom use.President of TI Education Technology, Peter Balyta stated, ""Given the sheer joy we have seen on students' faces as they learned to code during our testing phase, we are excited to see how Rover will inspire more young minds through an introduction to robotics.""Texas Instruments Incorporated Net Income (TTM) Texas Instruments Incorporated Net Income (TTM) | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteOur TakeTI’s robotic subsystem aims at building new capacities and features for robots used in industrial, medical, logistics and service applications.

905,TXN,"The U.S. equity markets shrugged off initial fears and scaled near record highs as Hurricane Irma had a lesser-than-expected impact on Florida and worries about another North Korea missile test by the weekend ebbed. As investors regained their appetite for riskier bets like equities, courtesy of strengthening dollar and sell-off in global bond markets, ‘cash cow’ stocks that offer higher returns have come to the forefront.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screen:Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dallas, TX, Texas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.4% and long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.6%.

906,TXN,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of senior notes offering worth $1.1 billion. Notes, carrying an interest rate equal to 2.1% per year, are set to mature in 2019. The offering is anticipated to close on Sep 20.However, the company announced that the offering is not “registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws” and therefore, are “being offered only to “qualified institutional buyers” under Rule 144A of the Securities Act or, outside the United States, to persons other than “U.S. persons” in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.”Hewlett Packard intends to use the entire proceed from the aforementioned offerings for repayment of its two existing outstanding notes. While one is $750 million worth of senior notes carrying a coupon rate of 2.45%, the other is $350 million worth of floating rate notes, both being due in 2017.Borrowing costs continue to be low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. With the U.S. treasuries offering low rates, corporate bonds and borrowings from banks are now witnessing high demand. We believe these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth.With the recent move, the company will be able to bring down its interest expenses as the new senior notes carry a lower coupon rate than the ones which are being repaid. It should be noted that the company’s interest expenses have been escalating due to mounting debt burden which will dampen its profitability.During the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Hewlett Packard paid $260 million as interest expenses, which is 33.3% higher than what it had paid during the same period in fiscal 2015. Also, the company’s long-term debt (excluding current portion) increased to $14.5 billion at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2017 from $12.2 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2016.Although, the entire industry to which Hewlett Packard Enterprise belongs to has been underperforming, the stock is among the worst performers. During the year-to-date period, the stock has lost 42.3%, as compared with the loss of 18.7% incurred by industry. Currently, Hewlett Packard carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are FormFactor Inc. (FORM  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Long-term expected EPS growth rates for FormFactor, NVIDIA and Texas Instruments are 16%, 10.3% and 9.6%, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

907,TXN,"Everyone knows by now what Internet of Things (IoT) is. It has already become an integral part of everyday life, thanks to an ever-increasing number of connected products.However, for the uninitiated, IoT is a concept, seeking to connect devices used for everyday living to the Internet, so that they can share and exchange data and thereby operate more intelligently. It can also enable devices to communicate with each other, as required (such as in connected homes).At the consumer level, the IoT market is dominated by techs such as Amazon and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), whose Echo and Home, respectively, are ruling the market. Also, activity-tracking products and advanced in-car technology are other products already available. On the commercial side, a number of industrial manufacturers have started installing sensors inside machines to track performance and efficiency.IoT Market: Strong Growth ProjectionsMarket observers recognize IoT as a booming space. According to a recent report by research firm Gartner, worldwide spending on endpoints and services of connected objects is expected to reach nearly $2 trillion in 2017 from $737 billion in 2016.There will be about 8.4 billion connected objects (IoT objects) in use globally by the end of this year, a rise of 31% from the year ago. This figure is likely to reach around 20.4 million by 2020. Notably, North America, Western Europe and Greater China region will dominate 67% of total globally IoT-installed bases in 2017. As per a Gartner report, Businesses will represent 57% of total IoT spending this year to $964 billion. Consumer applications will amount to $725 billion in 2017. The research firm has estimated that hardware spending from both segments will reach almost $3 trillion by 2020.According to another research firm IDC, the IoT market could nearly triple in the coming years. In 2014, the global IoT market was worth $655.8 billion. However, it has the potential to reach up to $1.7 trillion by 2020.Given such impressive projected numbers in the IoT space, investors should definitely consider adding IoT stocks to their portfolios.Below are the three IoT stocks that have the right combination to outperform:Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) – Cypress manufactures embedded system solutions for automotive, industrial, home automation and appliances, consumer electronics and medical products.Last year, the company acquired Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business to gain leadership in the IoT segment. Also, the company laid off 8% of its global workforce to focus on the growth areas like the IoT segment.Recently, Cypress' IoT connectivity platform teamed up with Arrow Electronics to deliver pioneering solutions to facilitate new, inventive business models for the IoT market.The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10.0%.Although CY has returned only 17.7% on a year-to-date basis compared to the industry’s gain of 18.2%, we believe that strong growth potential of its IoT initiatives will help the stock rebound going forward.Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) – The semiconductor giant has substantial opportunities stemming from the increasing demand for its microcontrollers — low cost, low power, embedded chips that have programming, and data memory.Its focus on gaining share in the infotainment and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) segments of the automotive market are likely to spur growth in 2017.The company’s IoT profile falls under its Embedded Processors division, which includes the Connectivity, Microcontrollers, and Processors categories. Its Embedded Processors segment witnessed growth of 8.1% sequentially and 15% year over year in its last reported second-quarter results.We believe that increasing number of connected devices is expected to drive demand for these chips in 2017 and beyond that will boost top-line growth.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 9.6%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, Texas Instruments has also underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. The stock has returned approximately 11.5% compared with the industry’s growth of roughly 15.0%.Fitbit, Inc. (FIT  -  Free Report) – Although the company’s growth has been slowed by massive competition in the wearables space, this is one of the few IoT pureplays that should perform well in the near future. Fitbit has devices at varying prices for individual and corporate uses. The company pursues corporate healthcare plans and has registered some major wins in the area.  Recently, the company introduced its sleek tech-filled wristwatch, the Ionic, which could help the company gain some share in the IoT market. Moreover, Fitbit has partnered with glucose monitoring device company, Dexcom Inc. (DXCM), to help users monitor their glucose levels on its new wristwatch Ionic. The deal will definitely help Fitbit to counter some competition in the IoT market.It has also undergone significant executive shakeup and cost structuring recently.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 22.5%.However, Fitbit has also underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. The stock has lost approximately 14.1% compared with the industry’s growth of roughly 8.7%.Bottom LineThe above mentioned stocks have made great progress in the segment and will play a big role in shaping the market going forward. Undoubtedly, these IoT stocks can’t not be ignored.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without. More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

909,TXN,"Texas Instruments’ (TXN  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.11 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Earnings increased 36% year over year and 11% sequentially.Revenues of $3.79 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.65 billion,up 11.4% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. Also, it came at the higher end of the guided range of $3.49-$3.79 billion, driven by strong demand for Analog and Embedded Processing products in the auto and industrial markets.Following first-quarter results, shares rose 5.62% in after-hours trading, driven by strong demand in the auto and industrial markets. Also, strong top-line outlook could be one of the reasons for surge in the share price.Also, Texas Instruments’ shares have rallied 25.1% in the past 12-month period, underperforming its industry’s growth of 49.7%. Segment wise, growth of analog and embedded processing applications business was strong. These typically yield a more stable business as well as strong margins. The Other segment declined year over year.Texas Instruments continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually expanding its exposure to industrial and automotive markets, while reducing the same in volatile consumer/computing markets, and increasing dollar content at customers..Internally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel , is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales, even while expanding its business.The company remains focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages. Overall, we remain optimistic about its compelling product line, differentiation in business and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. However, risks associated with a high debt level persist.Let’s see what the numbers say.Revenues in DetailAnalog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated 68%, 25% and 7% of quarterly revenues, respectively.Analog, which includes Power, Signal Chain and High Volume products, was up 14% from the year-ago quarter to $2.6 billion. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong performance in the product lines — power and signal chain.The Embedded Processing segment, which includes Connected Microcontrollers and Processors, was up 15% year over year to $926 million. The year-over-year growth was driven by stronger sales across both the product lines — processors and connected microcontrollers.The Other segment, which includes DLPs, custom ASICs and calculators, was down 13% from the prior-year quarter to $297 million.Margins Texas Instruments’ gross margin of 64.6% was down 48 basis points (bps) sequentially but up 156 bps from the year-ago quarter.

910,TXN,"Following a topsy-turvy day of regular trading this Tuesday -- which saw a nearly 700-point swing in the Dow, from up triple digits early in the day to more than 400 points down at the close -- we see another slew of Q1 earnings results from prominent companies in each of their various industries.

Revenues eked out a beat as well, to $1.72 billion from the $1.71 billion expected. The company's also announced a 50% dividend hike, which seems a bit out of the ordinary for a company that just lost its founder and CEO, Steve Wynn, ten weeks ago on charges of sexual misconduct. That said, the company has averaged more than a 22% positive surprise over the previous four quarters.

914,TXN,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT. Vishay markets its portfolio to manufacturers of everything from biometric monitoring systems to fitbands and smart appliances.VSH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is a hot momentum play, with shares adding more than 10% in the past four weeks to test new 52-week highs. Analysts have also become more bullish on the company’s earnings outlook, with full-year EPS estimates improving nearly 36% in the trailing quarter. Bottom LineThe Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world.  And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

915,TXN,"The markets hate the unknown and unpredictable, and the simmering tension in the Korean peninsula is a bit of both. Investors and politicians across the world seem to be apprehensive about the global reaction to North Korea's sixth and also its biggest nuclear weapons test this Sunday.With the potential for conflict over North Korea’s act in the forefront of everyone’s minds, stock markets are on tenterhooks as well. In fact, according to some South Korean officials, North Korea appears to be setting up the test for another intercontinental ballistic missile.Back home, geopolitics and severe hurricanes rocked Wall Street’s calm, as markets remained skittish in the aftermath of North Korea’s nuclear test and a second potent hurricane — Irma — expected in the United States in as many weeks.Amid such a fickle environment that could rapidly escalate, it was no surprise that investors sought asset security as gold prices flared up and the U.S. Treasuries strengthened.However, we feel that in such a scenario, investors should look beyond gold and government securities. We have created a multi-faceted screen for you that will give investors stability and profit growth potential farther than the next quarter.Making Sense of ProfitsIt is common knowledge that Wall Street is obsessed with the bottom line. But are higher profits necessarily better? Are these really a true indicator of the staying power of a company’s earnings?While dollar profits trump all other measures hands down for sheer shock value, these do not relate profits to the size of the company, its sales, resources or shareholder capital. The only profitability measure that reasonably works across industries is the ratio of return generated on the dollars invested in a business.The most popular among these ratios is Return on Equity (“ROE”), favored by both Wall Street analysts and investors alike. However, since the ROE measure receives the most attention from the investor community, executives focus heavily on this metric as well. Companies can exploit financial strategies (like increasing debt leverage and stock buybacks funded through built-up cash) to artificially maintain a healthy ROE for a while and conceal weakening operational profitability.So, let’s shift our focus to a different bottom-line metric which garners far less attention from executives and investors alike — Return on Invested Capital (“ROI”).The Lesser-Known ROI MetricEssentially, ROI shows how optimally management has been directing the capital under its control into profitable investments. It paints a clear picture of how efficiently a company is employing its capital and whether its competitive positioning is allowing it to produce good returns from that capital.Also, we will focus on large caps, which are big, established companies in the stock market, and have a comparatively softer risk profile. By virtue of their dominant market position, global footprint and relatively consistent cash-flow stream, these companies tend to be more reliable investments — which is called for in the current geopolitical environment. Also, ROI is particularly relevant for assessing companies that have a large amount of capital.Our ScreenNonetheless, it might be quite difficult for investors to single out such companies, as we need companies which have generated strong ROIs over a sufficiently long period of time, in order to determine a robust trend.So, we have created a three-faceted screen to shortlist such companies for you. Only those companies which have generated ROIs in excess of 15% on average over the last five years can get past our screen. Their current ROI (over the trailing 12 months) also needs to be at least 15%.In addition, to ensure that we hone in on stable companies, which have an established history of generating profits, our screen allows only those companies which have a market capitalization north of $10 billion.Needless to say, these companies must have a solid Zacks Rank too. A favorable Zacks Rank shows positive analyst interest and brighter prospects for the company.These stocks have proven their mettle consistently during challenging times and look set to outperform peers effortlessly through efficient usage of assets. Just five companies got through our screen, and here they are:The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)Boeing is one of the world's major aerospace firms, and designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services, and supports commercial jetliners, satellites, military aircraft, human space flight, missile defense, and launch systems, and services globally.The aerospace giant generated an impressive average ROI of 33.2% over the last five years and boasts a current ROI of 64%.Over the past month, analysts have become increasingly bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

917,TXN,"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) were down more than 4% through early afternoon trading hours Tuesday after the chipmaker lost its legal bid to postpone changes to its cellular patent licensing process in South Korea.The semiconductor manufacturing giant confirmed on Monday night that the Seoul High Court had denied its application to put a stay on a remedial order by the Korea Fair Trade Commission over the way it licenses cellular patents.Qualcomm was seeking to delay the Fair Trade Commission’s order while the company appeals the regulator body’s findings in court. Nevertheless, South Korea denied the request and ruled that Qualcomm’s business would not suffer irreparable harm if the order took effect during the appeals process.Qualcomm shares dropped about 4% to $50.08 by early afternoon. However, at least one analyst argued that the ruling wouldn’t really have a major effect on the company’s results.“While this is interesting, we do not believe it affects QCOM treatment in other countries,” said JPMorgan’s Rod Hall in a note. “We also point out that the smartphone volumes in Korea are tiny relative to global volume and have little impact on Qualcomm’s licensing revenue stream.”Indeed, Qualcomm’s slump appears to be coming on a weak day throughout the semiconductor industry. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor Sector ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) was down more than 1.5%, while major chipmakers like AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) were down more than 3%.Other industry giants, including Micron Technology (MU), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), also fell on Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down over 1.3% through Tuesday afternoon trading.Tech’s rough day was mirrored by nearly all major sectors, as several major international stories, as well as the onset of the market’s historic worst month, helped drag stocks down on Tuesday (also read: Stocks Dip To Start September, The Market's Traditional Worst Month).Want more stock market analysis from this author?

918,TXN,"At times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors should retain if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.In fact, Cirrus Logic stock has gained 10.3% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s rally of 9.3%.Factors In Favor of Cirrus LogicCirrus Logic reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results. The company’s revenues and earnings also marked year-over-year improvement.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 81 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents per share and increased 84.1% year over year. Total revenues increased approximately 23.6% year over year to $320.7 million and also marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $320 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily owing to higher adoption of its products and strength in customer relationships.Cirrus Logic has broadened product portfolio. Its chips are used in DVD players/recorders, disc drives, sound chips for computers, XBox, professional audio, mobile technologies and voice transmission.  In fiscal 2017, the company unveiled a variety of new products which includes audio codecs and DSPs, amplifiers, MEMS microphones, SoundClear embedded software, to name a few. Notably, the company is a major chipset provider to Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Samsung as it generates a significant portion of revenues from them. Consequently, we believe that new products are likely to drive sales this year.We also note that customer base has diversified in recent times. At the end of fiscal 2017, top 10 direct customers accounted for approximately 92% of its revenues as compared with 89% at the end of fiscal 2016. We believe that its diversified product line will aid it to expand customer base rapidly in the near future.Being a fabless company, it does not have to own or operate foundries for the production of wafers. Instead, it works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of products. It also frees up resources for research and development (R&D) activity that would otherwise have been locked up in capital assets. This approach permits the company to focus more on the designing, developing and marketing side, which reduces operational and financial risk.Continued investments in the audio segment have helped the company to come up with innovative products from time to time. This aids it in attracting new customers and brings in additional revenues. Additionally, expansion in the LED market continues to drive growth.The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 17.5%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 21.9%.Risks PersistCirrus Logic generates a significant portion of revenues from Apple. This means that there is always an inherent risk of losing an Apple design contract, which will significantly hurt its financials. Moreover, sluggish economic growth, as well as IT spending may affect performance, going forward.Furthermore, the company faces competition from the likes of Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) and STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM  -  Free Report), which also remains a concern.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Consequently, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock for the time being.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks (Strong Buy) here.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

919,TXN,"Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) is collaborating with The Cornucopia Project and ripe.io to aid crop quality, yield and profitability enhancement initiatives.The Cornucopia Project is a Peterborough, NH-based nonprofit organization that conducts agricultural and garden projects for students from elementary to high school.San Francisco, CA-based ripe.io focuses on integrating Blockchain consisting of a framework of distributed ledgers, application program interface (API), Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors, and connected food supply chain workflow with the food system.We observe that Analog Devices shares have rallied 9.2% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 15.2%.Deal DetailsThe collaboration aims to train students and farmers on how to monitor crop quality as they move from “Farm to Fork,” thus facilitating improved decision making. While financing will be done by all three, Analog Devices and ripe.io are in charge of technical training.Most importantly, Analog Devices will make available a prototype version of its crop monitoring solution for use in the project. It is a sensor-to-cloud, IoT solution that boosts farmers with improved decision making on the basis of collected knowledge from near-real-time monitoring.ripe.io, on the other hand, is providing its block chain technology aiming to develop a fresh produce supply chain with farmers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, food service and end consumers.Kevin Carlin, Vice President, Automation, Energy and Sensors at Analog Devices stated that the project is an expansion of the company’s ‘Internet of Tomatoes’ program that aims at improving farmers’ decision making on farming cycle and quality of produce.Analog Devices, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Analog Devices, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Analog Devices, Inc. QuoteOur TakeWe believe the move is intended to increase the popularity of Analog Devices’ crop monitoring solution offering.Funding training projects does initially act as a drain on cash balance and weighs on margins but can be fruitful in the long term if used tactfully. Given that Analog Devices has a strong market position across industrial, communications infrastructure and consumer markets, moves like this could help it attract new customers and keep the existing ones hooked on its services.The company has been strengthening its balance sheet, expanding margins and improving cash generation capacity through continued focus on product innovation. This is required especially when it’s increasingly facing tough competition from the likes of Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report).Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Revenues improved on a year-over-year basis mainly owing to increased demand from its storage, networking and connectivity business. Moreover, the company provided encouraging third-quarter earnings guidance.Though the macro headwinds and stringent regulations might put the company's financials under pressure in the near term, we believe that the strong demand for Marvell’s 4G LTE products could be a growth driver. This will be supported by growth from the company’s wide range of newly-launched Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.Going forward, the company’s current restructuring initiative will help Marvell improve cloud infrastructure and applications, which are expected to drive the top line. The latest buyback scheme also reflects its sound financial position and favorable prospects.However, competition in the semiconductor market from major players such as Intel Corp.

923,TXN,"Shares of Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) dipped into the red during early afternoon trading Monday, just one day before the chip behemoth is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report. With concerns emerging that the dominant run for semiconductor stocks could be over soon, investors will want to key a close eye on the recent results of an industry bellwether like TXN.Increased demand for its chips—thanks to a variety of new applications throughout the tech landscape—has helped Texas Instruments surge considerably over the past few years. However, volatility in the tech sector and semiconductor industry has taken the wind out of the stock’s sails in recent months.Still, earnings growth in our “Semiconductor – General” group is expected to exceed 20% in 2018, and investors will hope that Texas Instruments can get things started with a strong report on Tuesday. Let’s take a closer look.Latest Outlook and ValuationBased on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect Texas Instruments to report adjusted earnings of $4.99 per share and total revenue of $15.64 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 16.6% and 4.6%, respectively.Heading into the week, TXN was trading at 19.2x forward 12-month earnings. Over the past year, its Forward P/E has been as high as 26.2 and has low as 18.9. It has traded with a median forward earnings multiple of 20.6x in that time. Its industry peers are currently sporting an average Forward P/E of 18.3. Investors might conclude that the stock is slightly discounted compared to where it has traded recently—but also slightly more expensive that its industry average.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Texas Instruments surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Texas Instrument is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of -1.4%. This means that the most recent analyst estimates have been slightly lower than the consensus. In other words, our model is not conclusively calling for a beat.Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of Texas Instrument’s report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices. The firm has met or surpassed estimates in each of the trailing ten quarters, but the stock has not always generated positive momentum during earnings season.We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Over the course of Texas Instrument’s streak, shares of turned positive in just five of these windows.Want more market analysis from this author?

924,TXN,"The semiconductor corner of the broad technology market was badly hit last week amid a spate of negative news from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research LRCX.Taiwan Semiconductor reduced its target for sales growth in the global semiconductor industry this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year. Notably, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.3% on Apr 19, marking the biggest one-day drop for the index since Feb 8. In the past week, the index was down 4.4%.Additionally, the analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch dampened the mood by cutting the price target on chipmakers with heavy exposure to Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone business, including Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Cirrus Logic (CRUS  -  Free Report) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS  -  Free Report). The analyst expects chip stocks to go 4-7% lower (read: Should You Snap Up Downtrodden Semiconductor ETFs Now?).As a result, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Fund (PSI  -  Free Report) shed more than 4% each last week and clearly underperformed the broad technology fund (XLK  -  Free Report) by a wide margin. XLK lost just 0.2% in the same time frame. The weak trend might continue this earnings season given the lack of positive Earnings ESP but a series of positive estimate revision could provide some upside.According to the our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Most of the chipmakers like Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials AMAT are less likely to surprise this quarter while NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) is poised to beat estimates. Let’s delve into the earnings picture of those that have a higher allocation to the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q1 earnings unfold. SOXX is largely concentrated on the five firms, with a combined share of 35.5%, followed by 27.8% for SMH and 24.5% for PSI.Inside Our Earnings PredictionTexas Instruments is set to report on Apr 24, after market close. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -1.39%, indicating lesser chances of beating estimates this quarter. The earnings estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter has gone up by couple of cents in the past 90 days. The earnings surprise track over the past four quarters is also good, with an average beat of 7.04%. The stock has a VGM Score of B (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -3.12%, indicating a lower chance of beating estimates this quarter.

925,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 24.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 7.04%. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings of $1.09 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues of $3.75 billion surpassed the consensus mark and increased 9.8% year over year. The figure also came ahead of the guided range of $3.57-$3.87 billion, driven by strong demand in the auto and industrial markets.For the first-quarter, TI expects revenues between $3.49 billion and $3.79 billion (down 3% sequentially at the mid-point).

926,TXN,"Shares of several major semiconductor industry stocks were down in early morning trading Wednesday after the latest quarterly earnings reports from equipment suppliers ASML Holding (ASML  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) caused hesitation.Nevertheless, there were plenty of positives to take away from both of these reports. Lam Research surpassed estimates on the top and bottom lines, reporting total revenue growth of 34.2% on 19% higher shipments.Dutch equipment maker ASML also posted earnings and revenue beats. The firm also notched net sales growth of 35.7% and adjusted earnings growth of 12.3%. However, ASML said it expects gross profit margin to slip to about 43% in the second quarter from 48.7% in the first quarter.Lam Research investors might also be concerned about slumping margins. The company said non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was down about 80 basis points from the previous quarter to 46.8%, and it expects that figure to fall in the range of 46.5% to 48.5% for the current quarter.Lam also mentioned that it expects shipments to be between $2.85 billion and $3.15 billion in the quarter, which is slightly sluggish compared to the $3.13 billion in shipments witnessed during the March period.Overall, Lam Research guided for adjusted earnings in the range of $4.80 to $5.20 per share and revenue of $2.95 to $3.25 billion—both of which exceeded our previous consensus estimates.Still, both LRCX and ASML were met with volatility on Wednesday morning. Lam Research opened lower and quickly dipped to an intraday low of $196.50 per share, down about 7.5% from Tuesday’s close. ASML shares slumped as much as $9.70, or 4.6%, in early trading hours.Analysts were quick to declare Lam Research’s post-earnings selloff a buying opportunity, with teams from Evercore ISI, Stifel, and B. Riley FBR all maintaining bullish stances.“At or near $200, we are buyers all day long,” Evercore said in a note. “Put simply, the cost of adding each new memory bit is rising significantly across both DRAM and NAND, which should sustain elevated WFE for years to come.”Stifel elaborated further, saying Lam Research’s shipments outlook “could embolden bears who believe we are at the 'peak' of the cycle and in particular, on the memory front, where there are concerns on oversupply and overcapacity,” but reiterated its buy rating for the stock.But mixed reactions to the reports were enough to inspire selling throughout the semiconductor space early Wednesday morning. Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) opened lower before surging back to Tuesday’s close, Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) was down as much as 1%, and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) dipped nearly 5%.Overall, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) slumped $25.77, or 1.9%, to a mid-morning low of $1331.95 per share. However, the fund bounced of this daily low around 10:30 am EST.Want more market analysis from this author?

927,TXN,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT. Vishay markets its portfolio to manufacturers of everything from biometric monitoring systems to fitbands and smart appliances.VSH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is a hot momentum play, with shares adding more than 10% in the past four weeks to test new 52-week highs. Analysts have also become more bullish on the company’s earnings outlook, with full-year EPS estimates improving nearly 36% in the trailing quarter. Bottom LineThe Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world.  And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

928,TXN,"Shares of Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) slumped nearly 5.5% in morning trading Thursday after UBS initiated coverage of the trendy stock with a sell rating. The analyst team, led by Timothy Arcuri, are apparently bearish on Micron due to “cyclical memory concerns and big estimate cuts.”Arcuri argued that Micron’s supply chain has struggled to keep inventory growth on pace with revenue expansion over the four quarters, a phenomenon which has helped create a “very favorable cyclical backdrop” for the semiconductor business. However, the analyst feels this factor is rapidly waning and will soon become a headwind.UBS also assigned a sell rating to chip behemoth Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Meanwhile, the firm initiated coverage of three semiconductor plays—Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Marvel Technology (MRVL  -  Free Report), and KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report)—with buy ratings.Arcuri’s concern that cyclical trends could eventually become headwinds is one that frequently looms above the semiconductor industry. Decades of progress in personal, business, and mobile computing have allowed analysts and investors to pick up on recurring factors that both drive growth and cause pullbacks.However, those that are bullish on Micron believe that new secular trends are enough to outweigh these cyclical factors, and company management is working to shift the rhetoric by painting a new picture of its business.“The dealer market today is very different from the PC-dominated market of the past,” said Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra in the company’s latest earnings report. “More specifically, memory is making possible applications such as AI and VR, and enabling new cloud-based business models which deliver a fundamental value far in excess of a price per bit.”Memory remains a heavily-commoditized segment of the technology sector, thanks in large part to cyclical trends like those mentioned by Arcuri. But for those that believe in the power of these new secular trends, this means that Micron is trading at extremely attractive valuation levels.For instance, MU is currently sporting a Forward P/E of just 5.2, which comes in at a significant discount to the average of 18.8 displayed by our broader “Computer and Technology” sector. Micron is also sporting an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.It is also worth noting that, despite Arcuri’s bearish sentiment, analysts have been largely optimistic about Micron over the past month. In fact, the company has witnessed nine positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates within the last 30 days, lifting its Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.48. This positive revision activity has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want more market analysis from this author?

929,TXN,"After a stellar ride, the technology sector witnessed wild swings in March thanks to the decline in FANG stocks and other high-technology names. The tech onslaught stemmed from a slew of negative news from some of the key companies in the space.Behind The PlungeThe initial panic was created by Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) after the data breach report that sparked concerns about data privacy and security, and will likely lead to increased scrutiny and possible regulatory pressure. Then, Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) announced the suspension of self-driving tests, raising concerns over the new growth areas in the space and pushing shares down. Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) also dropped on expectations of further regulation on its social media platform while Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) touched a one-year low on Moody’s downgrade. All these news have raised concerns over the growth of the hottest technology trends like autonomous cars and artificial intelligence.Adding to the woes is the decline in Amazon shares late last week that has shed about $30 billion from its market value on a single day. News that President Donald Trump is looking to target the e-commerce giant over antitrust or competition laws and is considering ways to change the tax treatment took toll on the stock. As a result, the S&P Technology Sector was off 4% in March and is likely to see rough trading this month as well.Trade War Fears ReignitedFading trade war fears between the two largest economies, United States and China, seems back on the table with the start of April. China has retaliated against Donald Trump’s taxes on imported steel and aluminum with its own tariff of up to 25% on a series of 128 products worth $3 billion from the United States, including pork and wine, effective today. The Trump administration, looking to punish Beijing over technology transfer policies, is expected to unveil the list of Chinese imports targeted for U.S. tariffs this week.Trump has already signed an executive memorandum to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports targeting the technology, telecom, and apparel sectors. The round of sanctions and retaliation could trigger a global trade war, hurting the global economy and corporate profits at big U.S. exporters. In particular, technology stocks, which are the biggest contributors of the nine-year bull market and a Trump rally, are expected to be hit hard as most of the tech companies, especially semiconductor manufacturers and software companies, have large operations in the Chinese market.Given this, we have highlighted five tech stocks to stay away from given their huge exposure to China. In spite of their double-digit projected earnings growth and positive estimate revisions for this year as well as a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), these stocks are vulnerable to the ongoing trade jitters.Skyworks Solutions Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report)This Massachusetts-based company designs, develops, manufactures, and markets proprietary semiconductor products, including intellectual property worldwide.

931,TXN,"Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 2. Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 23.73%. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 40.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderCirrus Logic is a premier supplier of high-performance analog circuits and advanced mixed-signal chip solutions. The company delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.  The year-over-year comparisons on both earnings and revenue front were also favorable.Continued investments in the audio segment have helped Cirrus Logic to come with innovative products time to time. This helps the company in attracting new customers and brings in additional revenues. We expect this factor to positively impact the company’s to-be-reported quarter results as it did in the earlier quarters too. Additionally, synergies from acquisitions and expansion in the LED market are anticipated to drive the fiscal first-quarter results.Nonetheless, sluggish economic growth, as well as IT spending may affect its fiscal first-quarter performance. Moreover, the company faces competition from the likes of Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) and STMicroelectronics, which also remain a concern for the to-be-reported quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cirrus Logic will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cirrus Logic is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 54 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cirrus Logic carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though this increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Cirrus Logic, Inc.

932,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI’s second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues came ahead of expectations.Earnings of $1.03 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Revenues of $3.7 billion beat the consensus mark by $139 million.The strong results were driven by strength in auto, industrial, communications and personal electronics markets.Texas Instruments continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.Internally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on an expansion plan.At the call, management stated that the company will remain focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages. Notably, free cash flow over the past 12 months was $4.04 billion or 28.5% of revenues. Overall, we remain optimistic about TI’s compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output.However, risks associated with a high debt level persist. Year to date, the stock has underperformed the industry it belongs to. It gained 11.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 13.8%.Let’s see what the numbers say.RevenueRevenues were up 8.6% sequentially and 12.8% year over year and came at the higher end of the guidance range of $3.40 billion and $3.70 billion.The automotive market continued to be strong. The company also saw broad-based improvement in the industrial market. The communications market and personal electronics grew well. Enterprise systems revenues were flat.Growth of analog and embedded processing applications business was strong. It typically yields a more stable longer-lived business as well as strong margins. The Other segment declined.

933,TXN,"AT&T (T  -  Free Report) reported Q2 earnings moments after the closing bell today, topping estimates on both and top and bottom lines. Earnings of 79 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus by 5 cents, and sales of $39.84 billion narrowly edged out the $39.80 billion expected. Improved churn performance and 2.8 million wireless net adds helped bolster Q2 results. CEO Randall Stephenson mentioned that the Time Warner  merger remains on course to close by the end of 2017. For more on AT&T's Q2 results, click here.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) saw a huge year-over-year improvement in earnings growth, easily beating expectations in the process. T.I. posted $1.03 per share, above the 95 cents anticipated, on quarterly revenues of $3.69 billion, breezing past the $3.56 billion in the Zacks consensus. Earnings growth of more than 35% and sales growth of 18% year over year spurred the big beat after the bell today. CEO Rich Templeton credited growth in the autos and industrials markets for the quarterly outperformance.U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) blew the doors off its earnings estimate, reporting $1.07 per share compared to what was expected to be 40 cents and rebounding strongly from a bottom-line loss in Q2 2016. Sales of $3.14 billion topped the $2.98 billion in the Zacks consensus, up 15% year over year. U.S. Steel is seeing bullish demand in all its steel markets, which covers construction, oil & gas, autos, and more. The company is also no stranger to wildly volatile earnings reports, including a Q4 jump of 2600% on the bottom line.Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) benefited from a hotter Macau market on the way to its Q2 earnings and sales beat: $1.18 per share beat expectations by 9 cents, and $1.53 billion in revenues surpassed the $1.45 billion analysts were looking for. Growth in Macau was up 6.8% year over year to $682.7 million in the quarter. These stronger Macau numbers may have been priced in to the stock, which was up 17% over the past 3 months and +40% year to date, as the stock is down more than 2% in post-report late trading.Finally, Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) fought through another quarter rife with negative headlines to outperform expectations on the bottom line: $2.32 per share improved over the $2.16 estimate, which itself was a nearly 150% gain from a year ago. Revenues missed estimates slightly, reporting sales of $1.17 billion compared to the $1.18 billion estimate. Comps of 8.1% were lower than expected (Q2 2016 was a particularly rough quarter for Chipotle), as the company dealt with norovirus and rat issues in the recent past.

934,TXN,"We are entering the heart of the second-quarter reporting cycle and 97 S&P 500 members, representing 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization, have already reported their results (as of Friday, Jul 21).Total earnings of these companies are up 8.4% on a year-over-year basis (78.4% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue is up 5.1% on a year-over-year basis (72.2% of the companies also beat top-line estimates).Overall, second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 8.6% from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 4.7%. This compares with 13.3% growth in first-quarter earnings on 7% higher revenues.Technology Earnings ExpectationsTechnology is one of the three sectors contributing significantly to second-quarter earnings. The other two are Finance and Energy.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software. Earnings for the technology sector are anticipated to be up 10.1%.A couple of semiconductor companies are slated to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 25. The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. So, let’s take a sneak peek into how Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) are placed ahead of their releases.Texas Instruments is unlikely to beat expectations as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, as per our proven model, a company needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3  to deliver an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.However, we note that Texas Instruments beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 7.68%.We believe the company’s strength in auto and industrial markets will play an important role. Compelling product line, the differentiation in its business, investments in high margin areas, and lower-cost 300mm Analog outputare other positives.It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), remains one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices.(Read More: What's in Store for Texas Instruments in Q2 Earnings?)Texas Instruments has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the stock returned almost 12%, the index gained 10.7% over the same time frame.Similarly, Advanced Micro Devices is unlikely to beat estimates as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters and matched the same on the other two occasions. It delivered an average four-quarter positive surprise of 34.09%.We believe strong demand for GPU cards, expanding product portfolio (Ryzen Pro, Vega accelerator, EPYC server processor, Ryzen desktop processor) and AMD’s improving position in key markets like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), gaming and parallel processing are positives. (Read More: Can Advanced Micro Pull an Earnings Surprise in Q2?)Advanced Micro stock has gained 22.4% year to date, underperforming the 30.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. The underperformance reflects stiff competition from NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) in the GPU space and Intel in the consumer PC market.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

935,TXN,"Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI, a global semiconductor company and one of the world's leading designers and suppliers of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits, is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25.The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that makes surprise prediction difficult. This is because, per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) going into the earnings announcement.Texas Instruments’ surprise history has been quite impressive as the company beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 7.68%.In the last one year, the stock has underperformed the industry it belongs to. It gained 24.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 35.3%.First-Quarter Highlights        In the quarter, Texas Instruments’ revenues grew 13.1% year over year. Pro forma net income was up 40.6% from the year-ago period.The automotive market continued to be strong. The company also saw broad-based improvement in the industrial market. The communications market and personal electronics grew well. Enterprise systems saw a decline.The analog and embedded processing applications business displayed strong growth.Factors at Play this QuarterInternal Execution Remains the KeyInternally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC), remains one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on an expansion plan.Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteInvestments in High Margin Areas Texas Instruments continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing its exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.Auto and Industrial Markets StrongThere are indications of strengthening auto and industrial markets, which are helping the company. The communications and enterprise systems market is stable. The personal electronics market remains weak.To ConcludeWe remain optimistic about TI’s compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm Analog output. We note that channel inventories remain very low, meaning that demand is likely to remain strong.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #1.The Priceline Group Inc. , with an Earnings ESP of +2.31% and a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

SOXX has the largest concentration in the five firms with a combined share of 32.5%, followed by 31.2% for SMH and 20.9% for PSI.Let’s dig deeper into the earnings picture of these companies that would drive the performance of the above-mentioned funds in the coming days:According to the our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided.

Notably, the company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 2.82%.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 19.05%. Adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) increased 14.3% from the year-ago quarter to 32 cents per share.

Moreover, weak U.S. dollar was also expected to hurt profitability as almost 30% of the company’s costs are in foreign currencies. Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cadence Design Systems, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWe note that Cadence has outperformed the Zacks categorized Computer Software industry on a year-to-date basis. While the stock returned 40.1%, the industry gained 23.4%.The outperformance can be attributed to improving penetration of its newly launched products like Xcelium and Protium S1 as well as strong adoption of Palladium Z1 and Pegasus Verification solution. During the first quarter, the company won a number of customers including Xilinx, Mellanox and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report).We note that Cadence’s digital, signoff and custom/analog tools are now enabled on Samsung Electronics’ 7LPP and 8LPP process technologies. Moreover, the company has received certification for its 28nm FDS reference flow by Samsung. We believe that the recognition will aid Cadence to win new customers.Moreover, the company’s expanding product portfolio boost its competitive position. Management noted that as part of the System Design Enablement (SDE) strategy, Cadence continues to pursue opportunities in higher growth areas like automotive, cloud infrastructure, machine learning, and aerospace & defense, which will eventually drive overall results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cadence will beat earnings this quarter.

"
938,TXN,"Key Points:
"
939,TXN,"The SOX remains in a 14-month slump
"
940,TXN,"Chipmakers are dealing with both inventory and demand issues
"
941,TXN,"Analysts are cutting forecasts on many semiconductor stocks
"
942,TXN,"Highlighted stocks include AMD, INTC, MU, RBCN, and TXN
"
943,TXN,"The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (aka ""the SOX"") is trading at levels not seen in 5 years. Problems within the industry have caused the index to remain in a 14-month slump.
"
944,TXN,"Too Much DRAM
"
945,TXN,"An ongoing glut of DRAM continues to cast a cloud over the entire industry. (DRAM is the most commonly used memory in PCs and workstations.) Many industry observers had hoped that demand would improve this year, but that has not happened. At the same time, foundries have not curtailed production enough. Therefore, DRAM prices remain weak.
"
946,TXN,"One of the largest manufacturers of DRAM is Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report). MU is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter results on Oct 1, and brokerage analysts are not optimistic. Within the past few weeks, 4 analysts have lowered their expectations, pulling the consensus estimate down to a loss of 21 cents. MU is a Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stock.
"
947,TXN,"Perhaps more telling is the outlook for fiscal 2009. The consensus estimate calls for a loss of 33 cents per share, reflecting negative revisions by 6 brokerage analysts. Just 30 days ago, the average forecast had called for a loss of 13 cents per share.
"
948,TXN,"Vista Is Not Helping
"
949,TXN,"Adding to the negative sentiment are worries about slowing demand for PCs and laptops. Various news reports have suggested that factories in Asia are seeing smaller orders.
"
950,TXN,"Some of the blame can be placed on the global economic slump. However, the blame also needs to be placed on Microsoft's (MSFT  -  Free Report) Vista. Though the sales numbers for the operating system look good on the surface, they mask the fact that most sales reflect the purchase of new PCs with Vista already installed. More importantly, many corporations have yet to upgrade from the older XP operating system, including PC-maker Lenovo. After using Vista at the office, I've decided to buy a Mac for home use.
"
951,TXN,"The concerns about slumping demand for PCs and the lack of traction for Vista are showing up in the earnings estimates for Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report).
"
952,TXN,"Nearly a quarter of the covering brokerage analysts have their 2008 and 2009 earnings forecasts on INTC during the past 30 days. Though the size of the reductions have not been large, 1 cent lower for 2008 and 3 cents lower for 2009, the negative trend is cause for concern. INTC is a Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stock.
"
953,TXN,"More troubling are the cuts to AMD. The company has missed earnings expectations for 2 consecutive quarters and brokerage analysts are now predicting bigger losses for 2008 and 2009 than previously forecast. Again, the size of the revisions are not big, a penny reduction for this year and next, but the trend is disconcerting. AMD is a Zacks #3 Rank stock.
"
954,TXN,"Demand for Handheld Devices Slipping
"
955,TXN,"The sluggish global economy is hurting demand for smaller, handheld devices such as mobile phones.
"
956,TXN,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) said in a recent conference call that it is seeing mixed performance from its wireless customers. Rubicon Technology  moved some of its deliveries of small LED wafers to 2009 because of a ""slowdown"" in the handheld device market.
"
957,TXN,"TXN narrowed its third-quarter guidance earlier this month and now expects per share profits to total between 42 and 46 cents, instead of 41 to 47 cents.
"
958,TXN,"Though most brokerage analysts left their third-quarter estimates unchanged, 10 cut their full-year 2008 forecasts and 11 cut their 2009 forecasts. The 2008 consensus earnings estimate is now at $1.80 per share, 2 cents below the average of 30 days ago. The 2009 consensus earnings estimate is at $1.91 per share, 4 cents below the average of 30 days ago. TXN is a Zacks #4 Rank stock.
"
959,TXN,"RBCN lowered its guidance for the remainder of 2008. The company expects to earn between 26 cents and 30 cents per share; previously it had predicted profits of 43 to 45 cents per share. All 5 covering analysts slashed their projections in response, resulting in a consensus earnings estimate of 29 cents per share. They also slashed their 2009 forecasts by 40 cents to 24 cents per share. RBCN is a Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stock.
"
960,TXN,"All of the aforementioned stocks are classified in Electronics-Semiconductors. This group contains 5 Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stocks: Chipmos Technology , Fairchild (FCS), Intersil (ISIL), Maxim (MXIM  -  Free Report) and Silicon Motion (SIMO  -  Free Report).

"
962,TXN,"There are a few semiconductor ETFs including PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductor (PSI), Semiconductor HOLDRs (SMH) and the S&P North American Technology Semiconductor iShares (IGW). Though they provide exposure to the semiconductor industry, they may not precisely track the SOX.

966,TXN,"Shares of Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) moved higher in early morning trading Monday as tech investors look to rebound from the sector’s tough stretch of trading last week. Despite recent volatility, Nvidia is up about 21% over the past three months, underscoring the company’s position as a tech bellwether and proving that Wall Street is still infatuated with this red-hot growth stock.Nvidia’s momentum comes on the back of its advancements in autonomous driving, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. But the company is still a powerhouse in its core gaming market, meaning that NVDA investors are getting unique exposure to both an industry leader and a budding growth play.The strength of Nvidia’s core business and new revenue streams has paid off in the form of rapid earnings and revenue improvement, with the graphics-chip maker notching adjusted EPS expansion of 61% and sales growth of 41% in its most recent fiscal year.But this surge has, at times, allowed Nvidia’s valuation to skyrocket into speculative territory, leading some value investors to declare it a bubble that is doomed to burst at the first sign of trouble.With that said, value investors should not ignore NVDA. In fact, a closer look at its valuation trend over the past year reveals a few interesting trends that might make the stock more attractive right now. Here’s how Nvidia’s Forward P/E looks compared to its peer group: Our system places seven other companies into Nvidia’s peer group: Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), THK Co. , Sumco , Xcerra (XCRA  -  Free Report), and Amtech Systems (ASYS  -  Free Report).This is obviously a diverse group of stocks, with some serving as direct competitors to Nvidia in certain key businesses—and others focusing on different markets entirely. This group is not perfect for direct comparisons, but it does help show how investors value other companies in the evolving semiconductor industry.Nvidia is clearly trading at a premium to its peer group, but that makes sense considering what the company brings to the table. The Santa Clara, California-based firm is on the cutting edge of the AI industry, and its products are also the go-to hardware for smart vehicle manufacturers.Meanwhile, Nvidia GPUs are the top choice among serious PC gamers, which continues to be a great core business for the company. In other words, investors should expect to pay a premium for a high-tech company with a solid foundation and mountains of potential.What’s more, Nvidia is actually trading at the lowest earnings multiple it has seen in nearly a year. Those concerned about the company’s valuation might have already written the stock off, but NVDA is really the cheapest it has been in some time.Nvidia has also been identified as a strong option by our proven Zacks Rank system. Our model places an emphasis on earnings estimates and positive estimate revisions, and ever-improving analyst sentiment surrounding NVDA helps the stock earn our top mark.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Nvidia’s full-year earnings has gained a staggering $1.55, indicating that analysts are struggling to keep up with the company’s lightning-fast growth. Thanks to this revision activity, NVDA is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Nvidia is certainly a pricey stock, but investors simply have to pay a premium for a company of this quality right now. NVDA is poised to outperform the market over the next one to three months, and it is on track to be a dominant tech powerhouse for years to come.Want more market analysis from this author?

967,TXN,"Shares of Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) gained about 1.5% on Friday, extending the red-hot stock’s impressive run and lifting its three-month gains to over 25%. The Wall Street darling remains a dominant player in the gaming industry, but its ongoing rise to the top of the technology sector comes on the back of tireless advancements in autonomous driving, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.Nvidia’s investments in these budding industries have also been paying off in the form of rapid earnings and revenue improvement, with the graphics-chip maker notching adjusted EPS expansion of 61% and sales growth of 41% in its most recent fiscal year.One of the company’s main growth drivers has been its Datacenter segment, which includes its AI-powered DGX and Tesla products. In the latest full quarter, Nvidia witnessed Datacenter revenues of $606 million, up about 105% year over year.But this surge has, at times, allowed Nvidia’s valuation to skyrocket into speculative growth stock territory, leading some cautious investors to declare it a bubble that is doomed to burst at the first sign of trouble.With that said, I want to show one NVDA chart that I think every investor needs to see—regardless of whether you are bullish or bearish on the company’s future.Here’s how Nvidia’s Forward P/E currently stacks up against its peer group:Our system places seven other companies into Nvidia’s peer group: Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), THK Co. , Sumco , Xcerra (XCRA  -  Free Report), and Amtech Systems (ASYS  -  Free Report).This is obviously a diverse group of stocks, with some serving as direct competitors to Nvidia in certain key businesses—and others focusing on different markets entirely. This group is not perfect for direct comparisons, but it does help show how investors value other companies in the evolving semiconductor industry.There are at least a couple of observations to make here. First, NVDA is trading with its lowest Forward P/E in nearly a year. For Nvidia bulls, this is probably a reason to buy even more. In the several quarters since the stock was previously trading at these levels, the company has done nothing but prove its insane growth and potential.And of course, we can see that Nvidia is trading at a significant premium to its peer group. This is where investors really need to step back and ask themselves one major question: What exactly is Nvidia doing that warrants this type of valuation?To many, the answer is pretty clear. Nvidia is on the cutting edge of the artificial intelligence industry, which should put it in a leadership position in a budding market that promises to change the nature of humanity forever (also read: Two ""Artificial Intelligence"" Stocks You Should Buy Right Now).Its products are also the go-to hardware for smart vehicle manufacturers, who need Nvidia’s top-of-the-line technology to power advanced in-car systems. Meanwhile, Nvidia GPUs are the top choice among serious PC gamers, which continues to be a strong core business for the company.Moreover, Nvidia has been identified as a strong option by our proven Zacks Rank system. Our model places an emphasis on earnings estimates and positive estimate revisions, and ever-improving analyst sentiment surrounding NVDA helps the stock earn our top mark.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Nvidia’s full-year earnings has gained a staggering $1.54, indicating that analysts are struggling to keep up with the company’s lightning-fast growth.

968,TXN,"Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) shares and sentiments have taken a beating after the flaws in its chips made headlines. Intel tried to push out patches along with OS providers Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) that slowed down machines.To make matters worse, CEO Brian Krzanich sold a sizeable amount of shares that further increased fears that the gravity of the matter was being played down. As a result, the shares have taken a beating. But last week saw something of a reversal in sentiments as two veteran analysts published notes that the shares are in fact worth buying.  Analysts Positive on IntelAnalysts at Instinet Research raised their price target on Intel shares from $50 to $60 based on its strength in the data center. ""This shift in customer mix [to cloud and communication service providers] has been dramatic, setting Intel up for better revenue growth,"" says the report quoted by Marketwatch. So Intel is expected to ""easily surpass segment guidance of high-single-digit growth"" on the back of the 20% growth it saw in Q4.A Citibank analyst  reiterated his Buy rating on Intel and named it the top semiconductor stock for 2018 (similar to Micron in 2017 when it appreciated 90%). The optimism is based on the resumption in spending by enterprises as reported by other companies.Given Intel’s greater exposure to the space, this should benefit it even more than the others. The low sentiment on the stock coupled with this growth potential makes for solid upside potential, the analyst says.Another point noted in the media is Intel’s institutional support. As sentiments on the stock remain low, institutions have continued to buy and currently hold about 70% of the shares. A class action lawsuit has commenced at the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of investors who purchased Intel shares between Jul 27, 2017 and Jan 4, 2018. The complaint is about the company issuing materially false and misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) there is a fundamental design flaw in Intel's processor chips as they contain a feature that makes them vulnerable to hacking; (2) updates to fix the problems in Intel's processor chips could cause Intel chips to operate 5-30% more slowly; and (3) consequently, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.Intel shares carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Intel peers worth buying include NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), or Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), which has a Zacks Rank #2.

970,TXN,"Shares of Ambarella Inc. (AMBA  -  Free Report) gained nearly 13.5% last Friday after the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. In fact, the company beat management’s projections at every point — revenues and margins.However, on a year-over-year basis, its top- and bottom-line results registered declines mainly due to a substantial plunge in chip sales to GoPro Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report), along with the prevalent softness in the drone market. Earnings were also adversely affected by elevated operating expenses.Let’s discuss the quarterly results in detail.Quarter in DetailThe company’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues slipped 19.4% year over year to $70.6 million, mainly due to the decline in drone and GoPro sports-camera revenues, partially offset by strong performances in the IP security, auto and non-GoPro wearable markets.However, quarterly revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70 million and came above management’s guided range of $68-$72 million. Moreover, excluding sales to GoPro, revenues remained flat year over year at $57.3 million. Sales to GoPro significantly declined year over year from $30.2 million to $13.3 million. During the fiscal fourth quarter, GoPro’s contribution to total revenues was down to 18.8% from 32.4% in the year-ago quarter.Apart from GoPro, WT Microelectronics and Chicony were the two companies which have contributed more than 10% to Ambarella’s fiscal fourth-quarter total revenues. WT Microelectronics’ contribution totaled 49.6%, while Chicony contributed 10.3%.On a non-GAAP basis, the company reported gross margin of 64.7%, which came in 250 basis points (bps) lower than the year-ago quarter. However, the figure expanded 70 bps from the previous-quarter tally, mainly driven by better IP security product mix, and partially offset by softness in drone and sports-camera revenues. Also, the fiscal fourth-quarter non-GAAP gross margin was higher than management’s earlier guidance of 62-63.5%.Non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $29.5 million, up from $25.4 million incurred in the year-ago quarter and $27.2 million reported in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Operating expenses flared up primarily due to escalating chip-development costs, primarily toward the development of 10-nanometer CV chips. However, non-GAAP operating expenses remained within the company’s previously guided range of $28.5-$30 million.Non-GAAP operating income dipped to $16.2 million from $33.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin contracted to 22.9% from 38.2% reported in the year-ago quarter chiefly due to reduced gross margin and soaring operating expenses.Non-GAAP net income plunged to $15.8 million from $32 million reported in the year-earlier quarter. On per-share basis, the company’s earnings came in at 45 cents, witnessing a substantial decline from the year-ago quarter’s level of 92 cents. This year-over-year fall stemmed from lower revenues and elevated operating expenses. However, the figure came well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents.Ambarella, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ambarella, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ambarella, Inc. QuoteBalance SheetAmbarella ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents & marketable securities of $434.6 million, up from $414 million recorded in the previous quarter.During the reported quarter, the company bought back 66,747 shares, for a total cash consideration of $3.3 million. Additionally, in February 2018, the company bought 142,344 shares at an average price of $48.05. Since the inception of its share-repurchase programs in June 2016, the company has bought back a total of 1,642,228 shares for a total consideration of $81.8 million. Ambarella has approximately $24.9 million remaining under the $50-million repurchase program, which commenced on Jul 1, 2017.GuidanceFor first-quarter fiscal 2019, revenues are expected to be between $54.5 million and $57.5 million (mid-point $56 million), down 10.3-15% from the year-earlier quarter. The guidance at the mid-point is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $59.2 million.Non-GoPro revenues in the fiscal first quarter are likely to drop 12% year over year.The company predicts that the considerable decline in revenues from the drone market will adversely impact the current quarter’s top-line performance. Additionally, it believes shortage of memory chips will thwart the company’s revenues in the fiscal first quarter. However, Ambarella anticipates strong year-over-year revenue growth in IP security (both professional and consumer) and automotive market.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to lie between 60% and 62%, as compared with 64.3% recorded in the year-ago quarter. The contraction will be due to increase in China security revenues and decline in drone revenues.Non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated between $30 million and $32 million, up sequentially due to increase in “chip tape out fees and engineering head count.”The company did not provide any outlook for fiscal 2019.Currently, Ambarella carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader tech space are Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

971,TXN,"Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) broke through long-term resistance and soared to 52-week highs after raising second-quarter guidance. The news followed a second consecutive earnings surprise and should reinforce the stocks underlying trend. 
"
972,TXN,"Full Analysis
"
973,TXN,"Texas Instruments Inc. is a global semiconductor company and one of the world's leading designers and suppliers of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits, the engines driving the digitization of electronics. These two types of semiconductor products work together in digital electronic devices such as digital cellular phones. Other semiconductor products include standard logic, application-specific integrated circuits, reduced instruction-set computing microprocessors, microcontrollers and digital imaging devices. 
"
974,TXN,"On Apr 23, TXN reported first-quarter earnings of 35 cents per share, up from 33 cents in the year-ago period and four cents above expectations. Despite estimate-beating earnings, revenues fell to $3.19 billion from $3.33 billion a year ago. The earnings release marked the second consecutive earnings surprise and the 16th straight quarter the company has met or exceeded expectations. In response to the continued earnings momentum, analysts recently raised their full-year estimates by 16 cents to $1.73, the second upward revision in three months. 
"
975,TXN,"Over the past few quarters, Texas Instruments has been suffering from excess inventory due to changes in the wireless market, where growth was faster for lower-end phones with less-expensive chips. However, officials commented that the market is changing again and demand was increasing for chips in higher-end handsets, resulting in lower inventory levels. 
"
976,TXN,"Supporting the recovery, on May 9 Texas Instruments raised second-quarter guidance. The company now expects earnings of 39 cents to 45 cents per share on revenues of $3.32 billion to $3.6 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of 42 cents per share on revenues of $3.46 billion. 
"
977,TXN,"After a disappointing performance in 2006, TXN has risen by an impressive 28.2% for 2007, well above the S&P500 return of 5.9%. After raising second-quarter guidance, TXN broke through key resistance that had largely held for over five years. The stock is now trading at 52-week highs on stronger-than-average volume. With no resistance to impede the upward trend, look for the positive momentum to continue; however, in the event of a downturn, old resistance should become new support.  
"
978,TXN,"May you live in interesting times is an old Chinese curse, and we are certainly living in interesting times.  The market has been very volatile of late. The yield curve has once again inverted, and unless long rates start climbing in a hurry it is likely to become even more inverted at the end of the month. 
"
979,TXN,"It is now very clear that the Fed will raise rates for the 17th straight meeting at the end of the month. I think they will pause after that, but it is not a certainty by any stretch of the imagination. Inflation has been creeping up, and the Fed clearly does not want to let that Genie out of the bottle. On the other hand, the housing market is clearly slowing, shutting down the housing ATM, and putting pressure on consumer demand.
"
980,TXN,"That is the bad news. 
"
981,TXN,"The good news is that corporate earnings are very strong, and show no signs of weakening. Essentially corporate profits are taking an ever increasing share of the national economy, mostly at the expense of wages and salaries (with the exception of at the very top). As a citizen I find this troubling, as and investor, I find this wonderful. Even as the market swooned over the last month, analysts continued to on balance increase their estimates for both this year and next year. While we are in the slow period, between earnings seasons, so the absolute number of revisions is relatively low, the ratio of increasing to falling estimates has remained very positive at 1.31. 
"
982,TXN,"In the S&P 500, a total of 589 individual estimates for 2006 earnings have been raised in the past month while only 451 have been cut. The positive estimate revisions were widespread, with eight of ten sectors having more increases than cuts. In the Industrial sector by more than a two to one margin, but interestingly the two consumer sectors are also showing signs of life on the revisions front. Ultimately, over the long run, the two most significant variables in the stock market are earnings and interest rates. Most everything else is significant in that it can affect one of those two variables, or is generally short run noise. Interest rates are still low, although have been rising, and earnings look great. 
"
983,TXN,"Among the most significant upward revisions in 2006 estimates this week were:
"
984,TXN,"Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) - Strong demand and high prices for gasoline might be bad for drivers but are good for refining companies. This is why estimates for VLO are being pushed upwards. Five analysts have increased their projections, resulting in a one-month, 3.3% rise in the consensus estimate. Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) - The Wall Street Giant appears to be hitting on all cylinders and reported much better than expected earnings (as did two big competitors, LEH and BSC). Over the last week, the mean estimate for this year is up 1.18%, and it is up 4.45% over the last month. Ten analysts raised their estimates over the last month, with no cuts. For next year, over the last month the mean estimate is up 3.26% as seven estimates have been raised and none cut.  Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) - New technology that will squeeze out twice as many chips per wafer is helping make many analysts more bullish on TXN. Over the last week the mean estimate for this year is up 1.58%, and it is up 1.70% in the last month. A total of 15 analysts raise their numbers for this year while only two cut. 
"
985,TXN,"Among the most significant falling estimates were:
"
986,TXN,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) may be stricken with the winners curse in its takeover of Guidant Corp earlier this year. This week the mean estimate for 2006 fell 3.90%, and is down 6.75% over the last month. This is a continuation of a trend which has seen expectations for the year fall 38.9% over the last three months. The picture is not much better for next year, where the mean estimate is down 4.75% over the last month and down 34.5% over the last three months.DR Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) - Evidence continues to accumulate that the housing market is cooling off rapidly. Over the last week the mean estimate is down 1.87%, roughly matching its decline for the month. For the month, three estimates have been cut and none increased. There have also been two cuts for next year and no increases leading to a 5.65% drop. Radio Shack (RSH) - The mean estimate for this year fell 2.86% this week. Over the last month the estimate is down 5.62% as four estimates were cut and none were raised. RSH margins have been under pressure and it has been losing share to big box consumer electronics stores. For next year, the mean estimate is down 4.34% over the last month due to four cuts and no increases. Expected Growth Rates by Sector
"
987,TXN,"The median firm within the S&P 500 is expected to achieve 11.8% growth this year. Although such growth would represent a decline from the first-quarters 12.8% pace of growth, it is still very healthy. For 2007 the median expected growth rate for S&P 500 firms is 12.9%. The sectors with the highest expected growth rates are Materials (21.1%), Industrials (16.6%) and Energy (16.3%). The slow growing sectors are Consumer Staples (6.1%) and Utilities (7.4%). The picture is much the same when growth is measured on a total net income basis, with the S&P 500 expected to report earnings 13.3% higher in 2006 than in 2005, and a further 10.9% growth in 2007. While the growth rates for the leading sectors are very similar when measured this way rather than by the median, particularly for 2006, the growth rates for the Technology and Health Care sectors are far more anemic for 2006 when measured on a total net income basis.

"
989,TXN,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to the total market capitalization for the sector.
"
990,TXN,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the differences between the size of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
991,TXN,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.2%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.4% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
992,TXN,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.2% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 9.4% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 13.4% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 9.4%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. 
"
993,TXN,"S&P MidCap 400
"
994,TXN,"The median firm in the S&P MidCap 400 is expected to report earnings growth of 10.91% in 2006.

1006,TXN,"Below are some of the stocks recommended by the most  5-Star  analysts in the semiconductor industry.  All of these companies are experiencing better demand for their products and services, so read through these profiles to help get your foot in the door of this thriving industry.  Intel Corporation  (NASDAQ:  INTC ) is the worlds largest chipmaker.  The company supplies the computing and communications industries with chips, boards, and systems building blocks that are integral to computers, servers, and networking and communications products. Its products are offered at various levels of integration and are used by industry members to create advanced computing and communications systems.  Bolstered by improvement in worldwide IT spending, this industry leader recently reported year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in its first quarter.  Revenue in the quarter reached $8.1 billion, which was up +20% from last year.  Excluding items, its earnings per share result in the quarter marked a strong improvement over last year while also topping the consensus by more than +3%.  Intel said it ramped its 90 nm process into high volume with the launch of several new desktop processors, and plans to substantially increase shipments in the second quarter.  The company said it is positioned well for continued growth thanks to the combination of these products in addition to new processors and platform innovations coming over the course of the year.  Intel did forecast a revenue range for the second quarter with a mid-point below analyst expectations, and the company hasnt been growing as rapidly as some if its smaller rivals, but the All Stars are not ready to give up on this industry leader and overall technology bellwethers.  There are currently seven All Star analysts recommending this company.  To further research Intel Corporation, click  INTC .  Texas Instruments  (NYSE:  TXN ) provides DSP and analog technologies to meet the real world signal processing requirements of it customers.  In addition to Semiconductor, the companys businesses include Sensors & Controls and Educational & Productivity Solutions.  The company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and has manufacturing, design, or sales operations in more than 25 countries.  In providing an update on the success of its Broadband Communications Group, Texas Instruments recently stated that it sees 2004 as its year to expand the broadband market with products that take broadband beyond high speed Internet access.  More specifically, the innovative company is looking toward mobility as a key feature for the future.  Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is expected to be one of the most rapidly-growing technology trends in 2004, and Texas Instruments presence in the field is one of the reasons that the company is high on the list of several All Star analysts.    
"
1007,TXN,"Last week, Texas Instruments reported first quarter earnings of 21 cents per share on revenue of $2.94 billion.  That earnings result tripled the year-ago performance while beating the consensus by +5%.  Revenue jumped +34% year-over-year and improved +6% sequentially.  Semiconductor revenue advanced +38% from last year thanks to demand across a broad range of products, especially DSPs and analog used in wireless along with high-performance analog used in a variety of applications.  Texas Instruments said that growth in Semiconductor revenue demonstrated the diversity of its customer base and its product portfolio, as shipments increased across most product lines and end markets.  Tom Engibous, Texas Instruments Chairman, President and CEO, stated, In all, the strength in customer orders and the continuing momentum of TI products lead us to believe that 2004 will be another strong year for our Semiconductor business.  To further research Texas Instruments, click  TXN .  Intersil Corporation  (NASDAQ:  ISIL ) is a leader in the design and manufacture of high performance analog semiconductors. The company's products address three of the industry's fastest growing markets: flat panel displays, optical storage (CD and DVD recordable) and power management.  Intersil started its year on solid ground the other day by reporting first quarter non-GAAP net income of 19 cents per diluted share, which was in-line with the consensus and above the year-ago total of 13 cents.  Net revenue rose by +19% from last year to $137.4 million.  Sales in the quarter were well-balanced across four high growth end markets; namely high-end consumer, computing, communications and industrial, which accounted for 20%, 26%, 27%, and 27% of sales respectively.  Intersil continues to enjoy overall strength in orders and end market demand, and expects its new products and design win successes to result in continued strong sequential growth for the rest of the year.   
"
1008,TXN,"One of the major developments for Intersil in the quarter was the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Xicor.  Xicor designs, develops and markets high performance analog mixed-signal integrated circuits, and Intersil said the acquisition significantly expands its portfolio of high growth, standard analog products.  The combined company will have a highly profitable operating model that generates significant cash.  To further research Intersil Corporation, click  ISIL .  Linear Technology Corporation  (NASDAQ:  LLTC ) was founded in 1981 as a manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits. Linear Technology products include high performance amplifiers, comparators, voltage references, monolithic filters, linear regulators, DC-DC converters, battery chargers, data converters, communications interface circuits, RF signal conditioning circuits, and many other analog functions.  Earlier this month, Linear Technology put together another solid quarterly performance, with net income of $85.5 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, which improved upon last year by +41% while beating the consensus by +8%.  Net sales reached $209.1 million, or +36% better than last years result.  Linear Technologys quarter fulfilled the forecast issued in early February, in which the company said that should strong demand for its products continue, sales and profits in the March quarter should grow about +10% sequentially.  In the quarter sales grew +12% sequentially while profits improved +15%.  The company stated that demand for its products continued to be robust and increased in each major end-market, led by industrial and communications, while also increasing in every major geographical area.  Robert H.

1009,TXN,"When the semiconductor industry rallies like it has over the past several weeks, you have to admit that the market has turned some type of corner.  For it wasn't too long ago that the space was considered the whipping boy of the downtrodden technology industry in the midst of a deeper and longer than expected market swoon.  Now, after three years of scraping the bottom of the barrel, analysts are beginning to direct more attention to semiconductors, and it currently enjoys a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.97 according to Nick Raich's  ""Weekly Earnings and Sector Update.""   That puts it 73rd out of more than 200 industries.  Not bad for an industry that couldn't catch even the smallest break one year ago.  While no one would contend that the semiconductor industry has emerged from the abyss once and for all, the potential of these tiny devices in even a moderately improved market has many analysts believing that we've seen the worst.  
"
1010,TXN,"On June 5th,  Intel Corporation  (NASDAQ:  INTC ), the world's leading chip manufacturer, announced that it was narrowing its revenue guidance range for the second quarter to between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion from its earlier guidance of $6.4 billion to $7 billion.  Therefore, keeping the mid-point of that range steady at $6.7 billion.  Now this is by no means a glowing review that's going to spark a new bull run with semiconductors, but it's a pretty good development for an industry trying to get back on its feet.  Furthermore, given its position as a bellwether in the technology space, Intel can't afford to make outlandish predictions that never reach fruition.  Instead, the announcement that Intel is experiencing stronger-than-expected demand for microprocessors was enough to keep the hope alive.   
"
1011,TXN,"However, for most people familiar with the situation, there's no need for hope.  The need for semiconductors, especially DSLs and analog devices, promise that these issues will make it to the forefront again - sooner or later.  Such devices are found in cell phones, video games, and countless other items that we use everyday.  For some perspective, one only needs to look at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.  Three months ago the index sat below 300, but on June 5th it was nipping at the heels of 400 at 395.02.  That puts it only 79.76 points away from its 52-week high, and 185.67 points above the 52-week low.  Furthermore, the Semiconductor Industry Association recently announced that worldwide sales of semiconductors reached $12.1 billion in the month of April 2003, which is flat from March but +9.7% better than the year-ago April.   
"
1012,TXN,"However, the terrain is still quite rocky for the semiconductor industry, as evidenced recently through  TriQuint Semiconductor 's (NASDAQ:  TQNT ) decision to cut its full-year earnings guidance.  Furthermore, while many businesses blamed SARS for lackluster results, that mysterious disease actually does pose danger to the semiconductor space.  Asia, where the most severe outbreaks of the disease has occurred, just happens to be a hotbed for semiconductors.  China is the world's fastest growing handset market.  In addition, the market remains sluggish despite displaying some signs of strength lately.   
"
1013,TXN,"For the moment however, stability in a giant like Intel is enough to keep spirits up in the space.  The semiconductor industry will once again be a leading player in technology, and analysts want to find the sweet spots as soon as possible.  The innovation and profit potential inherent in semiconductors will keep people's attention.  For investors willing to give this industry another chance, take a look at the four profiles listed below into consideration and see if you can jump on semiconductors before the next run up.  What Do the All Stars Recommend? 
"
1014,TXN,"Even if semiconductors were blowing the doors off expectations and leading the marketplace, investors would need the insight of top analysts to make intelligent investments.  The semiconductor industry can be an extremely confusing space for those who are not technically inclined.  Add to that the troubles that the market has posed and you have the recipe for disaster if taken lightly.  However, with good advice, a semiconductor investment can be a very profitable venture for determined investors.

1015,TXN,"Sometimes it takes a little vision to see the potential of some companies.  The semiconductor industry has certainly been one of those areas.  However, the following four companies don't need much explanation as to why they are high on several All Stars' lists.  Below are the top companies recommended by the most  5-Star  analysts in the semiconductor industry.  Intersil Corporation  (NASDAQ:  ISIL ) is a global semiconductor leader in the design and manufacture of high performance analog and wireless networking solutions.  The company's product portfolios address four of the fastest growing markets, including flat panel displays, optical storage, power management and wireless networking.  On May 28th, Intersil did what it does best; announced an innovative new product, namely the MightyMUX ISL43640 high-performance analog 4:1 bidirectional multiplexer/demultiplexer.  Applications for the new product include high-precision equipment used for medical, communications, and testing.  Intersil reported adjusted net income, excluding amortization of intangibles and other one-time items, of $18.3 million, or 13 cents per diluted share of common stock , for the first quarter 2003, ended April 4, 2003.  That result matched the year-ago result while revenue from ongoing operations increased by +10% from last year to $162.2 million, but declined by -1% sequentially.  However, the first quarter has historically been a weak one for the industry, and Intersil expects to resume sequential revenue growth in the second quarter.  It anticipates revenue growth of +5% to +7% in the quarter to between $172 million and $176 million.  Adjusted earnings per share are expected at 15 cents to 16 cents.  To further research Intersil, click  ISIL .  Integrated Circuit Systems, Inc.  (NASDAQ:  ICST ) is a leader in the design, development and marketing of silicon timing devices for communications, networking, computing and digital multimedia applications.  The company's timing devices have been gaining a lot of steam by penetrating into new markets.  Its success revolves around gaining share over old technology, and Integrated Circuit has been able to do just that.  The company reported fiscal third quarter fully diluted earnings of 22 cents per share on revenue of $60.9 million, which marked advanced of +38% and +14% from last year.  The quarter after Christmas is a seasonally weak one for the industry, and Integrated Circuit's results were below levels from the immediately preceding quarter.  The company plans to continue investing in new products in new market applications and do so at the lowest cost in order to promote future growth.  To further research Integrated Circuit, click  ICST .  Intel Corporation  (NASDAQ:  INTC ) deserves a seat next to the likes of Microsoft, Coca-Cola and General Motors as the undisputed leader of its industry.  So expansive has Intel's reach become, that many analysts and investors view the company as a major bellwether for not only the semiconductor industry, but the overall technology space as well.  Its products are used in desktop components, notebook components, server & workstation components, and networking & communications design components, just to name very few.  Intel's strength comes from not only developing and marketing revolutionary products, but also enhancing them to better serve their customers and to better compete in a difficult market during precarious times.  For example, earlier in June, the company disclosed new performance enhancements for its Intel® Centrino mobile technology-based systems, which includes the availability of a new processor operating at 1.70 GHz, a low-voltage 1.20 GHz processor and the ultra-low-voltage part running at 1.0GHz.  The market was holding its breath and crossing its fingers June 5th, as Intel was scheduled to provide an update for its business outlook of the second quarter.  The company narrowed its previous revenue guidance for the quarter to between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion, instead of $6.4 billion to $7 billion.  Therefore, the mid-point of the range holds, which is still a very welcomed development for an industry still feeling the aftershocks of an economic earthquake.  Intel also said that its Architecture business is trending toward the high end of the normal seasonal pattern, while demand for communications products remains weak.  All other expectations are unchanged.  To further research Intel, click  INTC .  Texas Instruments Inc.  (NYSE:  TXN ) has a foothold in two of the most important engines of the semiconductor space: digital signal processing and analog technologies.  These two types of semiconductor products work together in digital electronic devices.  The company's most recent quarterly report from mid-April contained a lot of firsts for Texas Instruments.  It introduced the world's fastest DSP, the world's first fully functional wireless digital baseband made with 90-nanometer process technology, and the world's first concept design for integrating three different wireless technologies in personal digital devices.  Such products display Texas Instrument's innovation and explain why this company remains at the top of several 5-Star analysts' lists.  That first quarter saw semiconductor revenue grow by +2% sequentially and +23% year-over-year, while overall revenue advanced by +2% and +20% respectively in those two time periods.  The company experienced growth in DSP, Analog and DLP products.  In fact, Texas Instruments made market share gains in DSP and Analog throughout 2002.  Orders for the first quarter improved by +10% sequentially and +20% from last year, as diluted earnings reversed a year-ago and sequential loss to come in at 7 cents per diluted share.  Texas Instruments has been around for a while, but continues to display its effectiveness in the semiconductor space.  To further research Texas Instruments, click  TXN .

1017,TXN,"Texas Instruments' (TXN  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.09 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings increased 24% year over year but decreased 14% sequentially.The above earnings per share figure do not include 75 cents in tax-related expenses primarily due to the recently passed tax reform act.Revenues of $3.75 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $11 million, up 9.8% on a year-over-year basis but down 9.8% sequentially. However, it came ahead of the guided range of $3.57-$3.87 billion, driven by strong demand in the auto and industrial markets.Following fourth-quarter results, shares fell 7.01% in after-hours trading possibly on slower-than-expected revenue growth due to softer demand for its chips used in communications equipment. Also, the sluggish top-line outlook could be one of the reasons for the decline in the share price.Also, Texas Instruments’ shares have rallied 47.9% in the last 12-month period, underperforming its industry’s growth of 53.2%.Segment wise, growth of analog and embedded processing applications business was strong. These typically yield a more stable business as well as strong margins. The Other segment declined year over year.Texas Instruments continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.Internally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while expanding its business.The company remains focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages. Notably, free cash flow in 2017 was $4.67 billion or 31.2% of revenues, reflecting an increase of 14% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, we remain optimistic about TI’s compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. However, risks associated with a high debt level persist.Let’s see what the numbers say.Revenues in DetailAnalog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated 68%, 24% and 8% of quarterly revenues, respectively.Analog, which includes Power, Signal Chain and High Volume products, was up 11% from the year-ago quarter to $2.5 billion. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong performance in product lines — power and signal chain.The Embedded Processing segment, which includes Connected Microcontrollers and Processors, was up 20% year over year to $896 million. The year-over-year growth was driven by stronger sales across both the product lines — processors and connected microcontrollers.The Other segment, which includes DLPs, custom ASICs and calculators, was down 16% year over year to $319 million. The decline was primarily due to custom ASIC and royalties moving to other income and expenses beginning in the first quarter of 2017.Margins Texas Instruments’ gross margin of 65.1% was up 54 basis points (bps) sequentially and 259 bps from the year-ago quarter. The company’s gross margin has been improving consistently as more production shifts to its 300 mm line.Operating expenses of $877 million were up 1.0% sequentially and 8.9% from last year. Operating margin was 41.7%, down 176 bps sequentially and 278 bps from the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowCash and short-term investments balance was $4.5 billion compared with $3.4 billion in the prior quarter.The company generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations, spending $231 million on capex, $706 million on share repurchases and $611 million on cash dividends.Texas Instruments is one of the few technology companies that return a significant amount of cash to investors. In 2017, the company returned approximately 4.7 billion of cash through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.At quarter end, TI had $3.6 billion in long-term debt and $500 million in short-term debt.GuidanceThe company provided guidance for the first quarter.It expects revenues between $3.49 billion and $3.79 billion (down 3% sequentially at the mid-point). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the upcoming quarter is pegged at $3.64 billion.Earnings for the quarter are expected to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.17 per share.

1019,TXN,"Tuesday, January 23, 2018Sandwiched in between Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) strong quarterly earnings report after the bell yesterday and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) and United Air Lines (UAL  -  Free Report) following today’ close, we see a fresh group of Q4 earnings hitting the tape.

1020,TXN,"Shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) surged nearly 3% to hit a new all-time high on Monday, just hours before the streaming giant is scheduled to report its Q4 earnings.Netflix saw its stock price pop 2.90% in morning trading to touch $227 per share, as investors clamor to grab the stock at a price many must assume will look like a steal in the near future. Over the last year, the streaming company has bolstered its original content offerings in preparation for what is likely to be an even tougher battle for subscribers in 2018. Netflix reportedly spent $6 billion to launch 30 new original shows in 2017.Netflix expects to up its spending in 2018 to $8 billion, as the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Hulu, and soon Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) compete more fiercely for subscribers in the over-the-top streaming market. Netflix now has 88 original scripted series, while Amazon and Hulu claim 28 and 17 respectively. Time Warner’s  HBO boasts 21 shows.Looking ahead to this afternoon’s report, Netflix is expected to see its earnings skyrocket 173% year-over-year to hit $0.41 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. On top of this massive bottom line growth projection, the company is expected to post Q4 sales of $3.28 billion, which would mark a 32% jump from the year-ago period.Subscriber growth is another key metric inventors will look for when the company reports after Monday’s closing bell. In the third-quarter, Netflix added 5.3 million subscribers to bump its total to 109.25 million subscribers from over 190 countries.Netflix has announced that it expects to add 6.30 million new subscribers in its fourth quarter. The company now projects it will close fiscal 2017 with a total of 115.55 million subscribers. On top of user growth, the streaming power would also like investors to focus on its international margin expansion.Investors should note that Netflix failed to match or top earnings estimates in the last two quarters after doing so for over three years in a row. Still, before today’ climb, Netflix stock price had jumped by nearly 13% over the last four weeks and 59% in the last 52-weeks.Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and will help kick off a big week for tech giants, with Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) also set to report earnings in the coming days (also read: Upcoming Tech Earnings Reports to Watch: NFLX, TXN, INTC).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1024,TXN,"Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) displayed its latest chipset, designed for high-resolution headlight systems at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).The new DLP chipset is first of its kind that provides full programmability and highest resolution. Its resolution is 10,000 times more than all existing driving beam (ADB) technologies. It can work with any light source, be it LED or laser illumination.Texas’ lead customers have already started trying out the DLP5531-Q1 chipset, which is expected to be widely available in the second half of 2018. We believe that the new DLP chipset will see strong demand in the future from car manufacturers and Tier-1 suppliers as it will improve the driving experience. With the technology, users can control light distribution on the road. The chipset maximizes brightness, reduces the dazzle from oncoming traffic and reflections of traffic signage.Notably, shares of Texas Instruments have gained 47.9% year to date, substantially outperforming the 21.6% rally of the S&P 500.ADAS Presents Strong Growth OpportunitiesThe new DLP chipset technology will address future communication requirements in autonomous and self-driving vehicles. We believe that demand for semiconductor content in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) will increase in the future and this new technology will help the company to boost its revenues.Given its ability to partially or fully dim individual pixels, car manufacturers and tier-1 suppliers can create a channel that will communicate with drivers, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road.Texas’ management believes that the automotive sector has strong growth prospects. In fact, the company has been focusing on the automotive market from a long time. The company has been investing significantly in research and development of automotive products as the market is expected to witness CAGR of 5.8% between 2016 and 2022 to reach $48.78 billion, per marketsandmarkets.com.The growth is expected to continue as there is an increase demand for electronic content in cars.

1025,TXN,"Market pundits have set their eyes on Corporate America as it is gearing up to report Q4 earnings results later this week. While the broader market is expected to face a period of consolidation, bank majors may feel the heat due to adjustments in values of deferred tax assets and liabilities and charges taken against earnings for repatriation.The energy sector is poised to report highest earnings growth among all sectors, with technology, Industrial products and materials contributing the maximum. Thus, investing in fundamentally solid stocks from these sectors is a well thought-out strategy as these are likely to make the most of the Q4 earnings season. Here, we should bear in mind that better-than-expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price.Market Consolidation on the AnvilOf late, all major bourses have been hitting a series of record highs, with the S&P 500 crossing the coveted 2,700 mark for the first time this year. But, this uptrend may follow a fresh period of consolidation in the fourth-quarter earnings season.And why not? In each of the first three quarters of 2017, the S&P 500 climbed around 5% heading into the earnings season. As the earnings seasons proceeded and companies started beating estimates, the market consolidated. Thus, a similar sort of market consolidation is expected this reporting cycle. After all, the index had already posted gains of 6.1% during the fourth quarter, which marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for the broader index.S&P 500’s Pre-Earnings Price PerformanceQuarterPrice Performance (Pre-Earnings Season)Q1 20175.1%Q2 20175.0%Q3 20175.3%(Source: CFRA)Tax Overhaul Effects – Banks First On the DocketThe Q4 earnings results are expected to be quite disorderly, especially that of big banks. Lowering of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% will now force banking behemoths to re-measure the value of their deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover, one-time charges for repatriating overseas earnings need to be considered. Total Q4 earnings of major banks are expected to be down 6% from the same period last year on 5.3% higher revenues.However, consumers are feeling pretty good about themselves, with their confidence index remaining at historically high levels. Their finances have improved based on household debt service payments, as a percentage of disposable income. This in turn reduces the loan default risks, which may bode well for banks. Further, it gives consumers provision to take more debt.Needless to say, financial stocks have had a solid run over the last few months, buoyed by optimism surrounding the rise in interest rates.

1026,TXN,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT. Vishay markets its portfolio to manufacturers of everything from biometric monitoring systems to fitbands and smart appliances.VSH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is a hot momentum play, with shares adding more than 10% in the past four weeks to test new 52-week highs. Analysts have also become more bullish on the company’s earnings outlook, with full-year EPS estimates improving nearly 36% in the trailing quarter. Bottom LineThe Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world.  And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.
