9,HPE,"The coalition of companies jockeying with Amazon.com (AMZN) for a lucrative Pentagon computing contract is far bigger than previously reported, signaling added heft behind efforts to keep the work from going exclusively to the world's largest cloud services provider.SAP America (SAP), General Dynamics' (GD) CSRA unit, Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among at least nine companies that have coordinated their opposition to the government awarding the contract to a single provider, according to emails obtained by Bloomberg News. The Amazon cloud services business leads the market and is widely perceived to be the front-runner.The most active members of the coalition trying to fend off an Amazon cloud win are Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) and International Business Machines (IBM), according to two people familiar with the matter. Other companies involved include Dell Technologies (DVMT) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Bloomberg has reported.SAP and the others aren't considered top contenders for the contract. But the companies are banding together to fight the Pentagon's plans to award it to a single bidder. They're concerned it could disrupt their established business model for obtaining military contracts.The Pentagon announced a winner-take-all competition for the multibillion-dollar cloud services contract in March.It has since paused the bidding process for the project. The reason is it would transition massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. The government has said it still plans to award the contract by September.Representatives for SAP, Red Hat, CSRA and VMware declined to comment.The interest is widespread among technology companies in pressing the Pentagon to change its procurement approach. For one, it indicates the importance of the lucrative contract. Providers are struggling to catch up to Amazon cloud. The same is true for firms that sell software and other technology to federal agencies.Companies have begun conversations about jointly bidding for the contract known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, sources say.The Pentagon has tapped Dana Deasy to be its new chief information officer to oversee the contract. Members of the coalition welcome the move, sources say.""Dana Deasy is a highly professional, seasoned, transformational CIO who will lead the DoD's technology efforts with distinction,"" Oracle's Senior Vice President Ken Glueck said in a statement.Deasy's comments before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in May pleased the coalition, sources say. While he didn't address the JEDI contract specifically, he talked about the importance of using multiple cloud providers.Deasy previously worked as global chief information officer for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) at a time when the company made major investments to transition to a public cloud. He held similar positions at the North American unit of General Motors (GM), Tyco International and Siemens' (SIEGY) North American operation.""Under Deasy's leadership, the department will gradually consolidate its disparate networks, data centers and cloud efforts to manage them at the enterprise level,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement Monday.To advance their agenda, the tech allies have been strategizing by email and phone. They've courted trade and mainstream media and lobbying lawmakers, defense officials and the White House, Bloomberg has reported.The competitive cloud coalition has notched some wins. The House committee in charge of federal spending approved a Defense Department funding bill this month. It would halt funding for the contract until the Pentagon submits a strategy to sustain competition and use multiple cloud-service providers.It is the third attempt by lawmakers to influence the process. The full House is scheduled to take up the spending measure this week.

10,HPE,"Chipmakers are closing out the seventh week of a rally begun in the first week of May, and they've helped power the Nasdaq to its new highs. The gains have been broad, although some were left behind (Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Tower Semiconductors (TSEM)). Others, like Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), remain deep in long-term corrections.Qorvo (QRVO) broke out on Thursday, but remained below long-term resistance near 86. Switzerland-based STMicroelectronics (STM) cleared a buy point in what was maybe not quite a breakout, but significant because it snapped resistance that had capped STM's progress since November.Multiple attempts to break that resistance made STM's base a bit of a puzzle. Possible buy points occurred at 25.40, 25.22 and, finally, a cup-with-handle buy point at 24.62.STM cleared the 24.62 entry June 5, right after it announced its chips were being used in the Alcatel 3V smartphone, just introduced on the European market by China's TCL Communication.STM is a broad-range chipmaker that counts Apple (AAPL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), China's Huawei and Western Digital (WDC) among its more than 1,000 customers.The stock's 4.4% gain on June 4 rode volume that was 51% above its 50-day average, well above the 40% minimum needed to qualify as a breakout.But investors may have been hesitant. The breakout move left shares far below the stock's commanding resistance. And STM had posted gap-up moves past buy points on Jan. 18 and March 21. Both rose only briefly above 25.On June 6, STM took out the 25.22 buy point. Volume was only 27% above average. But the stock had pressed to a new high. After a four-day consolidation, shares broke decisively above both the buy point and the 25 resistance level. Shares on Friday remained well within the chipmaker's buy range, which runs through 26.48.For those who bought at the 24.62 level, the stock is now technically extended.In either case, the base pattern begun in January undercut a prior, two-month base. STM briefly broke out above that base's 24.90 buy point in January. Then it pulled back more than 8% and triggered the automatic sell rule. In fact, it pulled back a total of 19% from its breakout high. That was enough to undercut the two-month base — a move which resets the stock's base count.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSTM had run up 334% in the 16 months before starting its prior base. So although it was not late stage, a reset gives some assurance that shares are not due for immediate pressure from profit taking.RELATED:As Tesla, GM Rally On EV, Self-Driving Hopes These Stocks May Be NextChip Stocks On The Rise: ASML, STMicro, OthersThese 3 Top Stocks Had Strong Moves Into Buy Zones TodayPain For All?

24,HPE,"Dell Technologies (DVMT), the computer and data storage giant,  is considering a range of options to raise cash and reduce a heavy debt load. Those options include an initial public offering or possibly purchasing the remainder of VMware[ticker symb=VMW] that Dell doesn't own.Dell is rethinking its structure three years after it, as a privately held PC company, merged with data storage leader EMC in a $67 billion deal. The Dell Technologies board plans to meet, possibly next week, to discuss strategic options, according to people familiar with the matter, first reported by Bloomberg. Dell may also decide not to make any such moves at this time, reports also said.According to the Bloomberg article, Michael Dell is considering bringing Dell Technologies public with an initial public offering.The portfolio of Dell Technologies includes PCs and servers, workstations, displays and gaming PCs, a cybersecurity unit and a cloud platform. Dell's deal making has added a larger debt load to the balance sheet. The company currently has about $51 billion of debt, according to S&P Capital IQ. Raising cash could help the company reduce a heavy debt load or further expand operations.Shares of VMware, a publicly traded cloud infrastructure and virtualization software company that was majority owned by EMC, have gained more than 62% in the past 12 months and were up 12%, near 153.90 during afternoon trading on the stock market today.

25,HPE,"Extreme Networks (EXTR), the one-time highflier from the dot-com era that crashed and disappeared from radar screens for more than a decade, is now one of the top stocks in one of the market's strongest-performing industry groups.X After a second attempt at reinventing itself in 2015, Extreme is now ranked No. 2 by IBD Stock Checkup — based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance trends — in the Computer-Networking group, which is ranked No. 6 among 197 industry groups.Extreme's resurgence began after it installed board member Ed Meyercord as chief executive. Meyercord pared down the company, narrowing its focus and stabilizing its finances, before beginning to build it up piece by piece.""They decided the acquisition strategy was the right strategy,"" said D.A. Davidson Co. analyst Mark Kelleher, even after high hopes for its $180 million acquisition of Enterasys Networks in 2013 were largely dashed.Now, Extreme has shown that it has the right team in place to execute on its vision. It's pushing past the $1 billion annual revenue threshold and is throwing off enough cash to make key technology acquisitions that have broadened out its product set.Extreme bills itself as the only pure play end-to-end enterprise networking company with software-driven solutions that go from the wireless edge to the data center. It's the clear No. 3 in the enterprise network market, behind the dominant leader Cisco Systems (CSCO), and No. 2 Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and growing faster than the mature market in which it competes.That position doesn't just reflect its third-place revenue share, still only about 4% of the market, but also its ranking by Gartner, which puts Extreme a close third behind Cisco and HP — and well ahead of the rest — both in its ability to execute and the completeness of its product vision.Gartner's September report also highlighted Extreme's ""strong customer service through a 100% insourced service and support team.""Meyercord said on a Nov. 7 fiscal first-quarter earnings call that Extreme is leveraging its recognition from Gartner, which he called ""one of the most relied-upon resources for enterprise customers"" and ""the best marketing we have,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Extreme is ""taking share from our larger competitors,"" Chief Financial Officer Drew Davies told a Needham networking and security conference on Nov. 14. He highlighted business wins in the past couple of weeks, including the Wynn Boston Harbor resort and a competitive bidding win at Raytheon.In its latest acquisition, which closed in October, Extreme bought Brocade's data center switching, routing and analytics assets for $55 million in cash. The deal is on track to add $230 million in revenue for Extreme in the first year.Broadcom (AVGO), which acquired the rest of Brocade, was willing to part with that portion of its business so as not to compete against the networking vendors such as Extreme that use Broadcom chipsets to power their switches, D.A. Davidson's Kelleher told Investor's Business Daily.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Extreme Networks were whipsawed in a volatile week for technology stocks. The upshot from a technical perspective is that the stock will have to work on a new base with a 14.44 buy point, the point at which an investor has the best opportunity for significant near-term gains. A leading stock in a leading industry group can be a recipe for a winning stock if bought at the right time.Kelleher said Extreme's strategy to build a complete enterprise networking offering by putting together pieces such as Brocade's data center business makes a lot of sense.Because of various mergers — and, in the case of Avaya, a bankruptcy — Extreme has been able to pick up ""all of these embedded assets that weren't being optimized,"" Kelleher said.Kelleher expects there will be more such acquisition opportunities ahead, though he expects Extreme to take about six months to digest its latest purchase.In July, Extreme strengthened its competitive position when it closed on its purchase of Avaya's networking assets, which it won with a $100-million bid. Extreme said the deal would add to earnings and produce $200 million in annual revenue.In October 2016, Extreme finalized its purchase of the wireless local area network business of Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), which is expected to generate more than $115 million in fiscal 2018 revenue.Those three acquisitions have essentially doubled the total addressable market opportunity for Extreme from $8 billion to $16 billion.""(Extreme's) strong (first) quarter was driven by the better than expected results of the Zebra and Avaya transactions,"" wrote Needham analyst Alex Henderson. ""The new employees are delivering better-than-expected productivity.""Henderson said Extreme's staff is now unencumbered by the constraints of their prior company structures. In Henderson's view, the new Extreme is proving through the ""exceptionally smooth integration of the Zebra acquisition"" that the company can execute on its acquisition strategy.On the fiscal first-quarter earnings call, Meyercord called the Brocade deal an ""important piece of the puzzle that helps us complete our enterprise networking solutions portfolio,"" enabling it to meet the large-scale data-center needs of Fortune 500 customers.Extreme now has 30,000 customers, after a picking up a large base of blue-chip clients via acquisitions, and one of its keys to growth will be cross-selling opportunities. Gartner says government and education have been Extreme's main vertical markets, but that customers in retail, hospitality, manufacturing and healthcare also ""should consider Extreme.""Henderson noted that Extreme more than doubled the number of $1 million-plus deals in its past two quarters.Outside of acquisitions, Extreme has been generating positive organic revenue growth in the low-single digits in recent quarters, an improvement after the retrenchment in 2015, and analysts see some potential for further improvement. Yet, Extreme's target market is only expected to grow an annualized 2% in coming years, so acquisitions and market-share gains will have to be growth drivers.For the December quarter, Extreme offered revenue guidance of $236 million to $246 million, well above the $224 million consensus. The guidance for EPS of 10 cents-14 cents was below the 18-cent estimate, but analysts have downplayed that as a function of timing of the Brocade deal.The quarterly results won't include October, always a relatively big month for the Brocade data-center business. That means Extreme will get more of a cost bump than a revenue bump for this one quarter.Shares of Extreme were down Friday by 0.9% to 12.74.RELATED:Extreme Networks In Buy Range, With NFL Wi-Fi Season In Full-SwingWhy This Networking Firm's Shares Jumped To A Two-Month HighEarnings Beat, Buying Spree Are Driving This 'Extreme' BreakoutStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

58,HPE,"As former General Electric (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt has emerged in the lead to become the new chief of Uber, his role in transforming a century-old manufacturing company into a digital-industrial powerhouse is seen as making him an ideal fit for the ride-sharing service in deep need of a cultural makeover.XBesides infusing each of GE's core businesses with technology, Immelt served as a diplomat and statesman for GE, while slimming down the conglomerate, driving GE's push into China 15 years ago, and fostering a noted compliance culture, said Deane Dray, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets.""It's an opportunity for Jeff Immelt to provide that 'celebrity CEO' (cachet) but from the standpoint of a known, high-caliber executive,"" Dray told IBD. ""GE has made such a big investment in its digital capability, the Predix platform. I can't help thinking that is a factor in why he is being considered"" for the role at Uber.The search for a new head at Uber follows the forced resignation of CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick in June, following months of upheaval at the tech startup. Among other troubles, a former Uber engineer accused the company of widespread sexism, an Uber board member resigned after a sexist remark, and Benchmark, one of Uber's biggest investors, is suing Kalanick for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.With a ""bro"" culture seen as a key issue, top Silicon Valley women like Facebook (FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg and former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Meg Whitman were seen as possible Uber CEOs.But instead, a majority of the Uber board is coalescing around Immelt, sources told Recode, and the two other executives in the running are also men.Meanwhile, one of Uber's earliest investors has proposed another top pick for CEO: Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. A pact between Tesla and Uber would give Uber the autonomous driving technology it badly needs and expand Tesla's presence in many more markets, angel investor Jason Calacanis said according to CNBC.Uber told IBD on Monday that it was not commenting on the CEO search. GE did not respond to a request for comment.Shares of GE dipped 0.4% on the stock market today, posting a fresh 52-week low of 24.32 intraday, and Tesla dropped 3.6% to 335.00, negating its cup-with-handle base and 370.10 buy point.While Immelt has stepped down as CEO at GE, he remains chairman until the end of the year. John Flannery, a 30-year GE veteran, on Aug. 1 took over as the industrial giant's first new CEO in 16 years.During his tenure, Immelt deepened ties with Silicon Valley, divesting core businesses such as financial services while sharpening the tech focus across the industrial conglomerate's business lines.However, investors grew disenchanted with the overall strategy and slumbering stock, leading to the exit of the man widely credited with transforming the company.RELATED:Your Parents' Car Culture Is Nearly Dead: Here's Why

The company said it added more than 875 customers in the quarter, bringing the total to 7,051.Among the negatives, as seen by analysts, Nutanix is facing increased competition from NetApp (NTAP), Cisco Systems (CSCO) (IBD), VMware (VMW) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). Analysts also noted that Nutanix is having to deal with higher DRAM-chip prices but is maneuvering through that challenge with software enhancements.For the current quarter, Nutanix guided revenue in the range to $240 million to $250 million, an increase in the range of 44% to 50% from the year-ago quarter and above the consensus estimate of $231 million. It also forecast an adjusted loss of 37 cents, matching the consensus estimate.RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg maintained an outperform rating on Nutanix and price target of 34.""Results were strong, with large deals again at record levels,"" Hedberg wrote in a research note to clients.Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron maintained an outperform rating on Nutanix and price target of 34.""Overall execution continued to improve with sales productivity rebounding, strong North America and international traction, and record large-deal activity,"" Kidron wrote in a research note to clients.RELATED:Pure Storage Zooms; Price Target Raised On Strong Earnings Report

69,HPE,"Arista Networks (ANET) stock fell Monday as analysts debated the impact of an International Trade Commission judge's ruling that the cloud-computing network gear maker infringed on two more Cisco Systems (CSCO) patents.The ITC judge's ruling is subject to full commission review, which is expected to be completed by April 9, 2017.Cisco prevailed in a similar patent case in June, but Arista has continued to ship products to customers amid an ongoing legal battle.""This outcome was largely expected, and Arista must now go through many of the same steps it has gone through with (the June patent case),"" said Tim Long, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, in a report.Founded in 2004, Arista early on targeted banks that needed high-speed switching for equities trading. Arista began focusing on cloud data centers in 2008. Much of Arista's senior management team came from Cisco.Cisco and Arista are also involved in a copyright infringement trial in federal court in San Jose, Calif., that's expected to end next week.Arista stock finished trading down 1.4% to 93.14 on the stock market today. Arista stock is up 18% in 2016 but has dropped 7% from an intraday high of 98.79 set on Dec. 8. Cisco was up marginally to 30.17.IBD'S TAKE: Arista is No. 17 on the IBD 50, a screen of leading growth stocks.

71,HPE,"Without its stellar group of ""cloud titan"" customers, network gear maker Arista Networks' (ANET) rise in the data center switching market vs. goliath Cisco Systems (CSCO) might never have happened.Now it's poised to make an even stronger move in the market, provided it can hang on to those customers, the likes of which include Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL), eBay (EBAY)  and Yahoo (YHOO).These tech behemoths all buy speedy network switches and software for use in data centers that provide cloud computing services from Arista, even though industry leader Cisco now holds nearly 60% of the data center-switching market. Many of those companies will rely on Arista more as they crave faster network speeds to whisk content and apps to mobile devices or, in Netflix's case, stream high-quality video.While some of Arista's blue-chip clients are now developing their own switching hardware, a development that has some analysts worried, others say Arista's software expertise gives it an edge as the market evolves.""Arista is gaining share by focusing on the needs of a very demanding set of data center customers. They have a big presence with (web) hyperscalers, the cloud titans,"" said Brad Casemore, an analyst at research firm IDC.Arista had about 8.4% of the market in slower Ethernet switching in 2015, but its share is double that in higher-speed 40- and 100-gigabit sectors. Consequently, Arista's share of the overall market is close to 10%, Casemore estimates. IDC expects demand for 40- and 100-gigabit switches to boom through 2020 and for Arista to grow along with that.It's all helped Arista see its revenue jump 35% in the first nine months of 2016 to $801 million. Its stock has nearly doubled since reaching a low in early February. But shares dipped 1.4% to 93.14 Monday after a judge ruled that the company had infringed on patents held by Cisco.When it was founded in 2004, Arista first went after banks that needed high-speed switching for equities trading. Four years later, it began focusing on cloud data centers, says Chief Executive Jayshree Ullal.""When we spotted the cloud opportunity we were almost too early for it,"" Ullal told IBD in an interview. ""What we saw was the rise of cloud companies, the proliferation of mobile devices and new cloud applications that were very different than enterprise applications, very distributed, and that required a network that could aggregate information in a real-time fashion.""Arista's Ethernet switches speed up communications between computer servers packed into the data centers, and interconnect racks of servers in different buildings so they behave like one data center. While Arista has feasted on cloud networking, some of its internet customers — notably Facebook — have been developing their own data center technology.Facebook and Google have pioneered open-source software concepts in data centers. They lowered data center costs by running software on so-called ""white-box"" servers, built by lesser-known suppliers from Asia.One worry is that cloud builders may use contract manufacturers to make their own network switches — basically servers with built-in, high-speed communications functions — at the expense of Arista, Cisco and other suppliers. Ullal says Arista isn't worried about the white box trend.""We're a software company,"" she said. ""We could run on anybody's white box if customers wanted it. We don't view what Facebook or other companies do as a threat, we see it as an opportunity and as collaboration.""Some analysts aren't so sure. When Facebook, Arista's second-biggest customer behind Microsoft, in November announced ""Backpack,"" its first 100-gigabit switch, it set off alarm bells among industry watchers at Goldman Sachs.""Facebook believes it now has a full road-map to building a data center,"" a report from the investment bank said. ""We view these developments as a long-term negative for data center switching vendors Arista, Cisco, and Juniper (Networks) (JNPR).""IDC says original design manufacturer, or ODM, switch makers — contract manufacturers of white-box switches — had 12.3% of the 100-gigabit data center market in 2015, third in market share behind Cisco and Arista. Players in that market include Cumulus, Pluribus Networks, and Big Switch.Peter Christy, an analyst at 451 Research, says it's a ""fact of life"" that Google, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook design and engineer their own massive data centers. Microsoft is less focused on white-box switch replacement, analysts say.""They have unique networks,"" Christy told IBD. ""It's a real problem for the switching industry that the highest growth segment is increasingly being (sourced) internally.""But Mark Moskowitz, analyst at Barclays, says worries over Facebook's switching venture and those of others may be overblown.""While cloud service providers from time-to-time experiment with homegrown switching applications, such initiatives are not to fully displace the merchant suppliers,"" Moskowitz said in a report. ""In certain cases, these homegrown efforts are designed to influence the technology road maps of the merchant suppliers.""Citigroup analyst Stanley Kovler said in a report that Arista's risk of market share loss due to the white-box trend is ""negligible as Arista's products are primarily in the core, complex part of the data center.""IBD'S TAKE: Arista shares broke out above 90 in late November and have reached new all-time highs in several sessions since then. The company is at the top of the class among networking companies in performance. For a stock checkup on Arista, check here.IDC's Casemore says the white box trend as well as competition from China-based Huawei in switching are reasons why Arista is pushing into the $13 billion network router market, taking on Cisco and Juniper. Routers whisk data from data centers across the internet. Arista is using a new Broadcom chip called ""Jericho"" in router products, now in trials.Arista, which has over 4,000 switching customers, aims to have over 100 routing customers by mid-2017. Morgan Stanley, in a report, estimates that Arista could garner $200 million to $300 million in revenue from router products by 2020.""Network design is changing. It's getting more difficult to distinguish switching from routing,"" Ullal said. ""This is a natural opportunity for us, but it's not going to happen overnight.""Arista, which raised $226 million in its 2014 initial public offering, now is on track to easily top $1 billion in 2016 sales. Barclay's Moskowitz says it could hit $2 billion by 2020 based on share gains in the data center switching market alone.Aside from its push into the routing market, Arista aims to target the corporate market through a new alliance with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE). And, it aims to grow revenue from government customers as well.Family trusts formed by co-founders Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton hold about 27% of outstanding shares, while Arista's top 10 shareholders own nearly 67% of the company's float, says Thomson Reuters.To keep its edge, Arista Networks has been spending 20% to 22% of sales on research and development.""Networking has been written off as being mature, but Arista is redefining networking for our customers,"" Ullal said. ""The company was really built by engineers for engineers.""

87,HPE,"Having skin in the game matters. Especially with mutual fund managers. Funds with at least one manager who has a lot of their own money invested in the fund are more likely to outperform than funds whose managers have little or none of their cash on the line, according to a recent report by Russel Kinnel, director of fund research for Morningstar Inc.Among the 100 largest mutual funds tracked by the research firm, 56 have at least one manager who has more than $500,000 of his own money invested in the fund. Thirty-one of the 50 — or 62% — with the best average annual gains over the five years through Oct. 31 have at least one manager with more than $500,000 invested in the fund.Top performers with more than $500,000 of their own skin in the game include $43.6 billion Vanguard Health Care (VGHCX), $46 billion Vanguard Primecap (VPMCX), $32.6 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth (TRBCX), $55.8 billion Dodge & Cox Stock Fund (DODGX) and $35.6 billion Fidelity Growth Company (FDGRX).Their average annual returns over the past five years range from Fidelity Growth Company's 14.30% to Vanguard Health Care's 16.82%.In the same period, the S&P 500's yearly pace was 13.57%.What stocks are driving these funds?

Earnings per share rallied 7% in the third quarter, rebounding from two straight quarters of declining EPS growth. The company reports fiscal Q4 earnings Nov. 22. The consensus of analysts is that EPS will rise 13%.Jeffries Group raised its price target to 27 this past week.FedEx (FDX) has been a strong performer for T. Rowe Blue Chip Growth.

The tiers are zero, $1 to $10,000, $10,001 to $50,000, $50,001 to $100,000, $100,001 to $500,000, $500,001 to $1 million, and $1,000,001 and above.Three of Vanguard Primecap's managers had $1,000,001 or more invested in their fund: Theo Kolokotrones, Joel Fried and Alfred Mordecai.

The managers work for Pasadena, Calif.-based Primecap Management, which Vanguard has hired as subadvisor for the fund.T. Rowe Price Blue Chip's Larry Puglia had $1,000,001 or more of his own bucks battling side-by-side with his shareholders' money.The Dodge & Cox fund had six managers with $1,000,001 or more at risk: Wendell Birkhofer, Bryan Cameron, Charles Pohl, Diana Strandberg, David Hoeft and Steven Voorhis.In addition, managers Philippe Barret and Kathleen McCarthy had personally anted up $100,001 to $500,000.Fidelity Growth Company's Steven Wymer was also in the top tier, above $1 million.As of Aug. 31, 1,036 funds had at least one manager who had more than $1 million of his own money on the line in his fund.That's about 13% of the 8,025 funds tracked by Morningstar.The more of their own money that managers invest, the better their funds do. Forty-seven percent of funds — with a manager who had more than $1 million invested over the past five years — outperformed their respective benchmarks.That success rate falls to 43% for funds whose managers have $100,001 to $500,000 invested.And it falls further, to 35%, for funds whose managers have none of their own money invested in the portfolio.Among just stock funds, those whose managers' personal exposure was in the top tier had a 39% success rate. Just 29% of stock funds with no manager's skin in the game outperformed.""It pays to invest with managers who invest in their funds,"" Morningstar's Kinnel said.RELATED:Introducing IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards

88,HPE,"Analysts expect Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to provide fiscal 2017 guidance at its investor day on Tuesday, with the strategic direction of its core business a key question following the planned spinoff of its services and software businesses.If Hewlett Packard Enterprise goes shopping, an Oppenheimer analyst speculates that Arista Networks (ANET), a maker of computer networking gear, would make a good acquisition.Arista Networks has been grabbing share in the data center market from HPE rival Cisco Systems (CSCO).IBD'S TAKE: HPE stock has dropped below its 50-day moving average, not a good sign. Its Composite Rating of 88 out of a possible 99 is respectable but the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks has higher-rated companies, with Arista Networks at No. 16.""The companies (HPE and Arista) have already partnered and are very familiar with each other, making a combination easier,"" said Ittai Kidron, an Oppenheimer analyst, in a research report. ""Arista's ongoing litigation with Cisco could complicate a potential acquisition near term, as could Arista's market cap.""That said, by mid-2017, Arista could be in a position to have its (patent) workarounds certified by U.S. Customs, moderating the litigation risk.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise in May said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. Then in September, HPE said it would spin off its software business and merge it with U.K.-based Micro Focus International.""HPE's balance sheet would boast a significant net cash balance of over $9 billion after the completion of the two spinoffs. An acquisition would likely come above HPE's stated 'sweet spot,' but Arista's value to HPE is undeniable,"" Kidron wrote.Some observer speculate HPE, with its remaining server, data storage, and wireless networking businesses, could be taken private.Jim Suva, an analyst at Citigroup, says the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be much more focused.At the analysts day, ""we expect detailed strategic discussion with respect to the enterprise hardware group,"" said Suva in a research note. ""While there are many moving parts to the business with divestitures, accelerated restructuring and separation payments, we believe investors are underappreciating the free cash flow generation.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock was down more than 1.1% at the close on the stock market today, at 21.27, a one-month low. Arista stock was up a fraction, near 81, following four straight down days after touching a 14-month high of 87.62.RELATED:HPE To Spin Off Software Unit, Slims Down As Dell Bulks UpCisco Data Storage Acquisition Might Help Vs.

89,HPE,"Chipmaker Intel (INTC) got an assist from improved personal computer sales in the third quarter, but its high-margin data center chip business disappointed.Intel stock fell 5.9% to 35.51 on the stock market today, after the No. 1 chipmaker posted Q3 results late Tuesday.At least seven Wall Street analysts cut their price targets on Intel stock on the news.IBD'S TAKE: Intel stock cleared a buy point at 36.03 last month, but threatened to close below the pivot on Wednesday. Shares fell below their 50-day moving average line on Wednesday for the first time since late June. For more information on Intel stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Intel lowered its sales growth target for its data center chip unit to high single digits for the full year. That's down from projections for midteens growth at the start of the year.Intel's data center group accounts for about half the company's operating profit.For Q3, Intel reported $4.5 billion in data center chip business, missing Wall Street views for $4.6 billion. Sales in the unit were up 10% year over year.Intel's data center group remains the company's ""crown jewel growth franchise, but near-term growth continues to disappoint,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsay said in a research report.Intel's largest unit, its client computing group, saw sales rise 5% year over year to $8.9 billion in Q3. Total sales rose 9% to $15.78 billion. Intel earned 80 cents a share excluding items in Q3, up 21% and topping Wall Street's target of 73 cents.But for Q4, Intel expects sales of $15.7 billion, vs. analyst expectations for $15.86 billion.Intel also forecast a decline in gross profit margin to 63% on a non-GAAP basis in Q4, from 64.8% in Q3. Its gross margin guidance implies non-GAAP earnings per share of 71 cents in Q4, vs. consensus views for 77 cents, UBS analyst Stephen Chin said in a report.""The bulls will point to (data center group) reaccelerating and PCs stabilizing,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report Wednesday. ""However, bears will likely point to further PC market declines, a deteriorating core enterprise business in (the data center group) and a slowing of cloud/networking-centric DCG spend.""Intel's Q3 report is likely to weigh on companies with meaningful exposure to the enterprise and PC segments, including Cisco Systems (CSCO), Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Micron Technology (MU), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC), Pacific Crest Securities said Tuesday.All of the above stocks fell Wednesday except for HPE, which got positive reviews for its analyst day Tuesday, and Super Micro.

90,HPE,"Quick! Name a good Taiwanese stock.If Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was the first to pop into your head, you're in sync with the iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF.That's not just because Taiwan Semiconductor is the best recognized Taiwanese company, but also because the stock is the largest portion of the exchange traded fund. Taiwan Semi accounts for a hefty 25% of the fund's portfolio, dwarfing most of the other 90-plus holdings.While that's a lot of eggs in the iShares Taiwan ETF basket, it's turned out to be a good bet. Shares of the chipmaker have been on a steady ascent this year, reaching record highs last month after surpassing the previous peak of January 2000.The ETF uses the company's Taipei-traded shares rather than the American depositary receipts, but both stocks mirror each other quite well. The U.S. and Taiwan shares are pulling back to the 50-day moving average for the third time since breaking out to new highs in June. Both charts bear a resemblance to iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF this year, which is up 20% in 2016.What about the other 75% of the fund?More than 8% is invested in Hon Hai Precision, a stock that surged as much as 31% from its May lows but has retreated back to a prior resistance level. The company is unfamiliar to most U.S. investors, but it is also known as Foxconn, one of the largest contract manufacturers of electronics in the world. Foxconn is one of the principal suppliers for Apple (AAPL) products; its other major customers include Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Sony (SNE) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).Largely due to Taiwan Semi's big weighting, 60% of the fund is in technology stocks. Some 16% is financials and materials make up less than 10%.The Taiwan Stock Exchange is up nearly 9% this year, putting it well ahead the Nikkei and the mainland Chinese indexes, which are down about 10%. Taiwan also is outperforming the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index.""The primary drivers of this rally have been more macro-related than fundamentally driven, as earnings growth in Taiwan has increased in line with the broader emerging markets, but valuations in Taiwan have richened faster than the emerging market asset class as a whole,"" says Tushar Yadava, investment strategist at BlackRock's (BLK) iShares.On Nov. 30, the fund will start tracking the MSCI Taiwan 25/50 Index. It is quite similar to the current MSCI Taiwan Index, but the new one caps the largest holding, i.e., Taiwan Semi, at 25% of the portfolio. It also limits the sum of all companies with at least a 5% weighting in the index at no more 50%. The change is to better reflect rules on diversification, which the fund already has been following, iShares says. The caps are applied at quarterly rebalancings, so there may be some drift in between.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

Check out the IBD Big Cap 20 for the big companies that currently are performing the best.""The company has become adept at pivoting, splitting and divesting as necessary to extract shareholder value out of a business that plus or minus a point is basically not growing,"" Needham analyst Richard Kugele wrote in a research report Thursday. ""That said, we believe the value extracted from the spin-merger of the software business with Micro Focus adds at least $2 in value for shareholders to our previous $22 price target (now $24) and on that basis warrants a reiteration of our buy rating.""UBS analyst Steven Milunovich also maintained a buy, but with a caveat. While he said in a research note that the recent deals benefit current shareholders, ""the question when the dust settles is whether HPE will win as a more agile hybrid infrastructure vendor or have difficulty competing with larger Cisco and Dell with greater software and services assets.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock ended Thursday trading down 3.2% to 21.38 on the stock market today. The stock hit a record high of 22.32 on Sept. 1.Late Wednesday, HPE confirmed earlier reports that it would spin off its software business and merge it with U.K.-based Micro Focus International, as one of Silicon Valley's true pioneering companies continues to restructure and focus on the rise of cloud computing.HPE will receive $2.5 billion in cash and Micro Focus stock valued at $6.3 billion at the time of the announcement. U.K.-based Micro Focus is traded on the London exchange. HPE shareholders will own 50.1% of the new company, which is expected to generate about $4.5 billion in annual revenue, more than $3 billion from the HPE side.In May, HPE announced the sale of its services business to Computer Sciences, with HPE shareholders owning about half of a company valued near $8 billion. This deal is expected to close in Q1 2017 and the Micro Focus deal in the second half of 2017.In announcing the Micro Focus deal, HPE said ""the move enables a stand-alone HPE to realize its vision of being the industry's leading provider of hybrid IT, built on the secure, next-generation, software-defined infrastructure that will run customers' data centers today, bridge them to multicloud environments tomorrow, and enable the emerging intelligent edge that will power campus, branch and IoT applications for decades to come.""It was only in November that venerable Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard Inc. split into two publicly traded companies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise to focus on services and products for businesses and other enterprises, and HP Inc. (HPQ) to focus on PCs and printers.Also late Wednesday, HPE announced mixed results for its fiscal Q3 ended July 31. Earnings per share minus items of 49 cents topped Wall Street views for 44 cents, but revenue fell 6% year over year to $12.2 billion, where analysts had expected $12.6 billion. In constant currency, servers fell 2% and storage fell 5%, though the networking unit rose 10%.HPE CEO Meg Whitman is trying to create a company better able to compete with Dell Technologies, following its just-completed acquisition of EMC, as well Cisco and IBM, as large companies shift spending to cloud computing services.But Pac Crest's Kurtz said HPE still needs to show it can ""buck industrywide secular headwinds facing on-premise hardware vendors and if HPE can establish share as a provider in new growth categories like hyper-converged appliances.""RELATED:Cisco Systems Should Get Into The Chip BusinessHP Inc.

107,HPE,"CyberArk Software (CYBR) stock toppled Wednesday after the company reported Q2 billings that missed expectations by $10 million.Analysts, though, downplayed billings as largely meaningless in CyberArk's perpetual license model and said better measures -- sales and earnings -- easily topped.Summit Redstone analyst Srini Nandury reiterated his buy rating on CyberArk stock and boosted his price target to 60 from 55. CyberArk ""is profitable with plenty of headroom to grow driven by a shift in security spending from perimeter to protection of internal assets,"" he said in a research note.But by the closing bell on the stock market today, CyberArk stock lost 6.5% to 51.71. As of Tuesday's close, shares had risen 23% this year, while IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group had fallen 9%. On Friday, CyberArk stock touched a nearly one-year high of 57.57.IBD'S TAKE: CyberArk stock is ranked first in its industry group with a Composite Rating of 98, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks. The group is ranked No. 43 out of 197 groups tracked, climbing from No. 186 over the past 13 weeks.For Q2, CyberArk reported $50.4 million in sales and 29 cents earnings per share ex items, up a respective 39% and 53% vs. the year-earlier quarter, and topping analysts' views for $48.3 million and 20 cents.License sales (comprising 59.5% of total revenue) rose 35% to $30 million. Maintenance and professional services added $20.4 million, up 45%. But $49.6 billion in billings lagged analysts' model for $60.1 million, though was up 3%, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski said.""While this marked the seventh consecutive quarter the company exceeded the high-end of guidance, the magnitude of the beat was the smallest it has ever been,"" Nowinski wrote in a research report. He maintained his overweight rating on CyberArk stock, but he boosted his price target to 60 from 55.Summit Redstone's Nandury said CyberArk is simply getting better at giving accurate outlooks. He and William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho wrote in separate reports that billings aren't a relevant measure of CyberArk's success considering its perpetual license business model.Ho kept his outperform rating on CyberArk stock.Nandury sees CyberArk as a strong acquisition target and, following a partnership with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) during the quarter, wouldn't be surprised at a near-term bid by the company. HPE will deploy CyberArk products in its managed service offering.""It is entirely possible HPE may make a bid for CyberArk if the CyberArk's privileged account solutions find widespread adoption within HPE's customer base,"" he wrote.Current-quarter sales guidance for $51.5 million to $52.5 million met the consensus view for $52 million and would be up 30% vs. the year-earlier period. CyberArk's 21-23-cent EPS ex items view narrowly topped analysts' 21-cent view at the midpoint. But EPS would fall 15% year over year.

Atlassian has helped boost its group, specialty enterprise software, into the top 20, as you can learn from IBD Industry Themes.He said the company was ""unique from the start: from its differentiated, online sales model to its no-hassle, no discounting pricing to its high-growth, already profitable and generating cash business.""Atlassian, which went public in December at 21, soared to a record high of 32.54 on Aug. 5, after posting June-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations. Atlassian stock also broke out of a cup base at a 31.56 buy point on that date.Shares have since fallen, however, and fell 1.3%, to 29.95, in the stock market today.Kees started coverage with a 35 price target on Atlassian stock, saying ""we believe TEAM's competitive advantages remain viable for the immediate future.""Atlassian's customers include big names such as: BlackRock (BLK), Amgen (AMGN) and Sotheby's (BID).

GE closed above its 50-day moving average for the first time since May 2. Its stock has been forming a first stage base for nearly two months with a 32.15 buy point.GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said the move is designed to update industry in Europe.""Europe has the talent and infrastructure to lead a productivity revolution and the digitization of industry must be at the core of this mission,"" Immelt said in a written statement Tuesday.The Paris foundry is the first in a series of new GE Digital centers designed to incubate startups, improve collaboration and drive digital ecosystem growth, the company said. The Paris facility will serve as the hub of a network in Europe and GE plans to build four more such foundries this year.No financial terms were given but the company cited studies saying digitization will add more than 110 billion euros ($123 billion) in annual revenue for industry in Europe over the next five years.In addition to the digital foundry, the company launched two new software products based on its Predix operating system for industrial products.General Electric's Predix OS provides a digital platform for industrial devices such as locomotives, jetliners, power plant equipment and the like.

Apple has been more reserved, although it's slowing growth may spur more acquisitions.The cash-rich internet giants are not the only ones that may go shopping. Analysts also expect Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE), Alibaba (BABA), Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and IBM (IBM) to be among the buyers. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) last week acquired LinkedIn (LNKD) for a hefty $26.2 billion.It's an era of ""unicorns"" -- startups valued at $1 billion or more, based on venture capital and private investments. The biggest names among unicorns include resource-sharing businesses such as Uber, Airbnb and Lyft, as well as social online companies Snapchat, Spotify and Pinterest.While unicorn valuations have been tempered recently, that's also a trend among smaller startups, says the Bloomberg report.Mutual funds including Fidelity Investments and T.

122,HPE,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) earnings growth might slow amid mounting competitive pressure from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and a “refocused” Juniper Networks (JNPR), says Goldman Sachs, which on Wednesday downgraded Cisco to neutral from buy.Cisco stock closed down 1.1% at 28.65 in the stock market today.While Cisco already faces “significant pressure” from Nokia (which this year completed its $17 billion acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent), Arista Networks (ANET), and China-based Huawei, new threats are emerging, says a Goldman Sachs research report. “We see heightened competitive pressure from a more focused HPE following its acquisition of Aruba last year and split from HPQ,” Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in the report. “In the data center segment, we see Juniper as a more meaningful competitor.”Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies last November, Hewlett Packard Enterprises and HP Inc., which focuses on PCs and printers. HPE last month said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC).HPE now could be on the prowl for acquisitions, analysts say.“Cisco has been able to offset share losses in networking with share gains in servers, but we see those as largely exhausted now,” Jankowski said. “In addition, the significant increase in management turnover over the last few months raises execution risks over the medium term.”Some analysts have speculated that Cisco could buy a data storage company with software expertise in converged infrastructure.“We believe HPE now has a much more rounded networking portfolio with the Aruba asset, as well as a much stronger focus on enterprise IT infrastructure,” added Jankowski. “In addition, its leadership in servers and significant presence in storage (where Cisco only participates through partnerships rather than directly) can give it a competitive advantage in situations where the customer is looking for bundled solutions.""HPE’s significantly lower margin structure allows it to undercut Cisco on price.”

124,HPE,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) could go shopping for a data storage company with software expertise, as enterprise customers shift toward “converged infrastructure,” says Barclays.While Cisco has a joint venture with EMC (EMC) and alliances with NetApp (NTAP) and startup SimpliVity, the computer networking giant needs to own data storage assets as customers shift to converged data center infrastructure -- including servers -- that run on network management software, the investment bank said.“We believe converged infrastructure could be an area of interest for Cisco to tactically acquire software-defined storage assets,” Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz said in a research report.  “While storage is the glaring hole in Cisco’s portfolio, we think the company will move away from hardware-based assets as it attempts to shift to more software mix and value-added services.”Aside from Cisco, Moskowitz says Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), EMC, VMware (VMW) and Oracle (ORCL) aim to be players in the converged infrastructure market. EMC is in the final stages of  being acquired by privately held Dell.“Hyper-converged infrastructure relies more on software and seems to be ushering in the software defined data center. As such, consolidation may be critical for some of the systems-centric vendors to keep pace with innovation within the software realm,” he wrote.San Jose, Calif.-based Nutanix has been gaining share in converged infrastructure, says the Barclays report. Nutanix might well rekindle plans for an initial public offering, analysts say.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, meanwhile, also is on the prowl for acquisitions, according to analysts.“Converged infrastructure is just a way of packaging IT components to drive efficiencies rather than a radically different concept that unlocks incremental revenue,” said Moskowitz. “We think storage vendors get hurt the most, implying only upstarts or companies not possessing legacy storage like Cisco are best positioned to benefit from this trend.”Cisco stock fell 0.65% to 28.84 in the stock market today. HPE lost 2.7% and EMC dipped 0.1%.

125,HPE,"General Electric (GE) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) on Wednesday announced that they will share technology to develop products for the Industrial Internet of Things.Hewlett Packard Enterprise is the information technology and service company formed when Hewlett-Packard late last year split into two companies, HP Inc. (HPQ) and HPE. At the HPE Discover conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Hewlett Packard Enterprise said that it's now a preferred storage and server infrastructure provider for GE's Predix cloud technologies.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Chief Technology Officer Mark Potter said in a written statement that, ""In order to fully take advantage of the Industrial IoT, customers need data-center-grade computing power, both at the edge -- where the action is -- and in the cloud.""No financial terms were given for the agreement, but Hewlett Packard Enterprise joins AT&T (T), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Verizon Communications (VZ) and others that have partnered with GE on its Predix platform. IC Insights forecasts that Industrial IoT revenues will reach $12.4 billion in 2015, nearly doubling the $6.4 billion in 2012.General Electric shares rose 0.6% to 30.31 on the stock market today. GE stock is in a two-month consolidation with a 32.15 buy point but found resistance at the 50-day line Wednesday. HPE rose 1% to 19.35, hitting a record high for a third straight session.The accord is part of GE's transformation into what it calls a digital industrial company. GE has traditionally made big iron equipment like railroad locomotives, jet engines and wind turbines. It's undergoing a major transformation as it connects those devices with its cloud-based Predix operating software platform.Bill Ruh, GE's chief digital officer and CEO of the company's GE Digital business, said in a recent IBD interview that the company aims to have its Predix OS used by every large industrial company in the world.Predictive intelligence comes into play in Predix. Asked if that was the origin of the made-up word ""Predix,"" Ruh said, ""Absolutely. Deep machine learning is part of this. We couple it with physical machine models. Those are our secret sauce that differentiates us,"" from others creating software for the Industrial Internet of Things.

""That said, we do not expect Meg to exit HPE before the software spinoff is completed (scheduled for Sept 1).""HPE is selling off its software business to U.K.-based Micro Focus. HPE has already spun off its enterprise services business, which merged with Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC). Whitman's plans could be clarified at an analysts meeting expected in the fall. She oversaw the split of Silicon Valley pioneer Hewlett-Packard into two publicly traded companies in November 2015, with its printer and PC business becoming HP Inc. (HPQ). Whitman assumed control of HPE after the split.Before that, Whitman made an unsuccessful bid for governor of California as a Republican in 2010, though in 2016 she supported Democrat Hillary Clinton over eventual winner Republican Donald Trump in the presidential race. Still, she's been a big Republican fundraiser.Neri has been executive VP and general manager of HPE's Enterprise Group, which includes servers, storage, networking, and cloud solutions. HPE is competing with two other IT industry giants, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell Technologies (DVMT), in providing next-generation data center technology. Cisco hosts a company tech conference this week.IBD'S TAKE: HPE's stock is down 4% in 2017 as the company restructures and is trading at a nine-month low.

Arista stock rebounded from intraday lows to close up 0.1% at 151.23 Thursday. On Friday, the stock was little changed. Shares have shot up some 55% in 2017.""A crescendo of fading litigation risk, improving gross margin, and revenue upside potential related to the HPE partnership stands to bolster the model,"" said Moskowitz in a report.Arista sells network switches that speed up communications among racks of computer servers packed into the data centers. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Arista has been taking share from Cisco, thanks to customers such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB).""While Cisco and its litigation machine is not likely to go away quietly, we think the precedent set with the recent Patent and Trial Board ruling also sets the stage for litigation-averse, long-term investors to start taking a fresh look at the stock,"" added Moskowitz in the report. ""It is good timing as we expect both margin and valuation multiples to exhibit increasing upward mobility.""IBD'S TAKE: Arista Networks ranks No. 8 in the IBD 50 roster of high-growth stocks. Lumentum Holdings, Lam Research and Nvidia are the top tech stocks in the IBD 50. Amid a legal battle with rival Cisco, Arista has rushed to ramp up U.S. manufacturing in case its imports are blocked.Arista has denied infringing Cisco's patents, and it also says it has modified its network software to resolve issues.RELATED:As Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant Cisco

Juniper Networks stock rose 2.6% to 29.20 on the stock market today. With Monday's gain, Juniper Networks stock neared its 50-day moving average.""The cloud vertical is now 27% of revenues, highlighting Juniper's increased diversification and lesser reliance on the traditional telco vertical,"" Long said in a report. ""The cloud vertical has driven much of Juniper's recent growth and remains a significant growth opportunity as it architects its portfolio to meet cloud customer requirements.""Juniper's cloud-computing growth is coming from customers such as Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), Facebook (FB) and Oracle (ORCL).Long, though, says other parts of Juniper's business are struggling.""We hold no illusions about routing and security, and expectations remain low,"" he said in a report. ""Routing remains challenged by soft telco spending and instances of switching displacing routers based on improving merchant silicon capabilities. Security has been a long-term headwind for Juniper, and the updated product portfolio may be too little too late. That said, given low expectations, any upside represents a call option on the shares.""Juniper reports fiscal Q2 earnings on July 25. Juniper reported March-quarter earnings slightly above expectations.IBD'S TAKE:  While Juniper aims for a rebound, Arista Networks has been taking share from Cisco. Arista Networks is ranked No. 6 on the IBD 50, a roster of fast-growing companies. Look for more top-performing companies at the IBD 50, which also includes Lumentum Holdings and Lam Research.The company has been seeking a turnaround under its new chief executive, Rami Rahim.""Juniper has underperformed year to date, and we believe the shares are ripe for a turnaround as more credit is given to the switching business, customer diversification strategy, strong operating expense management, and balance-sheet flexibility,"" Long said.RELATED:Cisco Lowers Sales, Earnings Forecast But Not As Much As FearedArista Price Target Hiked: Less Cisco Risk, More HPE UpsideIs This Tech Celebrity And Political Honcho Planning An Exit?

131,HPE,"Thoughts from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) management on how it plans to use growing cash on its balance sheet may overshadow earnings when it reports fiscal second-quarter results late Wednesday.It's the first earnings report since HPE spun off its enterprise services business, which merged with Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC).

133,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) signaled that more acquisitions may be coming at its “Discover” customer conference this week, say analysts.There’s been speculation that Hewlett Packard Enterprise could acquire an enterprise software company or F5 Networks (FFIV), a supplier of data center gear.Katy Huberty, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s recent acquisitions have turned out well.""While the company is focused on organic innovation, HPE is open to acquisitions similar to 3Par, 3Com and Aruba -- complimentary technologies that can be sold through HP's distribution channel,” Huberty said in a report. “Software-defined and hyperconverged products are a key area of focus with acquisitions potentially focused here.”At Jefferies, analyst James Kisner says Hewlett Packard Enterprise could be in the hunt for Seattle-based F5 Networks. (F5 Networks shot up nearly 13% on Tuesday on a report that it had hired Goldman Sachs (GS) to help review takeover approaches.)“From a strategic perspective, we believe HPE could be a possible suitor,” said Kisner in a report. “HPE’s Aruba acquisition has been doing well. At Discover, (CEO Meg) Whitman noted that the size of potential acquisitions is less of an issue than their valuation. We note that F5 is trading at a similar valuation as Aruba pre-acquisition.”Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz has an underweight rating on Hewlett Packard Enterprise.""The Discover customer conference highlighted management confidence in GDP-like revenue growth as the company invests outside the data center in the $25B campus/edge market and machine learning,"" wrote Moskowitz in a report. ""HPE exhibited some flexibility on M&A, as there was commentary suggesting acquisitions can be pursued if done at the right multiples. Given the successes of Aruba, 3PAR, and ArcSight, we think HPE’s M&A track record has enough support to pursue a larger acquisition if it can move the revenue needle.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise on May 25 said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), a move that could put pressure on IBM (IBM) to respond, analysts say.HP Enterprise shares finished 1% higher on the stock market today, hitting a record high for a fourth straight day.

Microsoft in early 2015 tried to buy Salesforce.com, said reports. Some rumors of late, though, have Amazon.com as a possible Salesforce.com buyer.Hewlett Packard Enterprise on May 25 said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp.

Rivals Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) were down a respective 3.8%. Harder hit Imperva (IMPV) and Fortinet (FTNT) stocks were down 5.4% and 7%, respectively.Seyrafi suggests that investors look at stocks with higher sales growth, free-cash-flow yields and strong EMEA moats. On those factors, Seyrafi suggests that investors dig their heels in on Facebook, Salesforce.com (CRM), Palo Alto, Cisco, Apple and FitBit (FIT) stocks.In terms of sales growth, Palo Alto Networks is likely to trail Facebook. Their estimates call for 28% and 33% growth in 2017, respectively. Palo Alto's sales have slowed recently from its typical 50%-plus rate. Seyrafi expects Cisco and Apple to see the slowest growth rates, at 3% and 2%, respectively.FitBit and Salesforce have the smallest EMEA exposure at 15% and 17%, to Palo Alto's 18%, among the companies that FBN reviewed. More than 20% of Apple, Facebook, Cisco, Twitter (TWTR), Tableau Software (DATA) and Splunk (SPLK) sales are tied to EMEA. Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Microsoft (MSFT) tip the boat with a 30%-plus exposure across the pond.However, Apple has the strongest free-cash-flow yield at 11%, leading Palo Alto at 10%, Cisco at 9.2% and FitBit at 7.6%.

HPE also reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 earnings, but EPS was still down 2% year over year.“We believe the HPE Services plus CSC transaction will cause Xerox (XRX) services to be looked at as an acquisition target, as well as put pressure on IBM to consider making acquisitions in its services business,” Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report.The combination of HPE’s enterprise services business and Computer Sciences will have about $26 billion in annual sales. The deal is expected to close in March 2017.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at Jefferies, says the HPE-CSC deal has merit.“We believe the combined firm will trail only IBM Global Services and Accenture (ACN) in terms of global IT Services revenue,” Kupferberg said in a report. “While neither CSC or HPE enterprise services are industry growth leaders and have been in turnaround mode, we see strategic rationale for the merger, given the complementary vertical exposures (CSC strong in insurance, health care and banking, with HPE enterprise services known for pharmaceuticals, transportation, and telecom.)”Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies last November, with HP Inc. (HPQ) due to report late Wednesday. Shareholders of HP Enterprise and CSC will each own half of the new company's shares.Computer Sciences stock shot up 42.2% to 50.68.

Dave & Buster shares hit record highs, but ended the week barely higher.Health-savings-account manager HealthEquity (HQY) topped first-quarter estimates. However, as Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa noted, the company's EPS was helped by a lower-than-expected tax rate due to changes in accounting standards, and that the company expects higher service-cost spending on fraud prevention to hit gross margins.

150,HPE,"Wall Street is waiting to see if Box (BOX), which reports fiscal first-quarter 2018 earnings late Wednesday, will continue to bounce back from a sell-off in March when the online data-storage and file-sharing service provider's guidance disappointed.Redwood City, Calif.-based Box is expected to report an unadjusted loss of 14 cents a share vs. an 18-cent loss a year earlier, with revenue rising 27% to $114.7 million.""We expect a modest top-line beat and raise to accompany significant year-over-year margin expansion when Box reports results,"" said Rob Owens, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst in a report.Box stock has climbed 36% in 2017 but dipped 1.4% to close at 18.57 on the stock market today.Box on March 1 reported fiscal 2017 fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations, but April quarter and full-year 2018 profit guidance was light.Box reported its first quarter of positive free cash flow in the January quarter. Consensus estimates, though, are for free cash flow to be slightly negative in the first quarter. Box has forecast positive free cash flow for all of 2018.Box has alliances with IBM (IBM) and Salesforce.com (CRM) in the corporate market.

The company is part of IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, which ranks No. 105 out of 197 industry groups.  Learn more about Box and other companies in the group at IBD Stock Checkup.""Competitive pressure arising from Microsoft's offerings has been a common premise underlying cautious outlooks on Box,"" Owens added in his report. ""Without meaningful shifts in the strategic focus at Microsoft, we expect Office 365 adoption will continue to be a key driver for new customers to invest in Box and for existing customers to expand their usage of Box.""Box's investments include computer servers that provide remote storage in data centers. One of Box's challenges, analysts say, is driving average selling prices higher with add-on software modules, such as file-sharing and content management tools, as prices for online data storage continue to fall.RELATED:Overseas Tax Holiday For Tech Titans May Come With A CatchHPE Outlook For Cash, Acquisitions May Trump Earnings Results

152,HPE,"Microsoft's (MSFT) deal to buy online professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion took many on Wall Street by surprise. Most analysts thought it was more likely that Microsoft would acquire a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company like Salesforce.com (CRM) or Workday (WDAY). Many say the deal could spark more mergers and acquisitions in enterprise software.Microsoft announced its agreement to purchase LinkedIn early Monday. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the deal ""brings together the world’s leading professional cloud with the world’s leading professional network.""Microsoft stock, which fell 2.6% Monday, closed 0.6% lower at 49.83 on the stock market today. Workday rose 2.5% Tuesday, while Salesforce.com stock dipped 0.5%.Microsoft reportedly tried to acquire Salesforce.com in early 2015 with a bid that topped $50 billion, but it was rebuffed. With LinkedIn, Microsoft will get tools to compete with Salesforce. Microsoft will be able to use LinkedIn's Sales Navigator as a social selling tool integrated with its Dynamics customer relationship management software.“Microsoft’s agreement to purchase LinkedIn came as a surprise -- we thought a SaaS application M&A strategy was more likely,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a research report.He said he sees the logic of the deal -- combining LinkedIn user data with Microsoft’s Office 365 and Dynamics CRM -- but he is not clear on how it materially expands Microsoft’s total addressable market.“The good news is this takes the risk of an even bigger deal off the table and (we think) implies Microsoft’s core business remains healthy,” MacMillan said. He rates Microsoft stock as outperform, with a price target of 61.The LinkedIn deal could spur more mergers and acquisitions in the cloud computing sector, Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in a report.“This acquisition increases the likelihood of more M&A in enterprise and systems software,” he said.The question is which companies will step up. Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) are among the potential acquirers, he said.Microsoft eventually will consider buying a firm with exceptional sales talent, such as Salesforce, Workday, Adobe Systems (ADBE), ServiceNow (NOW) or Splunk (SPLK), he said. Davis rates Microsoft stock as hold, with a price target of 55.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle also sees more M&A ahead in internet cloud applications.“As Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft and Google compete more aggressively in the cloud, applications provide a means of differentiation,” Barnicle said in a report. “Microsoft leads in applications because of Office. LinkedIn would provide additional differentiation.""It is likely Amazon and Google will also look to acquire large application companies, like Salesforce.com, Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK) or Workday. They are less likely to buy the smaller or more vertical SaaS vendors because those companies are too small to make a big difference for Amazon or Google, in our view.""Barnicle rates Microsoft stock as overweight, with a price target of 65.While some analysts on Wall Street were cautiously upbeat about the Microsoft-LinkedIn tie-up, others said Microsoft paid too much.“While we believe there is some strategic rationale supporting the deal, we question at what cost,” Jefferies analyst John DiFucci said in a report. “We view this acquisition as similar to other major acquisitions that Microsoft has made over the years, including aQuantive, Skype, and Nokia.”The purchases of aQuantive and Nokia were costly failures, and Skype’s performance is an unknown quantity, he said.“Microsoft has historically gotten a free pass from investors, since these deals typically only represented about a quarter of free cash flow, vs. more than a year’s worth for LinkedIn, which may force accountability,” DiFucci said. He rates Microsoft stock underperform with a price target of 40.RELATED:Public, Private Software Firms May Compete In M&A, Says CanaccordSalesforce-Microsoft Office 365 Deal ‘Delivering Real Dividends’Is Salesforce Big Enough To Avoid Amazon, Oracle Overtures?

154,HPE,"Negative trends in the enterprise market -- large companies and government agencies -- are lowering expectations ahead of Cisco Systems' (CSCO) fiscal Q3 earnings, due out Wednesday after the market close.Many large companies are outsourcing business computing workloads to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), lessening their need for the routers, switches and other networking gear sold by Cisco and others.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate Cisco earnings minus items will rise 2% to 55 cents, though they see revenue falling 1% to $11.97 billion.“We see three major issues into this earnings release, including weak IT data points, all signaling industrywide IT spending weakness, less visibility around service provider spending, and global macro exposure,” Kulbinder Garcha, a Credit Suisse analyst, said in a research report.“Year to date, we have seen weak IT spending indications from large bellwethers including IBM (IBM), EMC (EMC), Juniper (JNPR), Brocade (BRCD) and SAP (SAP),” added Garcha, who has an underperform rating on the stock.JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall, in a research report, cited negative enterprise market commentary from Intel (INTC), Oracle (ORCL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). Reports of slower tech spending was a factor in the stock market's plunge early in the year.With many tech companies struggling to meet expectations recently, an in-line quarter for Cisco might be good enough to move shares higher, said Citigroup analyst Jim Suva.RW Baird's Jayson Noland was another analyst citing slower spending of late. “Our partner survey results indicate a softer-than-expected April quarter, with improved prospects for growth for the remainder of calendar 2016,” Noland wrote in a research note.Cisco stock, up 1% near 27 in early trading in the stock market today, is about even in 2016.

In PaaS, companies sell applications and software, including business management and database services, that run on cloud infrastructure.“Cloud is not a winner-take-all market,” said UBS. “We believe the 'big will get bigger,' ... AWS, Microsoft, and Google are going to be winners, with IBM holding its own.""The likely losers, based on UBS estimates of revenue exposure, include Rackspace (RAX), Nimble (NMBL), Pure Storage (PSTG), Brocade (BRCD), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and NetApp (NTAP).”Rackspace, which is set to report Q1 earnings after the close Monday, is transitioning to a services model, providing support for AWS and Azure.IBM acquired IaaS provider Softlayer in 2013. To be stronger in PaaS, IBM has layered software on Softlayer’s infrastructure and made other cloud acquisitions, says UBS.One surprise in the UBS survey is that IT executives expect pricing for cloud computing to moderate. Some analysts predict Google will be more aggressive in cutting prices.

159,HPE,"Western Digital (WDC) on Tuesday received a price-target hike to 50 from 45 and an upgrade to outperform from market perform by Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman.The moves comes two days before Western Digital is slated to give new guidance that will include its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk. Western Digital announced the completion of its SanDisk acquisition last week, creating a big competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage. The company has said it would update its guidance after the market close Thursday for its fiscal fourth quarter ending July 1.Ackerman says while he expects the SanDisk acquisition to dilute earnings through 2017, “We think the stock should start to work higher from here, as Western Digital’s updated guidance should act as a positive catalyst and help eliminate uncertainty.""Western Digital stock finished trading up 4.5% to 42.28 in the stock market today. However, the stock is down 47% since the acquisition was announced in October. Shares hit a four-year low of 34.99 on May 16 but are up 20% since then.Western Digital and SanDisk had combined revenue of about $20 billion in 2015, with $14.5 billion from Western Digital. It’s the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX).SanDisk is a leading provider of chips used for data storage in a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and PCs. The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, move up the ladder to make bigger sales to businesses and other enterprise customers -- the market where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk drive technology is losing ground.Western Digital's year-over-year revenue has fallen for six straight quarters. That’s largely due to lower disk drive sales in the slumping PC market and the migration of disk storage to chip-based storage in many products. Seagate's revenue has fallen for five straight quarters.“Now that SanDisk is subsumed into Western Digital’s operations, Western Digital now morphs from an enterprise highly exposed to the cannibalization of next-generation storage into a media agnostic, vertically integrated data storage provider capable of generating mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-double-digit EPS growth,” Ackerman wrote.He said the top 10 customers shared between Western Digital and SanDisk include Best Buy (BBY), Apple (AAPL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. (HPQ)“With SanDisk, Western Digital can now more effectively service both enterprise and hyper-scale customers and capitalize on the explosion of data creation that should double every two to three years by 2020,"" Ackerman wrote.

160,HPE,"Ask Wall Street analysts to name possible catalysts for a rise in big-cap technology stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), and near the top on most lists would be Trump administration plans to allow companies to bring foreign profits into the U.S. at a reduced tax rate.Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama.The proposed changes on ""repatriated"" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress.""A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved,"" Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. ""I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable.""Even so, one worry is that the overseas ""tax holiday"" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms.Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst.""If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know,"" UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report.There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track.""There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America,"" Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. ""We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs.""Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called ""repatriated earnings."" Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas.President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate.The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate.The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all.However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said.The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, ""Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases.""UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a ""tracking mechanism"" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place.S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations.The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says.While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas.If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it ""expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return.""In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund ""transformative"" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA).Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets.Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

164,HPE,"If Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen shops at Amazon.com (AMZN) like most Americans, she might pick up insights from the e-commerce behemoth to help her set future interest rates.In fact, Yellen & Co. might want to include Amazon in the mix when discussing oil, housing, health care and other inflationary costs that can signal whether to tap the brakes or let the economy keep rolling.""Amazon is killing lots of businesses. In the process, it may also be killing inflation,"" Ed Yardeni, noted economist and president of Yardeni Research, said in a recent report.Using Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' playbook, Amazon has pummeled rivals with price cuts enabled by its smart logistics and relentless drive toward efficiency. Labor-displacing warehouse robotics give Amazon a cost advantage, and it aims to one day deploy delivery drones to extend its edge all the way to the customer's doorstep.Amazon's casualty list already is formidable. Over the years, Amazon has left consumer-facing retailers such as Borders, Circuit City and Sports Authority in the dust. Department chains have been closing stores, unable to answer the e-commerce challenge.Now Amazon is taking on gargantuan retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Costco Wholesale (COST). These big-box retailers are trying to fight back, and their main tool is cutting prices.And Amazon is impacting more parts of the U.S. economy as it expands from books, toys and electronics into apparel, groceries and entertainment. Cowen & Co. calls the ""$1.3 trillion U.S. grocery market Amazon's biggest potential source of revenue upside.""While Amazon's effect on the retail sector has grabbed headlines, there's also Amazon Business to consider. The online sales channel for business customers is sending prices down for industrial products, pressuring companies like W.W. Grainger (GWW).There's also Amazon Web Services, the fast-growing cloud computing business. A Citigroup report in April called the impact of AWS and cloud services ""deflationary"" on the information technology industry.For now, Fed officials say a tightening labor market has put upward pressure on wage costs. The Fed has hiked interest rates once this year, and is expected to do it twice more. The unemployment rate fell to 4.4% in April, below the structural rate and matching the lows of 2006-07.Yet some economists contend that Amazon's use of automation as it pushes into new markets looms as a long-term factor in restraining job and wage growth. Amazon's scale is unmatched. It's most conspicuous in the retail space.""Traditional retailers will struggle to compete with a business that generated an estimated $225 billion in global gross merchandise value in 2016, growing 29% year-over-year and has the discipline to operate at a 1% margin,"" said a recent Morgan Stanley report.The CEO of entertainment provider Liberty Media (LMCA), Greg Maffei, called Amazon a ""ridiculously scary"" rival at a financial conference May 9.Amazon ""has an ability, because of its scale, to invest at incredibly low or negative rates of return — because they can cross-subsidize, and the market is willing to suspend disbelief in future profitability,"" Maffei said.Economist Yardeni, meanwhile, compares Amazon's scale to that of China.""Amazon arguably has done as much as the Chinese to kill jobs and keep a lid on inflation by enabling fast and easy price discovery for anyone with a cellphone,"" he said.Amazon has quickly gained traction in apparel and is now the second-biggest retailer behind Wal-Mart. Now it's taking Wal-Mart head-on.A longtime price discounter itself, thanks to Chinese manufacturing partners, Wal-Mart has seen profits shrink amid Amazon's online onslaught.Wal-Mart in April began offering price discounts for 10,000 items that consumers buy online and then pick up in stores. By June, Wal-Mart plans to expand web discounting to 1 million items.Since it purchased e-commerce startup Jet.com last year, Wal-Mart has ratcheted up its battle with Amazon. Wal-Mart in January rolled out free, two-day shipping for orders over $35. Amazon last week cut its minimum order to $25.Another big-box retailer, Costco, is dealing with Amazon's push into new food categories. While Costco has a strong membership program, its best counterpunch is pricing, says a Piper Jaffray report.""Costco is cheaper than Amazon in consumables,"" the report said.Making competition intensify is the fact that consumers doing comparison shopping can do so on mobile phones as well as on home PCs.""Certainly online vs. in-store shopping has been a trend for over a decade. What seems new is the comparison shopping that is pervasive,"" said Don Rissmiller, economist at Strategas Research Partners.""This could be related to Amazon, but it's also that we have mobile devices with fast, readily available networks, and the apps to check the price of various items,"" Rissmiller said. ""What we do know is the retail deflator turned negative in recent years and the Fed should absolutely pay attention.""Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, says it's clear that Amazon's success is weighing on prices for many retail goods. ""But the impact on overall inflation is small,"" Zandi told IBD.""The retail goods that Amazon provides account for only about 15% of the consumer basket,"" Zandi said. ""So, if Amazon is responsible for reducing retail goods inflation by 1 percentage point per annum — an aggressive assumption — then this will reduce overall inflation by 0.15%. Not inconsequential, but not a game changer.""Meanwhile, Amazon's stock price continues to soar, having spent 20 years on the market as of Monday. Shares have grown roughly 64,000% from its split-adjusted IPO of $1.50 and doubled from an already formidable price of 474 a share, reached in February 2016. Shares ended trading Monday at 957.97, off a fraction.Analysts continue to see Amazon going well past the 1,000 level. On Monday, Oppenheimer was the latest, raising its price to 1,100 from 970, and calling Amazon a ""must own"" stock.In another part of the economy, information technology, Amazon also is a disrupter. Amazon's cloud-computing business is by far the biggest provider of computing resources via the internet, followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and others.As corporate America outsources more computing work to AWS and other highly automated cloud services, companies buy less hardware and software for internal data centers and cut back on IT staffing.In the March quarter, IBM's (IBM) hardware business fell nearly 17% to $2.5 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of cloud adoption. How do the likes of IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) fight back? By cutting prices.""Cloud is deflationary and collapses markets,"" said a Citigroup report in April.""Labor, with 85% deflation in the cloud, has the most significant disruption from cloud economics,"" says the Citi report. It says 15 IT staffers in a public, shared cloud service can replace 100 in a private data center.AWS will rake in some $37.5 billion in revenue by 2020, up from $17 billion this year, estimates Citigroup.Since 2006, AWS has been steadily cutting prices for cloud services, with Google and Microsoft following suit. Customers pay cloud service providers as little as pennies an hour per server or as much as $1-$2 an hour, depending on the type of workload. Even with low prices, AWS operating income doubled in 2016 to $3.1 billion, owing to massive scale.""Perhaps most importantly, AWS' juicy operating profit margin of more than 25% gives Amazon a way to fund its new ventures and a retail business that has notoriously skinny margins,"" said Yardeni. ""The cash and financial flexibility AWS provides ensure that Amazon will be a lethal competitor in the retailing industry for many years to come.""Long-range, Amazon's influence on job growth and the economy could grow if rivals duplicate its strategies to stay competitive.In fact, Amazon is pushing in the direction of its competitors, driving its automation beyond warehouses and into the retail space. Amazon hopes to eliminate store cashiers at Amazon Go convenience stores now being tested. Amazon Go stores use sensors to track items as shoppers put them into baskets. The shopper's Amazon account gets automatically charged.Amazon recently was granted a patent for automated, ""on-demand apparel manufacturing."" The patent highlights plans to go beyond clothing into other fabric-based products, such as footwear, bedding and home goods.Amazon is also bringing more of its logistics and delivery operations in-house.""We're in the early stages of drones disrupting the trucking industry and transportation costs,"" David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, told IBD. ""We're reaching an inflection point with robotics and automation, artificial intelligence and the shared economy. Most of these are massive supply-side deflationary developments.""Rosenberg says Amazon is part of a new industrial revolution that could push wages down.""Amazon and e-commerce are part and parcel of the fourth industrial revolution,"" he said.

165,HPE,"Some of America's most venerable tech companies aim to renew growth by breaking up.The jury is still out on whether that will work for Conduent (CNDT), which has a long road ahead, analysts say. Separated from Xerox (XRX) in January, Conduent helps other companies get their financial house in order in the field known as business process outsourcing.Some analysts say Conduent aims to build a more competitive business. Others contend it could be a more attractive takeover target down the road. Its results have been lackluster of late, though the company's outlook indicates a growth path ahead.Complicating matters is activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a piece of Conduent. The big question is what will happen if its turnaround starts clicking.""We think Conduent is an unlikely (merger) target,"" Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent report. ""We don't think any of the established BPO leaders, such as Accenture (ACN), IBM (IBM) or Genpact (G), have any interest in acquiring Conduent, given its focus on the low end of the market.""But others say a sell-off could come piecemeal.""(Chief Executive Ashok) Vemuri may choose to divest/sell portions of the business that are either 'noncore' or less profitable,"" said Frank Atkins, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst, in a recent note to clients. ""While this would have impact on top-line trajectory on a reported basis, it is a quick way to drive margin as well as restore balance-sheet powder for strategic investment. In our view, this could be in low-margin, more commoditized work, or in certain geographies which may not be of adequate scale.""In investor meetings, Vemuri has outlined plans to increase its sales force, invest in digital technologies such as data analytics, and focus on North America and Europe as core markets.What the company also wants to do is exit low-margin contracts and pursue new deals with better pricing. It aims to migrate toward higher-value-added work rather than being a soup-to-nuts services provider.""The core philosophy now is to drive a more repeatable, scalable and predictable business,"" Vemuri said on Conduent's fourth-quarter earnings call in February.  ""We are not in the business of trying to capture a headline by doing a big deal that we do not even understand how to start working on.""Regardless of what awaits the company, the split/merger strategy isn't unfamiliar. Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard in 2015 split into two publicly traded companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus on services and products for businesses, and HP Inc. (HPQ) to focus on PCs and printers.HPE in early April took a step further, spinning off its enterprise services businesses. But that entity merged with IT consulting firm Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC), now a rival of Conduent.Whether Conduent pursues a strategic direction similar to HP's remains to be seen. Xerox stock gapped up on Jan. 3, the day the spinoff was completed, and is up about 8% this year. Xerox is set to launch a slew of new products, aiming to spur revenue growth in the back half of 2017, analysts say.The move to split from Xerox was endorsed by Icahn, who built up a stake in the copy machine maker.Icahn now holds a nearly 10% stake in Conduent and picked three members of its board of directors. So he figures in whatever strategic options Conduent is looking at, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Conduent hasn't been a publicly traded company for long, but it's already is forming a cup-with-handle base that could lead to higher stock gains. Read here for more information on stocks forming cup bases.As its own entity, Florham Park, N.J.-based Conduent handles such services for businesses as state Medicaid payments, tollbooth collections, and other transactions.Along with Accenture, IBM and Genpact, a number of other business process providers compete with Conduent. They include Convergys (CVG), ExlService (EXLS) and WNS Holdings (WNS), as well as large multinational tech service providers including Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Cap Gemini (CGEMY), and the new DXC Technology.The worldwide BPO market is growing about 5% annually, says Citigroup. In 2018, it's expected to reach $197 billion, from $188 billion in 2017.As it grows, CEO Vemuri aims to provide multiple services to customers rather than spread out too thinly.""The thing we have to work on is to take various service capabilities, find the common thread between them, and sell (services) as a bundled solution,"" he said on Conduent's earnings call.Prior to joining Conduent last year, Vemuri was chief executive of iGate, an information services firm. France-based Cap Gemini acquired iGate for roughly $4 billion in 2015. Vemuri earlier worked at Infosys (INFY), an India-based consulting and tech services firm.Current results may not bode well for a takeover, though. Conduent's 2016 revenue fell 4% to $6.4 billion. Adjusted revenue in the December quarter fell 6.5% to $1.6 billion, below estimates.Conduent posted a fourth-quarter loss of $4.69 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 3 cents. Excluding a goodwill impairment charge and restructuring-related costs, Conduent said it earned an unadjusted profit of 29 cents per share vs. analysts' estimate of 23 cents. Analysts estimate that Conduent profit will rebound to 95 cents in 2018 from 75 cents this year. But it notched $1.06 in unadjusted profit last year.With a market valuation of some $3.2 billion, Conduent does not plan to repurchase shares or issue a dividend in the near term. Conduent has told analysts that if cost-cutting generates more free cash flow it could start making small acquisitions in 2018 to expand into new areas.Conduent has moved quickly to reduce its worldwide workforce to 91,000 as of Feb. 15, down from 96,000 at the end of 2016.While shares in Conduent are up about 7% since its spinoff from Xerox, Citigroup says one drag on Conduent stock has been that the company was not added to either the S&P 500 or midcap S&P 400 index post-spinoff, limiting its exposure to index investors.RELATED:Analysts Shoot Down Oracle-Accenture Deal; 'Why Buy The Cow?'

166,HPE,"Western Digital (WDC) received a 45% price-target increase and an upgrade from JPMorgan, as the market for disk drives and memory chips move in its direction.The upgrade to overweight from neutral from analyst Rod Hall was based partly on improving conditions in the PC market and a shortage of memory chips that is keeping prices high — two markets where Western Digital is a major player. Hall also wrote that Western Digital also has significant potential for cost reductions, following its acquisitions of memory chip companies SanDisk and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies.Hall also raised his price target on Western Digital to 116, from 80.Western Digital stock was up 1.5% to close at 86.05 on the stock market today. The stock earlier hit a high of 88 before pulling back as overall market conditions worsened. Western Digital stock is up 42% since hitting a low of 34.99 in May.Western Digital is benefiting from a shortage of Nand memory chips, which Hall thinks will continue into the fourth quarter.""We note that the Nand supply continues to be tight, as flagged by multiple companies, including HP (HPE) and NetApp (NTAP),"" Hall wrote in a research note Tuesday.He raised his outlook for disk drive shipments by 5%, ""driven by an improving PC market as well as the ongoing Nand shortage, which we expect to continue to drive increased hard disk drive demand.""Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA, also upgraded Western Digital on Tuesday, to a strong buy from buy, and raised his price target to 100, from 92.IBD'S TAKE: Western Digital has been added to the IBD Leaderboard list of top-performing stocks on March 30.

168,HPE,"Shares in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) edged down on the first day of trading following the spinoff of its enterprise services businesses, which merged with Computer Sciences (CSC) to create DXC Technology (DXC).HPE stock closed down 1% to 17.57 in the stock market today. The stock opened at 18 on Monday after closing at 23.70 on Friday. Accounting for the difference between Friday's close and Monday's open were terms of the spinoff: HPE stockholders received about 0.086 shares of DXC common stock for each HPE share.Shares in DXC Technology fell 1.8% to 67.95 on Monday.HPE updated its financial outlook to reflect the spinoff, ""which was largely in line with expectations,"" and consistent with earnings-call commentary,  said Tim Long, a BMO Capital Markets analyst in a report.HPE forecast second-quarter unadjusted earnings in a range of 33 cents to 37 cents a share vs. its earlier outlook of 41 cents to 45 cents. HPE forecast full-year 2017 earnings of $1.46 to $1.56 a share, down from the company's prior guidance of $1.88-$1.98.DXC assumed $600 million of HPE's net pension liabilities and $400 million of HPE's existing debt, while also paying a cash dividend of $3 billion, of which $1.5 billion will be used to pay down existing HPE debt.IBD'S TAKE: To learn about stocks that are breaking out or nearing buy points, try a free trial of IBD's MarketSmith premium charts and stock-screening service, accessible via the home page of Investors.com.About 50.1% of the outstanding shares of DXC common stock is now held by pre-merger HPE stockholders, with pre-merger CSC stockholders holding 49.9% of shares.HPE also plans to spin off its software business, which will be acquired by U.K.-based Micro Focus International.

169,HPE,"DepoMed (DEPO) stock tumbled to a low Wednesday not seen since a year ago, after the company pre-released negative first-quarter guidance and saw its chief executive resign amid a management shake-up and a U.S. senator's probe into opioid marketing.At the closing bell on the stock market today, DepoMed shares fell 3.1% to 13.79, after earlier falling as much as 5%. Shares hit an intraday 12-month high in late September but are down nearly 50% since then.Late Tuesday, DepoMed guided to $95 million to $100 million in first-quarter sales, lagging analysts' broader views by $15 million. That guidance will be revised May 8, during the Q4 conference call.The company also announced a management shift that saw Arthur Higgins replace former CEO James Schoeneck. Gavin Molinelli and William McKee were also added to the board.Higgins, Molinelli and McKee are aligned with activist investor Starboard, which is known for its big stake in HP Enterprise (HPE). Following the shake-up, only three of the nine board members are legacy members, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler noted in a report.DepoMed's board changes also followed reports earlier in the day that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is seeking marketing information, sales records and studies from manufacturers of top-selling opioids in the U.S.McCaskill says sales of prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999. DepoMed was named the fifth top seller of opioids in a CNBC report. Other leaders listed include Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen division, Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Mylan (MYL).IBD'S TAKE: DepoMed isn't the only company facing activist investors. Analysts say Bristol-Myers Squibb could be bought if pressure mounts from investors such as Carl Icahn. Who would bid on Bristol? Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive.Still, DepoMed sold only $190 million in opioids in 2015 vs. the industry leader, Purdue, which made $1.5 billion off its OxyContin drug, a well-known painkiller, according to Janney analyst Ken Trbovich.Trbovich sees the investigation posing little risk to DepoMed, which didn't begin selling opioids until acquiring Lazanda in 2013 and Nucynta in 2015, ""at which time diversion and abuse of prescription opioid medications was decreasing.""Koffler, of Mizuho, sees DepoMed being taken out.""With Starboard remaining involved, we have raised the expected probability of takeout from 30% to 50%,"" she said. ""This generates a hypothetical $16 takeout value for the stock, and may still allow Starboard to record a modest gain on its initial investment.""Alone, DepoMed is worth 10 to 13 per share in a takeout due to lower sales estimates, she said. But Koffler cut her views for this scenario to 50% from 70%. She also trimmed her price target on DepoMed stock to 13 from 16, but kept her neutral rating.Janney's Trbovich has a buy rating on DepoMed stock.RELATED:DepoMed Downgraded On Weakness In Base Business, Stock Run-Up

170,HPE,"Enterprise technology giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) crashed Friday after the company's fiscal year earnings guidance fell well short of views.HPE stock plunged as much as 10% in the stock market today, and ended the regular session down nearly 7% to 22.96. The drop resulted in a failed near-breakout. Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock had formed a cup base with a buy point of 24.89, and shares came within a penny of that price on Wednesday. But Friday's fall of more than 8% below the buy point triggers a sell signal, in any case.The technology company — half of the former Hewlett-Packard that was split into HPE and PC/printer company HP Inc. (HPQ) in 2015 — beat expectations with its earnings per share minus items and revenue for its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31.

IBD's New Highs list, though, ranks record-setters by other performance metrics.HPE is spinning off its services unit to Computer Sciences (CSC) and merging its software unit with U.K.-based Micro Focus, with the former slated for completion by April 1 and the latter by Sept. 1. But the ""key areas of weakness were servers and storage"" which is ""worrisome as these segments will be part of 'RemainCo' after the company completes"" the CSC and Micro Focus moves, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said in a research report.Seyrafi cut his price target on HPE stock to 25 from 26, but he maintained an outperform rating, saying ""we believe that multiple negative factors hit the company all at once,"" including a constrained supply of needed Nand flash storage.""While HPE shares benefited in 2016 from a strong capital allocation program and an aggressive plan to separate business units, core execution issues may cause worry about the pro forma EPS outlook, now $1.13-$1.23,"" Pacific Crest analyst Alex Kurtz wrote in a research note, maintaining a sector weight rating on the stock.RELATED:HPE Keeps Slimming, But Where's The Beef?Universal Display Hits Record High On Earnings Beat

173,HPE,"Dell owner Michael Dell as well as investors in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and IBM (IBM) -- the big 3 computer server companies -- ought to appreciate Bernstein's latest take on how much the cloud is cannibalizing the server market. It's not, says the investment bank.""Isn't it unbelievable?"" chided Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu in a Friday research note re-issued Tuesday. ""The cannibalization theory most investors and industry observers take for granted and as an axiom to any proper thinking about the future of this industry is just plain wrong: The cloud grew from zero to approximately 20% of total enterprise compute while shipments into traditional data centers kept stable"" from 2005 through 2015, he said, using Gartner and Bernstein estimates that showed server shipments near 8 million units annually during those 11 years.""Want a last nail in the coffin of this silly cannibalization theory?"" Ferragu wrote. ""Over the same 2005-2105 period, virtualization went from zero to about 70% penetration, increasing on average the utilization rate of servers by a factor of approximately seven times. This didn't trigger any cannibalization either (although countless sell-side analysts and investors take it for granted that virtualization killed the server market).""What happened was ""very simple,"" Ferragu explained. From 2005 through 2015, thanks to virtualization and the cloud, the cost of computing fell sharply.That sharp fall ""never meant money spent on compute capacity decreased,"" he said. ""It meant the amount of compute consumed by enterprises went through the roof. Nothing was 'moved to the cloud.' The cloud brought exceptionally cheap compute and enterprise used it to grow their consumption of compute.""In December, Gartner said Q3 server shipments rose 9.2% from the year-earlier quarter, and server revenue rose 7.5%.  By company, what became Hewlett Packard Enterprise on Nov. 1 led the world in Q3, with server revenue up 9.1% to $3.7 billion for the quarter, followed by Dell up 9% to $2.4 billion, then IBM up 5.1% to $1.3 billion, after it sold its lower-end x86 server business to Lenovo.""Dear reader, you probably consume 1,000 times more mobile data than in 2005, about 100 times more Internet traffic in general and you use on average about 1,000 times more transistors in your life,"" said the analyst.Total cloud revenue will grow about 50% annually over the next five years, and assuming cloud revenue per server will grow at 10% annually, largely due to Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, ""this still leaves us with about 40% per annum growth in server count,"" Ferragu said. ""As we saw absolutely no sign of slowdown while the cloud went from zero to 20% of compute, our intellectual honesty forces us to consider traditional enterprise data center will remain broadly stable. ...""The cloud will grow easily to well over 50% -- actually 60% in our forecast -- of the total of compute volumes in five years.""In the stock market today, shares of HPE rose nearly 1% and IBM rose a fraction. Privately held Dell is in the process of acquiring storage systems leader EMC (EMC), which was flat Tuesday.

174,HPE,"The IBM (IBM) revenue numbers stand out like a broken arm.Deep into a major transition that has shed multibillion-dollar businesses, IBM has reported 16 straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines. And it's not done yet. Another three quarters of declines are expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.In the past several years, Big Blue has shed computer hardware units, reshuffled its software businesses and realigned its workforce to reduce costs as it focuses on growth areas such as cloud computing, Big Data analytics, security and mobile computing -- areas that it calls strategic imperatives. Since 2010, IBM has invested about $30 billion in these areas.They include the creation of a new business unit, Cognitive Business Solutions, with its backbone being IBM’s advanced Watson computer. Watson is being used in health care, the Internet of Things, analytics and other fields. IBM says Watson can address a total market opportunity near $2 trillion.""We continue to make significant progress in our transformation to higher value,"" IBM CEO Virginia Rometty said in the company's first-quarter earnings release last Monday. ""We strengthened our existing portfolio while investing aggressively in new opportunities like Watson Health, Watson Internet of Things and hybrid cloud.""The IBM transformation is showing progress. IBM revenue from strategic imperatives rose 26% in 2015 in constant currency to $29 billion, compared with a 12% decline in overall revenue to $81.7 billion. Strategic imperatives now comprise 35% of total revenue, up from 22% two years ago. IBM has targeted strategic imperative revenue to reach $40 billion and at least 40% of revenue by 2018.But when will the revenue slide reverse?  UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, in a research report, says that 2017 is likely the turning point.“IBM is trying hard to transform its business and also to change the narrative from legacy loser to cloud and cognitive winner,” Milunovich wrote. He added, “Just because strategic imperatives gains the upper hand does not mean IBM's top line is off to the races, but it could mean the worst would be over.”As to whether Watson and its Cognitive Business can save IBM, Milunovich says that it’s too soon to know, as IBM does not disclose the Watson-driven revenue just yet.“Old IBM is in secular decline, but we believe cognitive eventually could create a material new revenue stream drawing from outside existing IT budgets. We don't expect revenue to be material for another three years, but the narrative is important now, and eventually Watson could be a $10 billion business,"" he wrote.Milunovich has a neutral rating on IBM and price target of 150.IBM stock was flat, near 148, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. IBM stock hit its all-time high of 215.90 in March 2013. It hit a six-year low in February but is up 27% since then.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Gracha has a more negative view on IBM and says that revenue won’t stabilize until 2018.“We see a painful multiyear turnaround from here, which drives underperformance,” Garcha wrote in a research note. “We believe that large parts of IBM’s business (hardware, operating systems, services) are being impacted by the cloud.”As to Watson, he said, “While we do believe the opportunity here is significant, it is also very early, with the commercial impact of such initiatives that may take several years, if not decades.”Garcha has an underperform rating on IBM stock and a price target of just 110.Other giants in the information technology field are also going through transitions and struggling to accelerate revenue growth. They include Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).“We believe the competitive challenges are emerging from companies seeking to build a business model similar to IBM’s, notably Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Cisco, Oracle, EMC and Dell,”  wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani in a research note.Of these competitors, he says, HPE is closest to IBM's model, with Cisco another. Dell is acquiring EMC.Daryanani has a sector perform rating on IBM stock and a price target of 155.

175,HPE,"Realizing that more big customers than ever are paying bigger dollars for ServiceNow (NOW) software in the cloud, investors bought up ServiceNow stock Thursday, healing much of the pain that they endured through the infamous Software Slump of January and February.ServiceNow stock shot up 18% in morning trade on the stock market today before easing back to a 15% gain, near 74.50, Thursday afternoon. It's 18% off a record high at 91.28 set Dec. 4, but it's more than 60% up from the nearly two-year low of 46 reached Feb. 8.ServiceNow late Wednesday issued first-quarter earnings and sales that exceeded Wall Street estimates.Shares of rival SAP (SAP) were down a fraction Thursday afternoon, but Salesforce.com (CRM) stock was up 1%.""We now have 249 customers each paying us more than $1 million in annualized contract value, an increase of 48% year over year,"" ServiceNow CFO Michael Scarpelli said in the company's earnings release. ""We also landed a record 13 upsells in the (first) quarter, each with an annualized contract value greater than $1 million.""Those results helped drive Q1 revenue up 44% to $305.9 million vs. the $301 million expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) EPS rose to nine cents from a penny in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had expected seven cents.Excluded from the adjusted earnings, among other things, were $270 million in legal expenses to settle patent infringement lawsuits that BMC Software and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) brought against ServiceNow. It brought the bottom line to a $333 million net loss vs. $58 million lost a year earlier, or a $2.06 GAAP loss per share vs. a 38-cent loss in 2015's Q1.Analysts and investors prefer to concentrate on the apples-to-apples non-GAAP comparisons.William Blair analyst Justin Furby reiterated his firm's outperform rating on ServiceNow without a price target, though he said, ""The stock can double (or more)"" over the next five years.""All other first-quarter metrics (revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, deferred revenue, free cash flow) came in ahead of guidance and the Street, and the company's second-quarter billings outlook of 31%-33% growth (37%-39% subscription billings growth) bracketed the consensus view of 32%,"" said Furby in a Thursday research note.Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis maintained a buy rating with a 90 price target on ServiceNow. ""We believe full-year guidance is likely conservative and sets the company up to outperform for the remainder of the year,"" he said in a Thursday note.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi raised his price target on ServiceNow stock to 90 from 80.

176,HPE,"IBM (IBM) closed down 5.6% at 144 Tuesday, following a first-quarter earnings report late Monday that beat estimates but still left room for concern.IBM has been undergoing a major transition, shedding older technologies while making a concerted push into growth areas such as cloud computing, Big Data analytics, security and mobile computing -- areas it calls strategic imperatives. The transition helps explain why revenue growth has declined each quarter for the past four years.In its Q1 earnings results, IBM reported revenue of $18.7 billion, down 4.6% from the year-earlier quarter but edging the Wall Street consensus estimate of $18.3 billion. Revenue from strategic imperatives rose 14%. Total cloud revenue rose 34%.Earnings per share ex items of $2.35 easily beat views of $2.09, as polled by Thomson Reuters, but were down 19% and marked the fourth quarter in a row of EPS declines.IBM stock fell in the stock market today presumably on the view that Q2 expectations are below estimates. IBM does not provide formal quarterly guidance, but its implied EPS guidance of $2.85 for Q2 is below the consensus estimate of 3.01. Despite the Q1 beat, IBM did not increase but instead maintained its full-year earnings outlook.IBD's Take: How healthy is IBM's stock and how does it stack up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupRBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani maintained a sector perform rating on IBM stock, and a price target of 155.“We believe the competitive challenges are emerging from companies seeking to build a business model similar to IBM's, notably Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Cisco (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), and Dell,” he wrote. Of these competitors, he said, Hewlett-Packard is the closest. Another is Cisco.“Beyond Hewlett-Packard and Cisco, there are also others attempting to recreate the IBM model,” he wrote.A harsher report on IBM came from Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha, who reiterated an underperform rating and a price target of 110 on IBM stock.“We believe the quality of earnings was again low and the manner in which IBM has chosen to manage its business seems unsustainable,” Garcha wrote. “We believe the secular and structural challenges facing IBM remain, and specifically see limited improvement in Services and Software margins.”UBS analyst Steven Milunovich maintained a neutral rating on IBM but raised his price target to 150 from 132.“The quarter was mixed with revenue and EPS beating due to currency improvement, acquisitions, and the Japan tax rebate,” he wrote. “We give IBM credit for changing the narrative,"" with an emphasis on becoming a leader in the new category of Cognitive Computing, which includes its Watson computer business, he wrote.Drexel Hamilton raised its revenue forecast, maintained its EPS projection and raised the price target to 166 from 160.

177,HPE,"Workflow software developer ServiceNow (NOW) lightened its wallet by $270 million, then lightened its stock price Thursday.ServiceNow stock stumbled 3% after the bell in the stock market today before recovering. It was down a fraction, above 63, in afternoon trading Thursday, 30% off its record high of 91.28, set Dec. 4. ServiceNow went public in December 2012 at 18.Investors seemed none too pleased with the size of ServiceNow's disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed after Wednesday's close, to settle patent infringement litigation with BMC Software and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). ServiceNow had disclosed in early March that at least some settlement was imminent.Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock was down more than 1% Thursday afternoon. ServiceNow rivals SAP (SAP) and Salesforce.com (CRM) were both up a fraction, with SAP just 2% off recent highs and Salesforce 8% off an all-time high 81.24 set March 31.ServiceNow, which delivers its software via the cloud, said that it is taking the $270 million charge in its first quarter, which it's slated to report Wednesday after the market close.""The settlement terms are rather significant, at over one-third of ServiceNow's net cash balance as of Dec. 31, 2015, but still represent less than one year's free cash flow (management has guided for $325 million of free cash flow in 2016), and both management and investors should welcome having these lawsuits in the rearview mirror,"" said William Blair analyst Justin Furby in a research note Thursday.He said, ""The company should benefit from the removal of ongoing legal fees that have been included in non-GAAP expenses."" Furby said that he won't be changing his Q1 estimates for ServiceNow but will look for ""additional detail"" on Wednesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected ServiceNow to report earnings per share minus items of seven cents, up from a penny in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is expected to rise 42% to $301 million. With revenue rising 47% for 2015, the company topped $1 billion in sales for the first time last year, contributing to its three-year 60% sales growth rate.RBC Capital Management analyst Matthew Hedberg estimated that the settlement would cost $1.50 per share off ServiceNow's presettlement cash balance of $7 per share.Hedberg, who still rates ServiceNow a ""top pick,"" said in a Thursday research note, ""There could be slight upside to forward margin expectations given an early resolution, as management likely planned for a longer trial and additional expenses."" He noted ""no future royalty payments"" from the settlements.""Overall, we are glad to put this issue to bed and believe focus can now return fully to execution, which had been less than ideal in 2015,"" he said.Despite its fast growth, ServiceNow experienced growing pains in 2015, so analysts will look for clues that might firm up expectations for 2016. For the year, Wall Street expects EPS of 60 cents minus items on sales of $1.36 billion, up from 40 cents on $1 billion in 2015.After meeting with ServiceNow CFO Mike Scarpelli Feb. 2, Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne said in a research note that the company is going to remain in the penalty box until investors feel more comfortable about the 2016 forecast. He pointed out that ServiceNow had missed its own annual contract value target in 2015 due to ""elevated sales turnover"" and a pause in hiring in Q2.Sales staff hiring ramped up late last year, but billings guidance of 33% to 34% growth for 2016 ""assumes very little/no sales productivity improvement and modest growth expectations for EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) as the new regional sales head ramps up,"" Materne warned.Still, he had a buy rating and 83 price target on ServiceNow stock, seeing growth in its market and in adoption rates for its platform. The company now averages seven custom apps per customer, up from 5.6 a year ago, Materne pointed out.

178,HPE,"Enterprise software developer ServiceNow (NOW) advised the Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday that a federal court in Texas has granted a 30-day stay of all deadlines -- notably this Friday's deadline to start trial -- in its defense against patent-violation claims by BMC Software.ServiceNow and BMC requested the stay ""so that the parties may document the agreement and submit appropriate dismissal papers,"" ServiceNow said in an 8K filing with the SEC.What now?ServiceNow stock was down 1%, below 60, in early afternoon trade in the stock market today, after rising 3.6% Tuesday as word spread that a legal settlement was in the works. ServiceNow stock still is up for the week and could notch its fourth consecutive week of gains, after shares hit a 22-month low in early February. Shares are still 34% off a record high of 91.28 set Dec. 4. ServiceNow went public in June 2012, priced at 18.More-established rivals Salesforce.com (CRM) and SAP (SAP) were making their own moves. SAP, the largest in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group by market cap, was up a fraction, near 77, Wednesday afternoon, just 5% off a nearly two-year high of 81.21 set Dec. 29. No. 2 player Salesforce.com was up 1.5%, near 71, 14% off a record high of 82.90 set Nov. 19.With a market cap of $9.6 billion, a tenth the size of SAP, ServiceNow is the fifth-largest member of the industry group.Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne, in a research note Wednesday, said that the dispute with BMC is ""more of a short-term concern ... than a wall of worry related to a possible penalty or injunction.""Nevertheless, we believe the (pending) settlement between the two companies does remove a near-term overhang and should allow investors to refocus attention on the longer-term opportunity,"" he wrote. ""We do not believe that the trial with BMC was impacting sales cycles. ... We continue to like the risk/reward longer-term, but as we noted after meeting with the company in early February, NOW is likely to remain in 'show me' mode until it reports"" its Q1 results.ServiceNow stock crashed 16% on Jan. 28 after the company reported Q4 billings below expectations, though EPS ex items jumped 533% to 19 cents, twice analysts’ expectations, and revenue rose 44% to $285.6 million, also topping Wall Street views.Materne maintained a buy rating on ServiceNow stock, with an 83 price target.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) also has patent infringement claims pending against ServiceNow, filed originally by the former Hewlett-Packard company.
"
179,HPE,"ServiceNow (NOW) stock rose Tuesday, with word out that it might be able to settle some of its patent litigation with privately held BMC Software, avoiding a trial scheduled to start Friday.A cloud-based business software rival of SAP (SAP) and Salesforce.com (CRM), ServiceNow shares were up more than 4% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 60.70. William Blair analyst Justin Furby suggested the possible settlement may “be a mild positive, as the prospect of a jury trial and the potential appeals process ... would have likely created overhang on the stock.“More importantly, until this point, we believe the litigation has not affected ServiceNow’s sales cycles,” Furby wrote in a research note Tuesday. But the increased public attention of a trial “could have delayed sales for SerivceNow, particularly if the court would have ruled in BMC’s favor.“Lastly, BMC had sought injunctive relief, and had the lawsuit and subsequent appeals process gone against ServiceNow, it could have faced the prospect of discontinuing or rewriting certain of its applications,” Furby said.BMC sued ServiceNow in September 2014, claiming seven patent violations. Courts dismissed two claims, and BMC withdrew a third. But last month, BMC filed a second lawsuit against ServiceNow, claiming infringement of five patents, two of which were included in the original litigation, Furby said, adding that he didn’t know if the proposed settlement included this second case.He said he spoke with someone at ServiceNow who told him that “all matters in controversy between the parties have been settled, in principle.” ServiceNow did not immediately respond to IBD’s request for comment.The four remaining claims of the original lawsuit involve ""managing a computer network via hierarchy,"" collecting performance management data, determining the root cause of a problem, and ""spotlight visualization"" for IT service models, Furby noted.As for separate litigation filed against ServiceNow in February 2014 by the former Hewlett-Packard Co. -- now represented in the action by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) -- claiming eight patent infringements, the court threw out four claims, stayed litigation on two, and scheduled an April 29 hearing and a May 22, 2017, trial date for the remaining two claims, Furby said.“The BMC settlement has yet to be finalized, and we are unclear what the amount will be and whether ServiceNow will be paying ongoing licensing fees to BMC as part of a potential settlement,” Furby wrote.ServiceNow has not been accruing reserves for damages but has been “expensing significant ongoing attorney fees ... incorporated into guidance,” he said. Furby put the company’s net cash pile at about $700 million and estimated $325 million in free cash flow in 2016 prior to any settlement.ServiceNow stock is trading 34% off a record high 91.28 set Dec. 4. Its stock plunged 15.7% on Jan. 28 after reporting billings below expectations, although fourth-quarter non-GAAP EPS was up 533% to 19 cents, doubling analysts' consensus, and revenue was up 44% to $285.6 million, also topping Wall Street.The IBD Computer Software-Enterprise industry group, led by SAP and Salesforce.com, has fallen 18% from its November highs. With $91.9 billion in market cap, SAP leads the group, followed by Salesforce’s $46.8 billion market value. ServiceNow's market cap stands at $9.6 billion.Shares of SAP and  Salesforce were up a fraction Tuesday afternoon, but Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock was down 2.5%.

180,HPE,"You can almost hear the conversation: ""That team did such a great job on that project,"" said CEO Joe Fiction, ""let's give them the entire product line to operate and save some dough.""Converting traditional business process outsourcing (BPO) into business process management (BPM) framed the Indo-U.S. BPO Summit this week in Orlando, Fla., sponsored by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce and India's National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM). Billed as a first-of-its-kind conference, the timing couldn't have been better, as many of the outsourcers were trading near record highs after a slow start to the year.Service-level agreements ""are changing to reflect this (BPO-to-BPM conversion), becoming more business-outcome-focused and leading the market to shift from a pure RFP (requests for proposal) procurement approach to a managed-service, end-to-end solution offering,"" said Cowen analyst Bryan Bergin in a research note Friday. ""This drives the shift from BPO to BPM and a strategic partner position. The effect of this evolution increases the stickiness of the revenue stream but also ties the fortunes of the provider even closer to that of their client base.""Many BPOs were represented at the show, including Genpact (G), Wipro (WIT), Convergys (CVG) and WNS Holdings (WNS). But Bergin focused on Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and ExlService Holdings (EXLS) for their ""industry depth and value-added service approaches that position each to win in this evolving landscape,"" he said.Cognizant stock was up a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 63 but still 10% off its Oct. 28 record high. ExlService stock was up more than 1%, near 52.50, just off of Wednesday's all-time high of 52.92.Wipro stock was up 1%, 5% off its 52-week high. Genpact stock hit a record high Friday and was up nearly 1.5% Friday afternoon. WNS was up 3.5% Friday, just 7% from an eight-week high touched Nov. 2. Infosys (INFY) stock was up more than 1% and near a five-year high. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock was up 3% and hit a new record high Friday.""We favor EXLS for its traditional BPO model pairing with an operations consulting business and rapidly growing analytics offering,"" Cowen's Bergin said. ""CTSH is building its BPM via a vertical-specific approach, leveraging its scale and expertise in health care and financial services to drive its (approximately) $1 billion business that is growing faster than the company average. We favor such approaches in the evolving BPM landscape.""Cowen carries ExlService with an outperform rating and a 63 price target. Cowen too rates Cognizant as outperform, with a 65 target.ExlService is a member of IBD's Commercial Services-Outsourcing industry group, which hit a record high Friday. Cognizant is a member of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, which was trading 9% off its all-time high set Nov. 5.Both companies are near the top of their heaps for overall stock and operating performance, with ExlService earning an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best possible 99, and Cognizant a 93 CR.

181,HPE,"While investors applauded Hewlett Packard Enterprise's first quarterly performance as an independent company -- beating Wall Street estimates and driving its stock up more than 13% Friday -- some analysts and owners are pushing CEO Meg Whitman to compete harder.That means more aggressively taking on cloud enterprise leaders Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), and buying up software  rivals such as Workday (WDAY) or Salesforce.com (CRM), rather than directing cash to shareholders.""I think we need to give Meg a chance to see if she can take advantage of the opportunities in servers with the cloud migration led by Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft on the service and software side,"" said Daniel Morgan, vice president of Synovus Trust, which holds 251,971 shares of HPE, in a Friday interview with IBD.""Further, the 54% year-over-year growth in the Q1 2016 quarter in networking allows HPE to build more momentum in this space"" vs. rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), he said.""And finally as we discussed before, the huge opportunity to expand the software unit with its 17%-plus operating margins (enables) a large acquisition in the cloud space. Right now software is just 8%-10% of total HPE revenues.""Buying enterprise software rivals Salesforce or Workday specifically is ""a chance to make that unit significant by bringing it up to 20%-25% of revenues,"" he said. ""Post-split, Hewlett Packard Enterprise was supposed to be the growth portion of the Hewlett-Packard Co., (creating) a reinvigorated growth company.""Nevertheless, happy with HPE's earnings performance issued after Thursday's market close, investors bid up its stock up 13.5% to close at 15.44 in the stock market today. That's less than 3% below its Dec. 1 high since splitting from its parent Nov. 1.For now, HPE stockholders interested in growth of any kind will need patience because the company is still shrinking, despite the slight Q1 beat.Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported earnings of 41 cents per share in the fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, on sales down 3% to $12.72 billion vs. pro forma figures from a year earlier. The results slightly beat the average view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which called for EPS of 40 cents on sales of $12.68 billion. The non-GAAP 41 cents EPS is down from 47 cents a year earlier. (However, if HPE had been a standalone company at the time, Q1 2015 adjusted EPS would have been 44 cents, the company said in a March 1 note.)That's pretty much as planned, with HPE not projecting much growth until fiscal 2018. For Q2 ending in April, HPE expects EPS ex items of 39 cents to 43 cents.  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q2 EPS ex items of 42 cents on sales of $12.297 billion before Thursday's earnings release, but on Friday, the revenue consensus was revised up to $12.332 billion.For the entire fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31,  analysts  polled by Thomson Reuters projected $1.87 EPS ex items for fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31, on revenue revised up Friday to $50.805 billion. HPE earlier had modeled $50.81 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016, down 2.5% from a $52.12 billion pro forma in fiscal 2015.The slightly smaller half of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., now called HP Inc. (HPQ), kept the legacy PCs, printers and ticker. HP Inc. lifted 0.6% to 11.18 Friday. Hewlett Packard Enterprise kept the enterprise software, servers, networking and financial services businesses.To encourage patience among Hewlett Packard Enterprise shareholders, CFO Tim Stonesifer said HPE will “return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders” in fiscal 2016, after devoting $1.3 billion to share repurchases and dividends in Q1. In ""addition,"" Stonesifer said, shareholders will receive a ""majority"" of proceeds from the sale of a 51% stake in its Chinese server and storage business to Tsinghua Holdings, valued at $2.3 billion at the time the deal was announced last May. The transaction was supposed to be done by February, but Whitman said regulatory delays have pushed back closing to May, after which the cash will flow to shareholders.To UBS analyst Steve Milunovich, who complained in the post-earnings-release conference call that HPE shares were priced too low, Whitman chuckled: “We appreciate that, which is why we’re backing up the truck” to buy back more shares, which helps boost the price.Whitman advised analysts that by investing internally and encouraging organic growth “you don’t end up with a Frankenstein of architecture"" as the company would risk doing by  growing through acquisitions. She cited HPE for pursuing both paths.“Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including servers, cloud, high-performance computing, IoT (Internet of Things), all-flash storage, Aruba and converged systems.” Aruba Networks is a networking leader in mobile enterprise that the old Hewlett-Packard agreed to buy last March for about $3 billion, strengthening the new HPE's rivalry with Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks.As for ""taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace,"" Whitman said, ""we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of IBM's (IBM) sale of their server business to Lenovo. ... We have a big opportunity to go take (merging) Dell and EMC (EMC) business, much as we took a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo.”She told CNBC on Friday that ""in the last quarter, we had about 107 deals that we actually took from Dell/EMC.""She also told analysts that HPE has become the ""leading infrastructure provider for SAP (SAP) HANA (application server) with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor.”In the cloud, she said, ""following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials.”It just wasn't enough for Needham analyst Richard Kugele, who chided the company in a research note issued Friday, arguing that the $2.3 billion windfall from Tsinghua should be spent on organic or M&A growth, not shareholders' short-term benefit.""We had hoped that post-split, HPE would be able to focus on getting its house in order and leverage its cash and balance sheet to buy/invest in solutions that solve their product gaps,"" Kugele said. ""Instead, the company seems intent on continuing financial engineering by doubling its cash return to shareholders (including the pending Tsinghua cash). In our view, this creates no sustainable value for the company or its investors but merely provides a floor for the stock during a period of poor enterprise spending.""With no material growth, revenue improvement or product strategy to build a buy thesis around, we reiterate our hold rating on the stock.""Said Morgan, the Synovus Trust portfolio manager who wants to give Whitman time to execute: ""I did hear HPE management touting its share repurchases and FCF (free cash-flow) generation capability on the call. And this is very reminiscent of when Mark Hurd was leading HPQ  (the former Hewlett-Packard Co.) and grew the share price through financial engineering and not new product growth.""Hurd is now co-CEO of Oracle (ORCL), one of HPE's toughest software rivals, and another legacy giant growing slowly.

186,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) said Tuesday it is paying $1.09 billion for data storage provider Nimble Storage (NMBL), which was also viewed as a takeover target of rival Cisco Systems (CSCO).HPE offered $12.50 per share for Nimble, a 45% premium to its closing price on Monday. That catapulted Nimble shares by more than 46% as they closed the regular trading session at 12.58. HPE stock was down 1.1% to 22.82, while shares in Cisco ticked up a penny to 34.20.Both HPE and Cisco aim to acquire technologies for next-generation data centers designed for cloud computing. HPE said in January it would buy privately held cloud software company SimpliVity, a rival of Nutanix (NTNX), for $650 million in cash. Nimble Storage, Nutanix, and Pure Storage (PSTG) are among smaller companies that analysts have speculated could be targets of Cisco.Pure Storage stock surged more than 11% to 10.47 on the stock market today.

He says Cisco could win more business from internet and tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB).

But gains and losses were relatively mild in the sector. Drugmakers and hospital stocks lagged. Managed care firms like Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) outperformed. Drugmakers were weak after President Trump tweeted again about his intent to get drug prices lower.Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by less than 2-to-1.In merger news, Sterling Bancorp (STL) slumped 4% and was testing support at the 50-day moving average on news it's acquiring Astoria Financial (AF) for $2.2 billion.

Some other small plays in the group rose, possibly on takeover speculation: Pure Storage (PSTG) jumped 11%. Qualstar (QBAK) rocketed 14% higher. Shares of HPE ended effectively flat.The video game developer and cable satellite industries also marked up strong sessions.The recreational vehicle makers group dropped hard as Thor Industries (THO) dived 10% in powerful trade as investors took profits after the company reported a broadly solid fiscal second quarter. A 27% rise in earnings and a 63% revenue surge beat analyst expectations and validated management's strategy and execution of its $576 million acquisition of Jayco last year.Thor's decline broke below support at its 50-day moving average in heavy trade, and it reversed all gains from a 106.43 buy point. Both moves are sell signals.Other RV makers and suppliers also felt the undertow, with Winnebago (WGO), Patrick Industries (PATK) and Rev Group (REVG) all down more than 5%.

192,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock rocketed 15% in morning trading on the stock market today. Late Thursday HPE edged above earnings-per-share expectations for its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, met on revenue and roughly met views with its Q2 earnings guidance, while also promising to return more capital to shareholders.For Q1, the company posted EPS ex items of 41 cents, down 6.8% from pro forma earnings of 44 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell 3% to $12.7 billion. For Q2, HPE expects EPS ex items of 39 cents to 43 cents. It didn't give revenue guidance.""All in all, the headline news looks like a solid report from a top/bottom-line perspective,"" Daniel Morgan, a vice president of HPE shareholder Synovus Trust, told IBD via email.On Wednesday, the company filed with the SEC to change its pro forma figures for the year-earlier quarter, which it issued after its Nov. 1 split from the legacy Silicon Valley pioneer Hewlett-Packard Co.HPE contains the business software and services, servers, storage and cloud-migration operations of the old company, with the new HP Inc. (HPQ) taking the PC and printer business. HPE now has more freedom to battle broad-based business-technology providers such as IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL).HPE changed its year-earlier figure for EPS minus items to 44 cents, from 48 cents. It didn't change its pro forma revenue figure.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected adjusted EPS of 40 cents for fiscal Q1, though it's unclear if that consensus estimate would have changed with the new pro forma figure. Analysts expected revenue of $12.68 billion.For Q2, analysts had modeled EPS ex items of 42 cents on sales of $12.3 billion.The company's fiscal 2016 EPS ex items guidance of $1.85 to $1.95 met the views of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. And HPE maintained its fiscal 2016 guidance on free cash flow -- cash from operations minus capital expenditures -- of $2 billion to $2.2 billion.HPE shares fell 2.2% to 13.60 Thursday. The stock, which debuted in early November, peaked Dec. 1 at 15.88.Looking for ways to speed growth and improve shareholder value, the Hewlett-Packard split came in the face of faster-growing competition from upstarts leading the way to cloud computing.Last week, HP Inc. said its Q1 EPS and sales each fell 12%, to 36 cents and $12.2 billion.""During our first quarter as an independent company, we saw the progress that comes from being more focused and nimble,"" HPE CEO Meg Whitman said in the company's earnings release. Whitman also serves as chair of HP Inc. and had been CEO and chairwoman of the former Hewlett-Packard Co. before engineering the split-up.“We delivered a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant-current revenue growth, and excluding the impact of recent M&A activity, we saw revenue growth in constant currency across every business segment for the first time since 2010,” she said.Revenue rose 4% year over year in constant currency, the company said.HPE CFO Tim Stonesifer said in the earnings release that the company will “return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders” in fiscal 2016, after devoting $1.3 billion to share repurchases and dividends in Q1.The networking business was the clear winner last quarter, and in fact the only business that notched revenue growth. The company said its Enterprise Group overall rose 1% to $7.1 billion in revenue, with a 13.4% operating margin. Networking sales jumped 54% from the year-earlier quarter -- more than 60% in constant currency -- but storage revenue fell 3%, and tech services tumbled 9%.Also slipping were server sales, albeit by just 1%. Before the release, shareholder Morgan, of Synovus Trust, told IBD he was “looking for stabilization in areas of weakness (by) expecting strength in servers into next year, as cloud and Big Data growth spur purchases. Servers represents 48% of the Enterprise (Group) segment's revenue and was (up) 5% year-to-year last quarter.”HPE's separate Enterprise Services segment sales fell 6% to $4.7 billion, the company said. Infrastructure tech outsourcing sales fell 8%, while application and business services revenue slipped 3%.Software services fell 10% to $780 million. License revenue fell 6%, support fell 13%, professional services revenue contracted 7%, and software as a service (Saas) sales fell 9%.Financial services, which help customers pay for their purchases, fell 3% to $776 million.In its filing with the SEC on Wednesday, the company said the main differences with its new pro forma EPS number for the year-earlier quarter ""are related to cash acquired and debt incurred by HPE just prior to the distribution (of new shares to old shareholders). The primary differences between the previously provided figures and adjusted cash flow from operations and adjusted free cash flow are related to prepaids, deposits and liabilities associated with property, plant and equipment, pension obligations and income tax asset and liabilities that transferred to HPE from its former parent just prior to the distribution.""

193,HPE,"Stocks showed modest losses in early trading Friday after a positive February jobs report.The Nasdaq lost 0.3%, the S&P 500 gave up 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1%.Jobs and company reports were the early drivers in the stock market today, with the Labor Department reporting nonfarm payrolls expanded by 242,000 workers in February. The department also revised January's job tally upward to 172,000 from 151,000. Consensus estimates targeted an increase to 190,000 new jobs in February.Private employers added 230,000 employees during the month, up from 182,000 in January and crushing estimates for an uptick to 183,000 new hires.

Earnings leapt 195%, revenue surged 61% and gross margins expanded to 41.1% vs. 33.6% a year ago. The stock ended Thursday less than 5% below a 26.64 cup base buy point.The mood overseas at the end of a strong week was positive, with most markets moving higher. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index posted the strongest gain, up 1.2% Friday, cinching a 4.2% gain in its third straight weekly advance. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.3% Friday, enough to clear a 5.1% advance in its third straight up week.In Europe, the benchmark indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt all traded up around 0.9% near midday.

194,HPE,"One day before Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is slated to post fiscal Q1 earnings, the stock of half of the old computing pioneer Hewlett-Packard Co. rose 4.7% in the stock market today. The stock was doing what analysts expect it to do, outperforming the other half of the legacy company,  HP Inc. (HPQ), whose shares fell a fraction.The stocks, of course, reflect the market's interpretation of the companies' operational performance since splitting into two from the legacy corporation in November.  HP, which reported earnings last week, kept the PC and printer businesses -- and the old HPQ ticker. Hewlett Packard Enterprise kept the server, storage, networking, enterprise-software and cloud-migration businesses, seen as faster-growing endeavors, and kept the CEO, Meg Whitman (who in addition is chairwoman of HP Inc).Hardware and equipment-product sales comprise about 38% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise revenue, with services generating the rest.For the quarter ended Jan . 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect HPE to report earnings down 17% to 40 cents per share on revenue down 2.7% to $12.68 billion, vs. a pro forma 48 cents on $13.03 billion in the 2015 Q1. The company reports after the market close.HP Inc.'s Q1 EPS and sales each fell 12%, to 36 cents and $12.2 billion.For its first fiscal year ending in October, Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects EPS minus items of $1.85-$1.95, up from the $1.84 pro forma earned in 2015, on revenue of $50.81 billion, down 2.5% from the pro forma $52.12 billion of 2015. Analysts have modeled $1.87 and $50.73 billion.""We like HPE because decent execution should be sufficient to move the stock higher,"" said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a February research note.  ""We believe growth in servers, networking and storage, stabilization in high-margin technology services and continued improvement in the Enterprise Services margin should help close the gap between the current P/E of 7x and our target of 10x.""Storage head Manish Goel, as well as a few of our industry sources, say that HPE is taking business from Dell/EMC (EMC) during their proposed merge.  Still, we think it's time for Meg Whitman to provide a vision for the company. IBM (IBM) has cognitive computing.  What does hardware-heavy HPE want to be in 3-5 years and what will be its differentiation?""Nomura doesn't cover HPE, analyst James Chen advised IBD Wednesday, but he and colleague Jeffrey Kvaal are watching closely as HPE competes with companies that Nomura does cover, such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Arista Networks (ANET).Nomura said it expects 3% sales growth for HPE's enterprise group this fiscal year, compared with Cisco and Juniper's guidance ranges of 3% to 6%.Hewlett Packard Enterprise's ""projected growth rates are not likely to threaten networking incumbents, but don’t imply much share loss either,"" the Nomura analysts said in a research note.HPE's hybrid cloud business competes with IBM, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Cloud Platform services.Big Data startup Hortonworks (HDP), the Hadoop developer, on Tuesday said it would collaborate with HPE on the use of Apache Spark, making use of shared memory in HPE enterprise environments.UBS analyst Mulinovich, in his February note, said that ""upon the split we argued in favor of HPE over HPQ stock. . . .  Hewlett Packard Enterprise has momentum with expected slight revenue growth in constant currency and an improving operating margin in fiscal 2016.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock is 12.5% off its Dec. 1 record high of 15.88, while HP Inc. is 26.5% off its record high of 14.82, set Nov. 24.

196,HPE,"The next round of price cutting in public cloud computing services could come from Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, just as Amazon.com and Microsoft show some restraint, says a Goldman Sachs research report.Amazon Web Services (AWS), part of Amazon.com (AMZN), is the biggest provider of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), where customers rent computer servers and data storage systems via the Internet. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet’s Google are the next biggest.The new boss of Google’s cloud business, Diane Greene, will make her debut at that unit's user conference March 23 to 24, notes the Goldman Sachs report. Greene, a Google board member since January 2012, founded virtualization leader VMware (VMW), which she led as CEO until she was forced out in 2008.In November, Google acquired Greene’s startup, Bebop, for $380 million.While AWS has been the biggest IaaS price-cutter of the last decade, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has been aggressive since moving into the market. Google slashed prices in March 2014, October 2014 and May-June 2015, Goldman analyst Heather Bellini said in the report.“Another 20% to 30% across-the-board price cut from Google in 2016 would not be surprising,” wrote Bellini. “This could be announced as early as their GCP Next conference in San Francisco on March 23-24. Similar to behavior in 2015, we do not expect Amazon and Microsoft to follow suit.”Goldman Sachs says that the top three service providers are gaining share as Verizon Communications (VZ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and others exit the public IaaS market and focus on private clouds.Goldman Sachs estimates that AWS’ revenue will hit $12.5 billion in 2016, up from $7.88 billion last year.“If AWS surpasses $10 billion in 10 years, it would be the fastest-growing software business,” surpassing Microsoft, Oracle (ORCL), and SAP (SAP),” Bellini wrote.

198,HPE,"Tech giant Cisco Systems' (CSCO) 16-nanometer data center semiconductor could slug Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO), which is ramping its 28-nm Tomahawk technology, an RBC analyst said Monday.Broadcom's Tomahawk will go for $600-$700 per chip, replacing the outmoded Trident chip that costs less than $500, on average. Unlike Trident, however, Tomahawk won't win across-the-board vs. Cisco, RBC's Amit Daryanani wrote.Cisco recently unveiled its CloudScale application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), in direct competition with data center chipmakers Broadcom, Cavium (CAVM), Intel (INTC), Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX).In the past, Broadcom's Trident won ""across the board"" at Cisco. This time, Cisco is likely to use its own CloudScale ASIC in its Nexus 9000, 9200 and 9300 platforms, leaving the 9500 to hold the Tomahawk silicon, Daryanani said.Other users include Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Arista Networks (ANET) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), which had a two-year head start to begin ramping Tomahawk-based solution, Daryanani wrote. He sees a five- to six-year lifespan for the product.Still, ""we believe Cisco encroachment into the merchant silicon market needs to be monitored by Broadcom investors,"" he wrote. ""For now, we continue to believe Broadcom's solutions are the market-leaders for cloud/data center spenders.""Daryanani maintained his 180 price target and top performer rating on Broadcom stock. Shares rose a fraction Monday, to 152.89, on a day when Apple released new products that didn't represent huge advances and were expected. Cisco stock fell a fraction on Wall Street Monday, while Apple was flat.

199,HPE,"Seemingly fully recovered from the infamous Software Sag of 2016 in January and February, big-cap Accenture (ACN) is flirting with a record-high stock price amid growth in its services, as it heads towards its fiscal Q2 earnings release due before the market open Thursday.Accenture stock was down a fraction in early trading in the stock market today, near 108, 18% above its seven-month low of 91.40 touched on Feb. 9 and just 2% off an all-time high of 109.86 set Oct. 28.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average estimated Accenture earned $1.18 per share minus items for the quarter ended in February, up 9% from the year-earlier period, on revenue of $7.72 billion, down 2.6%. Accenture guided Q2 to $7.62 billion at the midpoint of its range.Dublin-based Accenture ""cited no weakness in its financial services pipeline"" during its Q1 earnings release on Dec. 17, wrote Cowen analyst Bryan Bergin in a recent research note. ""This was (about) three weeks before a tumultuous start to 2016, and nearly two months prior to (services rival Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH)) sounding warning bells in its banking and financial services vertical.""In the Cowen Feb. 25 research note, entitled ""The Sky Does Not Appear to be Falling in Financial Services IT Spending,"" Bergin wrote that ""vendors that have noted service interruption have generally tied such weakness to a handful of specific clients. There have been Indian vendors with reports of healthy internal fiscal 2017 revenue growth targets, (notably Infosys (INFY) and Wipro (WIT)) and positive industry demand narratives across investor days by (Genpact (G), Epam Systems (EPAM) and Tata Consultancy Services) that have not yielded indications of across-the-board financials' spending declines.""He noted that Accenture has grown revenue in financial services in constant currency in four of the last five quarters, although financial clients represent only 21% of Accenture revenue in the last 12 months.In a research note last week, Trefis applauded Accenture for a ""very resilient business model,"" with 45% of its business in outsourcing and 55% in consulting.Cowen rates Accenture stock at outperform, with a 115 price target.With a healthy IBD Composite Rating (CR) of 80, meaning its stock is outperforming 80% of S&P 500 issues in a variety of metrics, Accenture is worth about half of IBM's (IBM) $142.8 billion in terms of market cap. IBM has a weak 56 CR.Infosys, with an 86 CR, has a $42.5 billion market cap, while Cognizant, with an 83 CR, is worth about $36.2 billion based on its stock price.Newly freed from PCs and printers, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) earns a 65 CR, with a $30.4 billion market cap.

200,HPE,"Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) has snared iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as a customer for its Google Cloud Platform, a deal that could help Google's service catch up with industry leader Amazon.com (AMZN), says an industry note from Pacific Crest Securities on Thursday.Amazon unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now the biggest provider of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), where customers rent computer servers and data storage systems via the Internet. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's Google rank next.Apple signed a contract worth between $400 million and $600 million to use Google's Cloud Platform, according to CRN. Apple now uses cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft, but intends to end its reliance on all its rivals in the next few years, as it builds its own data centers, according to Re/Code.While Apple has reportedly used AWS historically for iCloud, ""the more surprising shift is from Apple to Google, which are odd bedfellows given the two companies' mudslinging and competition in other areas,"" wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson. ""Did Google throw in free cloud as a way to renegotiate the search contract? Definitely adds to the perception of Google's momentum,"" Wilson added.The deal has not been confirmed by Google or Apple, but Apple did disclose its reliance on AWS and on Microsoft's Azure in a 2014 white paper.The alleged Apple-Google accord would help ""Google Cloud Platform catch up to Amazon and Microsoft -- at least in terms of perception -- as a real third player in the space instead of a distant third. Google has done similar deals with Snapchat, PricewaterhouseCoopers, General Mills (GIS) Coca-Cola (KO), HTC and Best Buy (BBY),"" said Wilson.In total, the cloud opportunity is big enough for all three Internet powerhouses, said Wilson, who estimated ""a potential $25 billion windfall opportunity in cloud services for Amazon, Microsoft and Google, collectively.""While AWS has been the biggest IaaS price-cutter of the last decade, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has been aggressive since moving into the market.

202,HPE,"Technology investors looking for high revenue growth often find their answer in software-as-a-service companies.ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the fastest-growing companies that fits that bill. ServiceNow's 2016 sales exploded 38% to $1.4 billion, and it has laid claim to being the ""fastest-growing enterprise software company with more than $1 billion in revenue.""It has set big goals, too. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company plans to nearly triple its revenue to $4 billion by 2020.""There's not another company that produces growth at our scale like we do,"" Frank Slootman, ServiceNow's chief executive, said in an interview. ""It's a trifecta — scale, growth and free cash flow.""ServiceNow faces fierce competition, though, most notably from Salesforce.com (CRM), currently the market leader in the industry known as SaaS. Salesforce.com's 2016 sales boomed 24% to $6.7 billion, and the San Francisco-based company is on track to hit $10 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year. It's aiming to hit $20 billion after that.Salesforce.com has the higher profile, being oft-mentioned in industry merger activity, whether it involves Microsoft (MSFT), LinkedIn, Twitter (TWTR) or another company. It specializes in software that helps businesses organize and handle sales operations.But ServiceNow stock has shot up 25% in 2017, while Salesforce.com is up 18% after lagging last year.SaaS companies sell online subscriptions to software, rather than one-time licenses. SaaS providers have high customer renewal rates and book recurring revenue over the long term. Most sell into the so-called ""enterprise market"" — large companies, government agencies and other big customers.ServiceNow has prospered by taking away the customers of BMC Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), CA Technologies (CA) and other ""on-premise"" software providers that shifted slowly to cloud-based SaaS business models.Founded in 2004, ServiceNow developed software for information technology service management, basically IT help-desk tools for tracking internal company issues. As Salesforce.com has expanded into marketing, customer service and e-commerce, ServiceNow has made a similar push into customer-service tools, heightening the rivalry between the two.Salesforce.com has been an acquisition machine, spending more than $4.6 billion in 2016 alone to buy companies.In ServiceNow's case, though, it can hit its $4 billion target by growing ""organically,"" meaning without big acquisitions, says Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst.""There may be opportunities for them to enhance the breadth of their offerings with (small) tuck-in acquisitions,"" Zukin added.ServiceNow expects to reach its $4 billion revenue goal by expanding into new markets — human resources, customer service management and security, to name a few — and by landing bigger contracts while targeting the top 2,000 global companies.ServiceNow has bought small companies like Neebula Systems, iTapp and most recently DxContinuum to acquire ""talent and technology,"" said Slootman, who has been ServiceNow's CEO since 2011. He earlier headed Data Domain, which was sold to data storage networking giant EMC in 2009.""Technology is not as useful without the talent,"" Slootman said. ""We have the ability to sell, so I don't need to acquire revenue or customers. We can do that ourselves. We try to acquire small companies with promising technology before they go vertical and their revenue explodes, because then it's way more expensive (to acquire them).""ServiceNow still garners most revenue from service management, but the 2014 Neebula acquisition provided key technology for mapping a customers' IT infrastructure in case outages or other problems occur. That's a different market, called IT operations management. ServiceNow's 2016 purchase of ITApp provided cloud management tools.ServiceNow's operations management tools account for about 9% of subscription revenue, with that expected to grow to at least 15% by 2020.Slootman says the same software tools that automate information-technology workflows and record keeping can be applied for finance, legal, procurement and other corporate departments. Like Salesforce.com, ServiceNow is building a library of business apps that customers can download via the internet.The name of the game for many SaaS companies is building a cloud ""platform"" so they can sell multiple software tools to different industries.IBD'S TAKE: After a series of flat bases over the last 10 months, ServiceNow broke out last month and is staking out higher ground above the 90 level. ServiceNow is the eighth-ranked company in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise Group. Tops on the list is Paycom Software (PAYC), which has a Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99.""In software everyone claims to be a platform play, but in reality there are only a few that can make that claim, and ServiceNow is one of them,"" said Matthew Hedberg, a RBC Capital analyst in a report.Much of ServiceNow's revenue growth has come from ""cross-selling."" Its sales staff aims to sell more products to existing service management customers. IBM has emerged as a key partner of ServiceNow, reselling its service management and other tools. Accenture has been a marketing partner in the government market.Alex Zukin, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, says IBM looms as a ""logical acquirer (of ServiceNow) over the longer term.""""ServiceNow's platform would be a logical extension of IBM's cloud infrastructure,"" Zukin said.In mid-2016, ServiceNow was among companies listed in a score card of possible Salesforce.com acquisitions that leaked from a board of directors meeting. Pegasystems (PEGA) and Tableau Software (DATA) also were on Salesforce's wish list, but ServiceNow's market cap is much bigger at more than $15 billion.ServiceNow generates hefty free cash flow, a feat that's not common among SaaS companies, and a plus for any potential acquirers. Free cash flow rose 40% to $322 million in 2016.The company reported unadjusted earnings of 71 cents in 2016 but it's still not profitable on an adjusted basis, which includes stock-based compensation. Shares of ServiceNow ended trading Friday up 1% to 92.74, and were up another 0.5% Tuesday to close at 93.18.ServiceNow has forecast 2017 revenue growth of 32% to $1.835 billion, at the midpoint of its guidance. Billing growth has stabilized after slowing in 2015, when the company reorganized sales. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are modeling 54% earnings growth to $1.08 a share in 2017.A roadmap to ServiceNow's $4 billion revenue goal was revealed in May 2016. A month earlier, it settled patent infringement cases with BMC and HPE. Analysts expect ServiceNow to continue taking share in the service management market from BMC and others, though privately held Cherwell Software is a strong rival.As ServiceNow expands into new markets, analysts say it could run into more competition from the likes of Atlassian (TEAM), Zendesk (ZEN) and Splunk (SPLK).Zukin says that in many cases ServiceNow's management software can work alongside other tools. He says human resources, where Workday (WDAY) is a leading provider, is one example.The Salesforce rivalry, though, seems to be growing.""Historically, ServiceNow's messaging has been that ServiceNow and Salesforce.com can coexist in accounts. The new message seems to be that customers are increasingly taking a 'CRM model' or 'service management' platform approach,"" Brian Schwartz, an Oppenheimer analyst, wrote in a recent report to clients. ""In other words, we believe the two platforms will increasingly be seen as future alternatives rather than running in parallel.""ServiceNow aims to leverage its database technology to provide more problem-solving tools in handling customer-service issues. Both Salesforce.com and ServiceNow are adding artificial intelligence to software. By embedding data analytics and ""machine learning"" into software, they aim to make it easier for customers to automate tasks.ServiceNow acquired AI startup DxContinuum in January. Slootman says he plans to utilize DxContinuum's  throughout ServiceNow's cloud platform. The tools will help customers build predictive models that make it easier to categorize incoming requests from company employees.Aside from HR, customer service and security, Slootman says SeriveNow could target other areas.""The good thing about this model is we can try things, we can be opportunistic,"" Slootman said. ""If something works, we'll do more. But we can also back out if it doesn't. There are no life-and-death bets. We can be very agile in how we move in or out of adjacent markets.""RELATED:Will Microsoft Stymie Salesforce.com's Stock Turnaround?

203,HPE,"Arista Networks (ANET) new software strategy will resonate with internet customers such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB), says Needham & Co., which hiked its price target on the data center gear maker.""This really matters to the Web 2.0 customers (and) Cisco Systems (CSCO) can't match it,"" said Alex Henderson, a Needham analyst in a report. Henderson on Monday hiked his price target on Arista Networks to 150 from 130.Arista sells network switches that speed up communications in cloud-computing data centers. It's ranked No. 2 in the IBD 50, a roster of fast-growing companies.Arista Networks stock climbed 2.7% to 127.47 on the stock market today. Shares in Arista Networks are still in a buy range after clearing a technical buy point of 123.22. Arista Networks on March 7 unveiled a new software strategy. The ""containerized"" version of Arista's EOS operating system enables its networking software to run on so-called ""white-box"" computer hardware, built by lesser-known suppliers from Asia.""(This) near term, allows Microsoft to deploy its SONiC software on Arista switches, while Facebook could be deploying cEOS on the white box switches in its footprint. Longer term, revenue and margin impact remains unclear,"" said Goldman Sachs in a report published on Friday.A JPMorgan analyst last week said Arista Networks strategy could spell more trouble for arch rival Cisco amid a festering legal battle.IBD'S TAKE: Arista Networks revenue jumped 35% in 2016 to nearly $1.13 billion. Look for more fast-growing companies at the IBD 50, which includes Nvidia and NetEase.Arista Networks' switches speed up communications between computer servers packed into the data centers, and interconnect racks of servers in different buildings. Arista has been taking market share from Cisco in the data center market by winning over internet customers.The International Trade Commission has scheduled a hearing in April related to the Cisco-Arista patent litigation. Arista has denied infringing Cisco's patents, and it also says it has modified its network software to resolve issues.RELATED:HPE Snaps Up Nimble, Lifting Shares In Sector; Cisco Lurking?Cisco Partly To Blame For Palo Alto Networks' Pain?Cisco Rival Arista's Price Targets Hiked, But Goldman Sticks With Sell

204,HPE,"Presidio (PSDO), a provider of information technology services, priced its initial public offering late Thursday at the low end of its expected range, showing subdued investor reaction toward the tech unicorn following the IPO of Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).Presidio focuses on providing IT to mid-sized companies. It competes against giants such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM) and Accenture (ACN).Presidio sold 16.7 million shares at 14 a pop, raising $233 million. It had set a price range of 14-16 each.The stock is expected to begin trading Friday on the Nasdaq under the ticker PSDO. Apollo Global Management (APO) owns a majority stake.With an initial market cap of about $1.3 billion, Presidio is the first tech unicorn to go public since the much-larger Snap did last week.Snap on March 1 priced its IPO slightly above its estimate range, raising $3.4 billion, making it the largest U.S.-listed IPO since Alibaba (BABA) in 2014.Snap, which had an initial valuation of $24 billion, soared 44% in its March 2 debut and kept rising the next session. But this week shares have tumbled 16% so far, as several analysts have issued sell ratings.Snap shares rose 1% to 22.94 in morning trade in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Snap's IPO and post-IPO action shows why investors should be wary about buying into a new company initially. Let the market separate the hype from the real winners. Here's how spot and exploit an IPO base.On Thursday, Airbnb completed a $1 billion funding round that valued the room rental marketplace at $31 billion, up from $30 billion about six months ago. Airbnb, which is now profitable, appears to be in no rush to go public.Earlier this week, online grocery delivery startup Instacart reportedly raised $400 million, valuing the company at $3.4 billion, up from $2 billion in late 2014.Instacart faces competition from many other pure-play online grocery firms, along with mounting competition from heavyweights Amazon (AMZN) and Wal-Mart (WMT).RELATED:Instacart Valued At $3.4 Billion: Unicorns Still Prized After Snap IPOIPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New IssuesSnap Gets A More Upbeat Review Amid A Series Of Sell Ratings

205,HPE,"Technology unicorn Presidio (PSDO) began its first day of trading Friday by debuting below its offer price, showing subdued investor reaction following the more splashy initial public offering of Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).Late Thursday, Presidio raised $233 million, pricing 16.7 million shares at 14 each and the low end of its estimated range of 14-to-16. Presidio stock opened at 13.50 on the stock market today, climbed as high as 14.36, closing up 1.8% at 14.25.Presidio specializes in digital infrastructure, cloud computing and security solutions, with about 7,000 business and government customers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, Presidio reported revenue of $2.7 billion, up 14%, and a net loss of $3.4 million, vs. a net loss of $29.4 million the previous fiscal year. It competes against information technology giants such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM) and Accenture (ACN).Presidio came to market with a valuation of about $1.3 billion, making it the first tech unicorn to go public since the much-larger Snap did last week.The hope is that the Snap debut will lead to a burst of IPO activity, shrugging off a market that began to dry up in the second half of 2015 and continues. The IPO slowdown occurs despite U.S. stock markets at or near all-time highs.Three IPOs are scheduled for the coming week. The largest is ProPetro, a provider of hydraulic fracturing services for the oil and gas industry. It looks to raise $350 million, offering 20 million shares at a price range of 16 to 19. It trades Friday under the ticker PUMP.Ardagh Group, a provider of containers for consumer packaged goods, looks to raise $299.7 million, offering 16.2 million shares at a range of 17 to 20, trading Wednesday under the ticker ARD.MuleSoft, a provider of software application services, seeks $169 million, pricing 13 million shares at a range of 12 to 14, trading Friday under the ticker MULE.IBD'S TAKE: IBD focuses on the best-performing IPOs of the past three years in its IPO Leaders column. You can also read this Investor's Corner on how should you handle Snap's market debut to maximize your chances for success with IPOs.Snap held its initial public offering on March 1, giving the company a market valuation of $24 billion. Shares priced at 17, the high end of its estimated range, and popped 44% on the first day of trading to close at 24.48. The offering raised $3.4 billion, making it the largest IPO of a U.S.-listed company since Alibaba (BABA) in September of 2014. The following day Snap hit a record high of 29.44 but has been on a downward slide since, with the stock currently trading near 23, up fractionally. Snap was hit with several sell ratings.Snapchat is a mobile messaging platform that competes mainly against the Instagram program of Facebook (FB), both being photo- and video-sharing applications with special features.Some observers hope that a successful IPO of Snap will lead to a stampede of big-name debuts. Other unicorns expected to go public in 2017 are music service provider Spotify, data analytics company Palantir Technologies and social network Pinterest.In other IPOs this past week, women's apparel provider J. Jill (JILL) priced 11.7 million shares at $13, below its estimated range of 14 to 16. J. Jill stock fell modestly in Thursday's debut and was up 2.4% to 12.95 Friday.RELATED:First Tech Unicorn IPO After Snap Prices At Low End Of Price RangeInstacart Valued At $3.4 Billion: Unicorns Still Prized After Snap IPOIPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New IssuesSnap Gets A More Upbeat Review Amid A Series Of Sell Ratings

206,HPE,"Arista Networks' (ANET) software strategy likely spells more trouble for archrival Cisco Systems (CSCO), says a JPMorgan analyst.Arista sells network switches that speed up communications in cloud-computing data centers. It's ranked No. 3 in the IBD 50, a roster of fast-growing companies.Arista has been taking market share from Cisco in the data center market by winning over customers such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).Amid a festering legal battle with Cisco, Arista on Tuesday unveiled a new software technology. This ""containerized"" version of Arista's EOS operating system enables its networking software to run on so-called ""white-box"" computer hardware, built by lesser-known suppliers from Asia.While Arista stands to sell less of its own network switches, it'll likely glean high profit margins from a software-based strategy, analysts say.""Though Arista may cannibalize some existing business we believe this could open up much of Cisco's bread-and-butter market to EOS and potentially grow Arista's total addressable market while simultaneously deflating Cisco's,"" said Rod Hall, a JPMorgan analyst in a report.Arista shares climbed 2% to 123.53 on the stock market today. Shares in Cisco slipped 0.5% to 34.02.Arista says the new version of EOS software will be ready in the back half of 2017. Stanley Kovler, an analyst at Citigroup, also sees upside from Arista's strategy.IBD'S TAKE: Chipmaker Nvidia, Cognex and China's Netease are among the top four companies in the IBD 50, a screen of leading growth companies showing strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals. ""With the announcement of containerized EOS and effectively disaggregating the software from it switches, Arista will enable its customers to deploy it software on white box solutions, (although) pricing for stand-alone software was not announced,"" Kovler said.Arista Networks' switches speed up communications between computer servers packed into the data centers, and interconnect racks of servers in different buildings.The International Trade Commission has slated a hearing in April related to the Cisco-Arista patent litigation. Arista has denied infringing Cisco's patents, and it also says it has modified its network software to resolve issues.RELATED:HPE Snaps Up Nimble, Lifting Shares In Sector; Cisco Lurking?Cisco Partly To Blame For Palo Alto Networks' Pain?Cisco Rival Arista's Price Targets Hiked, But Goldman Sticks With Sell

208,HPE,"The $679.9 million First Trust U.S. Equity Opportunities (FPX) just became the first ETF to add mobile-messaging upstart and new IPO Snap (SNAP) to its portfolio.The exchange traded fund was expected to include Snap at the next quarterly rebalance, on the close of March 17, but the index provider used discretionary powers to add the Snapchat owner at the close of business March 2 due to ""extraordinary circumstances,"" Ryan Issakainen, ETF strategist at First Trust, told IBD in a phone call Friday.Snap currently has a minuscule 0.3% weighting in the FPX portfolio but that could change after the rebalance, Issakainen added. Weightings in FPX are determined by float-adjusted market capitalization.FPX closed modestly higher Friday as it trades near all-time highs at around 57.The First Trust ETF tracks a market-cap-weighted index of the 100 largest and most liquid U.S. IPOs. It holds new stock market entrants for roughly four years, and also invests in spinoffs.Its 102 stock holdings include Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Facebook (FB), PayPal (PYPL) and Twitter (TWTR).Year to date through March 2, FPX ETF has advanced 6.0% vs. roughly 6.6% for the S&P 500. It has gained an annual average 10.9% over the past 10 years, outpacing the S&P's 7.9% gain over the same period.Snapchat-owner Snap jumped more than 40% Thursday after its long-awaited public debut and extended its gains on the stock market today, despite analyst warnings about its prospects.It could be years before the company, which is behind the popular disappearing-message app, lands in core exchange traded funds. Search giant Alphabet (GOOGL) waited roughly two years after its debut to join the S&P 500 index.Fledgling, newly public companies can be tricky to research and risky to invest in. They are also missing from the major market indexes, and the ETFs that track them, until they become seasoned stocks.That doesn't mean ETF investors get left out of the IPO party, thanks to exchange traded funds such as FPX that make IPOs, or initial public offerings, their business.A smaller and newer rival, Renaissance IPO (IPO), is set to include Snap on March 20 during the quarterly rebalance of the underlying index, David Sieber of Renaissance, an IPO ETF manager, told IBD in a phone call.""This will set up the ETF, which is now up 10.5% this year compared to 7.0% for the S&P 500, to be one of the first to include Snap,"" he said Wednesday.Sieber expects Snap to be a top-10 stock in the IPO ETF portfolio, given its size. Snap had a market capitalization of $31.32 billion as of the March 3 market close.The $13.5 million Renaissance IPO ETF currently holds 46 stocks, with hefty stakes in First Data (FDC) and TransUnion (TRU).Renaissance IPO typically acquires new issues within 90 days of listing and boots them out after two years of public trading. It can fast-track the entry of sizable new companies such as Snap.Neither IPO ETF captures the first-day pop, or drop, in any new issue. They tend to include IPOs only after a few days of public trading.Snap scored big with its IPO, raising $3.4 billion, making it the biggest U.S. IPO in years.Snap's IPO was priced at 17, opened trading at 24 Thursday and closed out the week at 27.09.

213,HPE,"Having just completed their first quarter since the Nov. 1 split of their former parent company, the stock of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the Big Data and hybrid cloud operations of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., has outperformed its sibling HP Inc., which retained the legacy personal computer and printer business.The new Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) fell 2.5% in the stock market today, to 13.45. True, that's 15% off its all-time set Dec. 1 at 15.88, but HP Inc. (HPQ) is trading 33% below its post-Nov. 1 high of 14.82, touched Nov. 24. It fell 0.9% to 9.88 on Tuesday.""Upon the split we argued in favor of HPE over HPQ stock,"" wrote UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a research note Tuesday. ""Hewlett Packard Enterprise has momentum with expected slight revenue growth in constant currency and an improving operating margin in fiscal 2016. This outlook was reinforced on the last earnings call (Nov. 25).""In contrast, HP Inc. told investors it would be investing for long-term gain. Our initial issue was the unsustainability of printer margins, but then unit demand fell apart last quarter. We remain concerned that HPQ estimates could be too high.""For the fiscal first quarter ended Jan . 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the Enterprise company to report earnings down 17% to 40 cents per share on revenue down 2.7% to $12.68 billion, vs. a pro forma 48 cents on $13.03 billion in the 2015 Q1.Analysts expect the performance of HP Inc., the PC/printer company, to slide further than Enterprise, with Q1 earnings down to 36 cents on falling sales to $12.23 billion.For fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31, the Enterprise company expects earnings of $1.85-$1.95 per share minus items, vs. the $1.84 pro forma earned in 2015.  It guided revenue to $50.81 billion, down from the pro forma $52.12 billion of 2015.Analysts expect 2016 EPS of $1.87 minus items on revenue of $50.68 billion.Hewlett Packard Enterprise and analysts expect profitability and sales to improve in 2017 and beyond.Reiterating a buy rating and 18.50 price target on Enterprise, Milunovich said: ""HPQ is slightly less expensive than HPE on all measures, but we prefer HPE's better earnings momentum. Even discounting HPE's segment P/Es by 20%-30% relative to comps results in an overall multiple of almost 10x and a price target of $18.50. The stock looks more expensive on current but inexpensive on normalized free cash, which we expect to be achieved in fiscal 2018.""UBS rates HP Inc. as neutral with a 15 price target.Meg Whitman, who remains chair of both companies, took the CEO title of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as she had with the former company, but named Dion Weisler CEO of HP Inc.Both companies are expected to report fiscal Q1 earnings this month.

214,HPE,"Ruckus Wireless (RKUS) could get a boost from increased spending on public Wi-Fi networks by cable TV companies as well as its push into a new market -- LTE wireless data services that use high-frequency 3.5 GHz spectrum, say analysts.Ruckus, a maker of Wi-Fi networking gear, competes with Cisco Systems (CSCO), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Aerohive Networks (HIVE) and others.Ruckus stock was up a fraction in midday trading on the stock market today, near 9.75, but it's down 9% this year after falling nearly 11% last year, amid a slowdown in education spending on wireless networks. Ruckus has a IBD Composite Rating of 70, where 99 is highest. Ruckus stock touched an all-time low of 7.25 on Feb. 10.On Friday, BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk initiated coverage on Ruckus with a buy rating.“We expect Ruckus to generate 16% revenue growth in 2016, an acceleration from last year’s 14% growth rate,” wrote Piecyk. “We expect 2017 revenue growth of 16% but note that if a cable operator were to initiate a new investment program, Ruckus would have the opportunity to accelerate the top line.”Ruckus sells Wi-Fi gear to the enterprise market -- big corporate, government, education and health system customers. One concern among analysts is its exposure to China’s telecom market.In late 2017, Ruckus could get a lift from a new product cycle, says Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair. Ruckus is targeting in-building wireless networks that use 3.5 GHz spectrum, using a technology called OpenG.Ruckus is working on OpenG with Qualcomm (QCOM), Nokia (NOK) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google.""Ruckus management is confident in driving adoption of OpenG over time and expects revenue impact in the second half of 2017,” wrote Ader in a research report. “We view the in-building cellular opportunity as an excellent strategic fit with Ruckus' existing business and a material growth catalyst longer term, especially as the Wi-Fi market matures.”

215,HPE,"AT&T (T) will likely be the biggest user of OpenStack cloud computing software worldwide, says a Goldman Sachs report on growth in private clouds.“AT&T will likely become the largest OpenStack environment in the world, as they expect to build out their private cloud to 500,000 nodes (servers) and span across hundreds of data centers,” said Heather Bellini, a Goldman Sachs analyst, in a research report.AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) in January joined Facebook’s (FB) Open Compute Project, which helps companies design and build low-cost data centers with open-source software.Behind VMware (VMW) and Microsoft (MSFT), OpenStack is the third-most-popular software technology for private clouds  --  data centers that operate behind a corporate security firewall.OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers. Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard.Many companies now back OpenStack, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Red Hat (RHT), Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell.AT&T plans to transform its massive network by 2020 -- with software running on standard computing gear replacing specialized hardware.“AT&T hopes to run every call through its OpenStack infrastructure by 2020,” said the Goldman Sachs report. “The company believes it can take out  billions of dollars in capital spending and operating expenses from moving to private cloud as they can use commodity pizza boxes instead of proprietary Cisco boxes. The entire infrastructure will be automated, helping AT&T operate at a faster pace and bring in new services, which is easier to do when they are software-based.”AT&T is using OpenStack software provided by startup Mirantis, says Goldman Sachs. It says Verizon is also a Mirantis customer. Privately held Mirantis, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., says its investors include the venture capital arms of Intel, Ericsson (ERIC), Dell and Goldman Sachs (GS).Goldman Sachs says Red Hat and VMware are the leading providers of OpenStack software for private clouds.Image provided by Shutterstock.

216,HPE,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) last quarter again nabbed market share from rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), a Piper Jaffray analyst wrote Monday ahead of Palo Alto's fiscal Q2 earnings late Thursday.In a survey of third parties selling Palo Alto products, half said Palo Alto is most consistently beating out Check Point, Piper Jaffray's Andrew Nowinski wrote in a research report.""Cisco, Check Point and Juniper have consistently been called out by resellers as the vendors most frequently losing to Palo Alto,"" he wrote. ""These are also the top vendors in the firewall market, suggesting Palo Alto continues to gain share at the expense of all the major vendors in the space.""That's sure to rile Cisco, which last week unveiled a next-generation firewall in direct competition with Palo Alto, Check Point, Fortinet (FTNT) and Intel (INTC)-owned McAfee. It was also the first time that Check Point was cited as the vendor Palo Alto beats most often, Nowinski wrote.Nowinski retained his rating on Palo Alto Networks stock to overweight, with a 208 price target. At least three other analysts, however, cut their price target on Palo Alto stock Monday ahead of the Thursday earnings report.Palo Alto stock rose 2.3% on the stock market today, but rival FireEye (FEYE) was up 9.4%. FireEye announced Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as its global alliance partner of the year.For fiscal Q2 ended in January, Palo Alto Networks is expected to report $318.3 million in sales and 39 cents earnings per share ex items, up 46% and 105%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. It would be its first quarter eclipsing the $300 million-mark.But sales and EPS minus items are expected to decelerate for the second consecutive quarter, according to the consensus of 40 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The consensus model is in line with Palo Alto's earlier guidance for $314 million to $318 million and 38 cents to 39 cents.Palo Alto stock is down 26% this year, slightly worse than IBD's 25-company Computer-Software Security industry group, which is 22% off its 2015 closure. Cybersecurity stocks were pounded in January on a perceived slowdown in spending after gloomy reports from firms like Tableau Software (DATA) and LinkedIn (LNKD).Neither Nowinski nor Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick see that slowdown for Palo Alto. Trebnick maintained her buy rating and 215 price target on Palo Alto stock. She urged investors to compare Palo Alto to direct next-generation firewall vendors.Barracuda Networks (CUDA), CyberArk Software (CYBR), Proofpoint (PFPT), Imperva (IMPV), Rapid7 (RPD), Qualys (QLYS), Splunk (SPLK) and FireEye ""have provided a seemingly negative read-through for Palo Alto Networks,"" Trebnick wrote in a research report. ""Unlike elsewhere in security, next-generation firewall vendors that cater to enterprises have all managed to produce good enough results for investors.""Trebnick expects Palo Alto to beat consensus expectations. Wildfire and Traps are driving higher attach rates, she wrote. Wildfire is Palo Alto's cloud-based malware-analysis system, which competes with FireEye. Traps is an endpoint-security product.Over the past 12-16 months, Palo Alto has expanded its suite of products to seven from four, Trebnick wrote. Together, Palo Alto touts them as a ""next-generation security platform.""""Our sources have indicated that they are now seeing increased success from this approach as enterprises are broadening their purchases to include more of the auxiliary software subscriptions,"" she wrote.Trebnick and Nowinski alike see a strong April-quarter pipeline for Palo Alto. Nowinski said he expects a 3%-4% upside to Q3 guidance despite typical seasonal weakness.

219,HPE,"Sales of $2 billion are a drop in the bucket -- if you’re IBM (IBM) or Cisco Systems (CSCO).That’s how much tech giant IBM drew in 2015 security revenue. Networking giant Cisco pulled in $1.75 billion in security revenue. But security sales accounted for just 2.4% and 3%, respectively, of those companies’ multibillion-dollar top lines.Both IBM and Cisco say their cybersecurity revenue rose 12% last year. The growth outstripped pure players Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP). And the total dollar sales for IBM and Cisco easily topped total revenue for leading security pure players Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye (FEYE).Cybersecurity Ventures CEO Steve Morgan says it’s just the beginning of a series of “knockdown, dragout brawls"" among tech giants IBM, Cisco, Dell and others specifically in the security software-and-services arena in 2016.And companies like IBM and Cisco don't enter the ring with kid gloves. This bare-knuckle  donnybrook for cybersecurity superiority will be fought with well-padded M&A budgets. The steep decline in security software stocks of late, amid fears of slowing spending on enterprise software, only raises the stakes, making some buyout targets likely more affordable.Lower spending could hit security vendors, but there's no debate that cybersecurity needs have grown. Hackers stormed the digital bulwarks of Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), Sony (SNE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the Office of Personnel Management in 2013, 2014 and 2015. That drove a lot of what Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski calls “panic spending.”More than 60% of 137 chief information officers recently polled by Piper Jaffray had refreshed their security firewalls within the past 12 months. And firewall security ranked only No. 5 on a list of CIO priorities. Endpoint security, compliance, protecting Web applications, and internal-access management topped CIO priorities.These latter four segments will be hot M&A sectors this year, Nowinski says.“A lot of enterprises, in light of all the mega-breaches that occurred in 2014 and 2015, really beefed up and spent a lot on their network perimeters,” he told IBD. “After getting more comfortable with your perimeter (by beefing up firewalls) . . . you need to invest in technology that protects what the hackers are going after.”Symantec, Trend Micro and Intel (INTC)-owned McAfee lead the endpoint protection sector, according to Gartner. The market tracker says Imperva (IMPV) and F5 Networks (FFIV) top the Web-application firewall market, while CyberArk Software (CYBR) leads the internal-access management segment.Valuations skyrocketed in the hyperactive 2015 threat landscape, Nowinski says. Thus, last year wasn't one of big consolidation for cybersecurity.""Companies were trying to figure out what were the most strategic assets they needed to add to protect against the changing threat environment,"" he said. ""The threat environment was evolving very quickly and valuations were going through the roof with these mega-breaches.""Valuations, however, have plunged lately. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was down nearly 40% as of Friday from its 2015 high achieved July 24 -- after the group plunged 7.4% on Friday. From the start of 2015 through July 24, the group had rocketed 33%.The group tacked on another 7.2% loss by the closing bell Monday, as techs tumbled on the heels of poorly received forecasts from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA), whose stocks sheared off after their quarterly reports last week. Cloud securer Qualys added to the pressure when, late Monday, the firm reported Q4 and 2015 sales that missed consensus views, and issued Q1 guidance that lagged Wall Street expectations.The mass high-tech selloff also plagued IBD’s 26-company Electronics Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which landed down 4% and 2.8% on Friday and Monday, respectively.Still, a lot of big dollars are up for grabs in cybersecurity, FBR analyst Daniel Ives says. He estimates that spending on next-generation security wares will jump 30% in 2016, though total IT spending is seen rising just 3%.Gartner estimates that IT security spending will soar from $75 billion-plus in 2015 to $101 billion in 2018. Research firm Markets and Markets sees the cybersecurity market hitting $170 billion by 2020.""It's such an enormous growth segment, in a very choppy environment,"" Ives told IBD. ""It's pent-up demand and it's the massive threat environment. . . . You look at the technology landscape and cybersecurity is a priority.""As nontraditional security firms jump on the cybersecurity bandwagon, no potential M&A is off limits, Cybersecurity Ventures' Morgan says.""If you look at the cybersecurity industry, there are not a lot of unicorns,"" he said. ""What we're seeing is (startups) will raise $10 million to $100 million . . . to ratchet up and get acquired by multimillion-dollar tech companies.""In January, FireEye stirred the M&A dust with a $200 million acquisition of cyberthreat intelligence firm iSight Partners, expanding its portfolio again after its $1 billion Mandiant acquisition in 2014.""That's where we're going to see the market,"" Morgan said. ""Any company that has successfully raised (venture capital) funding would be a takeover candidate.""Alan Kessler, CEO of privately held Vormetric, calls these ""tuck-in acquisitions.""""I think the pace of acquisitions is probably going to accelerate simply because of what's happening in the overall market demand for solutions,"" Kessler told IBD, ""but also the fact that some of the smaller players may have difficulty getting funding at a valuation that is appealing to their investors.""Vormetric falls into that ""tuck-in"" field. The encryption specialist is in the process of being acquired by Thales, a French company focused on ""creating a safer world,"" according to its website.Thales isn't a pure cybersecurity player but it touches 80% of online-processing payments, Kessler says. Vormetric will be threaded into Thales' data security group when the transaction closes, likely in late March.Kessler expects IBM and Cisco to continue adding new cybersecurity offerings to their portfolios. And the market recognizes that -- big tech firms know enterprise-level software, Enterprise Strategy Group analyst Jon Oltsik told IBD.""There's consolidation in the customers, the enterprise; they want to buy fewer tools from fewer vendors,"" Oltsik said. ""They want an integrated platform because what we've done in the past isn't working anymore.""And the efficiency of the technology has to be enterprise class, so that kind of speaks to the bigger vendors who know how to service the enterprise.""In the largest pure-tech merger ever, Dell last year agreed to acquire EMC for $67 billion in -- and thereby got its hands on EMC's RSA security business. In December, Dell confirmed rumors that it filed a $2 billion IPO for its SecureWorks business, which it acquired in 2011 for $612 million.""They single out cybersecurity and decide that's their spinoff?"" Morgan said. ""That says a lot about the market.""The pure players have done some tucking of their own. In 2015, Fortinet acquired Meru Networks for $44 million and Check Point spent $80 million on Lacoon Mobile Security.Also in 2015, Cisco followed up its $2.7 billion acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013 by acquiring OpenDNS for $635 million. And Raytheon acquired Websense for $1.9 billion, to create privately held Forcepoint.Between 2014 and 2015, Microsoft (MSFT) -- which Oltsik calls a cybersecurity ""wild card"" -- spent $600 million to buy three Israeli cybersecurity firms.""You would not call Microsoft a cybersecurity company,"" Morgan says. ""But you're starting to see them get very active in cyber. IBM would be another interesting company.""In 2015, IBM's total sales fell 12%, to $81.7 billion, even as its cybersecurity sales rose 12% to $2 billion.""That's a lot (of growth) when you're counting in the billions,"" Morgan said. ""That's not on a lot of people's radar. That gets lost a little bit in the context of much bigger companies.""FireEye's iSight acquisition is the only confirmed M&A in the sector this year. But CyberArk stock surged in January on rumors that Check Point is seeking to acquire it. Culturally, it makes sense --  they're both Israeli firms, Ives says.Should Check Point and CyberArk merge, such a deal would be larger than a tuck-in, Morgan says. Although Check Point is much larger -- with a $13.5 billion market value to CyberArk's $1.3 billion -- both are credible performers, he said.""I'm not sure we'd call that a merger or an acquisition,"" he said. ""CyberArk and Check Point, if that were to happen, I think you're looking at two companies coming together and looking to move into a much larger position in the market.""Cisco, Oracle (ORCL), IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Symantec will stoke 2016 M&A, Ives says. He lists Qualys (QLYS), CyberArk, Fortinet, FireEye and Imperva on his takeover list. He says the timing is especially ripe for Symantec to make an acquisition.Symantec completed its Veritas sale to the Carlyle Group on Jan. 29,  saying it received $5.3 billion in after-tax proceeds from the deal. Symantec acquired data storage firm Veritas for $13.5 billion in 2005, a deal that many analysts questioned.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec struggled in 2015, when revenue fell 2.4% to $6.54 billion. Now, Symantec will apply the cash from the Veritas sale toward an acquisition that strengthens its position, Nowinski said.Oltsik sees platform plays taking out Resilient Systems, Phantom Cyber, Invotas or ServiceNow (NOW) as automation becomes an increasingly important piece of cybersecurity. Smaller firms like Malwarebytes and Code DX also could be swept into the M&A frenzy, Morgan says.""In a different tech sector, where there's not as much M&A activity, you have to be doing some very cutting-edge things to be an acquisition target,"" he said. ""Here, if you walk and talk and raise money in the cybersecurity space, you're a target.""

Because it recently cleared a base in heavy volume and is holding above the buy point.It’s a tad extended from a 36.03 buy point, so investors need to watch for the stock to come back into the buy range. If it does, a low-volume pullback would be preferable.The company offers up a compelling growth story. Its supercomputers are used by governments, academic institutions and some businesses for national security, scientific research, weather and climate modeling and in computer-aided design, among other things.Despite formidable competition from some defense contractors as well as IBM (IBM) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), growth prospects look pretty good at Cray, with full-year earnings expected to surge 107% in 2015 and 34% in 2016.In April, Cray and Intel (INTC) received a $200 million U.S. Department of Energy contract for the development of a next-generation scientific research supercomputer.Shares gapped up Jan. 12 after the company pre-announced 2015 revenue of $720 million-$725 million, higher than prior guidance of $715 million given when the company reported third-quarter results in October.At the time, Q3 earnings jumped 92% from a year ago to 48 cents a share, well ahead of the consensus estimate of 6 cents.

225,HPE,"Reviews by analysts on the fourth-quarter earnings report from Splunk (SPLK) pushed aside a view that its weaker-than-expected Q1 outlook was a cause for concern.Big Data services provider Splunk reported Q4 earnings after the close Thursday that handily beat the consensus estimate on the top and bottom lines. But its Q1 revenue estimate of $231 million to $233 million was below the $241.4 million that analysts had modeled.Splunk stock fell 3.2% to 62.80 in the stock market today. Splunk came public in April 2012, with shares priced at 17. Its stock hit a four-year low of 29.85 last February, but has risen 110% since then. On Wednesday, shares briefly cleared a 65.85 buy point, hitting a 15-month high, but closed below  the entry area.IBD'S TAKE: Splunk has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, meaning it has outperformed 77% of stocks in the past six months on a variety of metrics. There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research top stocks, such as IBD's Tech Leaders. You can, for example, find out about four of tech's earnings leaders.Splunk's software helps tech managers monitor and analyze the vast volumes of data that companies and other enterprises are fast accumulating in the digital age — a field called Big Data. Splunk software uses the data to provide businesses with operational intelligence for security and information technology.Some analysts looked beyond the Q1 guidance with a view that Wall Street either got it wrong or that Splunk intentionally guided low, as they have done in the past. On Nov. 20, when Splunk provided Q3 earnings, it guided Q4 revenue in the range of $286 to $288 million, but came in at $306.5 million, up 39% year over year.Mathew Hedberg, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says Wall Street may have ""mis-modeled"" Q1 seasonality trends, and says company guidance was intentionally conservative. He maintained an overweight rating and 70 price target on Splunk stock.""We've seen the stock sell off on previously strong quarters, so our view is this represents another opportunity to buy a disruptive asset at a slight discount given upside to estimates from here seems likely,"" Hedberg wrote.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White maintained a buy rating on Splunk and raised his price target to 93 from 90.""Given Splunk's rapid revenue growth and prime position in the machine data market, we believe the stock has the potential for meaningful catch up in 2017,"" White wrote. He also said the company's relatively small size, low market penetration, smooth cloud transition and the strong secular trend around Big Data can keep it growing.BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman, in a research note, said that on just about every metric ""Splunk reported a very strong quarter, with reported billings of $432 million exceeding our estimate of $420 million.""While Q1 guidance disappointed, he wrote, ""We believe Splunk is leaving upside potential. We would encourage investors to be buyers on any weakness, as we think such weakness will be short lived.

226,HPE,"Universal Display (OLED), a key provider of technology and materials for OLED displays and lighting, late Thursday smashed Wall Street's fourth-quarter estimates for sales and earnings. It also announced plans to start paying a quarterly cash dividend beginning next month.Shares of Universal Display, aka UDC, rocketed over 12% in after-hours trading following the earnings news release. During the regular session on the stock market today, UDC shares fell 5.3% to 67.45.Results: UDC earned 55 cents a share, up 41% year over year, on sales of $74.6 million, up 20%, in the December quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected UDC to earn 42 cents a share on sales of $68.6 million.Guidance: UDC said it expects 2017 revenue of $230 million to $250 million, roughly in line with Wall Street's target of $244 million. It did not give an earnings target, but analysts have been modeling $1.29 a share this year, up 45%.Stock Action: UDC stock broke out of a cup-with-handle chart pattern with a buy point of 67.35 on Feb. 1, but quickly reversed. It staged another breakout on Feb. 14, rose for three days and retreated to just above the buy point on Thursday.Ewing, N.J.-based UDC late Thursday said its first-ever dividend of 3 cents a share will be paid on March 31 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 15.The dividend announcement ""reflects the board of directors' confidence in Universal Display's robust future growth opportunities, expected continued positive cash flow generation and commitment to return capital to our shareholders,"" UDC Chief Financial Officer Sidney Rosenblatt said in a statement.""As the proliferation of OLEDs expands across the consumer electronics landscape, Universal Display Corporation is well positioned to benefit with its strong breadth of enabling technologies, proprietary phosphorescent materials and over 20 years of know-how and experience. As we begin to benefit from what is forecasted to be a multiyear OLED capital expenditure cycle, we believe that this is the right time for UDC to pay its first-ever cash dividend.""Smartphone makers are beginning to switch to OLED, or organic light-emitting diode, displays from LCD, or liquid-crystal displays, because OLED provides better color reproduction and contrast and uses less power.

229,HPE,"On the eve of a summit last month between technology executives and then-President-elect Donald Trump, IBM (IBM) Chief Executive Ginni Rometty publicly pledged to hire about 25,000 U.S. workers and spend $1 billion on training over the next four years.She didn't mention that the tech giant was also firing workers and sending many of the jobs overseas.In late November, IBM completed at least its third round of firings in 2016, according to former and current employees. They don't know how many people have lost their jobs but say it's probably in the thousands, with many of the positions shipped to Asia and Eastern Europe.""The thing I found really insulting was that the quote-unquote reason for my termination was it was a 'skills transformation,'"" says Sean Ott, a 20-year IBM veteran asked to clear out his desk a couple of months ago despite what he describes as a strong performance rating. ""But at the same time, they have my exact job out there, they have my colleague's job out there for other people to get hired into.""During the presidential campaign, Trump routinely criticized offshoring, although he didn't specifically mention IBM. The firings — known internally as ""resource actions"" — have continued into the new year. This month, IBM started notifying more U.S. workers that they would be let go, according to a current employee, who says colleagues in the services business are bracing for further rounds.Many industries and companies have been sending jobs overseas to take advantage of lower wages and to be closer to local markets. In some cases, technological advances, including automation, have made positions obsolete.In an emailed statement, IBM spokesman Doug Shelton pointed out that the company generates more than two-thirds of its services revenue overseas. He reiterated plans to hire 25,000 people in the U.S. and said IBM will end up adding a net number of jobs over the next four years.""If we are able to fill these positions,"" he said, ""we expect IBM U.S. employment to be up over that period.''Shelton declined to say how many IBM workers were fired in 2016 but said the company enjoys an attrition rate that's historically much lower than the industry average.Rometty's hiring pledge prompted current and former IBM workers to vent on message boards and Facebook groups. Some complained that the new recruiting drive wouldn't offset jobs sent overseas in recent years. Others said Rometty had neglected to mention whether and how many people would be fired in the meantime. Some urged online communities to contact the Trump transition team and educate his aides about IBM's history of layoffs and outsourcing.""Ginni Rometty is terminating thousands of IT workers and touting herself as some hero who's out to hire 25,000 workers,"" says Sara Blackwell, a Sarasota, Fla.-based lawyer and advocate for Protect U.S. Workers, who represents about 100 ex-employees of IBM who have filed discrimination and other complaints. ""To me, that's hypocritical.""When Rometty became CEO in 2012, she began pushing IBM into new businesses such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. So far, results have been mixed. On Jan. 19, IBM reported that fourth-quarter sales fell 1% to $21.8 billion and operating margins narrowed, evidence that revenue from cloud computing and AI hasn't yet replaced sales from older businesses.However, some areas showed promise. Sales in the unit that houses analytics and AI software increased for the third quarter in a row, and the technology services and cloud platforms segment also recorded year-over-year growth.In a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said that the company expects to improve its margins this year, partly from ""savings we have from workforce rebalancing as we continue to remix the workforce.""IBM's reorganization inevitably meant some workers would lose their jobs. Automation wiped out some positions, and the company says some of the firings were done to make room for people with skills in IBM's new businesses. Layoffs have slowed but are continuing.In an Op-Ed published in USA Today in December to explain the creation of 25,000 new positions over the next four years, Rometty wrote: ""We are hiring because the nature of work is evolving.""At the same, time IBM has sent thousands of jobs offshore. It's not alone in doing this. In the last 15 or 20 years, Accenture (ACN), Cap Gemini (CGEMY) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) have all done the same.IBM doesn't disclose how many of its 300,000-plus employees work in the U.S. or in its various divisions. But the services businesses, which generate more than half the company's sales, have taken the brunt of the offshoring.For example, early last year, the technology services division aimed to have just 30% of permanent employees located in the U.S. by the end of 2016, according to two former managers, who received the information from superiors. Later in the year, the target had been reduced to 20%, said one of the people, who asked not to be named to discuss internal matters. Shelton said the numbers are inaccurate.As recently as three years ago, it was easier to track IBM's staff cuts. Employees losing their jobs received a list of colleagues being fired too, along with their positions, departments, ages and other information.They were able to use the information to determine whether they wanted to waive age-discrimination claims, which they needed to do to receive a severance package. Then in 2014, IBM ended the disclosures, making it much more difficult to tally job cut totals.The company hasn't entirely sidestepped criticism for firings. In 2015, local and federal officials lambasted IBM for dismissing 1,200 workers in Iowa and Missouri just five years after opening facilities there.The firings were a blow to the cities of Dubuque, Iowa, and Columbia, Mo., which spent a combined $84 million on sweeteners to lure Big Blue in the hopes of incubating a startup scene. Republican Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley wrote to the company to express concern about the firing of 700 workers.Today, Big Blue gets rid of people quietly and in smaller batches, former and current employees say. The firings have become so commonplace, they say, that many workers are resigned to losing their jobs and simply wait for their names to be called.Then, many are asked to train potential replacements overseas. In case of Ott, the former IBM employee, those people were in China, India and Argentina.""Clearly,"" he says, ""my skills are still relevant.""

231,HPE,"At least eight analysts hiked their price targets on Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock following the computer networking leader's fiscal Q2 earnings report late Wednesday, sending Cisco's stock up.Cisco's deferred revenue from software and subscriptions jumped 51% to $4 billion for the quarter ended Jan. 28, a sign that its business model transformation may be gaining traction, though overall revenue fell year over year for the fifth straight quarter.If the Trump administration follows through on a proposal to give a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, Cisco could make more acquisitions targeting software and services, analysts say.Drexel Hamilton hiked its price target to 40 from 36, and Deutsche Bank increased its to 40 as well. UBS and RBC Capital both hiked theirs to 37 from 35, while Oppenheimer increased its price target to 36 from 34. Piper Jaffray upped its to 36 from 32, while Pacific Crest Securities increased its to 34 from 33.Cisco stock rose 2.4% in the stock market today, to 33.60, earlier touching 33.97, its highest price since November 2007. Cisco stock on Tuesday climbed above a 32.05 buy point, so it's now slightly more than 5% extended.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco's dividend yield is higher than those of Intel, Microsoft and Apple. While telecoms have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, there are other options, such as banks, industrials and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Check out IBD's Income Investor for high-dividend-paying stocks.Cisco has been shifting to software and services from its core business of selling network switches and routers. Cisco in January said it would acquire software provider AppDynamics for $3.7 billion.""Wireless, security, collaboration and now ELAs (enterprise licensing agreements) helped drive 51% growth in deferred revenue from software and subscriptions to $4 billion,"" said Alex Kurtz, a Pacific Crest analyst, in a research report. ""This was a key data point highlighting the transformation in the business model. Security was another bright spot, with 45% deferred revenue growth year-over-year.""""We see the market pricing in some net benefit from a tax repatriation this year that could enable Cisco to accelerate its M&A roadmap and boost its longer-term product growth rates,"" added Kurtz.For fiscal Q2, Cisco said it earned 57 cents per share minus items, flat from the year-earlier period but topping views by a penny. Revenue fell 2% to $11.58 billion, but that beat expectations of $11.55 billion.In the current quarter, Cisco forecast EPS of 58 cents, in line with consensus estimates, and a 1% revenue drop at the midpoint of its guidance to roughly $11.78 billion. Analysts had projected $11.86 billion in revenue.Cisco hiked its quarterly dividend by 12% to 29 cents.RELATED:Cisco Systems Requires 'Needle-Moving' M&A, Says AnalystHow Cisco's AppDynamics Buy Could Impact New Relic, Splunk, IBM, HPECould Microsoft Join Cisco In Hunt For Security Firms?

Investors worldwide cringed as China's stock markets stalled and then sold off in droves.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group plunged more than 3.5%. Only FireEye, along with smaller stocks Identiv (INVE) and Ability (ABIL), survived the fall.No. 1 by IBD Composite Rating and market value in the group, cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) was down nearly 4%. Shares of fellow heavyweights Fortinet (FTNT), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) were down between 3% and 4% each.European Sales CrashFireEye stock crashed 23% in November after the company reported Q3 revenue and guided to Q4 sales that missed Wall Street projections. During Q3, FireEye lost its vice president of federal sales to Palo Alto Networks and a marketing executive to Fortinet.As a result, sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment declined sequentially for the third consecutive quarter and showed slowing year-over-year growth.Now, Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury says that FireEye stock has depreciated to an attractive buy-in point. He rates FireEye stock a buy and initiated his coverage with a 35 price target.Other analysts are bearish on FireEye stock, he notes. But ""FireEye is cheap, despite having growth of 28%, vs. the peer average of 25%.""""While it is entirely possible that the company can provide 2016 revenue/billings outlook that is below consensus, we believe the pullback of shares from current levels is limited,"" he wrote in a research report.FireEye gets a very low IBD Composite Rating: 18 out of a possible 99.Cybersecurity Market GrowthNetwork sandboxing, FireEye's bread and butter, had a $600 million total addressable market (TAM) in 2014 and is expected to have a 24% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2017, Nandury wrote.FireEye's newer segments — intrusion detection/prevention, corporate endpoint and threat intelligence security, threat analytics and security information event management — have a combined TAM of about $9 billion, Nandury estimated.""In total, the TAM for FireEye is growing at 25% CAGR through at least 2018, providing the company with significant growth opportunity,"" he wrote. He expects FireEye to have ""years of high growth"" in the mid-20% range.Nandury also expects FireEye to catch more Fortune 2000 customers. Currently, FireEye serves 50% of the Fortune 500 and 35% of the Fortune 2000.""Given that FireEye is known to catch malware other vendors missed, we expect many of the Fortune 2000 companies to deploy FireEye's solutions eventually,"" he wrote.'A Very Attractive Potential Acquisition'Plus, FireEye ""could make a very attractive potential acquisition,"" Nandury wrote, noting that the company leads its universe in interception and remediation of advanced persistent threats (APTs).""We believe the cybersecurity industry is a consolidating industry,"" he added. ""Given that FireEye has one of the best technologies to defend against APTs, we believe it could be an attractive acquisition candidate for a variety of players in the industry.""Nandury lists Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Symantec and Intel as likely acquisitive companies eyeballing FireEye.Between June 2006 and January 2014, 11 cybersecurity-oriented deals closed, Nandury wrote. Most of them are back-end heavy with six deals between 2011 and 2014.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

233,HPE,"Cybersecurity stocks zoomed higher Friday on Fortinet's (FTNT) back after the firm, late Thursday, topped Wall Street's Q4 billings views and announced a restructuring amid stalling growth.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group rocketed 5.2% in early trading on the stock market today before settling to a gain of 1.8% in the afternoon. The group, though, is down 16% year to date.Shares of CyberArk Software (CYBR), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet led the way up Friday, rising 9.3%, 7% and 6.8%, respectively. Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) stock rose 2.6% on its own late-Thursday Q4 sales and earnings beat.But Proofpoint (PFPT) stock plunged 6.5% Friday, a day after the company beat Q4 sales views but reported that losses were expected to deepen in Q1.At least two analysts cut their price targets on Proofpoint stock Friday. Fortinet stock suffered at least one downgrade and two price target cuts.Fortinet delivered a ""billings beat that will be front and center this morning,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research report.For its Q4 ended Dec. 31, Fortinet reported $380.9 million in billings, up 35% year over year. The figure topped analysts expectations for $367.5 million and the company's three-months-ago guidance for between $364 million and $369 million, Ives wrote.Billings for 2015 were $1.2 billion, up 37%.Fortinet also reported 18 cents earnings per share ex items on $296.5 million in Q4 sales, up 21% and 32%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Sales narrowly topped the consensus of 30 analysts for $296.2 million, and EPS met the model. Both measures were in line with Fortinet's guidance three months earlier for $293 million-$298 million and 18-19 cents.Fortinet wrapped 2015 with $1.01 billion in sales and 51 cents EPS ex items, exactly meeting Wall Street forecasts and in line with the company's earlier outlook.Current-quarter guidance for $270 million to $275 million in sales and 8-9 cents EPS ex items lagged the consensus for $277.7 million and 12 cents. Sales would be up 28% at the midpoint, but EPS would be flat to down 12.5% vs. the year-earlier quarter.The company expects Q1 billings of $315 million to $322 million, up 25% year over year at the midpoint of guidance. For 2016, Fortinet expects $1.5 billion to $1.52 billion in billings, a 23% year-over-year jump at the midpoint.Fortinet also announced a strategic restructuring within its U.S. enterprise sales force to focus on the midmarket and global enterprises ""following another quarter of disappointing growth,"" William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho wrote in a report. Ho maintained his outperform rating on Fortinet stock.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski noted Q4 was the first in 11 straight quarters in which Fortinet failed to exceed the high end of guidance. Product revenue of $144.8 million trailed the consensus for $147.1 million and ""was the primary culprit,"" he wrote in a report.Nowinski reiterated his neutral rating and 30 price target on Fortinet stock.But subscription revenue of $151.8 million outgrew product revenue -- 34% year over year to 30.8% year over year -- and led Fortinet to a 73.1% gross margin in Q4 vs. consensus views for 71.6%, Nowinski wrote.During Q4, Fortinet signed 577 deals worth more than $100,000, 193 deals worth more than $250,000, and 74 deals for more than $500,000 -- vs. 384, 137 and 60 deals, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter, Ives wrote.""We believe this trend will continue into 2016, as Fortinet has a nice window of opportunity to move into larger enterprises,"" he wrote.Ives retained his outperform rating on Fortinet stock but cut his price target to 38 from 44.Analysts and investors split Friday on Proofpoint stock. Wall Street applauded Proofpoint's Q4 sales beat, but investors pulled out in droves after Q1 guidance showed losses deepening by 3-4 cents per share.Proofpoint stock sank by as much as 11.5% in Friday trading, touching a year-low.For its fiscal Q4 ended Dec. 31, Proofpoint reported $74.9 million in sales, up 33% year over year, and an 11-cent loss per share, deepening from a 9-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Billings of $97.5 million exceeded the consensus for $92.7 million, Credit Suisse analyst Philip Winslow wrote in a report.Sales narrowly topped the consensus view for $73.46 million, as well as Proofpoint's guidance three months ago for $72.5 million to $73.5 million. The 11-cent loss per share was in line with expectations of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters and Proofpoint's prediction of a loss per share of 11-12 cents.The year wrapped with a 36% year-over-year sales jump to $265.4 million and a 35 cents loss per share vs. a 40-cent loss in 2014. Analysts were expecting $264 million and a 35-cent loss per share vs. Proofpoint's guide to $263 million to $264 million and 35-36 cents.But the Q1 guide disappointed.For the current quarter, Proofpoint sees $75.5 million to $76.5 million in sales, up 32% at the midpoint of guidance, and a loss per share of 14-15 cents. The consensus expected a 9-cent loss, which would have been flat year over year, while sales were merely in line.Proofpoint upped its 2016 revenue and billings outlook to $345 million to $348 million, and $428 million to $431 million, respectively.The guidance doesn't take into account recent partnerships with Intel's (INTC) McAfee and Palo Alto Networks, Piper Jaffray's Nowinski wrote in a separate report. Both ventures involve threat-intelligence sharing and joint go-to-market strategies, and ""could drive upside to estimates.""Nowinski reiterated his overweight rating and 76 price target on Proofpoint stock.Winslow maintained his overweight rating on Proofpoint stock and called it ""one of our favorite small-cap ideas in our coverage."" Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury dubbed it ""the one to own"" and reiterated a buy rating and 80 price target.During Q4, Proofpoint's TAP (targeted area protection) product grew 100% year over year for the ninth consecutive quarter, Winslow wrote. Proofpoint also sees serious upsell and cross-sell opportunities, noting 44% of all customers use two or more products.Nandury expects Proofpoint to dig into its Fortune 100 and Fortune 1000 customers to gain market share over incumbents like Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Symantec (SYMC), Microsoft (MSFT), McAfee and Cisco Systems (CSCO).Check Point notched a 5-cent EPS ex-items beat for its Q4 ended Dec. 31, but the midpoints of its Q1 guidance fell short of Wall Street views.For its Q4, Check Point reported $458 million in sales and $1.20 EPS ex items, up 9% and 12% year over year, respectively. Both topped the consensus model for $457.1 million and $1.15.Three months ago, Check Point guided to $440 million to $470 million in sales and $1.10 to $1.18 EPS minus items.Check Point wrapped the year with $1.63 billion in sales and $4.17 EPS minus items. Sales were in line with the consensus view, but EPS topped Wall Street expectations by 4 cents, and Check Point beat the high-end of its own EPS guidance by 1 cent.For the current quarter, Check Point sees $395 million to $410 million in sales and 99 cents to $1.05 EPS minus items. On a year-over-year basis, that would be down 8% and 7%, respectively, at the midpoints of guidance.Wall Street projected $404.8 million and $1.04.Regardless of the soft view, William Blair's Ho reiterated his outperform rating on Check Point stock noting the company saw strong data center and subscription growth in Q4.And Check Point is bracing for competition, he wrote.""Our discussions with re-sellers and partners suggest Check Point has been much more aggressive in courting the channel and in trying to match pricing on deals than it has been historically,"" he wrote.It's also possible Check Point could mount up through an acquisition. On Thursday, Check Point CEO Gil Shwed didn't dismiss the question during the conference call.""We are looking at the entire spectrum,"" he told investors. ""And if we can find the right opportunity and mainly the right strategic match, it can be small, it can be large.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

237,HPE,"Trying to identify which among the many enterprise software companies deserve the most attention in 2016 might be impossible, but we've cut our list down to six.Among cloud software upstarts, Splunk (SPLK), Tableau Software (DATA) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK) could make noise in the new year.And among the longtime standard-bearers, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) bear watching.These companies will generate billions of dollars in 2016 helping companies and people organize, analyze and manage ever-rising stores of data.Mobile data traffic alone will jump 1,000% from 2013 to 2018, to the equivalent of 43,709 text messages each second, says Cisco Systems (CSCO). Big Data and data analytics software turns those digits into actionable intelligence.Successes And, Uh, FailuresThe chosen six will serve well in gauging Big Data successes in 2016, says FBR analyst Daniel Ives.They will be less useful, however, for detecting Big Data failures, since most failures don't get publicized, says Svetlana Sicular, an analyst with research firm Gartner.These six offer some engaging dynamics: Splunk, Tableau and Qlik are just new enough, small enough, good enough and growing fast enough for the other three to acquire. The big three have single-digit growth rates prodding some investors to pressure for more action, like buying faster-growing rivals.""There are many companies that are extremely innovative, but the majority are not,"" Sicular told IBD. ""I gave a presentation on Big Data failures, because there are successes about which we all know but there are many failures, and people don't like to speak about them.""The Core WinnersLooking for success?""Qlik, Tableau and Splunk (are) the core winners in the Big Data trade for 2016,"" Ives told IBD. ""Front and center is Splunk. Their Big Data machine-to-machine analytics footprint is poised to see an inflection of growth in 2016 and beyond.""The company's Splunk Enterprise solution has been viewed as the 'go to' Big Data platform that is helping enterprises and governments launch their Big Data endeavors. We view this as a $40 billion market opportunity the next few years, with Splunk only less than 10% penetrated.""Next, we view Tableau and Qlik as Big Data winners, with Tableau being one of the best pure-growth companies in the tech space . .. and Qlik as the best Big Data turnaround story, with its new product portfolio, Qlik Sense. Qlik remains our top M&A candidate for 2016, with HPE, IBM and Oracle as potential acquirers.""Analyst Sicular expects some great data innovations in 2016, while people will benefit from innovations recently brought to market. She shares the tale of Climate, which agriculture giant Monsanto (MON) bought in 2013 for nearly $1 billion.""Climate Corp. installed sensors in the ground and were the first to offer crop insurance, (since) insurance companies never profited from crop insurance and gave up,"" Sicular said. ""So the innovation from Climate Corp. was they not only insured crops, but told farmers how to water the land. Those sensors were within 20 meters of each other.""The advantage was not only insuring the crops, but knowing how to very granularly grow the crops.""Sensors in the ground sound like the Internet of Things, Sicular notes: ""People didn't think back then of the Internet of Things, but that's how it worked.""Another example is John Deere (DE). They're changing their model (so it's) much more data-driven and providing preventive maintenance ... moving toward leasing their fleet, or being a different provider of their fleet, rather than selling.""There are many different models. We can't separate the data from its surroundings. We call it a convergence of social, mobile, cloud and Big Data.Built-Environment Cases""My favorite example: Fujitsu's turned one of their semiconductor fabs (chip manufacturing plants) into sort of a greenhouse, a place for growing lettuce. It turns out that some people ... cannot (eat) any foods with potassium. ... Fujitsu is growing potassium-free lettuce in a very controlled environment for a semiconductor fab.""Not only they, but other semiconductor manufacturers are implementing through the Microsoft (MSFT) Azure cloud.""Sicular cites real estate management as a good and growing market for Big Data IoT, with landlords saving 20% to 30% by monitoring and controlling built environments remotely, especially helpful in harsh climates.Online real estate firm Zillow (ZG) not only provides online home prices, but ""rich analytics about everything ... the crime situation, the level of education, all kinds of demographics, a lot more information than traditionally, and that's some of the keys to their success. ... Some of it is the availability or taking advantage of more data,"" Sicular said.She notes that NASA makes its images of earth available to the public, some in real time, and ""there's a company that predicts retail outcomes by analyzing the satellite images of parking lots in shopping malls.""Sicular divides Big Data into two categories: business extension implementation and game changing.In business extension, the technology is used to make something ""faster, better, cheaper, and it doesn't disrupt the business.""But game changing is the more exciting, she says.The Thrill Of Game Changing""Uber is not a taxi company,"" Sicular said. ""They don't own the fleet. They're a data company. Airbnb does not own rooms or hotels. They're a data company. Those would be examples of game-changing use cases.""Game changers don't have previous baggage pulling them down and can take full advantage of new technology and forward thinking, she says. ""It's much harder to change an old business than start a new business,"" she said.She calls Splunk and Tableau ""two very good companies.""Tableau, she says, offers ""one of the favorite tools for end users, which means it's here to stay ... current, prime time analytics software. It's great.""Splunk has over 10,000 users and (recently retired) CEO Godfrey Sullivan was a visionary. He was driven by the idea, and I think he's stepping down because he's satisfied with the result. I think it's a great company.""She points out that Splunk was ""the first in the Big Data world to go public (in 2012) and did everything right, growing organically with a good mix of analytics and data management.""

238,HPE,"Just as the stock market goes through a correction, earnings for the tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to record their first year-over-year decline in the past 10 quarters.A slowing China, weak global economy, strong dollar, poor PC sales and the shift to cloud computing continue to weigh on the tech sector, and the top tech companies' Q4 EPS are seen falling for the first time since Q2 2013.""Tech remains stuck in a low-growth environment, and the interaction of rising interest rates, a strong dollar, weak oil and commodities are increasing risk,"" said Bill Whyman, head of technology strategy research at Evercore ISI.Tech spending growth generally is slow, says Whyman, but he adds that underneath the surface, there is an aggressive shift in spending that favors companies connected to cloud computing, including providers of software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and young, disruptive Internet companies.Apple, Facebook, Amazon Earnings On TapThus far, 13 of the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings, including Intel (INTC) and IBM (IBM), which both provided tepid guidance that sent their shares falling.The tech earnings season gets into full swing starting Tuesday, with the biggest company of them all — Apple (AAPL) — set to report that day after the market close amid fast falling expectations for sales of its top product, the iPhone. On Wednesday comes Facebook (FB) and Qualcomm (QCOM), both after the close. On Thursday it's Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), also after the close. Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) reports on Monday, Feb. 1, after the close.The consensus estimate for the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings per share minus items to fall 3.4% from the year-earlier quarter, the fourth quarter in a row of deceleration. Subtracting Apple, which has the largest impact of any company in S&P 500, tech earnings would fall 6.7%, according to estimates collected by Thomson Reuters.For the S&P 500 as a whole, analysts call for EPS ex items, such as stock options and one-time expenses, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see its EPS tumble 73%. Excluding the energy sector, EPS is expected to rise 1.6% overall.Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings that usually put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. Not now. In terms of earnings performance, tech is in the middle of the pack among the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500.""The tech sector is now more of a mirror of the S&P index as whole,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.The tech industry has been stuck in slow-growth mode at the same time it's going through a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing — which has shattered old ways of using technology, says Evercore ISI's Whyman. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by turning to Internet-based cloud computing services provided by companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.Cloud Computing Drives TechnologyCloud computing is the dominant force in technology and will continue to accelerate, says Whyman. Among other things, cloud computing has spurred the emergence of SaaS, provided on demand as needed. SaaS leaders include Salesforce.com (CRM).Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from Taiwan and mainland China, opting for stripped-down hardware of their own design instead of brand-name products. That is rattling some of the largest information technology companies, such as IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), all of which are undergoing major transitions.This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs and now-slowing growth for smartphones and tablets.Global PC shipments fell 8.3% in the fourth quarter vs. Q4 2014, to just under 76 million units, according to preliminary results by market tracker Gartner. It was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment declines. For the year, PC shipments fell 8% to 288.7 million units. Gartner expects PC shipments to fall this year as well, but only by 1%, and it anticipates a soft recovery later in 2016.Global semiconductor sales fell 2% in 2015 to $334 billion, Gartner says, attributed not just to PCs, but also in part to weakened demand for electronic equipment amid the cloud shift and the continuing impact of the strong dollar.Strong Dollar Hurts Tech ResultsThe strong dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive, is more difficult for tech companies than other sectors.""A big variable remains the U.S. dollar, as it has a huge impact on tech,"" said Whyman. ""Tech derives more revenue from outside the U.S. than any other S&P sector.""Apple, despite the popularity of its products and huge size, is not immune to the fallout. When Apple reports earnings on Tuesday, its performance in China will be closely watched. China accounted for an estimated 25% of all iPhone sales in 2015. Slower economic growth in China and slower sales of smartphones globally are expected to pressure its earnings growth. The consensus on Apple is EPS growth of 6% year over year, which would be its slowest growth in eight quarters.As always, analysts will focus on corporate guidance, and the outlook might be especially important in this earnings cycle amid a rough start to 2016 for global stock markets.""The range of uncertainty is widening, so there is a greater interest in clues as to what 2016 might hold,"" Whyman said.Among the 12 subsectors in the S&P 500 tech group, application software leads with an expected average EPS increase of 44%. The group includes Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Salesforce.com.The Internet software and services group is expected to have the second-best performance among the tech subsectors. This includes Facebook and Alphabet, which continue to ride the rising tide of mobile and online ad growth. Facebook is expected to show EPS growth of 26%, while Alphabet is expected to post growth of 18%.Friday, some of the biggest tech companies reporting earnings in the coming week rose ahead of the major stock market indexes.Apple stock lifted 5.3% to 101.42, Facebook gained 4% to 97.94, Amazon rose 3.7% to 596.38 and Microsoft logged a 3.6% boost to 52.29.

In fiscal 2016, Cisco increased its dividend by 24%.Cisco said it earned 57 cents per share minus items, flat from the year-earlier period but topping views by a penny. Revenue for the quarter ended Jan. 28 fell 2% to $11.58 billion, but that beat expectations of $11.55 billion. Some of the sales decline stems from Cisco's sale of its set-top-box business last year. Even so, Cisco's year-over-year sales fell for the fifth straight quarter.In the current quarter, Cisco forecast EPS of 58 cents, in line with consensus estimates, and a 1% revenue drop at the midpoint of its guidance to roughly $11.78 billion. Analysts had projected $11.86 billion in revenue.In fiscal Q2, Cisco said it repurchased 33 million shares of its own common stock for $1 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco's dividend yield is higher than those of Intel, Microsoft and Apple. While telecoms have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, there are other options, such as banks, industrials and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Check out IBD's Income Investor for high-dividend-paying stocks.Cisco shares were down 0.7% in after-hours trading in the stock market today following its earnings release. Cisco stock rose 1.6% to 32.82 in Wednesday's regular session. Cisco on Tuesday climbed above a 32.05 buy point and is trading at more than nine-year highs.Cisco has been shifting to software and services from its core business of selling network switches and routers. Cisco in January said it would acquire software provider AppDynamics for $3.7 billion.Cisco has about $69 billion of cash on its balance sheet, with just over $60 billion of that overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, which could provide Cisco with more ammunition to make acquisitions or hike dividends.RELATED:Cisco Systems Requires 'Needle-Moving' M&A, Says AnalystHow Cisco's AppDynamics Buy Could Impact New Relic, Splunk, IBM, HPECould Microsoft Join Cisco In Hunt For Security Firms?

255,HPE,"Cisco Systems' (CSCO) acquisition of AppDynamics for $3.7 billion sparked takeover speculation of other software companies, with shares of New Relic (NEWR) and Splunk (SPLK) both surging Wednesday.Cisco late Tuesday snapped up AppDynamics just before it was set to be the first big tech IPO — the first tech unicorn IPO — of 2017. New Relic stock rose 11% to 36.85 in the stock market today, earlier hitting 40.10, just below a record high for a company that went public in 2014 at 23.Splunk stock rose 7.6% Wednesday, hitting a nearly two-month high and rising above both its 50-day and 200-day lines for the first time since early this month.Cisco stock edged up 0.33% Wednesday.AppDynamics provides cloud-based software that measures and analyzes the performance of business critical applications.""The acquisition broadens Cisco's software portfolio as Cisco attempts to diversify its revenue base with more subscription and recurring revenue,"" said Alex Kurtz, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a research report. ""The traditional market for application performance management (APM) is roughly $4 billion, but analytics, the shift to cloud deployments and the consolidation of monitoring tools appears to be expanding the addressable market.""Other vendors with APM exposure include Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and NetScout Systems (NTCT). We believe there is a split in the market between the next-generation players, with AppDynamics tending more toward hybrid cloud deployments and New Relic toward public cloud and digital deployments.""IBD'S TAKE: Seacoast Banking, Inphi, GrubHub and NetEase are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. AppDynamics, which recently raised the target range of its IPO to $12-$14 a share from $10-$12, was expected to price Wednesday night and begin trading on Thursday. The software maker had targeted a maximum valuation of $1.7 billion.AppDynamics will operate as a unit in Cisco's IoT division.Splunk is an AppDynamics rival and some have said it's also been eyed by Cisco, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research note. He says those rumors likely will cool after Cisco's announcement.""We think Splunk and AppDynamics fight for budget in some customer projects and we expect the intensity of this would increase or decrease depending on how Cisco executes in integration and its leverage of AppDynamics offerings across broader distribution channel,"" Pritchard wrote. ""Some had viewed Cisco as a potential acquirer of Splunk and while SPLK and AppDynamics are somewhat complementary, we expect investor sentiment around a Cisco/Splunk combination to cool.""In any case, a host of software mergers could be in the offing, analysts say.""We expected 2017 to be a better year for software M&A, and we certainly got off to a strong start with this transaction,"" RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg said in a report. ""In addition to AppDynamics, other market leaders in the APM space include New Relic and privately-held Dynatrace as well as challengers including CA Technologies (CA), IBM (IBM), Hewlett Packard Enterprises, BMC Software and Riverbed.""Ittai Kidron, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said: ""We're mixed on the Cisco acquisition's impact on New Relic. Positively, it suggests meaningful valuation upside and could put NEWR into play (potentially IBM or another legacy APM vendor). It also could create some execution distraction at AppDynamics.""RELATED:Cisco Systems Nabs AppDynamics For $3.7 Billion, Just Before IPO

256,HPE,"Cash-rich Cisco Systems (CSCO) reports earnings for its fiscal Q2 ended Jan. 28 after the close Wednesday, after a stock breakout Tuesday and with analysts expecting management will comment on profit margins, revenue growth, M&A and shareholder returns amid the companies continuing shift to software and services from its core business of selling network switches and routers.Analysts estimate EPS of 56 cents, down a penny from the year-earlier period, on revenue of $11.55 billion, down 3%. Some of the sales decline stems from Cisco's sale of its set-top box business.Cisco, with its stock hitting a buy point Tuesday and trading at more than nine-year highs, continues to make acquisitions, including its January announcement that it would acquire software provider AppDynamics for $3.7 billion.For the current quarter, analysts estimate EPS of 58 cents, up a penny from last year's April quarter, and revenue of $11.85 billion, down less than 1%, for the No. 1 maker of networking gear.IBD'S TAKE: Weibo, Netflix, Tesla and Alibaba are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.""We think sentiment is largely tepid as investors anticipate muted top-line results with EPS numbers that may come down a tad due to the AppDynamics purchase,"" said Mitch Steves, an RBC Capital analyst, in a research report.A year ago, Cisco hiked its dividend by 24%. Cisco's dividend yield is higher than dividends offered by such companies as Intel (INTC) Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL).Cisco's market-share losses in network switching have accelerated, mainly to competition from Arista Networks (ANET). An earnings call topic could be whether Cisco plans to step up acquisitions in data center infrastructure or security. The latter now accounts for 5% of revenue.Cisco has about $69 billion of cash on its balance sheet, with just over $60 billion of that overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, which could provide Cisco with more ammunition to make acquisitions or hike dividends.Cisco stock rose 1% to 32.30 in the stock market today, touching a buy point of 32.04 out of a 16-week flat base.

257,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) acquisition of  SimpliVity for $650 million in cash will create a stronger rival to Nutanix (NTNX), the leader in the budding ""hyperconverged"" data center  infrastructure market, as well as with Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell Technologies (DVMT), the merged Dell and EMC, analysts say.HPE said late Tuesday it would buy privately held SimpliVity.Both Nutanix and SimpliVity sell software that manages network, storage and server infrastructure in private cloud platforms, an emerging market called ""hyperconvergence."" Most of their revenue comes from specialized appliances, but the market is shifting to software that runs on low-cost servers.""Strategically, we believe that this transaction makes sense as it jump-starts HPE's entry into the HCI space and likely allows for substantial revenue and cost synergies,"" said James Kisner, a Jefferies analyst, in a research report.IBD'S TAKE:  Nutanix went public at 16 per share on Sept. 30, raising $238 million. The stock peaked in its second day of trading, at 46.78, but swooned in the latter half on 2016. But Nutanix stock has gained 15% this year. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. HPE estimates that the hyperconverged market was $2.4 billion in 2016 and is expected to reach  about $6 billion by 2020.HPE stock ended trading up 0.8% to close at 22.86 on the stock market today. Nutanix fell 6.3% to 28.17. Nutanix went public at 16 in September. It has an IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A-, indicating institutions have been buying than selling.In March 2015, SimpliVity raised $175 million at a $1 billion valuation, but big companies, including Dell/EMC and HPE have pushed into the market.""Given the down-tick in valuation, it seems possible the vendor (SimpliVity) may have seen a significant slowdown in its growth rate,"" Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in his report.An RBC Capital analyst says Nutanix has market momentum.""We don't think this transaction disrupts Nutanix's momentum, and in fact, it further validates the market,"" RBC's Matthew Hedberg said in his research report. ""We think Nutanix (52% market share) was winning more than its fair share of business against both HPE (3% market share) and SimpliVity (18% market share) independently, and bringing the two companies together likely does little to change Nutanix's win rates.""RELATED:Cisco, HPE Rival Nutanix Posts Q1 Beat, But Stock FallsTech Unicorn Nutanix Embraced With Positive Coverage Post-IPO

258,HPE,"Shares of software developer Hortonworks (HDP) jumped as much as 14% Friday, following the company's fourth-quarter earnings report late Thursday that topped expectations.Hortonworks reported revenue of $52 million, topping the consensus estimate of $48 million and up 39% year over year. It posted a per-share loss minus items of 50 cents, but analysts had modeled a 60-cent loss. It lost 72 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter.In the stock market today, Hortonworks stock rose 4.7% to 10.65. But earlier it rose as high as 11.59, just triggering a sell rule because that put the stock up 20% from its Jan. 30 breakout at 9.65.Hortonworks, though, is trading well below its December 2014 initial public offering price of 16. The company is a developer of Hadoop open-source software, which companies can use to better manage so-called Big Data.IBD'S TAKE: Hortonworks is trading above its 200-day and 50-day moving average, a positive indicator, though it sports a weak IBD Composite Rating of 29. For a look at growth stocks, check out the IBD 50 listing.For Q1, Hortonworks estimates revenue of $52 million and a 53-cent per-share loss ex items, both matching the consensus estimate.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White maintained a buy rating on Hortonworks stock, with a price target of 21.""After a difficult start to 2016 that continued with a much weaker than expected earnings report last August, Hortonworks has gotten its stride back with two consecutive quarters of solid results,"" White wrote in a research note. ""Not only is Hortonworks executing better but the company is pushing more aggressively into the cloud and newer products are starting to show strong momentum.""Needham analyst Richard Kugele maintained a hold rating on Hortonworks but did not assign a price target.""The gradual recovery underway at Hortonworks over the past couple quarters continued with the company posting a solid O4,"" Kugele wrote in a research note.RELATED:How Cisco's AppDynamics Buy Could Impact New Relic, Splunk, IBM, HPE

259,HPE,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) is at a crossroads and should make ""needle-moving"" acquisitions either in data-center infrastructure, software or security, says a William Blair analyst.""We do not believe the old Cisco playbook of numerous tuck-in acquisitions combined with a few larger bets in emerging product areas will work,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a research report Monday. He maintained an outperform rating on Cisco stock, which inched down 2 cents to 31.30 on the stock market today, close to a buy point of 32.04.If Cisco ""doubles down"" on data-center infrastructure, Ader speculates, it could buy Nutanix (NTNX), Pure Storage (PSTG), Nimble Storage (NMBL) or NetApp (NTAP).If Cisco takes a ""hard pivot"" toward software, it could acquire Splunk (SPLK), Red Hat (RHT) or ServiceNow (NOW), Ader said.Cisco now garners about 5% of revenue from computer security products. It could make a big jump by purchasing Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) or Proofpoint (PFPT), Ader added.""Like its large-cap peers in IT infrastructure, we believe Cisco needs to embark on a fundamental business metamorphosis,"" Ader said in the report.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, Glaukos and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Cisco in January agreed to buy AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, just ahead of that company's planned IPO. AppDynamics provides cloud-based software that measures and analyzes the performance of business critical applications.While Cisco has a partnership with Dell-EMC on networking products,  Ader says it could ""file for a full divorce.""Ader says that Cisco's effort to build a cloud computing rival to Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), hasn't clicked. ""Its much-hyped, $1 billion Intercloud cloud-federation project launched in 2015 is expected to be shuttered shortly — likely another casualty of AWS,"" wrote Ader.The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, which could provide Cisco with more ammunition to make acquisitions, says the William Blair analyst.""We believe the company needs to place needle-moving M&A bets with a clear strategic objective, instead of its current (incremental) approach,"" he wrote.RELATED:How Cisco's AppDynamics Buy Could Impact New Relic, Splunk, IBM, HPE

260,HPE,"Symantec (SYMC) late Wednesday reported fiscal Q3 earnings and revenue that topped views but forecast current-quarter sales and profit below expectations, sending shares in the security software maker down after hours.Symantec said fiscal Q3 earnings minus items rose 23% from the year-earlier quarter to 32 cents. Revenue climbed 20% to $1.09 billion for the three months ended Dec. 30.Analysts had projected non-GAAP profit of 28 cents and $1.08 billion in revenue.In the current quarter, Symantec forecast profit of 28 cents, up 27%, and $1.08 billion in sales, up 25%, at the midpoint of its guidance range, vs. consensus estimates of 29 cents and $1.1 billion.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec stock was down 3% in after-hours trading in the stock market today, following the company's earnings release. Shares fell 1% to 27.25 in the regular session Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Revenue growth is harder to come by for security vendors these days. Chipmaker Nvidia, which tops the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks, reports earnings on Feb. 9. Inphi, a member of IBD's Sector Leaders, reports on Feb. 7.Symantec acquired Blue Coat Systems in 2016 for $4.65 billion. Blue Coat Chief Executive Greg Clark became Symantec's CEO in August. Symantec in November announced it would acquire LifeLock, a provider of identity-theft protection services, for $2.3 billion.John DiFucci, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies, says Symantec might revise guidance when the LifeLock deal closes.Symantec sells security software to both businesses and consumers. Analysts say the LifeLock deal is aimed at bolstering its Norton security unit.Symantec's anti-virus software is often bundled with PCs. The Blue Coat acquisition put Symantec in the fast-growing cloud-access security broker market. CASB products act as a middleman between a corporate network and cloud applications hosted externally.Symantec on Wednesday also announced a $1 billion debt offering. Although Symantec will have some $8 billion in debt when the LifeLock deal closes, analysts say Symantec's acquisition spree could go on. Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) are also viewed as companies that could be looking to make acquisitions.IBD's Computer-Software Security group ranks No. 148 out of 197 industry groups.

262,HPE,"Hot startup and Microsoft (MSFT) rival Slack Technologies is pushing into the enterprise market, a move that will be closely watched by rivals and potential acquirers like Salesforce.com (CRM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).Slack and its business messenger app have been valued at more than $3.8 billion, so the company is among the tech unicorns — startups valued at $1 billion-plus. Slack says it has more than 4 million daily active users, with 1.25 million paid.Slack on Monday said it's developing a new version of its communications software for large companies. Slack's team chat app has been popular with businesses with fewer than 100 employees.Microsoft is creating a new office chat app that competes with Slack, while Cisco reportedly also has a rival technology in the works. Microsoft aims to integrate its app with Office 365.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft is trading near record highs. For a look at companies hitting 52-week highs, listed according to Composite Ratings, regularly check IBD's New Highs list.While Microsoft mulled an offer for Slack before buying LinkedIn last year, Slack makes a good fit for Salesforce.com, says Andrew Bartel, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.""Slack would make sense for Salesforce.com,"" said Bartel. ""Slack is a competitor to Microsoft Office. It would put Salesforce into a new category of communications software.""The Microsoft-Salesforce rivalry has been heating up.Slack has said it would not consider an IPO before 2018. Slack's chat app replaces emails by setting up textual conversations among groups involved in team projects.Slack in late 2016 partnered with Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), which is integrating the chat app with its G Suite cloud collaboration software.Salesforce.com doled out more than $4.6 billion in 2016 making acquisitions, including its $2.8 billion the purchase of e-commerce firm Demandware, which helps companies run their online shopping sites. Salesforce.com backed away from making an offer for Twitter (TWTR).Cisco in January acquired AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, sparking takeover speculation of other software companies, such as New Relic (NEWR) and Splunk (SPLK). AppDynamics provides cloud-based software that measures and analyzes the performance of business critical applications.Shares of Salesforce dipped 0.7% to close at 78.58 in the stock market today.

Analysts had expected EPS of 23 cents and revenue of $379 million.For the current quarter, ServiceNow forecast revenue of $406 million to $411 million, up 33% to 34%.

For the year, ServiceNow forecast revenue of $1.82 to $1.85 billion vs. consensus estimates of $1.8 billion.Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin maintained a neutral rating on the stock, citing its steep climb of late. ServiceNow stock is up 22% in 2017.""While we believe that the company is well-positioned to execute on its goal of $4 billion in revenue in 2020, we would remain sidelined at current valuation levels pending a better entry point,"" Zukin said in his research report.RELATED:How Cisco's AppDynamics Buy Could Impact New Relic, Splunk, IBM, HPESalesforce.com Stock Rallies In 2017 As Top Software Pick

264,HPE,"Initial jobless claims fell by 5,000 last week to 267,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average rose by 1,750 to 272,500, a three-month high.But by either measure, unemployment filings have held below 300,000 for almost the entire year, hitting a long-term low in July. Sub-300,000 readings normally signal booming job gains, but not in this economic cycle.Net job growth has been mediocre. Yes, there have been layoffs. Hewlett-Packard, now split into HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), announced plans to cut 30,000 workers. Oil services firms Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have announced tens of thousands of job cuts as demand plunges with the price of crude.But jobless claims and layoffs aren't the culprit. The problem is that actual gross hiring — hiring before any job cuts or exits — still hasn't returned to pre-recession levels, according to Labor's JOLTS report. Truth be told, gross hiring wasn't booming in the prior 2001-2007 expansion either, so failing to live up even to that pace isn't encouraging.Weak gross hiring likely is one reason why the labor force participation rate, including among prime-age workers, remains so low. Weak hiring — and firing — also suggest a less-dynamic economy. Some labor market churn is good, as workers move to more-productive jobs and industries.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

""We strengthened our existing portfolio while investing aggressively in new opportunities like Watson Health, Watson Internet of Things and hybrid cloud.""For 2015, IBM said total cloud revenue, including public, private and hybrid, rose 43% (up 57% adjusting for currency and its divested System X business) to $10.2 billion.Revenues for cloud delivered as a service — a subset of the total cloud revenue — increased 50% to $4.5 billion. Revenue from business analytics rose 7% (16% adjusting for currency) to $17.9 billion. It said revenue from mobile more than tripled, and security revenue rose 5%.In a conference call with the media after its earnings release, company CFO Martin Schroeter said IBM will continue into invest in strategic imperatives to drive its transformation. He said IBM spent $6 billion on research and development in 2015. In addition, it spent $3 billion to acquire 14 companies, half in the cloud market.""We've maintained high levels of investments and see returns from them,"" Schroeter said.IBM isn't the only long-time, or legacy, tech vendor amid a major transition. Other tech giants amid transition and struggling for growth include Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).""Over the past year, growth has been like watching grass grow as these large, traditional informational technology vendors face a Kilimanjaro-like climb in their quest for success in this ever-changing IT landscape,"" wrote FBR analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note last week.As evidenced by Dell's planned acquisition of EMC, ""these once almighty stalwarts are now scratching their heads trying to figure out the path for a renaissance of growth around cloud, Big Data, cybersecurity and the Internet of Things,"" Ives wrote.IBM has said it will plow $3 billion over the next four years into its Internet of Things unit.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a research note last week, ""We view 2016 as another transition year as IBM ramps investments, with 2017 a possible payoff as strategic imperative exceeds core franchise revenue.""

306,HPE,"It should be among the most unusual earnings conference calls in corporate history — certainly in Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) history, which by the time the company reports after the close Tuesday will have gone back, oh, 24 days since it became a company, though it's also 76 years old and could claim to be the pioneering Silicon Valley tech outfit.Reporting its fiscal Q4, which ended Oct. 31, Meg Whitman will hold court as both the new chairwoman and chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and as the continuing chairwoman and former chair and CEO of the former Hewlett-Packard, now known as HP Inc. (HPQ).HP Inc. kept the former Hewlett-Packard's ticker, HPQ. Hewlett Packard Enterprise got a new ticker, HPE.HP Inc. keeps the legacy computers and printer businesses. Hewlett Packard Enterprise takes the more ephemeral but — some analysts say — more promising enterprise services and cloud-enabled technologies businesses.In the past week, investors bid up Enterprise stock 6%, and 3% on Friday alone, to 14.21. That was its second best day of the month but still 5.5% off its open Nov. 2.Q4 might also be known as a clean-up quarter, a place to book some of the losses and charges related to the restructuring. Whitman said in September that the reorganization will impact cash by about $2.6 billion over three years starting in the current year, its fiscal 2016.""These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,"" Whitman said in September. ""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes, and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring.""Cost savings are coming, in part, from the elimination of as many as 30,000 jobs from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, three years after the old, combined Hewlett-Packard cut 55,000 jobs. At the time of the September Q3 earnings release, the combined company had about 302,000 jobs.For Q4 2015, the old Hewlett-Packard estimated that EPS minus items for the entire company would range from 92 to 98 cents. The estimate excludes 80 cents in separation costs and other charges.Analysts ascribed more than half of that income, 52 cents, to the future Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Thomson Reuters analysts estimated Q4 revenue at $13.5 billion.For Q1, ending Jan. 31, analysts expect Enterprise to earn 44 cents per share, minus items, on $12.77 billion in revenue.In Q3, ended July 31, the old Enterprise Group sales rose 2%, with a 13% operating margin, the old company said.""While we have to wait for HP's Q4 results to see the first full post-split balance-sheet details, HPE's filings disclose a pro-forma cash and investment position totaled approximately $11.5 billion exiting Q3,"" wrote Stifel analyst Aaron Rakers in a research report. ""HPE's total debt position stands at (about) $16 billion; however, it is important to note that this includes about $10.6 billion on HP Financial Services debt. This leaves HPE net operating cash at approximately $5.5 billion exiting Q3 (excluding about $615 million of reported HPFS cash).""We would note that prior conversations have suggested that HPE will be focused on maintaining an investment-grade debt rating or a debt-to-EBITDA in the 2.0x-2.5x range.""We expect investors to focus on HPE's capacity to make strategic acquisitions.""Stifel initiated Hewlett Packard Enterprise with a hold rating.

307,HPE,"Looking to push the legacy (i.e. old) giant tech stalwarts to use their cash piles to buy their way into faster growth, FBR analyst Daniel Ives issued a research report Thursday that praised Microsoft (MSFT) for its transition but kicked others — Cisco Systems, Oracle, IBM and Hewlett Packard — for their ""treadmill approach"" to expansion.And then he issued a wish-list of his top 10 tech tie-ups for 2016.""It has been a choppy environment for tech players with a very bipolar IT spending backdrop,"" Ives said. ""On the large-cap front, we have seen many changes from the HP split (into HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to the largest tech merger ever in Dell/EMC (EMC).""Dell offered $67 billion in October to buy EMC.""That said, it has been a tough road for many of these traditional tech stalwarts such as Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM), Cisco (CSCO) and HP, as investors have gotten used to seeing lackluster growth on a quarterly basis in light of the massive secular and company-specific challenges these mature tech vendors face,"" Ives said.""The lone bright star in this cloudy large-cap enterprise tech space has been Microsoft, which is gaining momentum into 2016, as (CEO Satya) Nadella has made some tough decisions ('ripping the Band-Aid' off Nokia, cost cutting, free Windows 10 download strategy) to put (Microsoft) on the yellow brick road to the cloud.""We believe the combination of the Dell/EMC deal, Amazon (AMZN) (Web Services') laser focus on the cloud and Nadella's 'golden child' success has put more heat in the kitchen for CEOs such as (IBM CEO Ginni) Rometty, (HPE CEO Meg) Whitman, (Oracle co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd), and (Cisco CEO Chuck) Robbins to change from their 'treadmill approach' heading into 2016 and to focus on M&A and/or organic growth initiatives.""FBR's top 10 merger-and-acquisition wish list for 2016, ""in no particular order,"" Ives said, are:• (1) Cisco and NetApp (NTAP),• (2) Cisco and FireEye (FEYE),• (3) IBM and Splunk (SPLK),• (4) IBM and Qlik Technologies (QLIK),• (5) HPE and Box (BOX),• (6) HPE and Qlik,• (7) Oracle and Verint (VRNT),• (8) Oracle and NetSuite (N),• (9) Microsoft and Imperva (IMPV), and• (10) Microsoft and Qualys (QLYS).""... we believe EMC/Dell has disrupted the landscape and will force many of these mature tech stalwarts to finally be more aggressive in 2016 instead of fretting about valuations, as they need to focus on putting fuel back in their near-empty growth tanks,"" Ives said.

313,HPE,"Technology giant IBM (IBM) on Tuesday remained in the buy zone it retook last week, but an investment bank threw cold water on theories that Big Blue might be in the early stages of a turnaround.With shares up and the company's so-called ""strategic imperatives"" revenue expected to rise 14% in 2016, ""there is a temptation to call this the beginning of a turnaround at IBM,"" Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a research report Tuesday. ""However, our closer examination highlights that a series of nonoperational, nonrecurring items are supporting the EPS.""We believe the structural profitability may continue to erode.""IBD'S TAKE: IBM hit a 52-week high last week, but which stocks are touching that level now? Quite a few, but always a good idea to parse these stocks by strength, which you find in IBD's New Highs. The companies are ranked by Composite Rating, which is based on key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.Garcha, who has an underperform rating on IBM stock, lowered his estimate for 2017 earnings per share to $12.64 from $12.74, vs. Wall Street consensus of $13.90.IBM stock, however, rose 1.7% to 168.25 in the stock market today.

The company has turned its focus to what it calls its strategic imperatives: cloud, mobile, security, data analytics and social business.In the meantime, though, Garcha says actions that have helped shore up its EPS in the past are less effective. He sees the company seeing lower returns from its intellectual property, for example. He says stock buybacks have helped but have ""led to an underinvestment in R&D.""He also says the job cuts and workforce rebalancing taking place at the company over the past five years ""has become less and less effective.""RELATED:IBM Among Megacaps At Buy Points; GE, Home Depot, Comcast, TooIBM CEO Among Those To Attend Trump Tech Summit

314,HPE,"Apple (AAPL) needs to dramatically increase its cash dividends if it wants to entice investors to buy its stock, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said Wednesday.The Cupertino, Calif.-based consumer electronics giant has posted three straight quarters of declining sales and earnings on a year-over-year basis. For the current quarter, Apple's fiscal Q1, Wall Street is modeling a 2% increase in sales and a 2% decrease in earnings per share.Investors are looking to the Fall 2017 release of the iPhone 8 as the next major catalyst for the stock. But White says the company could create interest in the stock before then by increasing its dividend yield to that of its peers. Apple traditionally updates its capital return program in April, when it releases fiscal Q2 results.""Given the roller coaster ride that Apple investors continue to find themselves on each year, we believe Apple should materially hike its dividend yield to a range of 3.5% to 4.0% (vs. 2.1% now) to attract more value investors that can act as a steadying force during rough patches,"" White said in a research report. ""The excuse that Apple's stock is so cheap, the company can buy back more shares (vs. a material dividend hike), is wearing thin.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been below its 50-day moving average, a negative sign, since Nov. 1. More attractive stocks for investors to consider can be found on the IBD 50 list of top growth companies.Apple should significantly increase its dividend even without a repatriation of foreign profits, he said. President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a corporate tax holiday on foreign profits.""Repatriation or no repatriation, we believe Apple should meaningfully hike its dividend,"" White said. ""Already, Cisco (CSCO), IBM (IBM) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are sporting a dividend yield of approximately 3.5%. When will Apple join the party?""White reiterated his buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 185.Apple rose 1% to 111.03 on the stock market today, working on a flat base with a possible buy point of 118.79. But shares are still trading below their 50-day line.RELATED:Are Apple, FANG Stocks Ready To Join The Trump Rally?Trump Targets Drug Prices, Apple, Seeks '5 Minutes' With Offshoring FirmsSquare Stock Gains On Apple Pay Mobile Partnership

318,HPE,"HP Inc. (HPQ) is making ""Star Wars""-themed personal computers, but the Force definitely wasn't with the PC and printer maker late Tuesday when it reported fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings.HP's PC and printer businesses brought in revenue of $12.66 billion in fiscal Q4 ended Oct. 31, down 14.2% year over year. The PC and printer businesses racked up earnings before taxes of $1.16 billion, down 18%.The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company also gave disappointing guidance.For the current quarter, its fiscal Q1, HP expects earnings per share minus items of 33 to 38 cents, vs. analyst expectations for 42 cents. On a GAAP basis, it is targeting EPS of 27 to 32 cents, vs. Wall Street's view of 38 cents.For fiscal 2016, ending Oct. 31, 2016, HP expects to earn $1.59 to $1.69 a share excluding items, where analysts were modeling for $1.71. On a GAAP basis, its EPS guidance was in line with forecasts, at $1.50 to $1.60 vs. expectations for $1.54.HP did not give sales guidance.HP stock plunged 14% Wednesday, to 12.64.Needham analyst David Rold downgraded HP stock to hold from buy on Wednesday.Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um on Tuesday cut his valuation range on HP stock to 14.50 to 16, down from 16.50 to 18, but he continues to rate HP stock as outperform.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin reiterated his sector weight rating on HP stock, which he said was fairly valued between 13.50 and 14.'Consolidating Markets'The PC and printer markets are likely to be challenging for several more quarters, HP CEO Dion Weisler said on the company's earnings conference call with analysts.""Q4 was a difficult quarter and somewhat weaker than we expected,"" he said. HP remains a leader in two ""large, consolidating markets,"" he said.The PC market has been tough, especially in the consumer segment, because of elevated sales channel inventory, Weisler said.Also, Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system has yet to spark a rebound in PC sales.But on the commercial side of the PC business, HP achieved its highest market share position ever at 23.7%, Weisler said.""We believe that innovation and sprinkles of magic are key to differentiation as the PC market goes through consolidation,"" Weisler said. He pointed to the company's new lineup of enterprise and consumer PCs, including a Star Wars Special Edition Notebook PC made in partnership with Walt Disney (DIS) and Lucasfilm.The former Hewlett-Packard split into two companies on Nov. 1. HP Inc. sells personal computers and printers, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) sells information technology hardware, software and services to corporations and other enterprises. HP Inc. and HPE reported results together Tuesday, as Q4 was their last quarter together before their split.""Both companies are off and running,"" Meg Whitman, chairman of HP Inc. and chairman and CEO of HPE, said on the call. ""Each company has a clear, well-defined strategy and is well positioned to win in its respective market.""In Q4, HP's PC unit sales were down 12% from the year-earlier quarter, with desktops down 17% and notebooks down 5%. HP has walked away from volume PC deals that don't meet its profit margin targets, Weisler said.HP's printer hardware unit sales were down 17%, with commercial units down 23% and consumer units down 14%. Supplies revenue was down 10%.Speaking on CNBC on Wednesday, Whitman said HP Inc. performed well in a ""tough PC market.""While Windows 10 hasn't provided a catalyst yet for PC upgrades, she still says that will happen.""There's nearly 450 million PCs out there that are older than 4-1/2 years,"" she said. ""And at some point, our belief is that people are going to upgrade those PCs. And I think HP Inc. is well positioned when that happens.""Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

319,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock jumped as much as 8.5% Wednesday after the company late Tuesday posted fiscal Q4 revenue that beat views and guided fiscal 2016 performance better than analysts expected.Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock ended the day at 14.12, up 3.1%.""Our overall opinion on HPE remains unchanged"" after the earnings call, wrote Needham analyst Richard Kugele in a research report. He said the stock ""already reflects an anticipated stabilization in some of its most troubled areas.""He said positives include growth in large, tier-one hyperscale servers, while negatives included a decline in services revenue.""Overall, the outlook for FY16 is unchanged (albeit more back-end loaded) and the stock is likely range-bound at current levels,"" said Kugele, who maintained a hold rating on HPE stock.Responding to those who say HPE isn't selling enough services and products in the cloud, company CEO Meg Whitman told CNBC Wednesday that spending for private cloud products — networks and data centers that businesses keep in-house, which is HPE's focus — is growing as fast as public cloud. ""Most people don't understand that,"" she said.""Yesterday, we announced that we were partnering with Microsoft (MFST) Azure to provide the public cloud,"" she told CNBC. ""And then we have this great cloud system automation that helps you orchestrate your clouds in your data center. So if you think about where the money is spent today, interestingly, still about 85% of the spend is in traditional I.T. ... The next-biggest segment is private cloud. And the next after that is public cloud. And private and public cloud are growing at about the same rate.""So we are going right to the heart of what our customers are asking. And I feel really good about our strategy and excited about the partnership that we announced yesterday with Microsoft Azure.""Microsoft Azure competes with market leader Amazon Web Services, a unit of Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and others in providing public cloud services.Needham's Kugele liked the Azure partnership and the fact that HPE was ""abdicating"" in the public cloud sector, but he pointed out that Azure is fighting against AWS, ""and ultimate success is going to be a marathon and not a sprint.""New Era BeginsEnterprise is roughly half — most analysts say the more promising half — of the Nov. 1 split of the legendary 76-year-old Hewlett-Packard Co. The other half, HP Inc. (HPQ), focuses on the PC and printer businesses, and it kept the old HPQ ticker.The Q4 report was the last for the old company, which Whitman also chaired. It earned 93 cents per share minus items in its fiscal Q4 ended Oct. 31, down 12%, on revenue of $25.7 billion, down 9%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 97 cents on $26.35 billion.Enterprise's pro forma portion of Q4 sales fell 4% to $14.1 billion but was up 3% in constant currency. Analysts were expecting Enterprise to post Q4 revenue of $13.5 billion.Enterprise reaffirmed its fiscal 2016 outlook of $1.85-$1.95 in adjusted earnings per share, with the $1.90 midpoint higher than the $1.88 estimated by analysts on revenue of $50.81 billion.Whitman told analysts in the conference call following Tuesday's earnings release that HPE ""will double down on our private and managed cloud (efforts), and sunset our public cloud."" Of ""the move to a hybrid cloud environment ... you can expect to hear more.""Needham analyst Kugele said that with HPE still on its way to 30,000 layoffs, and the service business determined to ""drag its margins higher through careful contract signings, we are most focused on the storage and server opportunity for HPE. In servers, the lumpy buying pattern of tier-1 hyperscale customers helped them in the quarter but is hardly consistently reliable.""Nevertheless we expect the segment to show slight growth in fiscal '16.""He said storage has benefited from ""aggressive pricing,"" but he sees more competition from rivals such as NetApp (NTAP) and Pure Storage (PSTG).""Bottom line, there are more puts and takes and caveats than investors should accept in a long thesis,"" Kugele wrote. ""Staying on the sidelines.""

393,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are in the same boat amid light guidance heading into 2017: Investors will wait-and-see whether President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tax reform will enable them to bring back overseas cash for bigger stock buybacks.HPE late Tuesday reported fiscal Q4 earnings that edged Wall Street estimates, but revenue and its current-quarter EPS guidance came in light. Shares initially fell, but closed strong to finish up 2.9%, at 23.54, in the stock market today. That's just shy of a 23.63 buy point from a cup base. HPE topped that entry point a few times in the past two weeks, hitting an all-time intraday high of 23.85 on Friday, but hasn't closed in buy range.Trump has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, with tax rates falling from 35% to 10%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).""HPE's Q4 results reflect challenges similar to those at Cisco: mixed regional execution but overall stable demand in the United States and some weakness in the United Kingdom,"" said Alex Kurtz, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a research report. ""A key catalyst is the potential treatment of its foreign cash under the new U.S. administration and how this could affect buybacks and/or M&A next year.""IBD'S TAKE:  Of the three large cap stocks in IBD's Computer-Tech Services group, HPE has the highest Composite Rating, a metric in CANSLIM investing. HPE's CR is 80 out of a possible 99, while Accenture's is 73 and IBM follows at 52. CACI International has a CR of 90, but it trades in low volume.Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, had a similar view after Cisco reported fiscal Q1 earnings on Nov. 17. ""Cisco has one of the largest overseas cash hoards at roughly $60 billion and has been a poster child for repatriation and corporate tax reform. At the very least, we expect Cisco could use repatriated cash to buy back stock and/or increase the dividend, which could boost shares,"" he wrote last week.Cisco guided to January-quarter earnings per share of 56 cents vs. consensus estimate of 59 cents.HPE said non-GAAP earnings rose 17% to 61 cents in the three months ended Oct. 31, while revenue, adjusted for divestitures and currency, fell 7% to $12.5 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected 60 cents and $12.8 billion.In the current quarter, HPE forecast profit of 44 cents at the midpoint of its guidance vs. consensus estimates of 46 cents.On  its earnings call, HPE told analysts that server revenue fell 6% and networking sales were flat, but solid-state flash storage was a bright spot, up 100% year over and now at an annual run-rate of $750 million.HPE might have lost share in the server market to Cisco, said a Jefferies report.HPE in May said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC). Then in September, HPE said it would spin off its software business and merge it with U.K.-based Micro Focus International""Ahead of its pending divestiture, enterprise services posted a good quarter, with better-than-expected revenues and a strong margin performance,"" said Tim Long, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, in a report. ""Within enterprise group, high-margin technology services revenues were also a bit better, an encouraging sign as HPE transitions itself.""Wrote Citigroup analyst Jim Suva in his report: ""While there are many moving parts to the business, we believe investors are under-appreciating the FCF (free cash flow) generation and net cash improvement for HPE"" since the former Hewlett-Packard split into two companies, HPE and the PC/printer company HP Inc., last November.Mizuho on Wednesday hiked its price target on Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock to 22 from 20.RELATED:Big Stock Buyback Boost Coming From Trump Tax Proposal: Goldman SachsCould HPE Go Shopping For Cisco Rival Arista Networks?HPE To Spin Off Software Unit, Slims Down As Dell Bulks UpWill Broadcom Chip Boost Arista Networks Vs.

394,HPE,"Some of Silicon Valley's biggest companies are trying to smooth over frictions with President-elect Donald Trump, but the soon-to-be tweeter-in-chief's possible protectionist trade measures and strained relations with China could spell trouble for the tech industry.Trump met with 14 tech leaders on Wednesday, and the tech summit's main topic included China. Those attending included the CEOs of Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) and Intel (INTC). Facebook's (FB) No. 2 exec also attended. But few details about the closed meeting were revealed.Trump, who took shots at Apple, Amazon and tech in general during the campaign, looked to forge some common ground with the tech leaders. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in the only public comment by a tech attendee, called the meeting ""very productive."" At the meeting's start, which was open to the press, Trump complimented the industry and said he wanted to help it do well.But Trump is off to a rocky start with China's government, starting with a breach of long-held protocol by accepting a phone call from Taiwan's president. China claims Taiwan as part of China, and the U.S. has officially recognized ""One China"" diplomatic relations since 1979. The Trump camp has suggested the One China policy could be used as a bargaining chip to win future trade concessions.During the campaign, Trump promised to brand China a currency manipulator. He warned of slapping a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is a current member of the exclusive IBD Leaderboard, where only the very best stocks at or near buy points reside. Netflix has a conventional buy point of 129.39, but investors willing to be more aggressive should check out Leaderboard for some more information.If Trump follows through and elevates the international status of Taiwan and enacts protectionist trade measures, China's government would retaliate, observers say. China did protest Trump's phone conversation with Taiwan's president.U.S. tech, and other, companies should be ""plenty worried"" about Trump's statements, says Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But if Trump's words don't turn into action, it could blow over. China will hold Trump more accountable once he's sworn in as president on Jan. 20, Lardy says.""He's not president yet,"" Lardy said. ""There are a lot of things China could do, but I don't think they will do any of them until there's something that goes beyond rhetoric.""Talking about how he's going to be a hard deal maker, all these things are not going to set the Chinese off on a path of retaliation immediately. But if it becomes more concrete than just rhetoric, at that point you could see retaliation in the commercial sphere. There are lots of screws they can turn on U.S. companies.""China's possible retaliatory actions include case-by-case enforcement of anti-monopoly laws and business regulations, slapping tariffs on U.S. goods and favoring European multinationals in purchases. China also could put an economic embargo on Taiwanese products.One worry for Silicon Valley is that Trump's transition team and early Cabinet appointments have few ties to the tech industry. Trump has focused on manufacturing jobs, not the digital economy.

Wang Jianlin, China's richest man and chairman of real estate and entertainment giant Dalian Wanda Group, has warned Trump of trouble if Chinese acquisitions of U.S. assets are blocked.Since China joined the World Trade Organization 15 years ago, U.S. exports to China have risen by more than 600%, while U.S. exports to the rest of the world rose by 80%, Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia, told IBD in an email.The U.S. ran up a $366 billion trade deficit with China last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It has been declining, but Trump aims to lower further.""Many American jobs and corporate profits would be lost if China would retaliate against new tariffs, including in the Republican-leaning Farm Belt, as China is the second-largest market for American agricultural exports, led by soybeans,"" Rothman said.

424,HPE,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) delivered another quarter of stellar performance wherein its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while earnings matched the same. Moreover, the company’s revenues increased for the seventh consecutive quarter, out of which the last six recorded double-digit growth after a prolonged period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments’ performance improved for the fifth straight quarter, after 2010.In fact, the company’s outstanding results for the last few quarters substantiate that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), along with its diligent restructuring initiatives, is finally paying off.HP’s total revenues climbed 13% year over year to $14 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.6 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments, as well as successful product roll outs.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 48 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and came toward the higher-end of management’s guided range of 45-49 cents. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP earnings improved 20%. The robust bottom-line performance was mainly backed by higher revenues and lower share counts.HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $8.8 billion, up 14% year over year, mainly driven by strong demand for high-end products and a 7% rise in prices.  While commercial revenues increased 16%, consumer revenues were up 10%.We believe the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, are ultimately paying off.Notably, International Data Corporation (IDC), in its latest report on first-quarter 2018 PC shipment, stated that this quarter marked the eighth consecutive quarter of overall shipment growth for HP.Coming to the Printing business, the segment’s revenues were up 11% year over year to $5.2 billion, primarily stemming from an 8% increase in supplies revenues and inclusion of the recently-acquired business of Samsung’s printing (S-Print) business. It should be noted that the buyout of S-Print has helped HP in the $55-billion high-end copy-machine market where Xerox Corporation (XRX  -  Free Report) is currently the leader.HP’s total hardware unit sales grew 13%, backed by the Consumer hardware unit’s increase of 4% and the Commercial hardware unit’s year-over-year growth of 88%. The robust growth in Commercial hardware units chiefly stemmed from the recent inclusion of S-Print business.Region wise, the company registered double-digit growth in every region it operates. Revenues from Americas were up 7% year over year. While revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) climbed 21%, the same from the Asia Pacific and Japan region jumped 13% year over year.Gross margin expanded 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 19.3%. This was primarily supported by increased pricing and improved mix in the Personal Systems segment, which more than offset elevated component costs, particularly the NAND flash chips.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 16% year over year to $1.7 billion. This was mainly due to the inclusion of the S-Print business, and increased investment in research and development, as well as go-to-market sales strategies.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations remained flat year over year at 7%, as benefit from improved gross margin was fully offset by elevated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $798 million compared with $685 million reported a year ago.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion compared with $5.5 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $4.5 billion compared with $6.3 billion reported in the last reported quarter.The company generated cash flow of $2 billion from operational activities during the first half of fiscal 2018. HP repurchased shares worth $1.3 billion and paid dividends worth $457 million, during the same time frame.GuidanceBuoyed by improving market share across the PC and Printer businesses, HP raised its non-GAAP earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now estimates non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.97 and $2.02, up from the earlier guidance of $1.90 and $2.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.93.On the cost front, the company anticipates that overall component and logistic costs for Personal Systems will escalate throughout fiscal 2018. Moreover, from the beginning of the fiscal second quarter, the company has been witnessing rise in material costs in the Printing segment, which are expected to continue flaring up in the second half of the fiscal too.Coming to the fiscal third quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 49-52 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 49 cents.Our TakeWe are impressed by the performance of HP’s PC segment, wherein the year-over-year increase can be attributed to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues. Additionally, the company’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. Meanwhile, it has been working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.The latest PC shipment data by IDC indicates that HP’s restructuring initiatives, including focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs, are paying off gradually. Per the data compiled by IDC, the company witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the seventh quarter in a row, after witnessing declines for five consecutive quarters.With the commencement of the shipping of A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP is likely to revive the company’s printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Also, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.Nonetheless, prices of components such as DRAM and NAND are likely to remain high in 2018, which will continue to drag down the company’s margins. Although the company’s strategic efforts are driving top-line growth, those might not be enough to offset this incremental cost.Moreover, competition from the likes of Lenovo, Dell and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is another key concern.HP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

425,HPE,"It was another interesting week on Wall Street, with early optimism about progress made in ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China giving way to caution after President Trump cancelled a proposed meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jung Un.On the earnings side of things, fresh reports from the likes of HP Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) helped mark one of the last busy stretches of the Q1 report season. Results were mixed this week, doing little to help broader indexes break out of the ranges they have been stuck in throughout recent months. Still, a few more marquee reports in the upcoming week have the potential to help that cause.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of May 28.1. Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report)Enterprise software and cloud computing giant Salesforce is slated to release its latest quarterly report after the market closes on May 29. Shares have moved nearly 10% higher in the past month, and the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

426,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein its top and bottom lines came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also marked robust year-over-year improvements. The robust quarterly results were mainly driven by the merger of the Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report).Notably, in 2016, Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into a spin-off-merger agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation, wherein it agreed to spin-off its Enterprise Services division and merge the same with the latter’s businesses. The transaction closed on Apr 1, 2017, and the new entity was named DXC Technology.Coming back to the fiscal fourth-quarter results, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of $2.28 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19, and also increased year over year.DXC Technology Company. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteQuarter DetailsRevenues in the quarter came in at $6.294 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $$6.12 billion. On a pro forma combined company basis, the company registered year-over-year growth of 4.3%. However, on a constant-currency basis, revenues edged down 1.3% year over year.Segment wise, pro forma revenues from Global Business Services (GBS) increased 3.3% on a year-over-year basis to $2.36 billion. The company continues to witness shift in traditional application services to enterprise and cloud applications.Global Infrastructure Services (GIS) revenues during the fiscal fourth quarter came in at $3.22 billion, marking 3.3% year-over-year growth on a pro forma combined company basis. The year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by growth in the company’s “cloud and platform services as well as mobility and workplace.”USPS revenues came in at $710 million during the quarter, up 11.1% year over year on a pro forma combined company basis. Notably, this was the last quarter when the company reported USPS results as its operating segment. As the spin-off of USPS will close on June 1, this year, the company will not include this segment under its operating results anymore.The company’s adjusted operating income from continuing operations, on a pro forma combined company basis, amounted to $1.03 billion. Adjusted operating margin came in at 16.2% as compared with 10.2% reported in the prior-year quarter, on a pro forma combined company basis. The robust improvement was mainly driven by the achievement of approximately $1.1 billion of cost synergies from CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services division merger during fiscal 2018.Adjusted net income from continuing operations came in at $661 million during the quarter as compared with $387 million reported in the year-earlier period on a pro forma combined company basis.The company exited the reported quarter with $2.648 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared with $2.926 billion recorded in the previous quarter.

Adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2018 came in at $2.427 billion. During this period, the company returned $306 million to shareholders through share buyback and dividend payments.Fiscal 2019 OutlookThe company initiated fiscal 2019 outlook. For the fiscal, DXC Technology projects revenues of $21.5-$22 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $23.85 billion.The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share between $7.75 and $8.15. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $8.97.During the fiscal, the company projects incremental cost savings of $400 million.Bottom LinePost merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. This alliance has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology might be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio, which is likely to drive growth over the long run. Notably, since its formation, the company has announced six acquisitions — Tribridge, Logicalis SMC, Racemi, M-Power, eBECS and Stable37.Currently, DXC Technology has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

427,HPE,"Benchmarks closed higher on Wednesday after President Trump reached an agreement with key members of Congress to extend the debt ceiling deadline. This was done to aid the relief funding for victims of Hurricane Harvey. However, another category 5 Hurricane Irma gained momentum and is slated for land fall on the coast of Florida this weekend. News of Irma’s coming sent the timeshare and vacation stocks lower. Meanwhile, Fed’s Vice Chairman announced his plans to retire in mid-October, citing ‘personal reasons’ behind his decision.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,807.64, gaining 0.3%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.3% to close at 2,465.54. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,393.31, increasing 0.3%. A total of only around 6.3 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.65-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.27-to-1 ratio.Debt Ceiling Deadline to be ExtendedMarkets closed higher on Monday after President Trump agreed with congressional leaders to support the extension of the debt ceiling deadline in order to fund a relief program to tackle the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. This short-term debt ceiling extension comes as a part of the Hurricane Harvey relief Bill which provides government funding for the victims of Hurricane Harvey. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also expressed support for the package.Extension of the debt ceiling is primarily part of the agenda of the Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced that a decision to push through the Bill was reached after Trump reached an agreement with congressional leaders in a meeting at the White House.The idea to push deadline ahead by only three months was met with open criticism by members of the GOP. House Speaker Paul Ryan termed the proposition by as ""ridiculous"" and ""unworkable."" Such comments hurt the investor sentiment. The House approved almost $8 billion on Wednesday as a part of the Hurricane Harvey relief funding. However, this did not include the debt ceiling extension or provisions for government spending.Possible Fallout of Hurricane IrmaThe likelihood of a category 5 hurricane, Irma, hitting the coast of Florida this weekend has increased, according to the National Hurricane Center. The eye of the hurricane passed over the island of Barbuda on Wednesday, moving northwest toward Puerto Rico. Hurricane Irma’s northern eye-wall pummeled Anguilla and is currently moving 90 miles east of San Juan, Puerto Rico.Market watchers closely followed the hurricane and its likely fallout sent timeshare stocks lower on Wednesday. Shares of Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV  -  Free Report) and Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) declined 1.4% and 1% respectively.Energy Shares Gained MomentumEnergy shares gained on Wednesday after oil refineries resumed action on Wednesday. Resumption of business led to increased demand for oil by the refineries thereby boosting energy shares.Nine of the 11 main sectors of the S&P 500 ended in the green on Wednesday, with energy leading the advancers. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) was up almost 1.6%. Shares of Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) gained nearly 2% on Wednesday. These gains pushed both the S&P 500 and the Dow higher. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Fischer plans to quit in mid-October, whereas his term would have officially ended in June next year and his term as a Fed governor would have termed in early 2020.Economists commented that Fischer’s departure would raise speculations about whether Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen would continue with her role. Moreover, market watchers would be closely watching Fed’s moves as lower than targeted levels of inflation make it difficult for the central banks to raise rates.  Investors also have a keen eye on European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting scheduled for Thursday.Economic DataFed released its Beige book report on Wednesday. As per the report, the U.S. economy recorded a ""modest to moderate"" pace of growth over past few weeks. ""Prices rose modestly overall across the country,"" the report said, indicating slow rates of inflation growth. Further, the report suggested that Fed’s measure of inflation pulled back to 1.4% in July on a year over year basis, recording its slowest rate of expansion in over a year and a half.

428,HPE,"Stock futures are up slightly in today’s pre-market, following a precipitous sell-off yesterday, especially in the Dow. Myriad concerns — from North Korea nuclear testing to Hurricane Irma heading for another major American flood plain (this time Florida) — seemed to finally cause a downturn in equities trading on Tuesday.Perhaps it was that so many concerns, which on their own never seemed to register much resistance to the overall bull market of the last 10 months, all coming at the same time — and following a holiday weekend — created a “wall of worry” in aggregate. Or maybe it has more to do with the same bell being rung over and over — such as Kim Jon-un’s 6th nuke test, or the U.S.’s 2nd major hurricane to approach our shores — that finally sets traders into generating a headwind against the long-term bulls.Hurricane IrmaConsidering the coming storm for a moment, although Hurricane Harvey off the Southeast coast of Texas is already projected to be the most expensive storm in U.S. history, Irma is much bigger and faster — 400 miles in diameter with winds 185+ miles per hour — and, in fact, is now one of the biggest storms ever recorded!So we’re seeing huge runs on supplies at Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and bottled water from companies like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) for those likely to try and ride the storm out. Hopefully this will result in unnecessary stockpiles if Irma suddenly turns back out to sea, but for now preparations are for another catastrophic storm to hit later this week. Irma is already bearing down on Puerto Rico this morning.Multitudes BuildingEither way, this theory would suggest that the more we see getting in the way of a prosperous market, complete with robust U.S. labor and lower-than-expected inflation, the more we see the likelihood of pushback and thus more red closings on the main indices. For today, we’re seeing a bit of a rebound ahead of the bell, perhaps the result of no new negative reports coming from North Korea or Hurricane Irma not yet making landfall in the continental U.S. to further drag stocks down.Even President Trump and Attorney General Sessions’ rollback of the “Dreamers” act — which would set about deporting 800K people currently living in the U.S. because they arrived as children undocumented — must pass through Congress before it has a material impact on our economy. Executives from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and elsewhere sent an open letter to Trump to reconsider his position on repealing DACA, to no avail. (Then again, it’s not like the president has a very good relationship with top executives these days, anyway.)July Trade DeficitWe see better-than-expected results in July’s trade balance: what was expected to ratchet up near -$45 billion has instead registered -$43.7 billion. True, we’re still deep in negative territory and slightly worse than last month’s -$43.5 billion, but the June read was the smallest deficit we’ve seen all year. Compare this with the nearly -$49 billion we saw in the first month of the year. Of course, we’re still a long way from being solvent on this measure — and likely will never be, actually — but we are in better stead than we had been earlier in the year.HPE BeatsFollowing a giant sell-off of more than 20% in the last 5 trading days at Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE  -  Free Report), shares are trading up in today’s pre-market following its positive surprise in earnings and especially revenues for its fiscal Q3 2017 after the bell yesterday: earnings of 30 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus by a penny, whereas quarterly sales of $8.21 billion easily topped the $7.79 billion we had anticipated. Higher sales in its networking equipment contributed to the beat. Shares originally rose 4% on the news, and are now roughly +2.6% a half-hours before Wednesday’s bell.

430,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 7. Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017.So, this will be the second quarterly result of the combined business. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.53, representing a year-over-year increase of a whopping 150.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained nearly unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $5.99 billion, up 220.3% from the year-ago quarter.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise  DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteDXC Technology’s fiscal second-quarter result is likely to benefit from CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services business merger, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. However, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability, offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent.Let’s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail.Merger Opens Up Avenues of GrowthPost merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.It is anticipated that the combined entity will generate revenues of approximately $26 billion. Also, DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Notably, the company had registered a 206% surge in fiscal first-quarter revenues mainly benefiting from the merger. The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology’s fiscal second-quarter top-line performance as well.Partnerships Enhancing Customer BaseGoing ahead, the company’s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud-computing market is likely to aid fiscal second-quarter results. The company, in August 2017, collaborated with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) and launched the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next-generation hybrid-cloud platform.It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT&T and HCL. It has also joined forces with Amazon to develop cloud-based solutions for enterprise and public-sector clients. In addition, it has entered into cloud-partnership agreement with IBM and SAP as well. These alliances have increased its access to new technology, backed innovative product development and creation of new markets.Also, it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility, social networking and big data facilities. This, in turn, is likely to expand DXC Technology’s customer base and help garner additional revenues.Acquisition to Generate Additional RevenuesFollowing the footsteps of CSC, DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth. Since its formation, the company has announced two acquisitions — Tribridge and Logicalis SMC. While it completed the Tribridge buyout in July this year, Logicalis SMC acquisition is still in process.Tribridge is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft’s Dynamics 365, which explains why this acquisition makes sense for DXC Technology. Therefore, the buyout is likely to benefit the company’s to-be-reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues.Escalating Interest Costs to Weigh on ProfitabilityFlaring up interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. As of Jun 30, 2017, DXC has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.25 billion, while it paid $76 million as interest expenses during the fiscal first quarter, which was 200% higher than the year-ago quarter tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt has significantly increased this year. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby increasing its interest-cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

431,HPE,"The technology sector in the United States performed exceptionally well in the third quarter. A rally in tech shares saw the tech-laden Nasdaq breach its 50th record close of this year on the last trading day of the quarter. Further, increased investment in technological R&D has also bolstered the sector’s growth.Moreover, tech shares have posted stupendous earnings throughout this fiscal and we expect this momentum to continue in the near term. Lastly, Trump’s one-time tax repatriation policy is bound to make tech companies wealthier and hence we suggest investing now. This is why it would be prudent to invest in tech mutual funds at this point.Robust Technological Developments and Excellent EarningsAnother reason why the tech stocks have outperformed the industry could be the emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearable devices, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, and artificial intelligence. Strong earnings from tech stocks throughout 2017 have also been pivotal in boosting the sector higher.The Q3 earnings season is at full throttle and we believe the bullish trend in tech is likely to continue as tech behemoths, particularly FAAMG stocks — Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — are all set to report this week. We expect the FAAMG family to report robust earnings in Q3, while the broader tech sector is expected to be up 9.7% on 6.7% higher revenues. Acceptance of the Budget Blueprint Will Bolster Tech SharesIn a 51-49 vote late Thursday, the Senate approved the budget blueprint for fiscal 2018. Economists believe that such a move ensures taxpayers that existing tax codes could soon be rewritten. Meanwhile, market watchers continue to pour money into Internet and tech companies, and the most basic thing that is driving them at this point is taxes. Trump has promised to deliver historic relief to corporate America by lowering tax rates. The corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%.Another major reform proposed is the repatriation of trillions of dollars held as cash reserve overseas by the companies with global operations for one-time tax (reportedly 10%). Moreover, in 2004, the Bush administration attempted a similar repatriation tax holiday for bringing in overseas cash reserves for a one-time tax of 5.25%. A number of companies repatriated an amount exceeding $300 billion.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM, Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) earnings are also projected to rise around 20.8% and 10.5%, respectively, on a repatriation tax cut, per Strategas Research Partners.

Moreover, these funds have encouraging third-quarter and YTD returns. Additionally, the minimum initial investment is within $5000 and net assets are above $50 million. Splendid earnings and more than favorable economic conditions make the tech sector a hotbed of money.Moreover, Trump’s one-time tax repatriation policy is deemed to improve the overall financial health of tech companies. Moreover, as the earnings momentum in the tech sector is slated to continue in the near term, we believe tech mutual funds are a hot choice.We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future.

432,HPE,"Tech has come a long way from the dot-com fiasco to a preferred trade by Wall Street pundits. Computer and software makers are having a ball as the White House’s initiative to trim tax rates are providing the much needed windfall to companies that have mostly hoarded money outside the United States. Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, while the lawmakers, regrettably, have been divided on the same so far this year.Substantial growth in cloud computing and the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, gaming and the launches of increasingly complex smartphones and consumer electronics suggest that the good times for tech will keep rolling, at least for now. Lest we forget, the “FAANGtastic five” – Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report) have gained in double digits this year. Amazon, in particular, topped the $1000-a-share level, highlighting the stellar show put up by tech stocks this year.Let us, thus, keep an eye on tech stocks that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season that has unofficially kicked off this week.Tech Stocks Could Make Billions Under Trump Tax Plan Investors continue to pour money into Internet and tech companies, and the most basic thing that is driving them at this point is taxes. Trump has promised to deliver historic relief to corporate America by lowering tax rates. The corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. This helps tech multinationals to bring funds held overseas back to the United States at a decreased tax rate. Bringing back the tech companies massive overseas cash pile would let it do a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and get involved in M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT, Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle ORCL hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM, Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) earnings are also projected to rise around 20.8% and 10.5%, respectively, on a repatriation tax cut, per Strategas Research Partners.The tax plan, in the meanwhile, aims to create three individual tax brackets with rates of 12%, 25% and 35%. The current top rate is 39.6%. The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force in the continued strength of big tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest in such bellwethers. Q3 Should be Good for TechThe third-quarter earnings season, historically, is one of the best seasons for tech stocks.As per hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, 30 days after the start of the third-quarter earnings season, the information technology sector gained an average 4.6% in the last 19 years. Meanwhile, other major sectors including industrials, materials and financials have gained 2.8%, 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively. In fact, the S&P 500 index gained a meagre 2.3% during the said period.Tech stocks had an impressive 2017 so far, while earnings for tech companies in the third quarter are expected to be up 9.7% on 6.7% higher revenues (read more: Handicapping the Q3 Earnings Season).Tech Earnings Preview: Cloud Business is a Game Changer International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) will lead the tech earnings parade on Oct 17. Can the company break it’s more than five-year long streak of quarterly revenue decline? It’s cloud revenues had increased 15% in the second quarter, but, that too was nowhere close to the triple-digit growth Microsoft witnessed in the same quarter and 40% growth Amazon reported over the last couple of years. This time around the tech major could, however, see a boost in hardware sales on the back of the security-fortified z14 mainframes introduced in July.Things are looking up for SAP SE SAP, which will report before the market opens on Oct 19. It saw 33% growth in cloud revenues and a whopping 70% growth in its S/4 Hana business suite in the second quarter. With little competition in its core market, the software and service provider is expected to see strong results in the third quarter in the aforesaid segments.Meanwhile, all await the releases from Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft on Oct 26. Alphabet’s dominance in the search marketing business seems to be getting stronger with each quarter, while Amazon continues to lead the cloud space. Investors, however, will be keen to see how Diane Greene-led Alphabet does in the cloud business. In the second quarter, Alphabet reported 33% growth to $2.2 billion in the category “other revenues” that includes cloud.Microsoft, in the meantime, has almost doubled in the three-and-a-half years since Nadella took over as CEO. The big question is whether the company can maintain growth in its cloud business. So, all eyes are on its Azure product. After all, if we combine Azure and other software-as-a-service products, Microsoft will gain an edge over Amazon in the cloud business.5 Solid ChoicesTechnology companies, nevertheless, are likely to see solid growth in Q3 on the back of favorable government policy.

433,HPE,"Last week, DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) announced the spin-off of its U.S. Public Sector (USPS) business, and subsequently merging the same with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions. The three companies have come together to form a publicly-traded IT service-providing company, primarily to the U.S. government. Notably, Vencore and KeyPoint are owned by private-equity firm Veritas Capital.Initially, the new company will have a total workforce of over 14,000 and generate annual revenues of approximately $4.3 billion. However, the firm’s name has not been decided yet. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of March 2018.Transaction DetailsPer the agreement, the deal will be structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, thereby making the entire transaction as tax-free to DXC Technology and its shareholders.Upon completion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares. Along with this, the company will receive $1.05 billion of cash from USPS, upon the completion of its spin-off. The proceeds from USPS are intended to be used for debt repayments, share buyback and other general corporate purposes.On the other hand, Veritas Capital will receive approximately 14% shareholding and a cash consideration of $400 million upon completion of the entire transaction.The current president and CEO of Vencore — Mac Curtis — will hold the position of chief executive officer of the new company, while Marilyn Crouther, senior vice president and general manager, DXC USPS, will serve as the chief operating officer. Mike Lawrie chairman, president and CEO of DXC, will chair the board of the new company, while names for other positions will be decided later.Rationale Behind the TransactionPer the company, the IT services market for both commercial and the U.S. public sectors has been evolving at an accelerating pace. Therefore, DXC Technology’s latest spin-merger move is believed to provide it a customized approach toward handling two different types of clients. Upon the successful formation, the new company will become one of the top five IT services providers to the U.S. government.Furthermore, it should be noted that Vencore is well known for providing cyber security, engineering, analytics and other IT solutions to the federal government, while KeyPoint is specialized in offering investigative services to a wide range of sectors, including federal, defense, intelligence and civilian sectors.Hence, per the company, the above-mentioned transaction is likely to fortify its capabilities in “offering differentiated, mission-driven solutions in cybersecurity, big data analytics, cloud engineering, enterprise IT services, and systems engineering – all enabled by a portfolio of cutting-edge Intellectual Property (IP).”The reinforced capabilities will help the new company win government contracts, in turn bringing in more revenues, in our opinion.Boosting Shareholders’ WealthThe latest move came just months after DXC Technology came into existence in April this year. Notably, the company is a result of the merger of the Computer Sciences and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The transaction has enhanced shareholders’ value of both the companies. Additionally, it has opened up new opportunities for driving the company’s growth.Therefore, we believe the recent spin-merger transaction of USPS business will not only boost DXC Technology’s shareholders’ value in the near term, but will also continue to create wealth over the long run.Since its first trading on Apr 4, 2017, DXC Technology has gained 34%, significantly outperforming the industry, to which it belongs to, return of 21.1%.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Nutanix Inc. (NTNX  -  Free Report) and SMART Global Holdings Inc. (SGH  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nutanix and SMART have an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 20% and 15%, respectively.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

434,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) recently announced entering into an agreement with Logicalis Group to buy the latter’s service management consultancy operation — Logicalis SMC. However, financial terms of the deal remain disclosed.The Netherlands-based Logicalis SMC was founded in 1998. This company is one of the leading providers of technology-enabled solutions for the service management sector in the Netherlands and the U.K.Moreover, Logicalis SMC is one of the biggest integrator of ServiceNow Inc.’s (NOW  -  Free Report) software and solutions, which mainly attracted DXC Technology to make such a move. It should be noted that Logicalis SMC was the first European company which became ServiceNow’s Master Solutions partner around 15 years ago.DXC Technology intends to integrate the to-be-acquired business with its Fruition Partners business which is the company’s leading global ServiceNow platform provider.The integration of Logicalis SMC business will further fortify DXC Technology’s position as a leading global software integrator for ServiceNow. The acquisition will help the company expand its presence across Europe. Also, it will strengthen its “scale, reach, industry experience and skills portfolio in the fast-growing enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) market.”Apart from this, DXC Technology will also benefit from Logicalis SMC’s strategic partnerships with companies like Cisco, International Business Machines and NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report).DXC Technology came into existence from the merger of the Computer Sciences and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The buyout of Logicalis SMC will mark DXC Technology’s second acquisition post its formation.This July, the company acquired privately-held Tribridge. Founded in 1998, Tribridge caters software services and cloud solutions needs of mid-market and enterprise customers in the areas of finance and operations, customer engagement, and human capital management.Since its first trading on Apr 4, 2017, DXC Technology has gained 26.3%, significantly outperforming the industry, to which it belongs to, return of 19.7%.We believe the recent buyouts will further solidify DXC Technology’s position as one of the leading IT services provider in the world.Post merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc. We believe the merger has opened up a number of growth opportunities for the combined company. Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology may be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio, which will likely drive growth over the long run.Nonetheless, the market is very competitive, with companies like CACI International Inc. and Accenture, which could hurt DXC Technology’s top and bottom lines. Additionally, a challenging macroeconomic situation and uncertain IT spending environment remain other headwinds.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

435,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) has been on a bit of a cold streak lately, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock. And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at HPE given that, according to its RSI reading of 26.94, it is now in oversold territory.What is RSI?RSI stands for ‘Relative Strength Index’ and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Other FactorsYet, HPE’s low RSI value isn’t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 7 earnings estimate revision move higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for HPE has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $1.40/share two months ago to $1.43/share right now.If this wasn’t enough, Hewlett Packard Enterprise also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)which puts it into rare company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now (or holding on), as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long.

436,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) reported non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 34 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents and exceeded the guided range of 29-33 cents. On a year-over-year basis, the figure almost doubled.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 49 cents from continuing operations against a loss of 37 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, it compared favorably with the guided range of 10-14 cents. The company attributed the better-than expected results to separation related tax indemnification adjustments.RevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues from continuing operations of $7.468 billion, up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Further, quarterly revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.326 billion.Adjusted for currency-exchange rates, the company’s revenues from continuing operations increased 6% year over year.The company witnessed particular tailwinds in Intelligent Edge, High-Performance Compute, Storage, Hyper Converged and Composable Infrastructure.During the reported quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s revenues in the Americas grew 3% in constant currency, primarily due to strength in storage and the Intelligent Edge. Revenues in Europe were up 9% in constant currency, with UK, France and Italy registering double-digit growth. EMEA performed pretty well with double-digit growth in compute, storage and Aruba Products and Services. Asia Pacific revenues were up 9% at constant currency, with impressive growth in Singapore, Australia and China.Segment wise, Hybrid IT revenues increased 7% year over year and 4% at constant currency to $6.023 billion. Revenues from the Intelligent Edge and Financial Services segments climbed 17.2% and 5%, respectively.Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise’s gross margin expanded 90 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 30.4%. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP operating margin increased 270 bps to 8.6%.The improvement in margins was primarily attributed to cost savings from HPE Next. Management was also positive about pricing and DRAM was less of a negative aspect compared to the previous quarters.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended fiscal second quarter with $6.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $7.7 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt at quarter end was $9.970 billion compared with $10.040 billion recorded in the first quarter.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise generated $200 million of cash flow from operational activities. However, free cash flow was negative $269 million. Additionally, during the reported quarter, the company returned $1 billion to shareholders, of which $907 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteGuidanceThe company issued an encouraging bottom-line guidance for the third quarter and raised its outlook for fiscal 2018.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, Hewlett Packard Enterprise projects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 35-39 cents (mid-point: 37 cents), which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company guides the bottom line to be in the range of 19-23 cents.Hewlett Packard Enterprise now expects non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.40-$1.50 (mid-point $1.45), up from the previous range of $1.35-$1.45 (mid-point $1.40). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.40. On a GAAP basis, the company now projects the bottom line to be in the band of $1.70-$1.80 per share, up from the prior range of $1.35-$1.45.ConclusionHewlett Packard Enterprise posted impressive financials for the second-quarter of fiscal 2018 on the back of robust performance of most of its segments. The portfolio mix was also impressive with HPE Next driving margins northward.Management is particularly optimistic about its recent acquisitions of Cape Networks and RedPixie, which are expected help the company penetrate deeper and wider into the market, thereby boosting the top line.Management is also positive about the newly launched complementary AI-based assurance and analytics solution called NetInsight, meant for optimizing network performance. The company is enhancing its capabilities in the hybrid IT model, which will drive revenue growth going ahead.Nonetheless, we remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to the three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from competitive pricing, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues.Currently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

438,HPE,"Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) dipped slightly on Monday, just one day before the company is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report. HPE has lost steam since its strong run to all-time highs earlier this year, but as a key figure in the enterprise tech industry, its earnings announcement has the potential to move the market.Enterprise tech has become a closely-followed business thanks to the widespread adoption of new technologies, including data center networking and cloud computing. HPE will hope to stand out from a competitive pack which includes IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report).So what should we expect to see from HPE when it reports on Tuesday? Let’s take a closer look.Latest OutlookAccording to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, analysts are expecting HPE to report adjusted earnings of $0.31 per share and total revenue of $7.33 billion. This would mark EPS growth of 24.0%, while year-over-year sales comparisons will be impacted by the firm’s divesture of its services and software units.It is also worth noting that HPE’s consensus earnings projection has moved five cents higher over the duration of the quarter, indicating an improved outlook from a few months ago.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that HPE surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.HPE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.0%. This means that the most recent estimates have been in line with the consensus. In other words, our model is not conclusively calling for a beat.Most Recent Valuation HPE is trading at about 12.1x forward 12-month earnings. This is a discount to the broader tech sector’s average of 18.8x, but within the range investors have come to expect over the past year. Still, HPE does look like a decent value option ahead of its report.Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of HPE’s report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices. The tech firm has actually missed EPS estimates in two out of the trailing four quarters, and those misses put a significant dent in the stock.We like to judge the price effect of earnings announcements by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. During the two aforementioned misses, HPE moved about 7% lower in these windows. However, the stock climbed nearly 12% during this window when the company beat EPS estimates last quarter.Bottom LineHPE is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), and although it looks like attractive for value investors ahead of its report, the stock behaves erratically during earnings season and might not be worth the risk. However, HPE was red hot to start the year and could very well surge back to new highs on the back of great results.Want more market analysis from this author?

439,HPE,"Dividends have been the consistent source of income for investors seeking regular returns during both bull and bear markets. According to a study, dividends accounted for an average 52% of the total returns over the past seven decades.This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these worlds — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Q2 Dividends Payout Hits Record Overall, the S&P 500 companies declared a record $124 billion in dividend payouts during the second quarter, up 11% from $112 billion in the year-ago quarter. About 89 firms hiked their payouts versus 67 firms a year ago, while 332 have maintained their dividends versus 347 in the same period last year. Notably, 43 companies have retained the ‘aristocrat’ status of 25 years of consecutive dividend raises. This is primarily thanks to a strong economy, solid earnings, historic tax cuts and results from the second round of Federal Reserve stress tests.Among the special attractions were Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report), which declared a dividend for the first time with a payout of 35 cents, and Dr Pepper Snapple , which announced a special dividend of $103.75 due to merger activity. Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) were among the firms that hiked dividend payouts (read: 4 Dividend Growth ETFs to Watch as Global Dividends Top).The trend is expected to continue in the coming months as most large companies have huge cash piles on their balance sheet and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. Additionally, the new tax law encourages the companies to bring their overseas cash back home at much more reduced rates and distribute parts of it to their shareholders. Per Bloomberg, an additional 75 companies will boost dividend payouts this quarter.Investors should also note that a company which consistently increases its dividend has stronger fundamentals, suggesting rising cash flows, good liquidity and a strong balance sheet.How to PlayGiven this, investors could tap growing dividends in the form of ETFs. Below, we have highlighted five popular dividend ETFs that offer excellent dividend growth potential, any of which could be a solid pick for investor in the long term: Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)This is the largest and most popular ETF in the dividend space with AUM of $27.8 billion and average daily volume of about 797,000 shares. The fund follows the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index, which is composed of high quality stocks that have a record of raising dividend every year. It holds 182 securities in the basket, with none accounting for more than 4.3% share. The fund charges 8 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (read: Tariff Threats Become Reality, Add 6 ETFs to Your Arsenal).iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the high dividend-paying U.S. equities with a 5-year history of dividend growth. It follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index and holds 99 securities in its basket with each accounting for less than 2.4% of assets. The ETF has AUM of $17.1 billion and average daily volume of more than 716,000 shares. It charges 39 bps in fees per year from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY  -  Free Report) With AUM of $15.6 billion and average daily volume of 548,000 shares, this fund provides a well-diversified exposure to 112 U.S. stocks that have been consistently increasing their dividends every year for at least 20 years.

440,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), yesterday, reported encouraging third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line not only came ahead of its estimates but also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Furthermore, the company recorded impressive year-over-year growth in revenues, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s non-GAAP earnings of 31 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents and also came ahead of management’s guidance range of 24-28 cents. However, the figure plunged 22.5% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 15 cents from continuing operations, as against $1.43 reported in the year-ago quarter. However, it compared favorably with the guided range of a loss of 2 cents to earnings of 2 cents.Per the company, the better-than-expected bottom-line performance was mainly “due to cost savings, software performance and favorable other income and expense.”Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company closed the spin-merger of its Enterprise Services business. Therefore, Hewlett Packard considers Enterprise Services as a discontinued operation since the fiscal second quarter, and the year-ago quarter’s results have also been adjusted accordingly.In addition, the company completed the pending spin-merger of its Software business in the fiscal third quarter. However, in this quarter, results include the full business of this division.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteQuarter in DetailRevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues from continuing operations (which includes Enterprise Group, HPE Financial Services and Software businesses) of $8.209 billion, up 2.5% from the year-earlier quarter’s revenues of $8.005 billion. Quarterly revenues comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.566 billion.The year-over-year growth was mainly driven by “better execution and a compelling portfolio”, which was partially offset by heightened commodities pricing pressure and unfavorable exchange rates. Adjusted for currency exchange rates and divestures, the company’s revenues from continuing operations were up 6% year over year.During the fiscal third quarter, the company witnessed uneven global demand across all regions. In the United States, sales, excluding Tier 1 servers, grew on the back of elevated sales of core servers and strong growth in networking business. However, the storage business witnessed a soft performance. Europe made a turnaround this quarter, registering year-over-year growth, mainly attributed to strong performance in “Germany and broad stabilization across Western Europe.” Additionally, the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region recorded growth, with stellar performance in Japan, China and India.Segment wise, revenues at the Enterprise Group were up 3% from the year-ago quarter to $6.8 billion. Adjusting for divestures and currency, segment revenues came in at 3%. While revenues from Servers were down 1%, Storage, Networking and Technology Services were up 11%, 16% and 1%, respectively.Software revenues declined 3% to $718 million. Adjusted for divestures and currency, the segment’s revenues were down 2%, when compared with the prior-year quarter. Revenues from Support and Professional Services dropped 2% and 23%, respectively. License and SaaS revenues, however, grew 2% and 7% year over year, respectively.Financial Services revenues were up 10% to $897 million. The segment’s net portfolio grew 2%, but financing volume dipped 8% year over year.Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise’s gross margin contracted 340 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 33%. This year-over-year contraction was mainly due to competitive pricing, elevated DRAM pricing, unfavorable currency, as well as stranded costs and short-term dilution from the recent acquisitions.Moreover, the company’s non-GAAP operating margin descended 150 bps to 8.4%, primarily due to a lower gross margin, which was partially offset by a decline in non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended the fiscal third quarter with $7.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, down from $8.1 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt at the quarter end was $14.527 billion compared with $11.904 billion recorded in the last quarter.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise generated $891 million of cash flow from operational activities. Free cash flow was $428 million. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, the company generated $63 million of cash flow for operational activities.Additionally, during the reported quarter, the company returned $732 million to its shareholders, of which $625 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise returned $2.259 billion to its shareholders, of which $1.936 billion was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.GuidanceThe company issued a disappointing bottom-line guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 26-30 cents (mid-point: 28 cents), which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company guides the bottom line to be in a range of breakeven to earnings of 4 cents.As the company completed its spin-merger of the Software business in the recently reported quarter, it adjusted the outlook for fiscal 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise now expects non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2017 in the range of $1.36-$1.40 (mid-point $1.38), down from $1.46-$1.56 (mid-point $1.51). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.46. On a GAAP basis, the company now projects the bottom line to be in the range of a loss of 7-11 cents. Earlier, the company’s guidance was in the range of a loss of 3 cents to earnings of 7 cents.However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise estimates free cash flow to be negative $1.8 billion in fiscal 2017.Our TakeAfter two back-to-back quarters of dismal performance, Hewlett Packard Enterprises reported encouraging fiscal third-quarter results, which indicates that the company’s contrarian strategy is in the right direction.The stock’s after-hour trade performance reflects that the better-than-expected quarterly results have reinstated investor’s optimism. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise gained approximately 5% during yesterdays’ after-hour trading session.Notably, although the entire industry, to which Hewlett Packard Enterprise belongs to, has been underperforming, the stock is among the worst performers. During the year-to-date period, the stock has lost 39.3% of its value, as compared with the industry’s loss of 19%.During the conference call, the company’s chief executive — Meg Whitman — hinted that it will continue to look for “opportunity to create an internal structure and operating model that is simpler, nimbler and faster.” This indicates that we may see Hewlett Packard Enterprise becoming even smaller with spin offs, or acquiring assets to enhance its capabilities in the hybrid IT model.Nonetheless, we remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to the three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from unfavorable currency exchange movements, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.Also, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain other concerns. Competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) adds to its woes.Currently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Iteris, Inc. (ITI  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

441,HPE,"The much awaited pending acquisition of Samsung Electronics’ printer business by HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), for $1.1 billion, crossed another milestone after China's Ministry of Commerce gave its approval for the transaction, per media sources. However, the deal comes with certain conditions which are meant to restrict the company from monopolizing the domestic laser printer market.Per Reuters, the Ministry of Commerce restricts HP from buying even a minority stake in any other A4 printer manufacturers in the country. The regulatory body also forbids the company to “not adapt its printers to restrict compatibility with third-parties or claim in advertising that its printers are not compatible with other suppliers.” Additionally, HP has to report its pricing and other related data to the ministry every six months, reported the news agency last Thursday.Notably, since the news surfaced, shares of HP have gained approximately 1.6%. The stock has had a remarkable run so far this year. In the year-to-date period, HP has surged 38.6%, outperforming 33.3% growth recorded by its industry.It should be noted that HP made this acquisition deal in September 2016, in an effort to turn around its printer business. With the Chinese government giving its nod, the company anticipates to close the deal in the fourth quarter of this calendar year.The acquisition is a strategic move by HP, as it will expand the company’s printing business as Samsung's printer business has more than 6,500 printing patents. Along with this, the deal will bring in additional 1,300 researchers and engineers, which will support development and manufacturing of HP printers, going forward.HP is one of the two publicly-traded entities formed after the November 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard Company. Besides HP, the split led to the formation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report). HP primarily focuses on PCs, and printing products and services.Notably, over the past several years, the company’s printing business has been facing challenges like sluggish demand and cut-throat competition in the space, which have eroded its revenues and market share.It should be noted that demand for printers is not as strong as it was 10 years ago. It has witnessed a secular decline over the past several years, as consumers are increasingly favoring digital alternatives over printed materials due to the former’s cost effectiveness.Furthermore, over the past few quarters, HP has been losing market share to its Japanese rivals — Canon and Epson — due to intense price competition. These Japanese manufacturers have been able to slash prices due to a weak yen compared to the U.S. dollar.Thus, we believe the acquisition of Samsung’s printing operations could help HP turn around the printer business. The transaction will not only eliminate a major competitor but also help control prices. Apart from this, the acquisition will also give HP access to Samsung’s partners and strengthen the former’s position across various geographies.Currently, HP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The long-term expected EPS growth rates for NVIDIA and Micron are 10.3% and 10%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

443,HPE,"HP Inc.’s (HPQ  -  Free Report) latest quarterly results reflect solid execution in its printing business.The company’s printing business’ quarterly revenues have witnessed back-to-back year-over-year growth. During third-quarter fiscal 2017, Printing revenues were up 6% year over year to $4.698 billion, primarily due to a 10% increase in supplies revenues.Moreover, the company recorded increase in unit shipments in all the three quarters of fiscal 2017. During the first, second and third quarters, HP registered year-over-year growth of 6%, 3.6% and 1.3%, respectively, in unit shipments.Additionally, per reports of the independent research firm, International Data Corporation (“IDC”), HP has been witnessing market-share improvement in Hardcopy Peripherals for the last three consecutive quarters. This indicates that the company’s strategies are in the right direction.Challenges in HP’s Printing BusinessHP is one of the two publicly-traded entities formed after the November 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard Company. Besides HP Inc., the split led to the formation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report). HP primarily focuses on PCs and printing products and services.Notably, over the past several years, the company’s printing business has been facing challenges like sluggish demand and cut-throat competition in the space which have eroded its revenues and market share.It should be noted that demand for printers is not as strong as it was 10 years ago. It has witnessed a secular decline over the past several years, as consumers are increasingly favoring digital alternatives over printed materials due to their cost effectiveness.Furthermore, over the past few quarters, HP has been losing market share to its Japanese rivals — Canon and Epson — due to intense price competition. These Japanese manufacturers have been able to slash prices due to a weak yen compared to the U.S. dollar.HP’s Counter StrategiesIn an effort to revamp its printer business, HP is looking at every aspect of growth, including product innovation and differentiation, acquisition, and expansion of 3D printing capabilities.Innovation is the KeyIt should be noted that if demand for anything does not remain as strong as it did once, one should resort to creative ideas in order to make innovative and differentiated products for gaining greater market share from rivals.It seems that HP has learned this lesson and is focusing on developing innovative and differentiated products. Last year, the company rolled out a smart pocket-sized printer for smartphones and tablets called Sprocket.Furthermore, the company, last year, unveiled its A3 multifunction printers (MFPs), which are now being shipped to more than 80 countries covering all key markets. These printers are designed to hamper the traditional $55-billion A3 copier category. The all-new A3 MFPs — with latest printing technology — enhance overall customer and partner experience with advanced security features. The printers also provide brighter colors, shorter production cycles and higher production throughput.Trying Inorganic Growth TacticApart from focusing on developing differentiated products, HP is also looking at acquisitions to drive growth. Most recently, the company completed the acquisition of Samsung Electronics’ printer business.Apart from bringing in additional revenues, the acquisition will help HP in expanding its printing business, as Samsung's printer business has more than 6,500 printing patents. All these will support development and manufacturing of HP printers, going forward.Besides eliminating a major competitor, the above discussed deal will also facilitate price control. Also, it will give HP access to Samsung’s partners and strengthen the former’s position across various geographies.Enhancing 3D Printing CapabilitiesThe company is also trying to enhance its 3D printing business capabilities, in an effort to revive tumbling sales. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, the company is way behind 3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report).Thus, in order to fortify its presence in this space, last year, HP unveiled its Jet Fusion 3D Printing Solution with two models to choose from — 4200 and 3200. Unlike 3D Systems and Stratasys, which target all kinds of consumers, HP emphasizes only on industrial markets due to the ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions.To satisfy customers in this space, HP has collaborated with various companies like Siemens, BMW, Nike Inc. and Autodesk Inc., with an aim to develop more advanced 3D printing technologies for a wide array of industrial use.Bottom LineHP’s efforts to revive its printing business have been commendable. Looking at satisfactory results from HP’s strategies, we feel the company can turnaround the printing business, and have a bigger share in the inkjet as well as 3D printer market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

444,HPE,"Mellanox Technologies Inc. (MLNX  -  Free Report) is riding high on expanding customer base and portfolio strength driven by strategic partnerships.To date in 2017, the company’s products have been selected by cloud computing and semiconductor bigwigs like Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), Alibaba Group (BABA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD  -  Free Report).Moreover, collaborations with the likes of VMware and HPE has significantly expanded Mellanox’s product portfolio.Interconnect Solutions Gain Rapid AdoptionMarket research firm IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes), which is ten times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. This exponential growth bodes well for Mellanox’s interconnect solutions owing to growing demand for higher network speeds for fast processing of data.InfiniBand is highly scalable and its off-loading capabilities that reduce load on CPUs are attracting artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning providers. Moreover, increasing adoption of cloud computing is driving demand for Ethernet, which is considered better than Fibre Channel, primarily due to its high speed (100 G versus 16/32 G) and low cost.Recently, Mellanox’s Spectrum Ethernet Switch was selected by Hewlett Packard to power its StoreFabric M-series storage networking switches. Spectrum is the part of Ethernet Storage Fabric (ESF) solution, which per Mellanox, is the fastest and most efficient Ethernet storage network available for the enterprise and cloud.Mellanox’s products are gaining rapid adoption, which is evident from Alibaba’s deployment of 25GbE and 100GbE ConnectX-4 EN family of Ethernet adapters in its data centers.Moreover, Mellanox’s Ethernet and InfiniBand interconnect solutions are powering AMD’s EPYC processors, which were launched in June, this year. Intel’s Xeon Scalable processor-based compute and storage platforms are also using the company’s InfiniBand solution.Collaborations Drive Customer BaseApart from strong demand for Mellanox’s interconnect solutions, collaborations with the likes of VMware and Hewlett Packard have helped the company gain strong footprint in the cloud and data-center market.Mellanox has partnered with VMware to combine iSER (iSCSI Extensions for Remote Direct Memory Access) networking solutions with vSphere. The company’s iSER uses an Ethernet Storage Fabric as a unified connectivity solution for compute and storage. This provides improved performance at lower costs.Mellanox has also partnered with Hewlett Packard, under which the former’s ConnectX-5 InfiniBand adapters and Switch-IB2 InfiniBand switches were used in latter’s HPE SGI 8600 and HPE Apollo 6000 Gen10 systems.We note that NASA Ames Research Center has selected Mellanox’s EDR InfiniBand solutions along with HPE SGI 8600 liquid cooled platform to expand its “Electra” supercomputing cluster.Mellanox’s collaboration with Microsemi Corporation is also expected to solidify the company’s footprint in the high performance computing market going forward.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

445,HPE,"On Sep 26, we issued an updated research report on internet-based social expression and personal publishing service provider, Shutterfly, Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report).Efforts to Improve Operational EfficiencyShutterfly has undertaken various structural changesas announced in fourth-quarter 2016. In fact, the company plans to retire many of its other brandsin order to focus more on profitable and cost-effective brands. Also, the existing customers will be migrated to one common website and all other websites will be shut down as has already been done for its Tiny Prints brand.Thus, Shutterfly plans to invest in a single Consumer platform with all customers gaining from investment in the Shutterfly.com site in the near term. This, in turn, is likely to reduce complexities of usage to a large extent, consequently increasing customer satisfaction.Additionally, one of the largest structural changes made by the company is to reduce workforce by approximately 13% or 260 employees. This is expected to result in an annualized cost decrease of roughly $25 million.Meanwhile, Shutterfly signed a follow-on deal with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in the last quarterto upgrade its printer fleet. Markedly, the underlying lease in the deal is expected to result in expense savings of $15 million over the next five years. Going forward, these higher quality and more efficient printers are anticipated to help improve Shutterfly’scost structure while using automation to reduce its reliance on seasonal labor.Furthermore, the company intends to improve operational efficiency and open new manufacturing facilities or consolidate the existing ones for future expansion.Added Growth InitiativesShutterfly is well focused on product innovation as a core part of its strategy to drive sales growth. It plans to re-invest in Tiny Prints as its premium cards & stationery brand and create a Tiny Prints boutique on a dedicated tab on Shutterfly.com. Additionally, the company intends to focus on the new Shutterfly Wedding Store as a part of its wedding strategy in the long run.Last year, Shutterflyadded more products to its newly launched statement gifts category, besides enhancing home décor category as well as cards and stationery category.In fact, the company is making progress with its Shutterfly 3.0 initiative, which encompasses a new integrated photo management solution also called the All New Shutterfly. This photo management service is anticipated to deepen the company’s relationships with its customers and drive sales over time.Furthermore, the company’s focus on improving technology-related offerings seems to bode well. Evidently, Shutterflyhas been continuously enhancing its mobile experience and optimized navigation, and also working on the look and functionality of its websites.Meanwhile, the company’s improved mobile app continues to drive a record number of customers, thus expanding its mobile footprint.In the second-quarter 2017, the company saw one million downloads of its app on the back of successful marketing efforts. Moreover, mobile sales that include both mobile web and mobile app, accounted for 25% of the Shutterfly brand revenues in the quarter, which was an increase of more than 600 basis points year over year.Overall, mobile continues to grow at a significantly faster rate than the company’s desktop business, and is expected to become an important growth driver in the near term.Potential HeadwindsShutterfly generally incurs loss in the first three quarters and makes profit in the final quarter of every year because of the seasonal nature of its business. Also, it is affected by vacation and other travel trends as these drive digital camera sales. Therefore, weaknesses in the travel industry owing to macro-economic slowdown or political instability can hurt the company’s business.Additionally, competition from other companies selling greeting cards or stationery at highly competitive prices on eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), is a threat to Shutterfly’s topline.Notably, the company has been incurring higher costs pertaining to the accelerated development of new production facilities along with a rise in the manufacturing, labor and training costs. In fact, with the announcement of the major restructuring goals, the company expects to incur restructuring charges ranging from $15 million to $17.5 million in 2017. These costs could weigh on the company’s margins.Shutterfly’s revenue growth has also been slow over the past couple of years. This is because the company had spread its resources thin across many businesses, brands and platforms, making it impossible to dedicate the right level of resource to each one.Although the company has undertaken huge structural changes to this end, 2017 is expected to be a transition year for them, with different brands transitioning at different times over the course of the first three quarters. Thus, the company projects net revenues in 2017 to grow a meager 1% over last year.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

446,HPE,"According to Bloomberg report, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) is planning to slash 5,000 jobs in a desperate bid to contain costs and take restructuring efforts to the next level. This is almost 10% of the total staff employed by the company.These retrenchment actions are being taken by management to save costs, as HPE faces intense competitionfrom cloud providers such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report).CEO Meg Whitman has been reorganizing operations to boost profits and this layoff is a part of that strategy adopted by her earlier this month to reach $1.5 billion in savings. Reportedly, the layoffs will “target workers in the U.S. and around the world. Managers are also said to be included in these layoffs.“Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company closed the spin-merger of its Enterprise Services business, which merged with Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC  -  Free Report).).Additionally, the company completed the pending spin-merger of its Software business in August this year.Price performanceShares of HPE gained more than 3% during yesterdays’ trading session.Notably, although the entire industry, to which Hewlett Packard Enterprise belongs to, has been underperforming, the stock is among the worst performers. During the year-to-date period, the stock has declined 38.4% of its value, wider than the industry’s loss of 17.8%.Bottom LineWe believe HPE management’s decision of executive lay-off is a bold one, going a step ahead of what it has done earlier. Such a notable job cut will clearly save money for the company, which, consequently, can be reinvested to further boost growth of its cloud-based and cybersecurity business.However, we remain doubtful about the extent to which this decision will be an optimally cost-efficient one, at least in the near term, as it will take some time to effectively take up the burden of work from the existing ones.Currently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks With Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

447,HPE,"Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO  -  Free Report) recently completed the earlier announced acquisition of Sunnyvale-based start-up, Springpath, for $320 million in cash. The company is speculated to show interest in NetApp Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report).Springpath Strengthens Competitive PositionSpringpath is well known for its distributed file system for hyperconvergence that enables server-based storage systems. The companies collaborated in early 2016 to launch HyperFlex, the industry’s first fully-integrated hyperconverged infrastructure system (“HCI”).HyperFlex combined Cisco’s Unified Computing System (""UCS"") blade servers with Springpath’s software at core. According to research firm IDC, the HCI market is anticipated to be a $6-billion opportunity by 2020.We believe that the acquisition will boost Cisco’s competitive position in the HCI market particularly against Nutanix (NTNX  -  Free Report). The company believes HyperFlex to be a better system as compared with Nutanix and others to address the challenges related to networking and performance of the HCI systems.Cisco Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Cisco Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteThe product gained strong traction with Cisco attracting almost 1800 customers last year.NetApp: Next Target?Cisco is now speculated to show interest in Sunnyvale, CA-based NetApp, per Barron, which quoted Summit Redstone analyst, Srini Nandury.According to channel checks, the analyst noted that Cisco is likely to acquire NetApp (market capital of $11.04 billion) instead of flash-storage provider Pure Storage. Per the analyst, the deal will boost Cisco’s competitive position in the data center market against the likes of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report).We note that in accordance to its software-centric approach, Cisco has completed a plethora of acquisitions in the software space over the last couple of years. The list included bigwigs like Internet of Things (IoT) cloud service provider Jasper Technologies (for $1.4 billion in 2016) and app performance management software provider AppDynamics (for $3.7 billion in 2017).However, the company has been a laggard in the storage space prior to Springpath. Cisco’s last notable storage acquisition was solid-state memory systems provider WHIPTAIL, way back in 2013. But the acquisition failed to deliver and the company closed down Invicta Storage business (that it got from WHIPTAIL) in 2015.NetApp: A Long time PartnerCisco has been dependent on partners like NetApp and Dell-EMC for storage needs in the data center market. Its relationship with NetApp dates back to 2003. The company is currently a Cisco Original Storage Manufacturer (“OSM”).In June, Cisco-NetApp expanded product offerings by launching FlexPod SF solution, which includes NetApp SolidFire all-flash, scale-out, cloud-connected storage, Cisco UCS B-Series servers and Cisco Nexus switching.ConclusionNetApp can be an ideal acquisition candidate for Cisco due to their long running relationship. The company will be easy to integrate into Cisco’s existing business line-up and also accretive immediately as noted by the Summit Redstone analyst, Srini Nandury.However, apart from NetApp there are few other storage companies that can interest Cisco. We believe that Reduxio Systems, Nimbus Data, Qumulo are the noticeable ones.Reduxio secured $22.5 million of funding in an investment round in March, this year. Per Reuters, C5 Capital was the lead investor. Jerusalem Venture Partners, Carmel Ventures, Intel Capital and Seagate Technology also participated in this round.Per TechCrunch, Seattle-based Qumulo raised $40-million Series B investment in 2015.Currently, Cisco has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

448,HPE,"With a nuclear missile game of chicken and a Category 5 hurricane barreling toward the East Coast, we begin this Labor Day-shortened trading week with myriad tensions on a global scale. We also see a return of Congress after summer recess with a debt-ceiling issue to somehow get beyond, as well as a proposed cancellation of another one of President Obama’s signature accomplishments — the “Dreamers” program, or DACA.It would appear the escalation of ICBM threats of nuclear annihilation are pretty well tuned out by the market, pending further developments. For now, we see lots of sabre-rattling but not a lot of action; of course, when what’s at stake is tens of millions of lives on the Pacific Rim and in America, actually taking action brings with it a dread that no market would be able to ignore. Right now, indexes are down somewhat but nothing “earth shattering.”Hurricane Irma’s 175 mph winds is now being called “extremely dangerous” as it enters the West Indies this week. Schools are closing, flights are being canceled and concerns of long-term power outages are following reports of approaching 20-plus-foot waves and double-digit inches of rainfall hitting islands in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. From there, it’s a waiting game to see if Irma socks the Southeast coast of the continental U.S. — and if so, where? Currently Florida, Georgia and both North and South Carolina look to be the most likely to take a direct hit.Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) CEO Tim Cook joins roughly 300 leaders in a variety of domestic industries in penning an open letter to President Trump regarding the DACA program, which would keep some 800K people from being deported from the U.S. Reports are that Trump has already made his decision on this issue, and an announcement is expected to be forthcoming from Attorney General Jeff Sessions sometime today. DACA, or the “Dreamers” program, is a works program for children of undocumented citizens. Business leaders say ending the program would cost the U.S. economy more than $460 billion and close to $25 billion in Medicare and Social Security contributions.Any Potential Good News?Sure! Fed Governor Lael Brainard has called for a slowing of interest rate increases by the Fed, both in its September meeting and beyond, until inflation metrics finally reach the optimum 2% economists have been looking for. We’re still not there yet any way you slice the data, so Brainard urges caution in tightening monetary policy until new developments push inflation upward. This should help equities traders feel the slack a bit, near term, without feeling the heat of ratcheting interest rates. Currently the odds for a September hike are already almost non-existent, though they do get much bigger for the December meeting.Also, Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE  -  Free Report) reports earnings results after the bell today, in an earnings season which is for most intents and purposes over with. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a good Zacks Style Score (Value-Growth-Momentum) of B. The Zacks consensus is looking for 26 cents per share on $7.57 billion for its fiscal Q3 2017, and the company is looking to bounce back from a negative earnings surprise last quarter. HPE split from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) back in early November 2015.
"
449,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 22. The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 47.8% in the last reported quarter. Notably, Hewlett Packard has a decent surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice, while missing the same in one occasion. It has an average negative earnings surprise of 11.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hewlett Packard is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Hewlett Packard currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings remained unchanged, over the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects earnings per share to increase 6% to 31 cents from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 25 cents. However, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues to be down 26% year over year to $7.33 billion.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteFactors to ConsiderThe year-over-year decline in revenues is expected mainly because Hewlett Packard is now focusing on the enterprise market and moving away from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which, we believe, will continue to hurt its revenues in short term.Furthermore, the acquisition of EMC Corporation (stylized as EMC) by Dell has been posing new challenges for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. With this acquisition, Dell has become one of the major players in the cloud services and data-storage market. EMC offers data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing, and other products and services that enable businesses to store, manage, protect, and analyze data.Additionally, VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) was EMC’s subsidiary that focuses on cloud and virtualization software and services for its parent company. Therefore, the acquisition of EMC, along with its privately-controlled structure, is providing Dell an unmatched scale, strength and flexibility to deepen the company’s relationships with customers of all sizes.This apart, it also seems that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is losing market share to Dell in the server shipment. Notably, according to IDC, during fourth-quarter 2017, Dell managed to drastically narrow down the server shipment market-share difference with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, as the company “continues to capitalize on expanded opportunities from its merger with EMC.”Nonetheless, the company’s bottom-line results are likely to benefit from the spin-off of its low-margin businesses like Software and Enterprise Services. In addition, massive share buybacks over the past year are expected to have boosted Hewlett Packard’s fiscal second-quarter earnings per share.Notably, during fiscal 2017, Hewlett Packard returned $3 billion to its shareholders, of which $2.56 billion was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments. Continuing the same, the company, during the last reported quarter, returned $862 million to shareholders, of which $742 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are couple of stocks, which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.00% and sports a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Intuit Inc.

450,HPE,"The sudden return of volatility to global stock markets has created buying opportunities in large-cap tech stocks as the sector’s investors look to rebound from recent selloffs. The world’s tech leaders have dominated Wall Street over the past two years, and now, investors might have a fresh chance to buy a few previously red-hot stocks at a discount.Of course, this recent volatility has made some investors hesitant, with bearish traders quick to draw similarities between this latest tech rally and the infamous dot-com bubble of the late 90s and early 2000s.However, unlike the dot-com bubble, there is real earnings and revenue growth fueling this tech rally. In fact, the average P/E ratio of our “Computer and Technology” sector currently sits at 21.3, which compares favorably to the dot-com era’s average that routinely soared into the 200s.Another interesting trend in today’s tech rally is that, rather than obsessing over the next big thing, investors seem to rewarding tried-and-true brands for their respectable growth. This means that some of the strongest tech stocks are the household names that consumers already know and love.With that said, check out these three blue chip tech stocks to buy now:1. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report)Amazon does not need much of an introduction, but investors should always remember that the company has its hands in much more than just the e-commerce business that brought it fame. The Seattle-based firm is now a legitimate brick-and-mortar retailer, cloud computing provider, entertainment media publisher, and more. AMZN is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Amazon’s track record speaks for itself, as shares have gained nearly 70% in the trailing one-year period. The stock has shrugged off market-wide volatility and continues to test new highs. Earnings are expected to improve by a staggering 180% this year, with sales surging nearly 34%. AMZN is a staple stock that should appease investors looking for near-term strength and long-term, buy-and-hold gains. 2. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report)Thanks to its strategic investments in datacenters and artificial intelligence, Nvidia has emerged as one of Wall Street’s most popular stocks. Of course, the company’s industry-leading GPUs remain its backbone and are the number one choice for PC gamers worldwide. Nvidia shares have gained over 57% within the past year, and since the stock is still sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it is showing few signs of stopping.Nvidia is still in an aggressive growth cycle, with current estimates calling for the firm to see EPS and revenue growth of 61% and 36%, respectively, this fiscal year. And of course, Nvidia has made a habit out of crushing expectations. Management is also improving its finances, generating cash flow growth of nearly 67%. Valuations are stretched, but investors should be willing to pay a premium for a company with Nvidia’s proven success and continued potential. 3. Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report)Facebook found itself at a bit of an impasse earlier this year as its handling of user data garnered significant public and regulatory scrutiny. But the company never felt much in terms of actual regulatory action, and so far, its revenue growth has significantly outpaced new costs associated with upping security and vetting content.FB is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and looks like one of the internet industry’s top picks once again. Earnings and revenue are expected to improve by 24% and 41%, respectively, in 2018. Meanwhile, the stock has a PEG of just 1.1, so investors are getting a good price for that earnings growth. Plus, at 25.6x forward earnings, FB is the cheapest it has been in quite some time. Want more market analysis from this author?

Shares have lost about 8.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HPE due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent Earnings Hewlett Packard Surpasses Earnings Estimates in Q2Hewlett Packard reported non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 34 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents and exceeded the guided range of 29-33 cents.

Further, quarterly revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.326 billion.Adjusted for currency-exchange rates, the company’s revenues from continuing operations increased 6% year over year.The company witnessed particular tailwinds in Intelligent Edge, High-Performance Compute, Storage, Hyper Converged and Composable Infrastructure.During the reported quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s revenues in the Americas grew 3% in constant currency, primarily due to strength in storage and the Intelligent Edge. Revenues in Europe were up 9% in constant currency, with UK, France and Italy registering double-digit growth. EMEA performed pretty well with double-digit growth in compute, storage and Aruba Products and Services. Asia Pacific revenues were up 9% at constant currency, with impressive growth in Singapore, Australia and China.Segment wise, Hybrid IT revenues increased 7% year over year and 4% at constant currency to $6.023 billion.

In addition, the company’s non-GAAP operating margin increased 270 bps to 8.6%.The improvement in margins was primarily attributed to cost savings from HPE Next. Management was also positive about pricing and DRAM was less of a negative aspect compared to the previous quarters.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended fiscal second quarter with $6.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $7.7 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt at quarter end was $9.970 billion compared with $10.040 billion recorded in the first quarter.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise generated $200 million of cash flow from operational activities. However, free cash flow was negative $269 million. Additionally, during the reported quarter, the company returned $1 billion to shareholders, of which $907 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.GuidanceThe company issued an encouraging bottom-line guidance for the third quarter and raised its outlook for fiscal 2018.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, Hewlett Packard Enterprise projects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 35-39 cents (mid-point: 37 cents). On a GAAP basis, the company guides the bottom line to be in the range of 19-23 cents.Hewlett Packard Enterprise now expects non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.40-$1.50 (mid-point $1.45), up from the previous range of $1.35-$1.45 (mid-point $1.40). On a GAAP basis, the company now projects the bottom line to be in the band of $1.70-$1.80 per share, up from the prior range of $1.35-$1.45.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and Consensus  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and Consensus | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, HPE has a subpar Growth Score of D.

452,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Company (HPE  -  Free Report) recently announced its plans to invest $4 billion in its Intelligent Edge technology related to edge computing, which deals with providing storage and computing capabilities close to where data is generated.The idea of computing data right at the point of generation or at a closer point rather than a data center lowers the latency period and leads to real-time processing. Additionally, the cost related to transferring data to a data center is also not required.Notably, the growth of edge computing is also assisting the rise in use of IoT (Internet of Things) devices, pertaining to the computation of data closer to the source. This eases the deployment process and enhances security.The increased use of edge computing, which leads to faster processing of data, is expected to gain widespread adoption with an exponential in increase in data generation. Per a recent report by Research And Markets, the global edge computing market is expected to reach $20,495.24 million by 2026 from $7,983.61 million in 2017 at a CAGR of 11%.Hewlett Packard Enterprise can make the most of the growth opportunity if the cards are rightly placed.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Revenue (TTM) Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Revenue (TTM) | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteHPE’s Position in Edge ComputingHewlett Packard Enterprise with its Aruba unit has a prominent presence in the industry. The host of solutions provided include campus switching, security, location-based services, wireless LAN and analytics among others.Most recently, Aruba introduced a solution for the modernization of branch networks for the evolution of IoT, cloud and mobility usage. Per the press release, “Aruba’s SD-Branch solution integrates new Aruba Branch Gateways with Aruba’s enhanced Aruba Central cloud management platform to provide a single point for SD-WAN, wired and wireless networking and policy enforcement, and to deliver secure, simplified branch connectivity at scale.”We believe that Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s increasing efforts toward strengthening its position in the Intelligent Edge domain will aid the company in grabbing a share in the global edge computing market, which will eventually benefit its top line.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderHewlett Packard Company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked technology stocks include NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

453,HPE,"Shares of HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) have been gaining solid momentum, of late. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company’s stellar second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Also, encouraging third-quarter and full-fiscal outlook drove its shares higher.Notably, the company has gained approximately 10.6% since it reported fiscal second-quarter results on May 29. In fact, HP has an impressive earnings surprise history with beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in thrice in the trailing four quarters while matching the same on one occasion. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 4.2%. Backed by the impressive results, the company has issued an upbeat outlook for the third quarter as well as full fiscal.The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 index in the year-to-date period. HP has returned 12.1% in the said period, while the index has gained 3.5%.Let’s take a look at what factors are driving HP’s back-to-back robust quarterly performances.Restructuring Initiatives Paying OffIt should be noted that since its split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in November 2015, HP has been trying to stabilize shrinking sales and eroding profits through a series of restructuring initiatives.As part of its restructuring efforts, HP has adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to spur demand for its PC products in the market. The company has rolled out a number of models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave, over the past two years.Impact of these initiatives is evident from the fact that the company regained the pole position in the PC segment by displacing Lenovo. Also, according to the data compiled by IDC, the company’s PC shipments registered the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in Q1, after witnessing several quarters of decline.The company’s efforts to revamp the printing business have also been commendable. It should be noted that HP has acquired Samsung Electronics’ printer business. This acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it has expanded the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition to the above, the company is now focused on fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets due to their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.However, these efforts have paid off well, with the company registering the fifth consecutive quarter of print business revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter.On the cost front too, HP has taken strategic steps, which includes divestment of its content management software tools and Customer Communications Management (CCM) assets to Open Text Corporation, and elimination of 4,500-5,000 jobs.Per the company, the divestment of CCM has led to cost reduction and enhanced productivity, thereby boosting profitability. The job cuts are anticipated to generate annualized cost savings of approximately $200-$300 million from fiscal 2020 onward.Impressive ValuationsThe stock currently trades at a forward earnings estimate at 11.8x, which is way lower than the industry to which it belongs to average of 16.3x. Given its recent track record of revenues and earnings growth, as well as the long-term forecast, the stock is highly undervalued which signifies that it still has significant upside potential.Moreover, HP has a VGM Style Score of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive its price.Consequently, we believe the stock has huge potential to surge higher and therefore, investors should consider it for near-term opportunities.

454,HPE,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) recently exhibited its next generation CPU and GPU products at Computex, 2018. The company has ramped up its CPU & GPU portfolio, which strengthen its competitive position against the likes of NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).The newly announced 7nm AMD Radeon Vega GPU is tailor-made for servers and workstations. Moreover, the new high-end Radeon RX Vega 56 and 64 Nano graphics card is likely to provide the company an edge against NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1080 and 1070 cards, which were released last year.Meanwhile, NVIDIA keeps the gamers waiting for its hyped release of GeForce GTX 11 Series graphics cards.Additionally, Radeon based RX Vega56 graphics card was demonstrated on Samsung’s 80” QLED TV. AMD claims that the architecture is designed for tear free smooth game play. It can run either on an equipped PC or with Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One S or Xbox One X gaming console.AMD also showcased second generation Threadripper CPU powered by Ryzen technology. 12nm Zen+ architecture will support the Ryzen second generation based Threadripper 2. The chip is touted to be the highest-end chip featuring a whopping 32 cores and 64 threads, per PC Gamer. The product is scheduled to launch in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Notably, Intel recently unveiled the 28-core PC chip. Higher core count of Threadripper 2 is expected to boost the competitive position of AMD against Intel.The EPYC processor, codenamed ""Rome"" which runs on 7nm Zen+ architecture, was also demonstrated at Computex. The processor is under testing and the company aims to launch it in 2019. However, EPYC driven SA1 Tencent Cloud Service is available.Gaming PC & GPU Demand to Boost AMD’s GrowthPer IDC, PC shipments remained flat in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the anticipated decline of 1.5%. The traction witnessed by gaming PCs is likely to have averted the decline. Per a Jon Peddie Research (“JPR”) report, with an increase in the number of people engaging in PC gaming, the related hardware market is experiencing a huge boost. Per the research firm, the market exceeded $30 billion mark in 2016 and is anticipated to witness compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% through 2019.Notably, growth in the gaming hardware market is driving demand for graphics processors as well. Per Allied Market Research, the GPU market is anticipated to reach $157.1 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 35.6% from 2016 to 2022.We believe both AMD and NVIDIA are well poised to benefit from the strong demand of gaming PCs. However, AMD’s expanding GPU portfolio catering to every price points is well-poised to threat NVIDIA’s dominance going forward.Despite its late entry, AMD is attaining the position of a major player in GPU market. The company started small, targeting the low-end segment and gradually built a position for itself.JPR report reveals that AMD impressively increased its GPU shipments and gained market share from 14.2% to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2018. The gain can be primarily attributed to the robust adoption witnessed by the company’s expanding product portfolio for workstations and cryptocurrency mining.Furthermore, increasing adoption of AI techniques and machine learning tools in industries like gaming, automotive and blockchain are primarily responsible for driving GPU demand. AMD is benefiting from this demand.Although Intel’s market share dipped from 67.4% to 66.6%, the company continues to be a leader. Meanwhile, NVIDIA maintained its market share at 18.4%.We believe that the launch of the new graphics cards will help AMD increase its market share further, going forward. Shares of AMD have returned 52.4% year to date.Expanding Customer Base Bodes Well For AMDAMD’s products in recent times have been selected by the likes of Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). These contracts are helping AMD fast penetrate the server market.Cisco UCS server platform is leveraging AMD products to offer 20% more storage capacity per rack, 128% more cores and 50% more servers.Other DevelopmentsAMD and Hewlett Packard Enterprise unveiled new EPYC-based HPE ProLiant DL325 Gen10 server platform at the Computex event.Notably, 32 “Zen” processor cores along with 40 terabytes of NVMe and two terabytes of memory storage lower the cost per virtual machine (VM) by 27%.Zacks RankAMD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

456,HPE,"Recovery in the server market, which began last year, has continued into 2018 as well, re-infusing optimism among server vendors. Per International Data Corporation (“IDC”), worldwide server revenues and shipment marked the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, after five straight disappointing quarters of decline.According to the data compiled by the research firm, worldwide server revenues jumped a whopping 38.6% year over year to $18.8 billion in first-quarter 2018, while overall shipment grew 20.7% to approximately 2.7 million units.IDC noticed growth in every segment, with revenues of volume servers rising 41.3% year over year to $15.9 billion, while the mid-range server registered growth of 31% to $1.7 billion. Also, high-end system revenues reached $1.2 billion, indicating a rise of 20.1%.Also, x86 servers retained the growth momentum during the quarter. IDC figured out a 41% year-over-year rise in x86 server revenues, reaching $17.4 billion, while revenues from non-x86 servers witnessed an increase of 15.5% to $1.4 billion.Demand From Various Segments, Increased ASP Drive GrowthThe research firm found that strong deployment by cloud-service providers, increased use of servers for software-defined infrastructure builds out and market-wide enterprise refresh cycle, drove the overall growth for the server market.This apart, availability of the latest CPUs such as Intel's (INTC  -  Free Report) Purley processors, and Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) EPYC processors also spurred demand for servers. It should be noted that hyperscale data-center service providers have waited a long time for these processors.Additionally, increased average selling prices (ASP), as a result of passing on some elevated component costs and richer configuration, bolstered server revenue growth.Sector Total Return %  Sector Total Return % |  QuoteDell Outpaces HPE in Market ShareWith respect to individual server manufacturers, on the revenue market-share front, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) jointly secured the first spot. However, if we look at the actual revenues, then Dell has outpaced HPE to hold the first position, with 19.1% market share. HPE ended the quarter with 18.6% market share. Notably, IDC calls it a statistical tie when the difference among vendors is 1% or less.Over the past four quarters, Dell has continuously registered year-over-year growth in server revenues and managed to drastically narrow down the market-share difference with HPE. In fact, it beat HPE in the last quarter. The reason behind this stellar market-share growth is that the company has been able to strategically capitalize on expanded opportunities from the EMC acquisition.Moreover, HPE is now focusing on the enterprise market and moving away from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which has been denting its short-term revenues. Nonetheless, its loss helped Dell grab market share in the hyperscale segment.The third position is a tie among Lenovo, International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report). If we look at the actual revenues, then Lenovo holds the third position with 5.8% market share, followed by IBM in the fourth spot, with 5.3% share, while Cisco comes fifth, with 5.2%.Furthermore, IDC provided revenues and shipment data for the ODM Direct group of vendors. These vendors continue to record huge year-over-year growth in revenues and market share, as large datacenters find it attractive to custom build their server designs at potential volume prices.In addition to the above, in terms of volume, Dell secured the top position, with a market share of 20.6%, while HPE holds the second spot with market share of 16%. Inspur, Lenovo and Super Micro occupied the third position, ending the quarter with market shares of 6.5%, 6% and 5.8%, respectively.Growth Across All RegionsRegion wise, IDC noted server revenue growth across every region. Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) witnessed the fastest growth, with a 51.7% increase. This was followed by Latin America, recording 41.1%, the United States 40.6%, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 35%, Canada 28.3% and Japan reporting 2.9% increase. China recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 67.4% in the quarter.Better Prospects AheadWe believe the global server market will continue to grow in the quarters ahead, mainly due to the further push of hyperscale server deployments by cloud-service providers. In our opinion, there is a huge growth opportunity in the hyperscale server-infrastructure space, with more and more companies shifting to cloud-based storage.Also, Gartner’s latest forecast for IT spending (a 6.2% increase in 2018) depicts a favorable tech spending environment, which, we believe, will positively influence the overall server market in the near term.Looking at the improving IT spending and server deployment push by data-center service providers across different geographies, we expect that the overall performance of vendors will continue improving over the next few quarters.Currently, HPE, IBM and Cisco all carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

457,HPE,"Wireless equipment player, Ubiquiti Networks, Inc.’s (UBNT  -  Free Report) shares have charted a steady upward trajectory in the recent times, having appreciated 8.3% in the past year. This is in stark contrast to its industry, which has declined 6.1% on an average, over the same time frame.Broadly speaking, Ubiquiti designs, manufactures and sells broadband wireless solutions globally. In fact, the company’s shares have actually appreciated manifold when compared with the industry average over the last five years.Let’s dig in to find the company’s economic moats and explore why it has been outperforming its peers consistently.Ubiquiti’s Community ForumTo begin with, the company stands out from its competitors as it has a unique business model and marketing strategy. Ubiquiti actually relies on community evangelism and word of mouth marketing, instead of using highly-paid sales persons. The company is committed toward reducing its operational costs by using this self-sustaining mechanism for rapid product support and dissemination of information by leveraging the strength of Ubiquiti Community.Consistent R&D OutlayUbiquiti also spends significantly toward research and development activities for developing innovative products and state-of-art technology. The company regularly launches innovative products at a fraction of the cost of the competing firms. Its unique business model helps regulate a highly efficient R&D culture.The company has impressive design capabilities, including hardware design and software design. The company’s strategic product launches at disruptive prices have helped it beat rivals to a great extent.Margin ExpansionUbiquiti has by far the best operating margins among its peers, with consistent net margin expansion over the last five years. It competes with players like Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), the Aruba arm of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.  and Huawei. Ubiquiti currently boasts a net profit margin of nearly 30%.Disciplined ManagementRobert Pera, Ubiquiti’s founder and CEO, has long since maintained that his focus is on the long-term success of the company, and not on quarter-to-quarter earnings, revenues, or cost variations. He owns about 71% of the company.Figures Don’t LieIn its last reported fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 results, Ubiquiti’s revenues steered past the higher end of its guidance and also grew 23.1% on a year-over-year basis. Its adjusted earnings also rose 8.7% year over year. Refreshingly for a technology company, there is hardly any difference between its GAAP and non-GAAP earnings, due to a conspicuous lack of stock-based compensation.Have a look at the company’s bottom line trend over the past five years compared to the industry average.The company also released optimistic guidance for fiscal 2018, with projected revenues of $1.0-$1.15 billion and earnings of $3.70-$4.30 per share. At the mid-point, this translates to earnings growth of about 30%. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $3.40 a share on sales of $946 million. This indicates that the company’s is positioned very well for the future.Summing UpWe believe that Ubiquiti’s strength basically comes down to disruptive price, performance and innovation. The company is simply selling its products for less because it has trumped its competitors with superior product design and also because it has been an extremely responsive company when it comes to adding features desired by competitors.Ubiquiti currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump Policies  If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

458,HPE,"The fortunes of server vendors have returned it seems, as worldwide server revenues and shipments grew year over year in second-quarter 2017, that too after five straight quarters of decline, per Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) and International Data Corporation (“IDC”).Although the numbers of both independent research firms are different, comments from these indicate that the server market may see further improvement in the quarters to come.According to preliminary data released by Gartner, worldwide server revenues increased 2.8% year over year to $13.938 billion in the second quarter, while overall shipment grew 2.4% to 2.824 million.An increase of 6.3% year over year in server revenues to $15.7 billion and 1.9% in shipments to 2.45 million units was also acknowledged by IDC. The figures vary due to different approaches in data compilation.The firms also agreed on the fact that x86 servers retained their growth momentum during the quarter. Per Gartner, x86 server revenues grew 6.9%, while shipment increased 2.5%. On the other hand, IDC figured out a 10.4% year-over-year rise in x86 server revenues.Hyperscalers Fuel Maximum GrowthAlthough the firms chose different data-compilation techniques, both highlighted almost similar reasons for the surge. The primary among these was strong demand from hyperscale data center service providers which made a huge push in server deployment. Per IDC, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) made the largest push in server deployment and accounted for more than 10% of the total server shipped during the second quarter.The second reason outlined by IDC was the availability of Intel's (INTC  -  Free Report) new Skylake processors. It should be noted that hyperscale data center service providers have waited for months for this processor, as a result of which both server market revenues and shipments witnessed a sharp decline in first-quarter 2017.Gartner also agrees with IDC’s view on strong demand from hyperscalers. Nevertheless, it underlined another reason for the strong recovery in the server market during the recently reported quarter. Gartner noted that data center infrastructure build-outs in the Asia-Pacific region, mostly in China, contributed hugely to overall growth.Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % Return Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % ReturnTop VendorsWith respect to individual server manufacturers, both firms share a similar view on the top two vendors. Gartner and IDC believe that on the revenue front, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) retained its leading position, followed by Dell.However, the research firms had different views when it came to the third, fourth and fifth positions. As per Gartner, International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Huawei were at the third, fourth and fifth spot, respectively.Per IDC, the third position was a tie between IBM and Cisco. This is because IDC calls it a statistical tie when the difference among vendors is 1% or less. Therefore, if we look at the actual market share, then IBM holds the third position, while Cisco has the fourth position. Lenovo secured the fifth place.Additionally, IDC provided revenues and shipment data for ODM Direct group of vendors. These vendors continue to witness huge year-over-year growth in revenues as well as market share “as large datacenters find it attractive to custom build their server designs at attractive volume prices,” per IDC.On the other hand, per Gartner, Huawei witnessed huge revenue growth and gain market share.In addition, according to Gartner, in terms of the number of units shipped, Dell continue to lead, with a market share of 17.5%, followed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, Inspur Electronics and Lenovo, which ended the quarter with market shares of 17.1%, 6.2%, 5.6% and 5.2%, respectively.Regional PerformanceRegion wise, the overall server market performance was mixed. According to IDC, revenues from Central and Eastern Europe, Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan), the United States and Western Europe grew year over year. Growth in the Asia-Pacific region was mostly contributed by China. However, Japan, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa registered a decline during the quarter.Bottom LineDespite differences, the comments by Gartner and IDC hint at bright near-term prospects for server vendors. According to Kuba Stolarski, research director, Computing Platforms at IDC, the hyperscale segment is likely to continue its growth in the quarters ahead.He believes that ""As hyperscalers tend to lead the market on most architectural updates, we expect the rest of the market to catch up over the next several quarters. As the market cycles through this refresh, we are seeing changes in vendor portfolios with new modular system designs and a greater focus on accelerator technologies, as well as the continued evolution of the role of cloud services in corporate IT.""In our opinion, there is a huge growth opportunity in the hyperscale server infrastructure space, with more and more companies shifting to cloud-based storage. Also, Gartner’s latest forecast for IT spending depicts a favorable tech spending environment, which, we believe will positively impact the overall server market in the near term.Looking at the improving IT spending and server deployment push by data center service providers across different geographies, we believe that the overall performance of vendors will likely improve over the next few quarters.Currently, IBM and Cisco carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Hewlett Packard Enterprise has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

459,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of senior notes offering worth $1.1 billion. Notes, carrying an interest rate equal to 2.1% per year, are set to mature in 2019. The offering is anticipated to close on Sep 20.However, the company announced that the offering is not “registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws” and therefore, are “being offered only to “qualified institutional buyers” under Rule 144A of the Securities Act or, outside the United States, to persons other than “U.S. persons” in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.”Hewlett Packard intends to use the entire proceed from the aforementioned offerings for repayment of its two existing outstanding notes. While one is $750 million worth of senior notes carrying a coupon rate of 2.45%, the other is $350 million worth of floating rate notes, both being due in 2017.Borrowing costs continue to be low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. With the U.S. treasuries offering low rates, corporate bonds and borrowings from banks are now witnessing high demand. We believe these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth.With the recent move, the company will be able to bring down its interest expenses as the new senior notes carry a lower coupon rate than the ones which are being repaid. It should be noted that the company’s interest expenses have been escalating due to mounting debt burden which will dampen its profitability.During the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Hewlett Packard paid $260 million as interest expenses, which is 33.3% higher than what it had paid during the same period in fiscal 2015. Also, the company’s long-term debt (excluding current portion) increased to $14.5 billion at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2017 from $12.2 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2016.Although, the entire industry to which Hewlett Packard Enterprise belongs to has been underperforming, the stock is among the worst performers. During the year-to-date period, the stock has lost 42.3%, as compared with the loss of 18.7% incurred by industry. Currently, Hewlett Packard carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are FormFactor Inc.

460,HPE,"If you are still holding on to shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Dropping Hewlett PackardEnterprise can maximize investor’s portfolio returns as it has witnessed a significant price decline in the past one year, and has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and year. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.Although the entire industry to which Hewlett Packard Enterprise belongs to, has been underperforming, the stock is among the worst performers. During the year-to-date period, the stock has lost 43.3%, as compared with the industry’s decline of 20.1%.Let’s delve deeper and find out what is taking the company down.Why Hewlett Packard Enterprise Should be AvoidedFor the full year 2017, we have seen seven estimates moving south in the past 30 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to drift downward, going from $1.43 per share a month ago to current level of $1.40.Additionally, Hewlett PackardEnterprise has seen seven downward estimate revisions against only one revision in the opposite direction for the current quarter. This has led to the consensus estimate declining to 28 cents per share from 39 cents in the past 30 days.Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company closed the spin-merger of its Enterprise Services business. Additionally, the company completed the pending spin-merger of its Software business in the fiscal third quarter.The company also issued a disappointing bottom-line guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 26-30 cents (mid-point: 28 cents), which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.As the company concluded its spin-merger of the Software business in the recently reported quarter, it adjusted the outlook for fiscal 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2017 in the range of $1.36-$1.40 (mid-point $1.38), down from $1.46-$1.56. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.46.Adding to the woes, the company posted an average negative earnings surprise of 0.58%.We remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to the three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from unfavorable currency exchange movements, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.Also, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain other concerns. Competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) adds to its woes.So, it may not be a prudent decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t intend to wait for a long time.Stocks to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc.

461,HPE,"With a nuclear missile game of chicken and a Category 5 hurricane barreling toward the East Coast, we begin this Labor Day-shortened trading week with myriad tensions on a global scale. We also see a return of Congress after summer recess with a debt-ceiling issue to somehow get beyond, as well as a proposed cancellation of another one of President Obama’s signature accomplishments — the “Dreamers” program, or DACA.It would appear the escalation of ICBM threats of nuclear annihilation are pretty well tuned out by the market, pending further developments. For now, we see lots of sabre-rattling but not a lot of action; of course, when what’s at stake is tens of millions of lives on the Pacific Rim and in America, actually taking action brings with it a dread that no market would be able to ignore. Right now, indexes are down somewhat but nothing “earth shattering.”Hurricane Irma’s 175 mph winds is now being called “extremely dangerous” as it enters the West Indies this week. Schools are closing, flights are being canceled and concerns of long-term power outages are following reports of approaching 20-plus-foot waves and double-digit inches of rainfall hitting islands in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. From there, it’s a waiting game to see if Irma socks the Southeast coast of the continental U.S. — and if so, where? Currently Florida, Georgia and both North and South Carolina look to be the most likely to take a direct hit.Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) CEO Tim Cook joins roughly 300 leaders in a variety of domestic industries in penning an open letter to President Trump regarding the DACA program, which would keep some 800K people from being deported from the U.S. Reports are that Trump has already made his decision on this issue, and an announcement is expected to be forthcoming from Attorney General Jeff Sessions sometime today. DACA, or the “Dreamers” program, is a works program for children of undocumented citizens. Business leaders say ending the program would cost the U.S. economy more than $460 billion and close to $25 billion in Medicare and Social Security contributions.Any Potential Good News?Sure! Fed Governor Lael Brainard has called for a slowing of interest rate increases by the Fed, both in its September meeting and beyond, until inflation metrics finally reach the optimum 2% economists have been looking for. We’re still not there yet any way you slice the data, so Brainard urges caution in tightening monetary policy until new developments push inflation upward. This should help equities traders feel the slack a bit, near term, without feeling the heat of ratcheting interest rates. Currently the odds for a September hike are already almost non-existent, though they do get much bigger for the December meeting.Also, Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE  -  Free Report) reports earnings results after the bell today, in an earnings season which is for most intents and purposes over with.

In what was a difficult stretch for retail restaurants, the company’s unique arcade-eatery concept helped it stick out, and the stock gained 35% on the year.  However, that momentum has not continued in 2017, and despite the fact that it’s never missed earnings estimates, Dave & Buster’s investors are understandably nervous heading into its Q2 earnings announcement. The primary cause for concern is the company’s rapidly decelerating comps growth rate, so investors will be most interested in that result. Nevertheless, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP of 1.54%, meaning that investors should be more confident about the chances of yet another beat. And as it stands now, our consensus estimates are calling for profits of $0.54 per share and sales of $280.5 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 8.3% and 14.8%, respectively. 2. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) - September 5 - After Market Close Information technology giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings results after the market closes on September 5. HPE just completed the spin-off of a large chunk of its software business, which it underscores the importance of this stretch in company history. Lower demand for servers at the enterprise and SMB segments due to the presence of virtualization and cloud options makes us slightly cautious about Hewlett Packard’s near-term prospects. On top of this, HPE currently has an Earnings ESP -0.87%.The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), and although this increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. 3. Dell Technologies (DVMT  -  Free Report) - September 6 - Before Market Open Personal computing and enterprise technology company Dell Technologies is expected to report its second-quarter earnings before the bell on September 6. While the power of the Dell brand may seem much weaker than it once was, its merger with EMC in late 2016 has breathed new life into the company. Shares of DVMT have gained more than 35% year-to-date, making it one of the hotter stocks in the IT space in 2017. Nevertheless, Dell’s “Computers - IT Services” industry is currently in the bottom 18% of the Zacks Industry Rank, which might speak to a weakness in the market. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

463,HPE,"On Friday, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (HPE  -  Free Report) are plummeting, down over 20% in midday trading after the company announced the spin-off of almost all of its software business.Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s software business, which includes the popular and widely used security platform ArcSight, has now been merged with British software company Micro Focus International, which trades on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker “MCRO.”“With the completion of this transaction, HPE has achieved a major milestone in becoming a stronger, more focused company, purpose-built to compete and win in today’s market,” said Meg Whitman, Chief Executive Officer of HPE.  “And, this transaction will deliver approximately $8.8 billion to HPE and its stockholders.”Today’s deal also marks the end of the company’s 2011 acquisition of British firm Autonomy, which Hewlett scooped up for $11 billion. At the time, the acquisition was to help push HPE forward as an enterprise software industry leader, but the deal was heavily criticized, and according to Reuters, Hewlett ended up taking an $8.8 billion writedown on it.Hewlett’s next step, though, will be to quickly build up its software division, especially for its mixed data center areas. The company has also had to adjust to the change in enterprise software, as cloud computing services offered from competitors like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) dominate the market.HPE was created in 2015, along with HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), as a spin-off from the Hewlett Packard Company. The company currently sits at a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘C.’More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

464,HPE,"It seems that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), along with restructuring initiatives, is apparently paying off at last for HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), as evident from its last few quarterly results. The company not only reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, but also continued the revenue growth momentum for the fourth consecutive quarter after several quarters of decline. The quarter also marked back-to-back second time in a row where both Personal Systems and Print segments have grown in the same quarter since 2010.HP’s total revenues increased 9.8% year over year to $13.060 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.077 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments, along with the successful launch of products.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 43 cents per share came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, as well as matched the upper-end of management’s earlier guidance range of 40-43 cents.Despite reporting better-than-expected results and strong top-line growth, shares of HP fell nearly 1.4% during yesterday’s after-hour trade. This may be due to the fact that the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP earnings failed to mark year-over-year improvement. Apart from this, a lower-than-expected earnings guidance range for the fiscal fourth quarter might also have turned investors cautious.Notably, HP’s non-GAAP earnings came in lower than the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 48 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company posted earnings from continuing operation of 41 cents, down from 49 cents reported in third-quarter fiscal 2016. The year-over-year decline in bottom-line results was stemmed by elevated costs and expenses, which were partially offset by higher revenues and reduced share counts.HP’s shares have underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. While the stock has returned 27% in the said period, the industry gained 37%.Quarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $8.404 billion, up 12% year over year.  Commercial revenues increased 11%, while Consumer revenues were up 14%. The company witnessed a 7% rise in total shipments, driven by a 12% increase in Notebook unit shipment. Desktops unit shipments were down 3% on a year-over-year basis.Printing revenues were up 6% year over year to $4.698 billion, primarily due to a 10% increase in supplies revenues. HP’s total hardware unit sales inched up 1% owing to an increase of 1% in Consumer hardware units. Commercial hardware units, however, remained flat on a year-over-year basis.Region wise, revenues from Americas were up 8% year over year. EMEA revenues grew 14%, while the Asia Pacific and Japan region increased 15% year over year, all in constant currency.Gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 18.6%, primarily driven by better margin in the printing segment backed by improved productivity and higher supplies mix. However, elevated commodity costs of Personal Systems partially offset the aforementioned benefit.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 35% year over year to $1.4 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations contracted 170 basis points to 7.7%. The contraction can be attributed to escalating costs and expenses. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $735 million compared with $826 million reported a year ago.HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.967 billion compared with $6.223 billion in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $6.744 billion compared with $6.710 billion last quarter.The company generated cash flow of $1.775 billion from operational activities during the quarter. HP repurchased shares worth $302 million and paid dividends worth $222 million, in the same time frame.During the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, operating cash flow came in at $2.997 billion, while the company paid $673 million as cash dividend and bought back shares worth $911 million.GuidanceHP raised its lower-end earnings guidance range for fiscal 2017. The company now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the band of $1.63-$1.66 (previously $1.59-$1.66). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.64 per share.For the fiscal fourth quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 42-45 cents per share (mid-point: 43.5 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 44 cents.Our TakeWe are impressed by the performance of HP’s PC segment, wherein the year-over-year increase can be attributed to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues.HP’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. The company is working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.The recently released PC shipment data by IDC depicts that HP’s restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs, are paying off. HP, as per the data compiled by IDC, witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the fifth quarter in a row, after registering decline for five consecutive quarters.With the start of shipping A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP can revive its printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Also, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns. Competition from the likes of International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) adds to its woes.HP currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

465,HPE,"Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to acquire Sunnyvale-based start-up Springpath for $320 million. The company offers hyperconvergence software that enables server-based storage systems. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) systems combine all the pieces (style storage arrays with more generic servers packed with disk and flash storage) necessary for data center computing. According to research firm IDC, the market is anticipated to be a $6-billion opportunity by 2020.Cisco-Springpath relationship dates back to 2015, when the networking giant invested in the start-up. The relationship deepened further when they collaborated in early 2016 to launch HyperFlex, the industry’s first fully integrated hyperconverged infrastructure system.HyperFlex combined Cisco’s Unified Computing System (UCS) blade servers with Springpath’s software at core. The product helped Cisco to enter the hyperconvergence market, which was dominated by the likes of Nutanix (NTNX  -  Free Report), VMware (VMW  -  Free Report), Dell-EMC and SimpliVity – acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) early this year. Cisco Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Cisco Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteSpringpath to Boost Competitive PositionSpringpath acquisition will boost Cisco’s competitive position in the HCI market. The optimistic expectation reflected a 1.92% increase in share price, which ultimately closed at $31.27 on Aug 22. Notably, the stock has gained 3.5% year to date, substantially underperforming the 18.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Springpath’s software – Data Platform – is based on Hardware Agnostic Log-Structured Objects (HALO) architecture, where the storage is maintained on a log-structured file system. This kind of file system is more efficient at handling inline de-duplication and compression of data as compared with append-only file systems like the Hadoop Distributed File System.Cisco views that Nutanix and other product offerings fell short in addressing challenges related to networking and performance related to HCI systems. The company believes that HyperFlex is a better solution in this regard. The product gained strong traction with Cisco gaining almost 1800 customers last year.Acquisitions Helping in TransitionThe buyout also reflected Cisco’s focus on transitioning to a software company as its hardware and networking business continues to decline. In the last quarter, Switching, NGN Routing and Data Center revenues declined considerably.Cisco has completed a plethora of acquisitions in the software space over the last couple of years. The big names were Jasper Technologies, a Internet of Things (IoT) cloud service provider, in 2016 for $1.4 billion and AppDynamics, an app performance management software provider, in early 2017 for $3.7 billion.Springpath is Cisco’s fifth acquisition in 2017. During the fourth quarter, the company completed the acquisition of MindMeld. In the current quarter, the company closed the acquisitions of Viptela (software-defined wide area networking product provider) and Observable Networks (cloud-native network forensics security applications delivered as a service provider).Zacks RankCisco has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

466,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of a Senior Floating Rate Notes offering worth $650 million. Notes, carrying an interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.95% per year, are set to mature in 2021.Per the company, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated will lead the underwriting syndicate. Security brokerage and dealership services provider will act as the sole active bookrunner and representative of underwriters.DXC Technology intends to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which also include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.Borrowing costs continue to be low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. With the U.S. treasuries offering low rates, corporate bonds and borrowings from banks are now witnessing high demand. We believe that these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth.Nonetheless, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. As of Jun 30, 2017, DXC has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.25 billion, while it paid $76 million as interest expenses during first-quarter fiscal 2018, which was 200% higher than the year-ago quarter tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt primarily increased this year. Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017.CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby increasing its interest cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Additionally, the company noted that the merger has opened up new avenues of growth and will help the combined entity to become a leading player in the IT services domain. Post merger, DXC Technology became the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report).However, we believe that the benefits of this merger will come over the long run, as DXC Technology’s near-term results are likely to bear the impact of the integration of the acquired businesses.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).DXC Technology stock has gained 21.1% since Apr 1, substantially outperforming the 12% rally of the industry it belongs to.A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is CSRA Inc. , which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

467,HPE,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 23. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.6%. Notably, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and came in line once, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 3%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in November 2015 enabled HP to make customized approach for its businesses which was not possible when it operated as a single entity. The company is working on product innovation and differentiation, as well as enhancing the capabilities of the printing business to stabilize its top line.Over the past one year, the company rolled out various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave. Apart from this, it is focusing on its pricing actions and marketing and sales activities which have helped in stimulating demand for the company’s PC products in the market.The impact of these initiatives is well indicated by the fact that the company has gained its top position once again by replacing Lenovo, per Gartner’s recently released data on PC shipment for second-quarter 2017. Also, the last-quarter growth in the company’s PC shipments was its fifth quarter of consecutive year-over-year improvement, after several quarters of decline.HP’s efforts to turn around the business have been commendable and seem to be in the right direction as indicated by the results of the last few quarters. We believe that the benefit of the aforementioned initiatives will have a positive impact on the to-be-reported quarterly results also.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain concerns. Competition from the likes of Dell, Lenovo and Apple also add to its woes.HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that HP will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release.

Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%.

469,HPE,"The enterprise technology industry has been a hot stock option for years, and most investors interested in this space have heard of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) and Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report). With both companies presenting positive yet distinct stock signals, which should investors hop on now? Let’s dive right into the question.HPE is an integrated systems company focused on enterprise offerings like IT solutions, servers, and cloud-based products. The stock currently sports a “B” grade for Value and an “F” grade for Growth in our Style Scores System.Meanwhile, Salesforce is a cloud-based software company engaged in the customer relations management business. CRM is currently holding an “A” grade for Growth and an “F” grade for Value in our Style Scores System.HPE and Salesforce are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) options, so whichever direction an investor decides to move in, they can feel secure knowing that both stocks have an improving earnings outlook. Let’s break down why each stock has received their respective Style Scores to help better choose an investment strategy.Two Different StoriesA typical value investor will most likely invest in HPE, especially when compared to Salesforce. HPE currently has a P/E ratio of 12.5, while Salesforce has a PE ratio of 59.3. This is the most popular metric used to determine value and is a measure of price divided by earnings. Here we see HP clearly trades at a discount to CRM based on this metric.In regards to valuations, the P/B ratio is also useful and helps compare a stock’s market value with its book value. HP has a P/B ratio of 1.1, which is a strong discount to Salesforce and its P/B ratio of 9.4. These metrics highlight the huge discrepancies between HPE’s “B” grade in Value and Salesforce’s “F” in our Style Scores System.Although these stocks may seem lopsided in these regards, Salesforce’s strength and HPE’s weakness lie in growth. Salesforce’s arguably insane PE ratio is indicative of  fast growth to come in the near future to level out the price, while HPE’s P/E ratio is indicative of steady growth, but at a much slower rate.In addition, Salesforce is expected to witness EPS growth of 24.2% on an annualized basis over the next three to five years, almost triple that of HPE’s 8.5%. This further supports the earlier notion that Salesforce stock is overvalued because of anticipation for massive growth.Bottom LineBoth HPE and Salesforce are Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks, with overall positive earnings revisions. Although this is the case, they have very distinct and polar strengths and weaknesses. Overall, HPE is the best option for value investors, while Salesforce appeals to the growth investor.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

470,HPE,"International Business Machines Corp (IBM  -  Free Report) delivered first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $2.45 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel. Earnings per share (EPS) increased 4.3% from the year-ago quarter but plunged 52.7% sequentially.The year-over-year growth in EPS can be attributed to higher revenues (10 cents contribution), improving gross margin trajectory, pre-tax margin expansion (four cents contribution) and aggressive share buyback (five cents contribution).This was partially offset by higher tax rate (couple of cents negative impact) and headwinds related to initiatives in repositioning IBM’s business (five cents negative impact).Revenues of $19.07 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.72 billion and climbed 5.1% on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues declined 15.4% sequentially. At constant currency (cc), revenues remained flat at $18.20 billion.Shares declined roughly 6% in after-hour trading following the first-quarter announcement. IBM has returned 4.9% year to date, slightly below the industry’s growth of 5.3%.Americas, Asia-Pacific Revenues DeclineGeographically, both Americas and Asia-Pacific revenues remained flat on a year-over-year basis.In the Americas, growth in Canada and Latin America (strong growth in Brazil) was offset by lower revenues from the United States (down 2%). In the Asia-Pacific, Japan declined 1% year over year.Europe, Middle-East and Africa grew 1% from the year-ago quarter driven by growth in France, Spain and Middle East/Africa. However, the U.K. and Germany declined 2% and 3%, respectively. International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM)  International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation Quote Strategic Imperatives Growth ContinuesStrategic Imperatives (cloud, analytics, mobility and security) grew 10% at cc from the year-ago quarter to $9 billion.

Revenues (external) increased 2% at cc to $4.30 billion, driven by robust performance from security and analytics offerings.Segmental revenues pertaining to Strategic Imperatives and Cloud grew 2% and 4%, respectively. Cloud as-a-service revenue annual run rate was $2 billion.Solutions software revenues increased 2%, while Transaction Processing Software revenues grew 1% on a year-over-year basis.IBM’s solid security portfolio is helping it to clients on a regular basis. Increasing demand for security solutions due to increasing hacking risks and data privacy concerns is driving growth. The company is also benefiting from the upcoming GDPR regulations in Europe.Extensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities across the portfolio drove top-line growth in SaaS offerings within the security segment.Blockchain has also become a major part of IBM’s product offerings. The company is now a part of more than 50 active blockchain networks. Recently, the company announced a beta version of IBM Blockchain Platform Starter Plan, which has already provisioned more than 750 networks.Analytics grew driven by strong transactional performance.

471,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company’s (HPE  -  Free Report) board of directors recently announced regular quarterly cash dividend of 11.25 cents per share to be payable on Jul 4 to the shareholders of record date as of June 13. The new dividend reflects an increase of a whopping 50% from the previous payment of 7.5 cents per share.This will mark the company’s third quarterly dividend payment in fiscal 2018. Prior to this, it had paid dividend in December 2017 and March 2018.The robust hike in dividend is believed to be in line with Hewlett Packard’s latest capital-return policy. It should be noted that during the first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call, the company had stated that it would return $7 billion to shareholders by fiscal 2019 through share buybacks and dividend payments. Of this, it is expected that Hewlett Packard will return at least half of the amount in the current fiscal.Notably, during fiscal 2017, Hewlett Packard returned $3 billion to its shareholders, of which $2.56 billion was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments. Continuing the same, the company, during the last reported quarter, returned $862 million to shareholders, of which $742 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.The company’s strong balance sheet and cash flow provides it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives, and scope for product innovation, acquisitions and expansion into newer markets. The company ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $7.7 billion.Some other companies that have a consistent track record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments include The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report).We believe such initiatives not only enhance shareholder return but also raise the market value of a stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, Hewlett Packard remains confident on its growth potential, thereby raising hope for further increase in shareholder value.Notably, Hewlett Packard has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. The stock has appreciated 19.8%, while the industry recorded growth of 3.1% during the same time frame. Currently, Hewlett Packard has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

472,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 5. The company posted a negative earnings surprise of 28.6% in the last quarter. Notably, Hewlett Packard has a mixed surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, missing the same in one occasion and matching in the other. It has an average negative earnings surprise of 4.4%.Factors to ConsiderLower demand for servers at the enterprise and SMB segments due to the presence of virtualization and cloud options makes us slightly cautious about Hewlett Packard’s near-term prospects. Notably, per the latest report from Gartner and IDC, server shipments declined for the fifth straight quarter in first-quarter 2017.The declining trend in server shipments has been hurting Hewlett Packard’s revenues. It should be noted that per Gartner’s report, the company witnessed a year-over-year fall of 15.8% in server revenues and 14.3% in shipments during first-quarter 2017.Moreover, citing preliminary statistics, Gartner, last month, hinted that server shipments may register another fall in second-quarter 2017. Therefore, we are concerned that the company’s to-be-reported quarterly results will be adversely affected by this persistent decline.Furthermore, elevated commodities pricing and execution issues remain a major headwind, which are likely to thwart the company’s overall performance in the near term.Also, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns. Competition from peers adds to its woes.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hewlett Packard will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

473,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report), formed through the merger of Computer Sciences and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) recently expanded its ties with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) at VMworld 2017.The two entities are coming together to debut the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next generation hybrid cloud platform. This contract will enable DXC’s clients to run VMware software (vSphere, Virtual SAN and NSX) on the Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deliver enhanced performance for networking customers. Furthermore, it will offer users an integrated hybrid cloud solution, functioning much like a software-defined data center (SDDC). However, financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.Per DXC, by this conglomerate ""we provide our clients the choice of both on-premises and cloud solutions on existing virtualized applications. DXC's Hybrid Cloud Service is a true accelerator for enterprises wanting to modernize and optimize existing infrastructures in a flexible consumption model, while embracing the open services of the public cloud.""The move comes at a time when DXC is strengthening its position in the virtualization server market. The company is expanding its expertise from just IT services to now include networking as well. We believe that the partnership will enable DXC to offer an efficient and improved hybrid IT environment to drive performance.The VMware Cloud on AWS will ward off difficulties while setting up a mature virtualized cloud-based infrastructure. This in turn will help DXC to expand existing networking-based infrastructure with the benefits of the VMware’s hybrid cloud offerings.VMware remains one of the leading companies in the virtualization and cloud computing space. With such partnership, DXC is poised well to benefit from the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions. Per a Gartner report, global spending on cloud technology is expected to increase 25% annually over the next few years, which will result in higher demand for virtualization capabilities. Bottom LineDXC Technology has outperformed the industry since it started trading on the NYSE on Mar 31, 2017. The stock has returned 22.9%, while the industry gained 12.1%.Post-merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc. We believe that the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology may be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance portfolio, which will likely drive growth over the long run.Nonetheless, the market is very competitive with companies like CACI International Inc. and Accenture, which could hurt DXC Technology’s top and bottom lines. Additionally, a challenging macroeconomic situation and uncertain IT spending environment remain other headwinds.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

474,HPE,"Shares of online travel booking giant Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) fell more than 4.3% in morning trading Monday, shortly after new reports suggested that its longtime CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has been offered the vacant chief executive position at Uber.According to TechCrunch, Uber’s board has reached the decision to offer Khosrowshahi the CEO job and will be officially announcing the move to employees soon.Although Expedia is a dominant force in the online travel booking space, Khosrowshahi is almost certainly a less-recognizable name than Meg Whitman of HP (HPE  -  Free Report) and Jeff Immelt of (GE  -  Free Report)—two candidates rumored to be top choices for Uber.Nevertheless, Khosrowshahi has been at the helm of Expedia, which was originally started as a subsidiary of Microsoft (MSFT), since its spinoff from IAC (IAC) in 2005. Since then, the company’s total revenues have jumped from just $2.1 billion to the massive $8.7 billion figure recorded last year.Over the past decade, Expedia shares have returned more than 150%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s roughly 50% gain over that time. After a series of aggressive M&A deals, EXPE has really taken off and is up more than 31% year-to-date (also read: Uber Picks Dara Khosrowshahi: A Look At Expedia's Performance Under Its CEO).Indeed, Khosrowshahi has helped Expedia scoop up HomeAway ($3.9 billion), Travelocity ($280 million), Orbitz ($1.6 billion), Wotif ($657 million), and Trivago ($564 million)—all in just the past four years.As of right now, Expedia is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

475,HPE,"A prudent investment decision means buying stocks that offer solid prospects and selling those that appear risky. Again, at times it is rational to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Here, we take into account HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), a company which has potential to perform well in the near term.HP Inc. is one of the two companies which came into existence post the split from the parent company – Hewlett-Packard Company – in Nov 2015. The stock has been clocking solid returns since then and gained approximately 33.2%, outperforming the Zacks categorized Computer-Mini industry’s return of 22.5% during the same time frame. The major part of the rally has been witnessed this year. In the year, so far, the stock has gained 24.1%.The other company which came into existence after the split is Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report).What’s Driving the Stock?Post the split, HP adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation and differentiation, as well as enhancing the capabilities of its printing business, which will stabilize the top line.Over the past one year, the company launched various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave. Apart from this, it is focusing on its pricing actions and marketing and sales activities which have helped in stimulating demand for its PC products in the market.The impact of these initiatives is well indicated by the fact that the company has gained its top position once again by replacing Lenovo, per Gartner’s recently released data on PC shipment for second-quarter 2017. Also, the last-quarter growth in the company’s PC shipments was its fifth quarter of consecutive year-over-year improvement after several quarters of decline.The company’s efforts to revamp its printing business have also been commendable. It should be noted that HP signed a deal to acquire Samsung Electronics’ printer business in 2016, for $1.05 billion. The acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it will expand the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition, the company is now focused on boosting its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets because of their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.On the cost front too, HP has taken remarkable steps, which include the divestment of its content management software tools and Customer Communications Management (CCM) assets to Open Text Corporation and elimination of around 3,000–4,000 jobs.The company expects the divestment of CCM to reduce cost and enhance productivity. This, in turn, would help the company enhance its profitability. The job cuts are anticipated to generate annualized cost savings of approximately $200–$300 million from fiscal 2020.Bottom LineWe believe that HP’s massive restructuring moves will complement its focus on core businesses, as well as enable it to expand its share in the PC and Printing market. Furthermore, the two independent research firms – Gartner and International Data Corporation – hinted that the PC industry has been moving toward stabilization. Therefore, we believe stabilization in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of companies like HP Inc.Furthermore, HP has a VGM Style Score of “A”. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Therefore, in our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio. Currently, HP carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

477,HPE,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is one of those technology companies that have demonstrated remarkable share price performance in the year so far. The company has generated high returns for investors in the year-to-date period and has the potential to exceed expectations in the next year.HP is one of the two companies which came into existence post the split from the parent company — Hewlett-Packard Company — in November 2015. The other company was Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report).The stock has been clocking solid returns since the split and has surged approximately 51.8%, substantially outperforming the S&P 500’s return of 26.4% during the same time frame. The major part of the rally has been witnessed this year. In the YTD period, the stock has appreciated 41.4%, while the S&P 500 has gained 19.3%.Let’s check out the reasons for this impressive surge in share price and consider why HP will continue its momentum in the next year as well.Revamped PC BusinessPost the split, HP adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to trigger demand for its PC products in the market. The company has launched various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave, in a year’s time.The impact of these initiatives is well highlighted by the fact that the company has regained its top position in the PC segment by replacing Lenovo. Also, according to data compiled by IDC, during third-quarter 2017, the company’s PC shipments registered the sixth quarter of consecutive year-over-year growth after witnessing several quarters of decline.Furthermore, the two independent research firms — Gartner and International Data Corporation — hinted that the PC industry has been moving toward stabilization. Therefore, we believe stabilization in PC shipments will benefit business prospects of companies like HP.Print Segment Shines AgainThe company’s efforts to revamp its printing business have also been commendable. It should be noted that HP has acquired Samsung Electronics’ printer business. The acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it has expanded the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition to the above, the company is now focused on fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets due to their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.These efforts have paid off well with the company registering the third consecutive quarter of print business revenue growth in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Also, the company’s last quarterly results reflected revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter after witnessing a prolonged period of decline. Further, the Personal Systems and Print segments improved for the third straight quarter after 2010.Stock Still UndervaluedThe stock currently trades at a forward earnings estimate at 11.7x, which is way lower than the industry average of 17.8x. Given its recent track record of revenues and earnings growth, as well as the long-term forecast, the stock is highly undervalued which signifies that it is still left with significant upside potential.Moreover, HP has a VGM Style Score of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Therefore, we consider that HP is one such technology stock which investors should keep in their portfolio.

Moreover, its order level in certain business segments has been hurt in recent times due on weak oil and gas demand.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) and Alamo Group, Inc.

482,HPE,"The fortunes of server vendors have returned it seems, as worldwide server revenues and shipments marked the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, that too after five straight quarters of decline, per International Data Corporation (“IDC”).According to the data compiled by the research firm, worldwide server revenues jumped a whopping 26.4% year over year to $20.7 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, while overall shipment grew 10.8% to 2.84 million units.IDC noted growth at every segment with revenues of volume servers rising 21.9% year over year to $15.8 billion, while the mid-range server registered growth of 48.5% to $1.9 billion. Also, high-end system revenues reached $2.9 billion, indicating rise of 41.1%, mainly benefiting from the launch of International Business Machines’ (IBM  -  Free Report) z14 in third-quarter 2017.Also, x86 servers retained the growth momentum during the quarter. IDC figured out a 24.7% year-over-year rise in x86 server revenues, reaching $17.5 billion, while revenues from non-x86 servers witnessed an increase of 36.4% to $3.2 billion.Hyperscalers Fuel Maximum GrowthPer IDC, this upsurge in the fourth quarter has been driven by strong demand from hyperscale data-center service providers which made a huge push in server deployment. According to the firm, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) continued their server deployment efforts to grab market share in the cloud service space.The second major reason outlined by IDC was the availability of Intel's (INTC  -  Free Report) Purley processors, and Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) EPYC processors. It should be noted that hyperscale data-center service providers have waited a long time for these processors.Dell Narrowed Market-Share Gap With HPEWith respect to individual server manufacturers, on the revenue market-share front, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) and Dell jointly secured the first spot. IDC calls it a statistical tie when the difference among vendors is 1% or less. Therefore, if we look at the actual revenues, then HPE holds the first position with 18.4%, while Dell has the second position with 17.5%.During the fourth quarter, Dell managed to drastically narrow down the market-share difference with HPE, as the company “continues to capitalize on expanded opportunities from its merger with EMC”, per IDC.Moreover, HPE is now focusing on the enterprise market and moving away from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which has been denting its short-term revenues. However, its loss helped Dell grab market share in the hyperscale segment.Moving ahead, IBM has secured the third position, with a market share of 13%. Notably, the company reported a massive 50.3% jump in server revenues backed by solid demand for its recently-launched z14 processors.The fourth position is a tie between Lenovo and Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report). If we look at the actual revenues, then Lenovo holds the fourth position with 5.3%, while Cisco has the fifth position with 5.1%.Furthermore, IDC provided revenues and shipment data for the ODM Direct group of vendors. These vendors continue to record huge year-over-year growth in revenues and market share as large datacenters find it attractive to custom build their server designs at potential volume prices.In addition to the above, in terms of volume, Dell secured the top position with market share of 20.5%, while HPE holds the second spot with market share of 16.9%. Lenovo, Huawei, Super Micro and Inspur Electronics occupied the third position, ending the quarter with market shares of 6.4%, 5.9%, 5.6% and 5.4%, respectively.Growth Across All Regions Except Latin AmericaRegion wise, IDC noted server market growth across every region except Latin America. Canada and Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan and China) witnessed the fastest growth with 69.7% and 38.2% increase, respectively. This was followed by China recording 33.8%, the United States 29.6%, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 17.4%, and Japan reporting 4.3% increase. However, Latin America registered a year-over-year decline of 5% in the quarter.Brighter Prospects AheadWe believe the global server market will continue to grow in the quarters ahead, mainly due to the further push of hyperscale server deployments by cloud-service providers. In our opinion, there is a huge growth opportunity in the hyperscale server-infrastructure space, with more and more companies shifting to cloud-based storage.Also, Gartner’s latest forecast for IT spending (a 4.5% increase in 2018) depicts a favorable tech spending environment, which, we believe, will positively influence the overall server market in the near term.Looking at the improving IT spending and server deployment push by data-center service providers across different geographies, we expect that the overall performance of vendors will improve over the next few quarters.Currently, HPE and Cisco carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while IBM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

483,HPE,"It was another interesting month throughout the global stock markets, with strong earnings results and relaxed trade tensions between the U.S. and China doing little to break range-bound indexes higher amid other potential macroeconomic growth headwinds.

All the three key indexes closed in the green for the week and registered record gains for two straight weeks.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 1.4%, or 349.44 points, to close at 25,309.99.

Additionally, the central bank sees the labor market is “little beyond full employment,” but wage gains will grow moderately.Moreover, the report indicated that inflation will remain near or lower than Fed’s target rate of 2% this year. However, the semi-annual report did not throw any light on the number of rate hikes this year.The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield decreased from 2.917% on Thursday to 2.871% on Friday, after it hit a four-year high earlier during the week.

Some of its holdings, including NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) rose 4.6% and 4.4%, respectively.Moreover, the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) increased 1.8%.

Brent crude price advanced 1.4% to $67.31 a barrel, settling at its best level in two weeks. Increase in oil prices had a positive impact on the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), which climbed 2.2%, becoming the second biggest gainer among the S&P 500 sectors. Dow components, Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) rose 2.5% and 2.2%, respectively.Indexes Post Best Week In 2 YearsFor the week, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 0.4%, 0.6% and 1.4%, respectively.

486,HPE,"Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) are trading over 12% higher in today’s pre-market trading as the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The upswing is also attributable to the encouraging outlook and hefty dividends.The company’s non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 34 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents and also came toward the higher end of management’s guidance range of 20-24 cents. However, on a year-over-year basis, the figure declined 24.4%.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 89 cents from continuing operations compared with 16 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, it compared favorably with the guided range of 1-5 cents. The better-than-expected bottom-line performance primarily stemmed from increased revenues, cost savings and lower tax rate.RevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues from continuing operations (which includes Enterprise Group and Financial Services) of $7.674 billion, up 11.2% from the year-earlier quarter’s revenues of $6.902 billion. Further, quarterly revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.025 billion.Adjusted for currency-exchange rates and divestures, the company’s revenues from continuing operations were up 9% year over year.During the reported quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance in the Americas grew 3% mainly due to “strength in core compute and campus switching combined with a recovery in the organic storage results.” Revenues in Europe went up 11% in constant currency mainly due to strength in core compute and storage, and higher growth in Germany and Scandinavia. The Asia Pacific witnessed strong core server sales, with growth in Japan, Australia and China.Segment wise, revenues at the Hybrid IT increased 10% year over year to $6.331 billion. Adjusting for currency, segment revenues were up 9% year over year. Revenues from the Intelligent Edge and Financial Services segments climbed 8.8% and 7.9%, respectively.Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise’s gross margin contracted 370 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 28.4%. This contraction resulted from competitive pricing, elevated DRAM pricing and unfavorable currency.In addition, the company’s non-GAAP operating margin shrunk 180 bps to 7.7%, primarily due to a lower gross margin, which was partially offset by a decline in non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues resulting.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended the fiscal first quarter with $7.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from $9.6 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt at the quarter end was $10.040 billion compared with $10.182 billion recorded in the last quarter.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise generated $142 million of cash flow from operational activities.

487,HPE,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is one of those technology companies that have been demonstrating remarkable share price performance. HP is one of the two companies which came into existence post the split from the parent company — Hewlett-Packard Company — in November 2015. The other company was Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report). The company has generated high returns for investors in the year-to-date period.The stock has been clocking solid returns since the split and has surged approximately 70.8%, substantially outperforming the S&P 500’s growth of 32.2%. The major part of the rally has been witnessed this year. In a year, the stock has appreciated 34.5%, while the S&P 500 has advanced 16.3%.Let’s analyze the reasons behind this impressive surge in share price and consider why HP will continue its momentum in the near-term as well.PC Business RevivedPost the split, HP adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to trigger demand for its PC products in the market. The company has launched various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave, in the last two years.The impact of these initiatives is well highlighted by the fact that the company has regained the pole position in the PC segment by displacing Lenovo. Also, according to data compiled by IDC, during fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s PC shipments registered the seventh quarter of consecutive year-over-year growth after witnessing several quarters of decline.Furthermore, the two independent research firms — Gartner and International Data Corporation — hinted that the PC industry has been moving toward stabilization. Therefore, we believe stabilization in PC shipments will benefit business prospects of companies like HP.Revamping Print SegmentThe company’s efforts to revamp printing business have also been commendable. It should be noted that HP has acquired Samsung Electronics’ printer business. The acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it has expanded the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition to the above, the company is now focused on fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report)    and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets due to their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.However these efforts have paid off well with the company registering the fourth consecutive quarter of print business revenue growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Also, the company’s last quarterly results reflected revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter after witnessing a prolonged period of decline. Further, the Personal Systems and Print segments improved for the fourth straight quarter after 2010.Stock Still UndervaluedThe stock currently trades at a forward earnings estimate at 12.2x, which is way lower than the industry average of 15.3x. Given its recent track record of revenues and earnings growth, as well as the long-term forecast, the stock is highly undervalued which signifies that it is still left with significant upside potential.Moreover, HP has a VGM Style Score of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Consequently, we consider HP as one such technology stock that investors should consider for near-term opportunities.

488,HPE,"A stock at a 52-week high level is perceived a winner. This level works as an indicator for many investors for buying or selling the stock.Quite often, investors start wondering if this level has made the stock an overpriced one. While they are not totally incorrect, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, a decision to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels makes an investor miss out on most of the top gainers.A stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ special attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them achieve the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that motivated investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank =1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen:Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), which was formed as a result of the split of Hewlett-Packard Company into two separate entities, deals with enterprise and service business-oriented segments. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 11.71%.NETGEAR, Inc.

489,HPE,"Momentum investing calls for a continuous appraisal of stocks, which ensures that an investor does not pick a beaten-down name and overlook a thriving one. Momentum investors buy high on the anticipation that the stock will only ascend further in the short-to-intermediate term.We believe the recent stock market upsurge presents an ideal buying opportunity for momentum investors. The market is highly anticipated to continue its bullish run driven by an improving macro-economic scenario. Notably, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index for the United States increased in January, which supports continuing economic growth.Moreover, positive impact of recent tax-reform on company earnings, which will be more prominent in the current quarter, is expected to provide a significant boost to the bull market.Technology Momentum ContinuesTechnology has been one of the most lucrative sectors for investors, year to date. The technology-heavy NASDAQ Composite (IXIC) is up almost 7.6% as compared with S&P 500’s growth of roughly 2%.The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) has also gained 8.2% on a year-to-date basis. Powershares QQQ ETF (QQQ) has also increased 9%.The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, AR/VR headsets, drones, self-driving cars and artificial intelligence (AI).Although technology stocks will benefit less from the corporate tax cuts, they hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. Moreover, higher domestic cash level will make the technology stocks less susceptible to an anticipated interest rate hike in 2018.Further, improving liquidity level will allow these companies to spend more on the emerging technologies like ADAS, IoT and AR/VR.Spending to Grow ExponentiallyBlackRock expects ADAS market to grow at least 20% each year through 2025, creating significant growth opportunity for manufacturers of camera lenses, sensors and other items.Per market research firm IDC, global spending on robotics and drones solutions will increase 22.1% year over year to $103.1 billion in 2018. This spending is projected to grow at a CAGR of 25.4% over 2018-20121 time frame to $218.4 billion.Moreover, global spending on IoT will grow 14.6% year over year to reach $772.5 billion in 2018. IDC predicts global spending on IoT to surpass $1 trillion mark in 2020 and reach $1.1 trillion by 2021.In addition to these positive data, IT spending is expected to grow. Gartner now projects global IT spending for 2018 to rise 4.5%, up from 3.8% in 2017.Our PicksThe trick to achieve success in momentum investing is based on the risk-appetite of the investor. Momentum investing is not for the faint-hearted and success comes only to those who can effectively ride the upswing and brave the downswing of the market with the same élan. It is here that the Zacks Style Score System can come in handy.We use the Zacks Momentum Style Score to pick stocks. The style score indicates the best time to buy a stock and take advantage of its momentum with a highest probability of success. Moreover, we prefer large caps due to their fundamental strength and stability amid increasing volatility in markets.Back-tested results show that stocks with Momentum Style Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Here, we have identified six great momentum stocks, each having market cap of more than $15 billion.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) offers graphics chip processors and related software for a wide range of visual computing platforms.

490,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of GBP 250 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.750% Senior Notes which are due 2025. The notes are being issued at a discount and are priced at 99.528% of the aggregate principal amount.The offering is anticipated to close on or about March 15. Led by Lloyds Bank plc and Merrill Lynch International, a group of underwriters will be conducting the offering.DXC is looking to use the proceeds from the offerings post the payment of all related expenses for repaying a part of its GBP 287 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans under revolving credit facility. The company may also use the fund for general corporate purposes and working capital.Though the Fed has been raising interest rates for the past year, borrowing costs are still very low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. Furthermore, we believe the company has been offering senior notes at the right time as the Fed is likely to raise interest rates much faster than previously anticipated.Nonetheless, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. Notably, the company exited the third-quarter of fiscal 2018 with $2.926 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared with $2.671 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt balance (net of current maturities) was $6.367 billion.The company’s share price movement has been quite favorable since its formation via the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) which concluded on Apr 1, 2017. The company’s shares have returned 50.7%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 31.9%.Currently, DXC carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks worth considering the broader technology sector are Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) and Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term expected EPS growth rate for Paycom and Facebook is projected to be 25.8% and 26.5%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

491,HPE,"The business world is buzzing on Monday morning, thanks in large part to the news that ride-hailing behemoth Uber has officially offered its vacant CEO role to Dara Khosrowshahi, the current chief executive of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report).Expedia has been a dominant force in the online travel booking space for some time, but Khosrowshahi is almost certainly a less-recognizable name than Meg Whitman of HP (HPE  -  Free Report) and Jeff Immelt of GE (GE  -  Free Report)—two candidates rumored to be top choices for Uber.Khosrowshahi probably owes his under-the-radar status to the fact that Expedia isn’t based in Silicon Valley, and should he accept the position at Uber, his time spent out of the tech industry’s spotlight may relieve some of the pressure that is sure to come with this highly-publicized role.Of course, we should remember that former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned in the wake of a company-wide scandal. Kalanick’s resignation came just a few weeks after Uber fired 20 employees as a result of an internal investigation into widespread claims of sexual harassment and misconduct (also read: He's Out: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick Has Resigned).Addressing this toxic culture and working to restore Uber’s credibility will likely be Khosrowshahi’s most important tasks at his new company, but investors will also be interested in seeing how the new chief executive produces value for the powerful ride-hailing brand.After its latest round of funding, Uber reached a valuation of $68 billion, making it the highest-valued private company in the world. However, the company has faced a variety of lawsuits and is apparently still bleeding money, putting a damper on hopes for a blockbuster IPO (also read: Will Uber Be the Hottest IPO of 2017?).But the hope of taking Uber public relatively soon may have contributed to the Khosrowshahi pick. The Iranian immigrant and Brown University alum helped lead Expedia through its spinoff from IAC (IAC  -  Free Report) in 2005, and since then, he has consistently delivered value for shareholders.As we can see, EXPE performed relatively in-line with the S&P 500 for most of the last decade, but the stock has really taken off over the past three or so years. Furthermore, since its spinoff from IAC, the company’s total revenues have jumped from just $2.1 billion to the massive $8.7 billion figure recorded last year.Khosrowshahi also has plenty of experience with M&As, as Expedia has executed about 20 deals in its roughly 20-year history. Under Khosrowshahi, Expedia has scooped up HomeAway ($3.9 billion), Travelocity ($280 million), Orbitz ($1.6 billion), Wotif ($657 million), and Trivago ($564 million) in just the past four years.As competition in the ride-hailing space continues to heat up, acquisitions could become a larger part of Uber’s strategy, which means Khosrowshahi’s appointment could pay off further.Khosrowshahi and Expedia also share a unique similarity with Uber: a massive divesture from China. In 2015, Expedia shed its stake in eLong, effectively ending its operations in the country, while Uber sold its Chinese unit to rival Didi last summer (also read: Uber Gives Up on China, Sells Business to Rival Didi Chuxing).Expedia’s rise to the $23 billion travel giant it is today has been monumental, and Khosrowshahi has played no small part in that success story. His experience will be certainly be beneficial to Uber, but it goes without saying that this new CEO role will be the most difficult challenge of his career.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

492,HPE,"At times, it is prudent to retain certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock faces a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.In fact, HP stock has gained 30.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 19% rally of the industry it belongs to.Further, shares of the company went up almost 3% yesterday and to eventually close at $19.41.Aspects In Favor of HPIt seems that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), along with restructuring initiatives, is apparently paying off at last for HP, as evident from its last few quarterly results. The company not only reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, but also continued revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter after several quarters of decline. The quarter also marked back-to-back growth for both Personal Systems and Print segments in the same quarter since 2010.HP also raised lower-end earnings guidance range for fiscal 2017. The company now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the band of $1.63-$1.66 (previously $1.59-$1.66). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.64 per share.HP’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. The company is working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.Per Gartner, HP managed to regain the top position by replacing Lenovo in the second quarter. Further, this was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company, following five back-to-back quarters of underperformance. Going forward, the research firm IDC’s forward looking statement indicates that the PC industry is moving toward stabilization. The aforementioned positive comments on the PC market will benefit the business prospects of HP.With the start of shipping A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP can revive its printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Further, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.The company exhibits a VGM Style Score of A and has an expected EPS growth rate of 2.9%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.9%.From a valuation perspective, the stock looks attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate. This signifies huge upward potential. HP currently trades at a forward P/E of 11.8x compared with the industry group average of 15.0x.Risks PersistHowever, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns. Competition from the likes of International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) adds to woes.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock for the time being.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

493,HPE,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) delivered another quarter of stellar performance. The company reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Its revenues increased for the sixth consecutive quarter, of which the last five have recorded double-digit growth after an extended period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments’ performance improved for the fourth straight quarter after 2010.In fact, the company’s outstanding results for the last few quarters substantiate that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), along with its diligent restructuring initiatives, is finally paying off.HP’s total revenues increased 15% year over year to $14.517 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.432 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments as well as successful product roll outs.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 48 cents per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents as well as management’s earlier guidance range of 42-45 cents. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP earnings improved 26%.Apart from higher revenues, the company’s bottom-line results benefited from lower effective tax rate due to the U.S. tax reform. HP noted that its fiscal first-quarter effective tax rate came in at 15% which is against its previous projection of 21-22%, resulting in a benefit of 4 cents per share.HP’s shares are up nearly 6% in today’s pre-market trading session. The upswing stemmed from the company’s upbeat second-quarter and fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings guidance.Notably, the stock has outperformed the industry in the last one year. While the stock has rallied 21.2%, the industry has recorded 15.8% growth.Quarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $9.440 billion, up 15% year over year.  While commercial revenues increased 16%, consumer revenues were up 13%. We believe the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, are ultimately apparently paying off.Notably, International Data Corporation (IDC), in its latest report on fourth-quarter 2017 PC shipment, stated that the quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of overall shipment growth for HP.Talking about only the U.S. market, it is only HP which recorded growth in PC shipments as well as improvement in market share. According to data compiled by Gartner (IT  -  Free Report), the quarter ended on Dec 31, 2017, was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company in the U.S. market.Coming to the Printing business, this segment’s revenues were up 14% year over year to $5.076 billion, primarily owing to a 10% increase in supplies revenues and inclusion of the first full quarter of the newly acquired business of Samsung’s printing (S-Print) business. HP expects that the acquisition of the S-Print business will bring in additional revenues of approximately $1.4 billion in fiscal 2018.HP’s total hardware unit sales grew 14% backed by Consumer hardware units increase of 7% and Commercial hardware unit’s year-over-year growth of 73%. The robust growth in Commercial hardware units primarily stemmed from the recent inclusion of Samsung’s printing (S-Print) business.Region wise, the company registered double-digit growth in every region it operates. Revenues from Americas were up 10% year over year. While revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) climbed 13%, the same from the Asia Pacific and Japan region jumped 18% year over year, all in constant currency.Gross margin expanded 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 17.8%, primarily driven by better margin in the printing segment driven by improved productivity and higher supplies mix. This was partially offset by elevated commodity costs of Personal Systems.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 17% year over year to $1.6 billion. This was mainly due to the inclusion of S-Print business, and increased investment in research and development as well as go-to-market sales strategies.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations remained flat year over year at 7% as the benefit from improved gross margin were fully offset by elevated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $803 million compared with $646 million reported a year ago.HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5.475 billion compared with $6.997 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $6.340 billion compared with $6.747 billion reported in the last quarter.The company generated cash flow of $996 million from operational activities during the quarter. HP repurchased shares worth $462 million and paid dividends worth $230 million during the same time frame.GuidanceThe company, during its conference call, noted that due to implementation of the new tax code, its effective cost rate for fiscal 2018 is likely to be 16% (+/- 2%), much lower than the previous projection of 21-22%, thereby benefiting HP’s non-GAAP earnings per share by 13 cents. However, the company stated that “higher variable performance bonus opportunities for non-executives” will result in dilution of approximately 3 cents toward non-GAAP earnings.Therefore, the net benefit from lower effective tax rate will be around 10 cents, of which it has already earned in the fiscal first quarter. So, the remaining three quarters are likely to see a tax benefit of 2 cents each.Keeping the aforementioned factor, along with improving market share across the PC and Printer businesses, HP raised its non-GAAP earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now estimates non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.90 and $2.00 (mid-point $1.95), up from the earlier guidance range of $1.75-$1.85 (mid-point $1.80). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.81.For the fiscal second quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 45-49 cents per share (mid-point: 47 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 43 cents.Our TakeWe are impressed by the performance of HP’s PC segment, wherein the year-over-year increase can be attributed to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues. Additionally, the company’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. Meanwhile, it has been working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.The latest PC shipment data by IDC depicts that HP’s restructuring initiatives, including focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs, are paying off gradually. Per the data compiled by IDC, the company witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the seventh quarter in a row, after witnessing declines for five consecutive quarters.With the start of shipping A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP is likely to revive the company’s printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Also, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.Nonetheless, prices of components such as DRAM and NAND are likely to remain high in 2018 which will continue to drag down the company’s margins. Although the company’s strategic efforts are driving top-line growth, those might not be enough to offset this incremental cost.Moreover, competition from the likes of Lenovo, Dell and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) remains another key concern.HP currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

495,HPE,"Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report) stunned its shareholders yesterday with the news that the company and some of the company's executives have been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The wireless equipment player’s shares slipped more than 25%, as investors abandoned the stock in droves following the probe into its business and accounting practices.Of late, Ubiquiti’s shares have been volatile and lost 16% over the past six months. This is in stark contrast to its industry, which has rallied 16.7% on an average, during the same time frame.The SEC ProbeAccording to a regulatory filing dated Feb 13, the agency has issued subpoenas to Ubiquiti and a few of its officers, “requesting documents and information relating to a range of topics, including metrics relating to the Ubiquiti Community, accounting practices, financial information, auditors, international trade practices, and relationships with distributors and various other third parties.”Several securities litigation firms, which include Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP, Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP, Holzer & Holzer, LLC and Block & Leviton LLP, have launched investigations on behalf of Ubiquiti’s shareholders related to the company and its officers’ possible violations of federal securities laws.Per a spokesperson, Ubiquiti is in the process of responding to SEC’s requests and intends to cooperate fully with the agency.What It Means for UbiquitiThe subpoenas mark the second setback for Ubiquiti's shares this month, coming on the heels of a tough quarterly report earlier in February.In all fairness, the subpoenas don't automatically mean that Ubiquiti is in the wrong. It is not clear what led the SEC to take this action. However, what’s disturbing is that less than six months ago, Citron Research had charged the company of fraud and questioned the integrity of distributors, high margins, corporate culture and cash balances. The company’s CEO Robert Pera vehemently denied these allegations.Investors will just have to wait and see what the reason behind the SEC probe actually is.The Other SetbackOn Feb 8, shares of Ubiquiti tumbled 14% in response to mixed fiscal second-quarter results. The company’s earnings missed estimates by 6.2%, putting an end to its three-quarter earnings beat streak.Ubiquiti’s quarterly results suffered from gross margin headwinds, as strong demand for core networking portfolio was eclipsed by $18.6 million booked as provisions for obsolete inventory, vendor deposits, and losses on purchase commitments. The losses on purchase commitments resulted from weak sales of the new FrontRow wearable cameras. Also, investors were disappointed with the outlook, which seemed weak considering that demand for several of the company’s new product offerings continues to grow.Ubiquiti clearly faces an uphill battle in persuading investors that things are going to be fine for the company in the near future.Ubiquiti has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and competes with players like Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), the Aruba arm of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.  and Huawei.

496,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) announced that it has been selected by Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) to build a next-generation supercomputer for its Swiss brain research initiative, Blue Brain Project.The supercomputer, codenamed Blue Brain 5, designed on the company's SGI 8600 System, will help in modeling and simulation of the mammalian brain. The new system will be dedicated to simulation neuroscience, more specifically simulation-based research, analysis and visualization, reports HPE.At the end of 2017, HPE was awarded the first contract by EPFL based on supercomputing requirements of the project and evaluating the bids. The total contract value, including a subsequent phase, is now expected to go up to CHF 18 million, which is just over $18 million.HPE’s Domain Expertise Makes it a Natural ChoicePer Felix Schürmann, co-director at the Blue Brain Project, “The Blue Brain Project’s scientific mission is critically dependent on our supercomputing capabilities.” And, HPE’s expertise on the matter is evident when he says, “HPE helps us to navigate the challenging technology landscape in supercomputing.”Moreover, HPE’s focus on powering technologies to help in providing targeted treatments is expected to be accretive to the company’s growth. We note that HPE’s technology is also being used by German researchers for studying brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s.Collaborations Enhance HPE’s Growth ProspectsWe note that in April, HPE collaborated with KU Leuven, a Flemish research university to develop and deploy a new supercomputer, specifically built to run artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. The system, Genius, by building applications is expected to drive scientific breakthroughs, economic growth and innovation in Belgium.Last month, the company collaborated with Sandia National Laboratories and the U.S. Department of Energy to build the “world's largest ARM-Based supercomputer”, Astra. The system enables National Nuclear Security Administration to address areas like national security, energy and science by improving analysis of complex, data-driven engineering and science simulations.Rapid adoption of supercomputing systems is expected to be a tailwind for the company. Per Technavio, the global supercomputer market is anticipated to witness CAGR of around 9% during 2018-2022.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Revenue (TTM) Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Revenue (TTM) | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderHPE currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few-better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are YY Inc.

497,HPE,"Arrow Electronics, Inc. (ARW  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has collaborated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) to become a Designated Learning Partner.Per the partnership, Arrow will now provide “authorized HPE Partner Ready Certification training” to its customers. The courses will include designing, deploying, administering and managing HPE servers, data centers and converged systems among others.Arrow Electronics with the assistance of the resources from HPE looks to educate customers with the knowledge related to HPE’s host of products and solutions, that will in turn be positively impacting the profit margin of the customers.We believe the collaboration with HPE will be beneficial for Arrow as the latter will be introduced to the vast customer base of HPE, part of which might be interested in Arrow Electronics’ electronic components and enterprise computing products.Hence, this partnership is anticipated to assist Arrow Electronics in expanding its customer base, which will eventually boost its top line in the long run. Notably, in first-quarter 2018, the company’s revenues were up 14.4% on an adjusted basis to $6.876 million.Arrow Electronics, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Arrow Electronics, Inc.

498,HPE,"We still have a few more weeks to go before the big banks start reporting June-quarter results. But the Q2 reporting cycle has (officially) gotten underway, with results from 9 S&P 500 members already out. All of these early earnings releases are from companies that have fiscal quarters ending in May, but these get counted as part of the June-quarter tally.We have another 11 index members with fiscal quarters ending in May on deck to report results this week. All in all, we will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members by the time JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) (unofficially) kick-off this earnings season on July 13th.The notable earnings reports coming out this week include:Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) reports on Tuesday (6/26) before the market’s open, with the homebuilder expected to earn $0.45 per share in earnings on $5.23 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.91 per share on $3.26 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock was up big following the last earnings release, but overall it has been a tough period for Lennar shares as well as the broader homebuilder space.Lennar shares are currently trading close to 52-week lows and are now down -18.8% since the start of the year, underperforming the Zacks Construction sector’s -8.1% year-to-date decline vs. the S&P 500 index’s +4% gain. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which is scheduled to report results Thursday morning (06/28) is down even more than Lennar (down -19.9% YTD).    General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) reports on Wednesday (6/27) morning, with the company expected to earn $0.75 per share on $3.91 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.73 per share on $3.81 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. Estimates have come down a bit in recent days and the stock has lost ground following each of the last two earnings reports. The stock was down big in the run up to and the day of the last earning release on March 21st and has essentially remained flat since then. General Mills shares are currently down -22.3% since the start of the year, underperforming the struggling Consumer Staples sector’s -10.3% year-to-date decline.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) reports after the market’s close on Thursday (6/28), with the company expected to earn $0.64 in EPS on $9.39 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.60 EPS on $8.68 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock was down following each of the last three earning releases, but has been an impressive performer this year, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector as well as the broader market. Nike shares are currently trading close to their 52-high and are up +18.6% vs. the Consumer Discretionary sector’s +4.7% year-to-date period.Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) will report before the market’s open on Thursday (6/28), with the company expected to earn $1.71 per share in earnings on $10.02 billion in revenues, up +12.5% and +13% from the year-earlier period, respectively. Accenture has been spotlighting its opportunity in the digital, cloud and security areas in recent quarters and revenues from those areas should show strong momentum in this release as well. Management’s commentary about technology spending trends typically has read through for IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The stock was down big following the last quarterly release on March 22nd, but has recovered since then and is currently up +4.9% in the year-to-date period.The chart below of weekly reporting calendar for the S&P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another three weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off.Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +18.5% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This would follow +24.6% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +8.6%, the highest growth in almost 7 years.The chart below plots the evolution of Q2 earnings growth expectations. As you can see, the growth rate has ticked up a bit, partly reflecting results from the 9 S&P 500 members that have reported results already. But even after accounting for the results that have come out, Q2 estimates revisions are nowhere near the impressive positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season.A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes, which was obviously a one-off development. Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes, we would have seen only EPS estimates go up, with no changes to revenue estimates. But that wasn’t the case, as revenue estimates had gone up as well, which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction.But as the chart above shows, we didn’t see much in positive revisions. In other words, while the overall growth picture remains very strong – there is no other way to describe +18.5% quarterly earnings growth - there is not much improvement in expectations for Q2 and beyond. The recent strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend.This flattish aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding, June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors. The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology, Energy, Medical, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Business Services, and Retail. Estimates have gone up the most for the Energy sector, reflecting momentum in oil prices. Excluding the gains made in the Energy sector, the aggregate revisions picture for the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q1.The Earnings Growth PeakThe chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters.Please note that while the Q2 growth pace represents a deceleration from the preceding quarter’s impressive level, the overall level of total earnings is in record territory, as the chart below shows.The two charts above provide different answers to the ‘peak earnings’ question. The first chart shows that the growth rate likely peaked in 2018 Q1, while dollar earnings aren’t expected to ‘peak’ till the last quarter of 2018. Even with respect to the growth rate, it is very much possible that final growth rates for Q2 and Q3 may surpass what we saw in Q1.We should keep in mind that this earnings cycle got underway back in 2009 when the U.S. economy got out of its last recession. By this time, earnings growth should have come down to the historical ‘normalized’ pace in the mid-single digits level. The reason we have these impressive growth numbers and positive revisions trend is thanks mostly to the effect of the tax cuts, which will start wearing off towards the end of 2019.In other words, earnings likely haven’t peaked yet. But with this cycle so long in tooth, we are steadily moving towards that stage.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

499,HPE,"Last week, Meg Whitman resigned as HPE CEO, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) was rumored to have a deal with Cerner, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google was caught secretly collecting user location data and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) formed a strategic alliance in China. Here are the details-Meg Whitman Resigns as CEO of HPEAfter a 6-year stint at the company she promised to turn around in 5, Meg Whitman is resigning from her position as CEO of HP Enterprise. She steps down on Feb. 1 and will be succeeded by Antonio Neri, who is an engineer with 22 years of experience working in various departments of the company.Back in 2014, Whitman split the company in two in the hopes that the two halves would operate more efficiently as separate units. True enough, the consumer hardware side, HP Inc, has shown signs of improvement although comparisons get tougher here on out. However, the HPE side that she heads directly hasn’t done as well as predicted, with the main problem being an inadequate level of innovation that hasn’t allowed the company to compete effectively.She has, however, picked up Aruba Networks and Nimble Storage along the way, both of which are contributing to its growth numbers today. She’s also stripped down the workforce, almost laying the ground for the engineering push Neri is likely to bring. “Antonio is a deep technologist,” Whitman told analysts. “I think I have added a lot of value here in terms of shareholder value creation, financial structuring, ignition of the innovation engine. But the next CEO of this company needs to be a deeper technologist.”The announcement took analysts by surprise since Whitman has previously denied her intention to leave, especially when Uber was reportedly pursuing her for the top job some time back. She has also said that much work remains to be done. The announcement was taken very badly by investors since it came alongside weaker-than-expected guidance on the back of results that topped expectations.Amazon Has Deal with CernerCNBC reports that Amazon has an agreement with Cerner, according to which the leading EHR company will deliver EHR services along with Amazon analytics at high speeds and accuracy to large healthcare organizations that operate on a very big scale. This will help Cerner expand geographically.Cerner’s HealtheIntent platform facilitates the gathering and retrieval of and access to patient electronic records (EHRs) including prescriptions to facilitate their analysis by hospitals and healthcare professionals, thereby reducing the cost and improving upon the outcome of treatment while also taking care of insurance claims. This is the service that will use AWS.Google Secretly Recording User LocationQuartz has revealed that from some time in the beginning of the year, Android devices have been sending Google location data even when location services were disabled. Google’s privacy policy contains a section on location data that reads as follows: “When you use Google services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.”This tracking was done through the Android OS by making changes to the Firebase Cloud Messaging service that runs on Android devices by default. So the data was collected irrespective of whether the phone was connected or not and whether it had a SIM installed or not.When confronted, Google said that the information was collected to manage messages and push notifications, and it had never used the information nor stored it. It also said that this location-data-harvesting system was separate from the one that was shared with advertisers, so customer privacy hadn’t been sacrificed.   Alibaba Cements Offline Strategy with Strategic AllianceAlibaba has bought 36.16% of China’s leading grocer (with around 8.2% market share, according to Kantar Worldpanel) and hypermarket store operator Sun Art for around $2.9 billion. For the purpose, Alibaba has partnered with French retailer Auchan, which is increasing its own stake in Sun Art to 36.18% and Taiwanese conglomerate Ruentex, which is selling most of its holding to Alibaba to retain 4.67%.For Alibaba, the goals of the partnership are to bring technology to Sun Art stores, grow its food retail footprint (the total food retail opportunity in China is $500 billion), facilitate a seamless omnichannel experience to Chinese customers and collect more data on them for its machine learnings purposes.As of June 30, 2017, Sun Art operated a gross floor area of approximately 12 million square meters in China. It currently operates 446 hypermarkets of 17,000 square meters each across 29 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in China. Its stores are branded “RT-Mart” and “Auchan” and “Auchan Minute” (for superstores and innovative unmanned stores).Alibaba has been investing in offline channels for some time now. The company has invested more than $9 billion dollars on physical stores over the past two years, including InTime, Suning and Lianhua. TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+0.17%+13.91%FB+1.78%+23.30%GOOGL+0.77%+9.58%MSFT+0.07%+21.64%INTC-1.97%+25.10%CSCO+1.70%+15.50%AMZN+4.28%+22.17% Other StoriesCorporateApple Removes Apps in China: Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), like several others, has removed several voice over internet protocol (VoIP) apps, including Microsoft’s Skype from the app store. The Chinese government has for some time been cracking down on apps that do not comply with government censorship rules and illegally reach users through their VoIP connections.An Apple spokeswoman said in this context, ""We have been notified by the Ministry of Public Security that a number of voice over internet protocol apps do not comply with local law, therefore these apps have been removed from the App Store in China” adding that “these apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.""Apple Assembling with Illegal Labor: No matter how much the iPhone X costs and how much profit it makes for the company, it appears that assembling the things requires illegal student overtime. Apple has always driven a hard bargain with its suppliers. In this case, Taiwan’s Foxconn, already hit by iPhone X production delays reportedly saw its profits drop 42% in the most recent quarter.Possibly to make good, the company hired student interns who worked 11 hours a day to qualify for their graduation degrees. Student overtime is illegal in the country and Foxconn has said that it has a policy not to let students work overtime. Moreover, its internship programs are carried out in cooperation with local governments and vocational schools in China.But in this case, the students worked voluntarily and were compensated and given benefits, mainly because the policy hadn’t been adopted in some parts of its operations. It has confirmed that such a thing wouldn’t happen again.New Products/TechnologyApple Self-Driving Car Research: Apple has published a paper on self-driving technology. The Nov 17 publication in online journal arXiv, written by researchers Yin Zhou and Oncel Tuzel describes advancements in 3D object detection. LiDAR takes a time of light approach, i.e. it shines light on an object and maps its return path to determine its shape and distance. Since it’s difficult to detect small or far-away objects in this way, the LiDAR system is paired with a camera, which however makes it more cumbersome.Apple’s researchers use complex computer vision and artificial intelligence to create a LiDAR-only system they call VoxelNet. They say that this system is more efficient and effective than the systems in use today.Apple SE 2 in 2018: According to media reports that quoted China’s Economic Daily News and MacRumors, Apple is set to launch the second version of iPhone SE, its low-end smartphone for emerging markets. The reports say that the phone will be assembled exclusively by Apple’s partner Wistron and will cost $450.So the launch of iPhone X and continuation of iPhone SE appear to be part of Apple’s strategy of expanding its product range to cater to a broader customer base. At the same time, it’s a way for Apple to benefit from higher volumes with the SE and greater profitability with the X. Apple remains a premium brand however since the SE is still more expensive than other low-end devices.Intel Could Increase iPhone Share in 2018: Well-known Apple analyst with a very good track record for breaking Apple News, Ming Ci Kuo estimates that Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) new modems will be in at least 70-80% of all iPhones next year. The XMM 7560 LTE modem is better than the currently-used XMM 7480 in terms of speed, power efficiency and compatibility with CDMA networks.Qualcomm’s new X20 LTE modem will also be an improvement over the currently-used X16, but Apple’s reluctance to use Qualcomm technology is not just about technology. It’s more about the souring relationship and the looming litigation between the two.Pixel Users Get Google Lens: Google Lens, the AI-powered visual search technology developed by Google, was initially announced in Google I/O 2017. Management said at the time that it would be integrated within Photos and Assistant in Pixel phones. But while some had seen it as part of Photos, the rollout to Assistant appears to be on now. Google says that the feature will be available in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, India and Singapore.  AWS Secret Region for U.S. Intelligence Service: Amazon has launched a separate cloud service for U.S. intelligentsia called Secret Region. The storage space will be accessible only to the U.S. intelligence community and users with a Secret U.S. security classification and contract vehicles for using the service.Amazon signed the CIA in 2013 for a $600 million deal, so what seems to be an expansion of services for intelligence services of the government is a huge validation of the security and secrecy offered by Amazon. According to Amazon,  ""With the launch of this new Secret Region, AWS becomes the first and only commercial cloud provider to offer regions to serve government workloads across the full range of data classifications, including Unclassified, Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret.""Collaborations and M&AApple Pay Deal with French Bank: Apple Pay, which enables secure payments in stores, within apps and on the Internet using built-in fingerprint scanning on iPhones for authorization, has at last signed on a major French bank. Apple launched the service in France a year ago and has signed on some smaller banks to date, including a startup online bank.Apple Acquires Vrvana: Vrvana, the company that blends AR and VR experiences in a single headset called Totem, has been acquired for an estimated $30 million, according to TechCrunch. The company’s extended reality headset differs from other competing technologies like Microsoft Hololens in that it uses a system of cameras to track a user’s relative position with respect to his environment, as well as a separate set to track his hand gestures instead of transparent, projection-based displays used in the Hololens.This has minimized latency to 3 milliseconds, thus greatly improving upon the experience. For comparison, Facebook’s Oculus aims to deliver a latency of 20 milliseconds. Latency is an important factor driving user experience because high latency destroys the immersive feel and also leads to motion sickness. Apple has said for long that AR is a very big deal and some have rumored that it will ship its own AR device in 2020. As always, Apple doesn’t comment on rumors.Some NumbersApple May Ship 4 Million HomePods in 2018: A Bloomberg report indicates that Apple will ship 4 million units when it launches in 2018. Amazon has sold 15 million Alexa units since the e-commerce giant launched them in 2015, according to CIRP LLC.Apple's device, however, focuses on sound quality, so there is a lot of speculation about its doubling as a music streaming device. It will have much fewer skills than competing digital home products from Amazon and Google, so it’s unlikely to be as useful. But Apple has a loyal customer base that usually laps up anything Apple has on offer, so they probably won’t grudge the $349 Apple intends to charge for the device.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

500,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 22. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this IT solution-providing company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last two quarters. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe acquisition of EMC Corporation (stylized as EMC) by Dell has been posing new challenges for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. With this acquisition, Dell has become one of the major players in the cloud services and data-storage market. EMC offers data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing, and other products and services that enable businesses to store, manage, protect, and analyze data.Additionally, VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) was EMC’s subsidiary that focuses on cloud and virtualization software and services for its parent company. Therefore, the acquisition of EMC, along with its privately-controlled structure, will provide Dell an unmatched scale, strength and flexibility to deepen its relationships with customers of all sizes.Apart from this, it also seems that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is losing market share to Dell in the server shipment. Notably, according to IDC, during third-quarter 2017, Dell managed to drastically narrow down the server shipment market-share difference with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, chiefly benefiting from “the strong synergy between its server team and the storage team incorporated from the EMC acquisition”.This happened mainly because Hewlett Packard Enterprise is now focusing on enterprise market and “pivoting away” from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which has been denting its short-term revenues. We believe this strategy will hurt Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.Since its split from HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been focusing on restructuring and realigning the company’s businesses to drive long-term sustainable growth and improvise margins. In doing so, the company has spun-off its Software and Enterprise Services business. The spin-offs will surely result in an unfavorable year-over-year comparison, which means disappointing top- as well bottom-line results for the fiscal first quarter.Moreover, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, in its previous earnings conference calls, had hinted that the company might continue to shrink with spin-offs. However, in our opinion, the company’s contrarian strategy might be in the right direction but the turnaround is still far behind as we haven’t seen any significant improvement in the recently-reported financial results. We also consider that the company is still struggling to determine its true business focus.Also, we consider that the company’s to-be-reported quarterly results will bear the brunt of the three main challenges it is currently facing — competitive pricing, heightened commodities pricing pressure and some dilution from M&A. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Hewlett Packard Enterprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 23 cents, representing a year-over-year plunge of 48.9%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $7.03 billion, down a massive 38.4% from the year-ago quarter.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteA Stock With Favorable CombinationHere is a company which, as per our model, has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc.

501,HPE,"At times, it is prudent to retain certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors need to retain if they are looking to reap long-term gains. Though the stock faces several headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.Further, during the year-to-date period, the stock has gained 0.01%, against the industry’s loss of 3.9%.What’s Going in HPE’ Favor?HPE reported modest fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The company’s non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 29 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents and also came toward the higher end of management’s guidance range of 26-30 cents. Further, the figure jumped 26.1% on a year-over-year basis.The better-than-expected bottom-line performance was primarily owing to cost savings, lower tax rate, favorable other income and expense as well as transactions in connection with Software-spin merger.HPE reported revenues from continuing operations (which includes Enterprise Group and Financial Services) of $7.660 billion, up 4.6% from the year-earlier quarter’s revenues of $7.324 billion.We consider that divestment of Software division is in best interest of HPE. The company has sold this division to British firm, Micro Focus, in a cash-stock deal worth $8.8 billion. HPE has received $2.5 billion in cash and the remaining consideration in the form of a 50.1% stake in the combined company. The software division generated fiscal 2016 revenues of $3.2 billion, down 11.8% from fiscal 2015 level. Moreover, it includes the highly controversial Autonomy acquisition that was mostly written down by the current CEO Meg Whitman.It also includes other buyouts like Mercury Interactive and Vertica. Consequently, by selling assets which are not doing well and have limited growth potential, the company will be able to mobilize resources to the fast-growing areas of the cloud such as software defined networks (SDN), and converged and hyper-converged infrastructure.Moreover, the stock looks attractive from a valuation perspective. This is because HPE currently trades at a forward P/E of 11.18x compared with the industry group average of 76.30x, which signifies a huge upward potential.The stock’s long-term earnings per share growth rate is 6.6% and it carries a VGM Style Score of A.Concerns RemainIn a sudden move, Meg Whitman has decided to step down as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of HPE, leaving the company in the middle of its restructuring phase to cut costs and focus on high-margin businesses.Whitman has been replaced by Antonio Neri who also serves as the current president of HPE.  Whitman will continue to function as a member of Board of Directors. Antonio will function as the CEO of HPE effective from Feb 1, 2018.Moreover, the company issued a disappointing bottom-line guidance for first-quarter 2018. HPE expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 20-24 cents (mid-point: 22 cents), which was lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.The company also provided outlook for  2018. HPE expects non-GAAP earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $1.15-$1.25 (mid-point $1.2). The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $1.17.We remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from unfavorable currency exchange movements, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues. These headwinds are expected to thwart overall performance in the near term.Further, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain other concerns. Competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) adds to woes.Our TakeWe are encouraged by the company’s massive restructuring initiatives. On one hand, it is offloading low-margin business such as Software, which, in our opinion, will improve the company’s margins over the long run. On the other hand, it is enhancing capabilities in the hybrid IT model as evident from the recent agreements to acquire SimpliVity and Cloud Cruiser. We believe the company’s focus on hybrid IT model will drive growth over the long run.We expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat even amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest investors to hold on to the stock at the moment.Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA has a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11.2%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

502,HPE,"Both the Dow and S&P 500 closed in the red on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq finished an all time high. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes released on Wednesday indicated that a rate hike is almost certain in December, but stated that only one or two rate hikes were likely in 2018. Prospects of a slower pace of rate hikes next year weighed on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, gains in telecom and energy stocks had a positive impact on markets. U.S. markets were closed on Thursday following Thanksgiving holiday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.3%, to close at 23,526.18.

On Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. The CBOE VIX increased 1.5% to close at 9.88.Fed Minutes Hints at Softer Rate Hike Pace, HP CEO to Step Down In the minutes of Oct. 31 - Nov. 1 FOMC policy meeting, Fed officials ascertained a December rate hike. However, some policymakers showed concerns over “persistent” slowdown in inflation and hinted that the central bank may scale back to one or at two rate increases next year, which was lower than the previously expected three rate hikes. Moderate pace of future tightening weighed on investor sentiment, which in turn pulled majority indexes downward.Additionally, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company’s (HPE  -  Free Report) shares fell 7.2% after the company reported a weak fiscal first quarter earnings outlook. Also, the company’s CEO Meg Whitman announced that she will step down in February, which also weighed on the Hewlett Packard’s share performance. Hewlett Packard was the worst performing stock among the S&P 500 companies on Wednesday. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

503,HPE,"The markets bounced back strong from last week’s sell-off, and despite renewed concerns about the possibility of rising inflation, investors jumped back into stocks—causing Wall Street’s major indexes to regain some much of the losses suffered during the recent correction.And whatever the case may be with inflation, we know that an improved global economy and impressive Q4 earnings results should help the broader market move higher for now. The latest earnings season is nearing its completion, and among the 362 S&P 500 members that have reported results, earnings are up 14.5% year-over-year on 9% higher revenues.With that said, a number of marquee reports remain to be released, and these newer results could help set the tone as inflation fears begin to creep back into the market.Investors should remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected most-important reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of February 19!1.       Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report)Discount supermarket behemoth Walmart is scheduled to release its latest quarterly report before the market opens on Feb. 20. This stock tends to serve as a bellwether for the consumer economy, so investors will definitely want to pay close attention to its results. Shares of WMT have gained about 7% over the past 12 weeks.WMT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect the company to report earnings of $1.36 per share and revenues of $135.04 billion, which would represent growth of 4.6% and 3.1%, respectively. The key to any potential surprise will be Walmart’s continued e-commerce growth, with an emphasis on margin expansion in this segment. 2.       The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report)Home improvement retailer Home Depot is slated to report its latest quarterly results before the opening bell on Feb. 20. With a strong economy and housing market throughout the country, logic would imply that Home Depot could be ready to post an impressive report, but the exact details will be revelatory regardless. Share of HD have gained 8% within the past 12 weeks.HD is holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) heading into its report date. According to our latest consensus estimates, the company is projected to post earnings of $1.62 per share and revenues of $23.67 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 12.5% and 6.6%, respectively. 3.       Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report)Hewlett Packard Enterprise is slated to release its latest earnings report after the bell on Feb. 22. Things have been relatively up and down for HPE since its split from the former Hewlett-Packard Company in late-2015. Still, the company is coming off two-straight earnings beats, and a recent spin-off could help improve margins.Nevertheless, HPE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). According to our latest consensus estimates, HPE is poised to post earnings of 23 cents per share and revenues of $7.03 billion. During the third-quarter of fiscal 2017, the company sold its Software business to British firm Micro Focus, so the most important year-over-year comparison for investors to keep an eye on will be in the net margin category. Want more analysis from this author?

504,HPE,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), yesterday, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced that its board of directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $4 billion. However, management stated that the timing and number of shares to be bought will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors.The latest approval is in addition to the company’s existing authorization, wherein approximately $1.2 billion worth balance remaining as of Apr 30, 2018.This apart, management also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 13.93 cents per share to be paid on Oct 3 to shareholders of record date as of Sep 12, 2018.HP has a steady track record of returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payouts. The company, since its split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), has returned approximately $2 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments.The company’s strong balance sheet and cash flow provide it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives, and scope for product innovation and expansion in newer markets. The company ended second-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of nearly $4.25 billion and generated more than $2 billion of cash flows from operating activities in the first half of the fiscal.Some other companies that have a consistent track record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments include Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report).We believe such initiatives not only enhance shareholders’ return, but also raise the market value of a stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, HP remains confident on its growth potential, thereby raising hope for further improvement in shareholder value.HP Inc. Price HP Inc. Price | HP Inc.

505,HPE,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) has expanded its partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in server storage. The companies will join forces to demonstrate U.3 reference platform, SFF-TA-1001 at HPE Discover. The U.3 universal drive cage will feature Toshiba U.3 enabled SAS, SATA and NVMe drives.The move marks Broadcom’s intents to further strengthen its ties with HPE by including Broadcom 24-port RAID controller to the HPE ProLiant Gen10 server family. HPE’s Smart Array P824i-p MR SAS controller furnishes an ideal solution for storage servers. The controller provides flexible, expander-less storage suitable for high drive count as in HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10.U.3 technology enables SSDs (SATA, SAS and NVMe) and HDDs (SATA and SAS) to function in a single bay. It renders the practice of wiring multiple protocols redundant, consequently simplifying the processes.Broadcom remains committed in providing the customers with robust application uptime and data protection. The customers are likely to gain significantly from the extended Broadcom enabled HPE server storage solutions. Lower costs, simplifying complexity, enhanced drive as well as storage flexibility and improved performance are the key benefits.We believe the company’s strengthening collaboration with HPE makes it well poised to expand data center server storage capabilities. We believe an expanding RAID portfolio bodes well for Broadcom in the long run.Additionally, per a Technavio report, global RAID controller card market revenues are projected to reach $2.9 billion by 2021. This report reinforces our belief regarding the potential of the company’s RAID solutions.Shares of Broadcom have returned 8.6% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s rally of 7.6%.Bottom LineBroadcom is benefiting from robust demand of its wireless solutions and expanding product portfolio. It makes the company well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G.However, investors are cautious regarding the customer concentration woes and intensifying competition in most of the markets in which the company operates.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBroadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc.

506,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein non-GAAP earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues fell short of the same. However, on a year-over-year basis, both marked a robust improvement mainly driven by the merger of the Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report).Notably, in 2016 Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into a spin-off-merger agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation, wherein it agreed to spin-off its Enterprise Services division and merge the same with the latter’s businesses. The transaction closed on Apr 1, 2017, and the new entity was named DXC Technology.Coming back to the fiscal third-quarter results, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99 and also increased on a year-over-year basis.DXC Technology Company. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteQuarter DetailsRevenues in the quarter soared a whopping 222.7% from the year-ago period to $6.186 billion. However, excluding the impact of purchase price accounting and last year’s one-time contract reset United States Public Sector (USPS), revenues were down 4%. On a constant-currency basis, revenues fell 5.9% year over year. DXC Technology’s revenues also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.228 billion.Segment wise, revenues from Global Business Services (GBS) surged a massive 121.3% on a year-over-year basis to $2.315 billion. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, on constant currency basis, revenues decreased 6.6% year over year. The decline was primarily due to weak performance of traditional application services which was partially offset by growth at Enterprise Applications and Business Process Services businesses. Revenues from the new business for GBS came in at $3.3 billion during the reported quarter.Global Infrastructure Services (GIS) revenues during the fiscal third quarter came in at $3.145 billion as compared with $871 million reported in the year-ago quarter. On constant currency basis, revenues dropped 6.8% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting), primarily due to decline in traditional infrastructure services. Revenues from new business for GIS awards came in at $2.2 billion during the quarter.USPS revenues came in at $726 million during the quarter, however were down 11.9% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting). Revenues from new business for USPS awards came in at $527 million in the quarter.The company’s adjusted operating income from continuing operations (excluding one-time items) amounted to $927 million as compared with $626 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin came in at 15% as compared with 9.5% reported in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted net income from continuing operations came in at $622 million during the quarter as compared with $416 million reported in the year-earlier period.The company exited the quarter with $2.926 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared with $2.671 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt balance (net of current maturities) was $6.367 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine-month period ended Dec 31, 2017, came in at $2.542 billion. Adjusted free cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 came in at $1.870 billion. During this period, the company returned $189 million to shareholders through share buyback and dividend payments.Updated Fiscal 2018 OutlookThe company reaffirmed fiscal 2018 revenues guidance but increased its outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share. For fiscal 2018, DXC Technology projects its revenues in the range of $24-$24.5 billion in constant currency. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $24.32 billion.However, the non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range has been raised to $7.50-$8.00 from $7.25-$7.75 anticipated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $7.52 per share.Bottom LineThe company’s upbeat guidance for earnings makes us optimistic about its near-term performance.Post merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. This alliance has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology might be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio, which is likely to drive growth over the long run. Further, the company is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1.1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.6 billion at the end of the same.Currently, DXC Technology has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is GTT Communications, Inc.

507,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8. Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017.So, this will be the second quarterly result of the combined business. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.99, representing a year-over-year increase of a whopping 145.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been revised upward over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $6.23 billion, up a massive 224.9% from the year-ago quarter.DXC Technology’s fiscal third-quarter result is likely to benefit from CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services business merger, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. However, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company’s profitability, offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteLet’s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail.Combined Entities Opened Up Avenues of GrowthPost merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.It is anticipated that the combined entity will generate revenues of approximately $26 billion. Also, DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Notably, the company had registered a 229% surge in the fiscal second-quarter revenues chiefly benefiting from the merger. The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology’s fiscal third-quarter top-line performance as well.Enhancing Customer Base with PartnershipsThe company’s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud-computing market is likely to aid fiscal third-quarter results. The company, in August 2017, collaborated with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) and launched the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next-generation hybrid-cloud platform.It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT&T and HCL. It has also joined forces with Amazon to develop cloud-based solutions for enterprise and public-sector clients. In addition, it has entered into cloud-partnership agreement with IBM and SAP as well. These alliances have increased the company’s access to advanced technology, backed innovative product development and creation of new markets.Furthermore, it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility, social networking and big data facilities. This, in turn, is likely to expand DXC Technology’s customer base and help garner additional revenues.Buyouts to Generate Additional RevenuesFollowing the footsteps of CSC, DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth. Since its formation, the company has announced two acquisitions — Tribridge and Logicalis SMC. While it completed the Tribridge buyout in July last year, the Logicalis SMC acquisition is still in process.Tribridge is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft’s Dynamics 365, which explains why this acquisition makes sense for DXC Technology. Therefore, this buyout is likely to benefit the company’s to-be-reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues.Rising Interest Costs to Dent ProfitabilityFlaring up interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company’s profitability. As of Sep 30, 2017, DXC has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.33 billion, while it paid $154 million as interest expenses during the first half of fiscal 2018, which was 185% higher than the first half of fiscal 2017 tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt has significantly increased this fiscal. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby escalating its interest-cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

508,HPE,"DXC Technology (DXC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is providing Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report) with a new “human resources (HR) and payroll deployment” system meant for enterprises with an employee range of 3,500 to 15,000.Per the press release, this service is “a fixed-price, preconfigured deployment of Workday Human Capital Management (HCM) and Workday Payroll” and can be seamlessly integrated into the ongoing operations of an enterprise.Workday is one of the leading providers of cloud-based HCM and financial management software solutions.

Thus, the need for cloud-based deployment of HCM and payroll services is increasing.Per a recent report by Gartner, the worldwide public cloud service is expected to reach $411.4 billion by 2020. We believe that with cloud computing being one of the major revenue generating sectors of DXC, expansion of the related client base will be beneficial for the company’s top line. This will help it to make the most of the growth opportunity in the market.DXC Technology Company. Price DXC Technology Company. Price | DXC Technology Company. QuoteOther Strategic Initiatives of DXCDXC Technology was formed following the merger of Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was completed on Apr 1, 2017.  The combined entity has become a prominent end-to-end IT services providing company.Apart from cloud computing, the company is steadily focusing on its cyber and Big Data business. Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology is making strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio, which is likely to drive growth in the long run. Since its formation, the company has announced two acquisitions that of Tribridge and Logicalis SMC.Apart from buyouts, the company expanded its ties with VMware at VMworld 2017. The two entities are coming together to debut the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next generation hybrid cloud platform.In October 2017, the company announced the spin-off of its U.S. Public Sector (USPS) business, and subsequent merger of the same with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions.Upon completion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares and $1.05 billion of cash from USPS. Per the agreement, the deal will be structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, making it tax-free for DXC Technology and its shareholders.We believe all these initiatives are helping the company to strengthen its position in a highly competitive industry including the likes of Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) and International Business Machines.DXC Technology has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

509,HPE,"In a sudden move, Meg Whitman has decided to step down as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), leaving the company in the middle of its restructuring phase to cut costs and focus on high-margin businesses. The move led to deep unrest among investors, causing shares to plunge around 7% on Nov 22.Coming to the price performance, the stock has lost 3.1% in the past year, wider than the industry’s decline of 2%.Whitman has been replaced by Antonio Neri who also serves as the current president of HPE.  Whitman will continue to function as a member of Board of Directors in HPE. Antonio will function as the CEO of HPE effective from Feb 1, 2018. Whitman, who will sign off as the CEO stated, ""Antonio's ready, the company's ready, and it's the right time.""She further added, ""Neri has been with the company since 1995, working his way up to the company's top ranks.”Whitman has served the company since 2011 and successfully witnessed the company’s split into two. In fact, under Whitman’s leadership, HPE has achieved a major milestone in becoming a stronger, more focused company, which can compete and win in today’s market.Under Whitman’s leadership, the company restored its balance sheet, strengthened operations and enhanced customer satisfaction.  Post separation from HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), the company also made innovative moves to focus and strengthen portfolio. Moreover, Whitman orchestrated the spin off and mergers of HPE’s Enterprise Services and Software businesses, as well as strategic acquisitions including Aruba, SGI, SimpliVity and Nimble Storage.HPE’s TroubleRecently, the company reported not-so encouraging fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny while the top line missed the same. Moreover, the view provided by the company was also not worth an applause.HPE expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 20-24 cents (mid-point: 22 cents), which was lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.The company also provided outlook for fiscal 2018. HPE expects non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.15-$1.25 (mid-point $1.2). The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $1.17.We remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to the three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from unfavorable currency exchange movements, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.Further, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain other concerns. Competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) adds to its woes.Moving ForwardNeri, in his new role, will continue to focus on strategic initiatives, key customer relationships and technology development. In our opinion, if any one that could succeed Whtiman, the name is Antonio. Neri’s appointment is a sound choice, given his profound experience in the company over the years. We expect the new CEO of HPE to better understand the overall strengths and weaknesses of the business as he has in-depth knowledge of the market dynamics.Currently, HPE carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

510,HPE,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) has come up with another quarter of stellar performance. The company reported better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 and revenues increased for the fifth-consecutive quarter after an extended period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments have improved for the third-straight quarter after 2010.In fact, the company’s outstanding results for the last few quarters substantiate  that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) coupled with restructuring initiatives is finally paying off for HP.HP’s total revenues increased 11% year over year to $13.927 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.246 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments along with the successful launch of products.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 44 cents per share matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure came toward the higher-end of management’s earlier guidance range of 42-45 cents. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP earnings improved 22.2%.Despite reporting better-than-expected results and strong top-line growth, shares of HP have declined over 5.5% during yesterday’s after-hours trading. The downturn was owing to the company’s soft first-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings guidance range, which at mid-point is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Moreover, Meg Whitman, CEO of its sister company, HPE, announced her retirement yesterday. During her six-year tenure, she initiated a number of turnaround strategy but most of them failed to gain traction. We believe the news might have turned investors a little cautious.Consequently, HP’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. While the stock has been up 44.7%, the industry to which it belongs gained 46%.Quarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $9.084 billion, up 13% year over year.  While commercial revenues increased 11%, consumer revenues were up 18%.Printing revenues were up 7% year over year to $4.877 billion, primarily owing to a 10% increase in supplies revenues. HP’s total hardware unit sales grew 3% backed by Consumer hardware units increase of 3%. Commercial hardware units, however, remained flat on a year-over-year basis.Region wise, revenues from Americas were up 10% year over year. While revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) grew 11%, the same from the Asia Pacific and Japan region increased 16% year over year, all in constant currency.However, gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 18.1%, primarily due to elevated commodity costs of Personal Systems. This was partially offset by better margin in the printing segment backed by improved productivity and higher supplies mix.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year over year to $1.5 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations remained flat year over year at 7%. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $749 million compared with $614 million reported a year ago.HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.997 billion compared with $6.967 billion in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $6.747 billion compared with $6.744 billion last quarter.The company generated cash flow of $680 million from operational activities during the quarter. HP repurchased shares worth $501 million and paid dividends worth $221 million, in the same time frame.During fiscal 2017, operating cash flow came in at $3.677 billion while the company paid $894 million as cash dividend and bought back shares worth $1.412 billion.GuidanceHP raised its earnings guidance range for fiscal 2018. The company now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the band of $1.75-$1.85 (previously $1.74-$1.84). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.78 per share.For the fiscal first quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 40-43 cents per share (mid-point: 41.5 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 42 cents.Our TakeWe are impressed by the performance of HP’s PC segment, wherein the year-over-year increase can be attributed to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues. Additionally, the company’s  efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. Meanwhile, the company is working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.The latest PC shipment data by IDC depicts that HP’s restructuring initiatives such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs are paying off. Per the data compiled by IDC, the company witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the sixth quarter in a row, after registering decline for five consecutive quarters.With the start of shipping A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP is likely to revive its printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Also, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns. Competition from the likes of International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) adds to its woes.HP currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

511,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) reported modest fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny while the top line missed the same.The company’s non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 29 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents and also came toward the higher end of management’s guidance range of 26-30 cents. Further, the figure jumped 26.1% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 23 cents from continuing operations, compared with 19 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, it compared favorably with the guided range of a breakeven to earnings of 4 cents.The better-than-expected bottom-line performance was primarily owing to cost savings, lower tax rate, favorable other income and expense as well as transactions in connection with Software-spin merger.Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company closed the spin-merger of its Enterprise Services business. Consequently, Hewlett Packard considers Enterprise Services as a discontinued operation since the fiscal second quarter, and the year-ago quarter’s results have also been adjusted accordingly.Additionally, the company completed the pending spin-merger of its Software business in the fiscal third quarter. Per the company, this quarter “represents adjustment to net periodic pension cost resulting from remeasurements of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise pension plans in connection with the spin-off of the software business, Seattle SpinCo, Inc., and the merger of Seattle SpinCo, Inc. with Micro Focus International plc and the spin-off of the enterprise services business, Everett SpinCo, Inc., and the merger of Everett SpinCo, Inc. with Computer Sciences Corporation.”Before diving into the quarter’s details, it is to be noted that the company in its separate press release announced that its current CEO Meg Whitman will step down, but will remain on the HPE Board of Directors. Effective from Feb 1, 2018, current President Antonio Neri will become president and CEO of the company.Following the news, shares of HPE declined more than 5% in after-hours trading, on Nov 21. Moreover, tepid earnings guidance for first quarter and fiscal 2018 negatively impacted the share price.Quarter in DetailRevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues from continuing operations (which includes Enterprise Group and Financial Services) of $7.660 billion, up 4.6% from the year-earlier quarter’s revenues of $7.324 billion. However, quarterly revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.714 billion.Adjusted for currency exchange rates and divestures, the company’s revenues from continuing operations were up 11% year over year.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance in the Americas stayed constant mainly due to steady core compute and higher networking which was offset to some extent by softer organic storage results. Revenues in Europe grew mid-single digit driven by higher networking and growth in Germany, France and Iberia. Asia-Pacific witnessed strong core server sales, with growth in Japan, Australia, India and China.Segment wise, revenues at the Enterprise Group was almost flat from the year-ago quarter to $6.852 billion. Adjusting for divestures and currency, segment revenues were up 1% year over year. Revenues from Servers were down 5%, Storage, Networking and Technology Services were up 5%, 21% and 2%, respectively.Financial Services revenues were up 24% to $1.010 Billion. The segment’s net portfolio grew 1%, but financing volume was flat year over year.Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise’s gross margin contracted 210 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 29.7%. This year-over-year contraction was mainly due to competitive pricing, elevated DRAM pricing and unfavorable currency.Moreover, the company’s non-GAAP operating margin descended 100 bps to 8.2%, primarily due to a lower gross margin, which was partially offset by a decline in non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Fiscal 2017 HighlightsHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues for fiscal 2017 from continuing operations of $28.871 billion, down 4.7% year over year.The company’s non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 96 cents per share lagged management’s guidance range of $1.36-$1.40. Moreover, the figure decreased 11.9% on a year-over-year basis.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended the fiscal fourth quarter with $9.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from $7.8 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt at the quarter end was $10.182 billion compared with $14.527 billion recorded in the last quarter.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise generated $826 million of cash flow from operational activities. Free cash flow was $370 million. For the 12 months ended of Oct 31, 2017, the company generated $889 million of cash flow for operational activities.Additionally, during the reported quarter, the company returned $725 million to shareholders, of which $620 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.

514,HPE,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) recently announced that Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s (HPE  -  Free Report) new ProLiant DL385 Gen10 server, which is powered by AMD’s EPYC processor has set new records across SPECrate2017_fp_base and SPECfp_rate2006.Notably, HPE Cloudline CL3150 server already uses EPYC processors. Enriched with 8-core to 32-core designing, eight channels of memory and support for high-speed I/O with 128 lanes of PCIe 3, AMD EPYC processors are well poised to cater to memory bandwidth requirement of this typical HPE server.We believe this to be a positive for AMD’s top line, which increased 26% year over year and 34% sequentially to $1.64 billion in third-quarter 2017. The quarterly revenue figure was also the highest since 2011.The ramp up of the company’s EPYC datacenter processors sale to cloud and OEM customers boosted server revenues during the quarter. Companies like Tencent and JD.com are planning to deploy the company’s EPYC processors. Moreover, Baidu and Microsoft also announced plans of deploying EPYC based products in their hyperscale environment, which is another positive for AMD. Growth DriversAMD primarily has two reportable segments — Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities) and Computing and Graphics (focused on the traditional PC market).The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment saw a 46% sequential increase, primarily driven by semi-custom revenues. The trend is expected to continue in the holiday season.AMD’s Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors backed Computing and Graphics segment’s third-quarter revenues that increased 74% from the year-ago quarter. Solid demand for the expanded Ryzen processor family in the desktop market was another tailwind. Notably, the availability of Ryzen Threadripper processors has enabled AMD to re-enter the high end desktop market.The company’s release of Vega-based GPUs and increasing demand for its Polaris products in both gaming and blockchain industries were positives for the top line as well. Additionally, better performance of the recently launched Radeon RX Vega family of GPUs aimed at gaming enthusiasts is anticipated to be beneficial for the company.Notably, the company entered into a partnership with Baidu during the quarter to focus on “optimizing” software for AMD’s Radeon Instinct GPUs at Baidu datacenters. Moreover, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Web Services announced that it is powering Amazon AppStream 2.0 with AMD Radeon Pro technology, aimed at driving cloud delivery of virtual applications.We believe these launches and partnerships will drive the company’s top line, thereby providing AMD with a competitive edge against peers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

515,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) has been an investor favorite, courtesy of its spin-off initiatives, strategic deals and partnerships.Investor confidence in the stock is evident from its price momentum. DXC Technology stock has gained 61.6% over the past year, substantially outperforming the 40.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at the key aspects aiding the company’s performance.The FormationDXC Technology was formed following the merger of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was completed on Apr1, 2017.  The combined entity has become the world’s second-largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc.The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom and expanded the avenues of growth for the combined company.Focused SegmentsDXC Technology focuses on the cyber business, cloud computing market and Big Data.Organizations are transitioning to cloud at an accelerated pace. According to Gartner’s latest report, at 2016-end total market size of SaaS was approximately $144 billion. However, during the year, total cloud shift to SaaS was just $36 billion. This means that the segment is still underpenetrated. Therefore, DXC Technology is expected to benefit from this untapped opportunity.AcquisitionsFollowing the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology is making strategic acquisitions to enhance portfolio, which is likely to drive growth in the long run. Since its formation, the company has announced two acquisitions that of Tribridge and Logicalis SMC.The integration of Logicalis SMC business will fortify DXC Technology’s position as a leading global software integrator for ServiceNow (NOW  -  Free Report). Tribridge is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft’s Dynamics 365, which explains why this acquisition is crucial for DXC Technology.PartnershipsApart from buyouts, the company expanded ties with VMware at VMworld 2017. The two entities are coming together to debut the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next generation hybrid cloud platform. This contract will enable DXC Technology’s clients to run VMware software (vSphere, Virtual SAN and NSX) on Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deliver enhanced performance for networking customers.Spin-OffThe company recently announced the spin-off of its U.S. Public Sector (USPS) business, and subsequent merger of the same with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions.Upon completion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares and $1.05 billion of cash from USPS. Per the agreement, the deal will be structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, making it tax-free for DXC Technology and its shareholders.To ConcludeOwing to all the positives mentioned above, the company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.5% and a VGM Score of A.

516,HPE,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) India recently launched a Customer Experience Center (CEC) in Gurugram powered by Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). The center will showcase smart city solutions based on Internet of Things (IoT) related technologies.HPE’s partners and customers will get a firsthand experience of the technologies that aid the development of smart-city related projects throughout India.The demonstrations will include the likes of “eHealth Center, Public WiFi, City Surveillance, Integrated Command and Control Center, and Solid Waste Management”, per the press release.The government of India is in the process of establishing around 100 smart cities across the country. Per Som Satsangi, MD - India, HPE, this launch is anticipated to accelerate the government’s “smart city strategy”, which will prove beneficial for providers of smart solutions like HPE.This will, in turn, boost investors’ confidence and help the company to rebound. It has underperformed the industry over the past year. Notably, HPE stock has lost 30.8% in a year, underperforming the 7.7% decline of the industry it belongs to. Other IoT InitiativesHewlett Packard Enterprise views Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) as the next major market. In June 2016, the company entered into a partnership with GE Digital, a unit of General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) to develop products for Industrial IoT.The integration of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s IoT technologies and GE's industrial expertise and its Predix platform has been beneficial for the industry as well as for Hewlett Packard’s total addressable market (TAM).Per MarketsandMarkets, the industrial IoT market is anticipated to reach $195.47 billion by 2022 from $113.71 billion in 2015 at a CAGR of 7.89%. We believe HPE’s presence in the IoT market coupled with its ongoing initiatives like the one discussed above will help it better tap the growth opportunity.However, industrial IoT is highly competitive with the presence of players like GE, Intel, Cisco Systems, International Business Machines and others. This remains a concern for the company.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderHewlett Packard Enterprise has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A top-ranked stock in the same sector is Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

517,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is on track to complete its planned spin-off of the U.S. Public Sector (USPS) business, and subsequently merge the same with the company’s pending acquisitions of Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions ahead of time. This is because the company has been granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act) by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).The HSR Act seeks to ensure due filing of all documents necessary for mergers, acquisitions and transfer of assets or securities by companies with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice.Notably, the three companies have come together to form a publicly-traded IT service-providing entity, primarily to the U.S. government. Vencore and KeyPoint are owned by private-equity firm Veritas Capital.Transaction DetailsPer the agreement, the deal will be structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, thereby making the entire transaction tax free for DXC Technology and its shareholders.Upon completion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares. Along with this, the company will receive $1.05 billion of cash from USPS, upon completion of the spin-off. The proceeds from USPS are intended to be used for debt repayments, share buyback and other general corporate purposes.On the other hand, Veritas Capital will receive approximately 14% shareholding and a cash consideration of $400 million on completion of the entire transaction.The current president and CEO of Vencore — Mac Curtis — will hold the position of chief executive officer of the new company, while Marilyn Crouther, senior vice president and general manager, DXC USPS, will serve as the chief operating officer. Mike Lawrie chairman, president and CEO of DXC, will chair the board of the new entity, while names for other positions will be decided later.Reason for the DealPer the company, the IT services market for both commercial and the U.S. public sectors has been evolving at an accelerating pace. Therefore, DXC Technology’s latest spin-merger move is anticipated to provide it a customized approach toward handling two different types of clients. On the successful formation, the new entity will become one of the top five IT services providers to the U.S. government.Furthermore, it should be noted that Vencore is well known for providing cyber security, engineering, analytics and other IT solutions to the federal government, while KeyPoint is specialized in offering investigative services to a wide range of sectors, including federal, defense, intelligence and civilian sectors.Hence, per the company, the above-mentioned transaction is likely to fortify its capabilities in “offering differentiated, mission-driven solutions in cybersecurity, big data analytics, cloud engineering, enterprise IT services, and systems engineering – all enabled by a portfolio of cutting-edge Intellectual Property (IP).”The reinforced capabilities will help the new company win government contracts, in turn bringing in more revenues, in our opinion.Boosting Shareholders’ WealthThe latest move comes just months after DXC Technology came into existence in April this year. Notably, the company is a result of the merger of the Computer Sciences and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The transaction has enhanced shareholders’ value of both companies. Additionally, it has opened up new opportunities for driving the company’s growth.Therefore, we believe the recent spin-merger transaction of the USPS business will not only boost DXC Technology’s shareholders’ value in the near term, but will also continue to create wealth over the long run.Since its first trading on Apr 4, 2017, DXC Technology has gained 37.2%, significantly outperforming the industry’s return of 26%.Currently, DXC Technology flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.A couple of other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), both sporting the same Zacks Rank as DXC Technology.NVIDIA and Micron have expected long-term EPS growth rates of 10.3% and 10%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

518,HPE,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) has laid off around 1,100 employees post its buyout of Brocade Communication Systems. The acquisition worth $5.5 billion was completed in November 2017. Notably, the deal bolstered Broadcom’s position in the storage area networking space.Further retrenchment may be in order after the company evaluates its resources. The San Jose, CA based chipmaker might restructure the company’s business accordingly and bring about the desired reduction in costs.Per Reuters, Broadcom has spent $143 million in its first two fiscal 2018 quarters in restructuring charges, majorly comprising employee termination costs. The company is likely to pay a significant amount of its employee termination costs in its current quarter.Shares of Broadcom have returned 15.7% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 18.7%.Recent DevelopmentsBroadcom recently strengthened its partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) in server storage. The companies will collaborate to demonstrate U.3 reference platform, SFF-TA-1001 at HPE Discover. The U.3 universal drive cage will feature Toshiba U.3 facilitated SAS, SATA and NVMe drives.Broadcom also announced that it has developed the approved SFF-TA-1005 Universal Backplane Management (“UBM”) specification. The company developed the platform co-sponsored by HPE, Dell EMC and 19 other members. The platform will enhance simplicity and provide clarity to the management of SATA, SAS and NVMe drives.We believe Broadcom’s collaborations poise it well to expand data center server storage capabilities. We believe an expanding portfolio bodes well for Broadcom in the long run.Upbeat Q2, View PositiveBroadcom put up an impressive second-quarter fiscal 2018 show, in the past week. Both earnings and revenues surpassed estimates. The company delivered earnings of $4.88 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents. The figure improved 32.2% from the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP revenues from continuing operations came in at $5.014 billion, up 20% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the figure came ahead of Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.003 billion.The company also provided promising revenue guidance. For third-quarter fiscal 2018, Broadcom forecasts non-GAAP revenues of almost $5.05 billion (+/- $75 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.06 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13.3%.Impact of the Restructuring Processes on MarginsBroadcom’s focus on networking products from cloud and data centers as well and broadband access products is helping it to accelerate gross profit. In second-quarter 2018, gross margin increased 330 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 66.6% in the quarter.We believe the company’s cost minimizing initiatives are likely to positively impact margins going forward.Northbound RevisionsBroadcom is witnessing positive revisions. In the past seven days, third-quarter fiscal 2018 estimates witnessed 10 upward revisions against merely one in the other direction, resulting in the Zacks Consensus Estimate rising from $4.61 to $4.83 per share. The figure represents a year-over-year earnings growth of 17.8%.To ConcludeBroadcom is benefiting from robust demand of its wireless solutions and expanding product portfolio. Increasing collaborations as well as initiatives in reducing costs hold promise.However, customer concentration woes and intensifying competition witnessed across most of the markets in which the company operates remain concerns.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBroadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc.

519,HPE,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) strengthened its partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in server storage. The companies will collaborate to demonstrate U.3 reference platform, SFF-TA-1001 at HPE Discover. The U.3 universal drive cage will feature Toshiba U.3 facilitated SAS, SATA and NVMe drives.U.3 technology enables SSDs (SATA, SAS and NVMe) and HDDs (SATA and SAS) to function in a single bay. It renders the practice of wiring multiple protocols redundant, consequently simplifying the processes.Broadcom remains committed in providing the customers with robust application uptime and data protection. The customers are likely to gain significantly from the new Broadcom enabled HPE server storage solutions. Lower costs, simplifying complexity, enhanced drive as well as storage flexibility and improved performance are the key benefits.Notably, Broadcom’s 24-port RAID controller was also added to the HPE ProLiant Gen10 server family. HPE’s Smart Array P824i-p MR SAS controller furnishes an ideal solution for storage servers. The controller provides flexible, expander-less storage suitable for high drive count as in HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10.We believe Broadcom’s strengthening collaboration with HPE makes it well positioned to expand its data center server storage capabilities. We believe an expanding RAID portfolio bodes well for Broadcom in the long run.Additionally, per a Technavio report, global RAID controller card market revenues are projected to reach $2.9 billion by 2021. This report reinforces our belief regarding the potential of the company’s RAID solutions.Shares of Broadcom have returned 11.1% in the past year underperforming the industry’s rally of 14.4%.Another Notable DevelopmentBroadcom announced in another press release that it has developed the approved SFF-TA-1005 Universal Backplane Management (“UBM”) specification. The company developed the platform co-sponsored by HPE, Dell EMC and 19 other members. The platform will enhance simplicity and provide clarity to the management of SATA, SAS and NVMe drives.Per the press release, “The SFF-TA-1005 UBM specification will help to unify and standardize backplane management in the data center.”To ConcludeBroadcom is benefiting from robust demand of its wireless solutions and expanding product portfolio. It makes the company well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G.However, investors are cautious regarding the customer concentration woes and intensifying competition witnessed in most of the markets in which the company operates.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBroadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc.

520,HPE,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.3% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Hewlett Packard Q4 Earnings Top EstimatesHewlett Packard reported modest fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny while the top line missed the same.The company’s non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 29 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents and also came toward the higher end of management’s guidance range of 26-30 cents. Further, the figure jumped 26.1% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 23 cents from continuing operations, compared with 19 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, it compared favorably with the guided range of a breakeven to earnings of 4 cents.The better-than-expected bottom-line performance was primarily owing to cost savings, lower tax rate, favorable other income and expense as well as transactions in connection with Software-spin merger.Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company closed the spin-merger of its Enterprise Services business. Consequently, Hewlett Packard considers Enterprise Services as a discontinued operation since the fiscal second quarter, and the year-ago quarter’s results have also been adjusted accordingly.Additionally, the company completed the pending spin-merger of its Software business in the fiscal third quarter. Per the company, this quarter “represents adjustment to net periodic pension cost resulting from remeasurements of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise pension plans in connection with the spin-off of the software business, Seattle SpinCo, Inc., and the merger of Seattle SpinCo, Inc. with Micro Focus International plc and the spin-off of the enterprise services business, Everett SpinCo, Inc., and the merger of Everett SpinCo, Inc. with Computer Sciences Corporation.”Before diving into the quarter’s details, it is to be noted that the company in its separate press release announced that its current CEO Meg Whitman will step down, but will remain on the HPE Board of Directors. Effective from Feb 1, 2018, current President Antonio Neri will become president and CEO of the company.Quarter in DetailRevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues from continuing operations (which includes Enterprise Group and Financial Services) of $7.660 billion, up 4.6% from the year-earlier quarter’s revenues of $7.324 billion. However, quarterly revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.714 billion.Adjusted for currency exchange rates and divestures, the company’s revenues from continuing operations were up 11% year over year.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance in the Americas stayed constant mainly due to steady core compute and higher networking which was offset to some extent by softer organic storage results. Revenues in Europe grew mid-single digit driven by higher networking and growth in Germany, France and Iberia. Asia-Pacific witnessed strong core server sales, with growth in Japan, Australia, India and China.Segment wise, revenues at the Enterprise Group was almost flat from the year-ago quarter to $6.852 billion. Adjusting for divestures and currency, segment revenues were up 1% year over year. Revenues from Servers were down 5%, Storage, Networking and Technology Services were up 5%, 21% and 2%, respectively.Financial Services revenues were up 24% to $1.010 Billion. The segment’s net portfolio grew 1%, but financing volume was flat year over year.Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise’s gross margin contracted 210 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 29.7%. This year-over-year contraction was mainly due to competitive pricing, elevated DRAM pricing and unfavorable currency.Moreover, the company’s non-GAAP operating margin descended 100 bps to 8.2%, primarily due to a lower gross margin, which was partially offset by a decline in non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Fiscal 2017 HighlightsHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues for fiscal 2017 from continuing operations of $28.871 billion, down 4.7% year over year.The company’s non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 96 cents per share lagged management’s guidance range of $1.36-$1.40. Moreover, the figure decreased 11.9% on a year-over-year basis.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended the fiscal fourth quarter with $9.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from $7.8 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt at the quarter end was $10.182 billion compared with $14.527 billion recorded in the last quarter.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise generated $826 million of cash flow from operational activities. Free cash flow was $370 million. For the 12 months ended of Oct 31, 2017, the company generated $889 million of cash flow for operational activities.Additionally, during the reported quarter, the company returned $725 million to shareholders, of which $620 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments. For fiscal 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise returned $3 billion to shareholders, of which $2.556 billion was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.GuidanceThe company issued a disappointing bottom-line guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2018.Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 20-24 cents (mid-point: 22 cents), which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company guides the bottom line to be in a range of 1-5 cents.The company also provided outlook for fiscal 2018. Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.15-$1.25 (mid-point $1.2). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.17. On a GAAP basis, the company projects the bottom line to be in the range of 43-53 cents.Hewlett Packard Enterprise estimates reported free cash flow to be $1 billion in fiscal 2018. The company also expects to return $2.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2018, of which $2 billion was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.VGM ScoresCurrently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a C. The stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookNotably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.

521,HPE,"As part of its ongoing restructuring initiatives, HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) recently, in a filing with Securities Exchange & Commission (SEC), noted that the company is increasing its employee retrenchment-plan target. The company now anticipates 4,500-5,000 employee retrenchment by the end of fiscal 2019.The latest target is about 500-1,000 higher than the earlier target of 4,000 announced in October 2016. As of Oct 31, 2017, the company’s total employee count was 49,000. With increased layoff target, it also raised the one-time expense anticipations related to this.HP now projects to incur a total of $700 million pre-tax charges related to the retrenchment, up from the previous forecast of $500 million. With the recent job-cut move, the company seems to be eyeing improving margins. In October 2016, this PC maker had announced job cuts to generate annualized cost savings of approximately $200-$300 million from fiscal 2020 onward.It should be noted that since its split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in November 2015, HP has been trying to stabilize shrinking sales and eroding profits through a series of restructuring initiatives.As part of its restructuring efforts, HP has adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to spur demand for its PC products in the market. The company has launched various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave, in the last two years.HP Inc. Price HP Inc. Price | HP Inc. QuoteThe impact of these initiatives is well highlighted by the fact that the company regained the pole position in the PC segment by displacing Lenovo. Also, according to the data compiled by IDC, during first-quarter 2018, the company’s PC shipments registered the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth after witnessing several quarters of decline.The company’s efforts to revamp printing business have also been commendable. It should be noted that HP has acquired the Samsung Electronics’ printer business. This acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it has expanded the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition to the above, the company is now focused on fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets due to their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.However, these efforts have paid off well, with the company registering the fifth consecutive quarter of print business revenue growth in second-quarter fiscal 2018.Also, the company’s recent quarterly results reflected revenue growth for the seventh straight quarter, out of which the last six recorded double-digit growth after a prolonged period of decline. Further, the Personal Systems and Print segments improved for the fifth straight quarter, after 2010.Currently, HP has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

522,HPE,"We have already moved past the traditionally busy stretch of earnings season, but there are still several key reports to look forward to next week.

Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of November 20.Salesfore.com (CRM  -  Free Report)Cloud computing and customer relations giant Salesforce is scheduled to report its latest earnings results after the market closes on November 21. Salesforce has never missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, and shares of the company are up over 56% so far this year. Nevertheless, increased competition in the cloud CRM space, as well as expensive international investments, could create new pressures this quarter.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Salesforce to report earnings of 37 cents per share and revenues of $2.65 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 52% and 23%, respectively. Investors will want to focus on the company's international growth, as a series of strategic partnerships and investments have made this segment the company's key growth catalyst. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report)Hewlett Packard Enterprise is slated to release its latest earnings report after the bell on November 21. Things have been relatively up and down for HPE since its split from the former Hewlett-Packard Company in late-2015. Still, the company is coming off a strong earnings beat in the most recent quarter, and a recent spin-off could help improve margins.According to our latest consensus estimates, HPE is poised to post earnings of 28 cents per share and revenues of $7.71 billion. During the third-quarter of fiscal 2017, the company sold its Software business to British firm Micro Focus, so the most important year-over-year comparison for investors to keep an eye on will be in the net margin category. Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report)Agricultural equipment behemoth Deere & Company is scheduled to report its latest earnings results before the market opens on November 22. Deere has met or surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in 13 consecutive quarters, and the company's stock has gained more than 30% this year.Based on our current consensus estimates, we expect DE to report earnings $1.42 per share and revenues of $6.91 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 58% and 22%, respectively. Typically, Deere & Company earnings reports serve as an important bellwether for the agricultural industry, and investors will anticipate more news on the company's pending acquisition of Wirtgen. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

523,HPE,"Joining the fast-growing blockchain technology league, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), last week introduced its product under its HPE Mission Critical Blockchain group. The product, which is anticipated to be commercially available by early 2018, has been named as Mission Critical Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).Built-in partnership with enterprise software firm R3 and based on as-a-service concept, the latest offering will provide enterprise customers necessary hardware to run their own blockchain operations or in partnerships with clients. Per media sources, the company’s DLT is faster, reliable, secure, and can be used on a larger scale than other available blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.With the recent product launch, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has joined the race with competitors like IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) in the blockchain technology space. Launching its service nearly a year and a half ago, IBM leads the space. On the other hand, Microsoft provides blockchain tools through its Azure cloud, while Oracle rolled out its service this October.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteBlockchain is believed to be the next game changer in the tech sector. The technology is primarily used for tracking transactions related to digital assets or documents, particularly in industries like banking, financial services and insurance.In the last few years, adoption of the technology has increased due to the fact that DLT, on which blockchain is based, ensures secured data storage and transmission. As every member involved in the consortium using the data can see the changes made, a breach is unlikely. This makes the process even more trustworthy.Moreover, the decentralized database puts a check on hacking and double counting, thereby bringing down the possibilities of monetary losses via cyber crime.Citing Gartner’s forecasts, Hewlett Packard Enterprise revealed that blockchain technology will generate $176 billion in business value by 2025.Given the huge prospect in blockchain technology space, we appreciate Hewlett Packard Company’s move, which, we believe, will provide a new area of growth.Hewlett Packard Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

524,HPE,"According to the latest Earnings Trends, 77.4% of the sector’s companies in the S&P 500 index have reported their results as of Nov 8. Total earnings for these companies are up 23.2% on a year-over-year basis on 10.9% higher revenues. Moreover, 81.3% of these companies beat earnings estimates, while 87.5% surpassed revenue estimates.The upbeat momentum can be attributed to impressive results from technology giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), Google, Intel Corporation and Microsoft Corporation.Apple has been a key contributor to the sector’s strong performance backed by impressive iPhone sales. Facebook’s advertising revenues continued to surge, while Google benefited from mobile strength, rapidly growing Google cloud and total paid click growth. Microsoft also gained from the strong Azure performance.However, Intel was a surprise package in the quarter. Solid results from the data-center portion fully offset weakness in the pc-market related business.Key Catalysts  The technology sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Rapidly expanding IoT market is driving growth for chip components to power applications, particularly ADAS, medical/healthcare and smart devices. Semiconductors are mainly gaining from strong demand for power-efficient and high-performance chips. These are essential to run cloud-data centers and process massive data by using IoT analytics, machine learning and deep learning applications.Moreover, rapid development of 5G platform and technology has evolved as another catalyst for semiconductor providers.Further, the server refresh cycle following the launch of processors by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a key growth driver.Additionally, growing incidents of cyber attack is anticipated to drive demand for cybersecurity software.How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right technology stocks that have the potential to beat earnings can be a daunting task. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for investors.You could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. Our Choices Given below are four technology providers that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), headquartered in Palo Alto, CA, provides enterprise hardware. The company is facing tough times due to competitive pricing, heightened commodities pricing pressure and dilution from mergers & acquisitions. Nevertheless, the ongoing restructuring initiatives along with enhanced capabilities of its hybrid IT model are key drivers.The company is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21. Currently, Hewlett Packard has an Earnings ESP of +1.86% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), based in San Jose, CA, is a leading provider of technologies that encompasses networking, security, collaboration and the cloud. The company’s expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security market presents significant growth opportunity. However, intense competition and slow order growth from service providers are headwinds.We note that Cisco beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.16%.This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.28%. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 15.Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report), based in California, is a fabless designer, developer and marketer of analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The strong demand for the company’s 4G LTE products is a growth driver. The company will be able to meet this demand with its wide range of newly-launched IoT solutions.Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 25.97%.This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.78%. The company is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 28.Pure Storage Inc. (PSTG  -  Free Report), headquartered in Mountain View, CA, is a leading provider of all-flash storage products. The company is benefiting from rapid proliferation of FlashArray, FlashStack and FlashBlade portfolios.The company’s expanding product portfolio (that includes platforms like NVMe, Purity FlashBlade, 75 blades up to 8 PB of storage, Object Storage, and Active Cluster) is a key catalyst.This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an Earnings ESP of +8.70%. The company is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 28.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

525,HPE,"Last week, DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) announced the completion of the much awaited spin-off of its U.S. Public Sector (USPS) business, and subsequently merging it with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions. The newly-formed company has been named as Perspecta Inc., which started trading on the New York Stock Exchange from Jun 1, 2018, under the ticker symbol “PRSP.”Notably, the three aforementioned companies came together in October last year to form a publicly-traded IT service-providing company, primarily to the U.S. government. Notably, Vencore and KeyPoint are owned by private-equity firm Veritas Capital. The new company is anticipated to have a total workforce of more than 14,000 and generate annual revenues of approximately $4.3 billion.The whole deal was structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, thereby making the entire transaction as tax-free to DXC Technology and its shareholders. Upon completion of this transaction, DXC stockholders received 1 share of Perspecta for every 2 shares of DXC held in the company as of record date May 25.Along with this, DXC received $984 million of cash from Perspecta. Earlier the company had announced that the net proceeds from the transaction will be used for debt repayments, share buyback and other general corporate purposes.Per the company, the IT services market for both commercial and the U.S. public sectors has been evolving at an accelerating pace. Therefore, DXC’s latest spin-merger move is believed to provide it a customized approach toward handling two different types of clients.Notably, the company is a result of the merger of the Computer Sciences Corporation (“CSC”) and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The transaction has enhanced shareholders’ value of both companies. Additionally, it has opened up new opportunities for driving the company’s growth.Nonetheless, the company’s escalating interest expenses resulting from increased debt burden make us increasingly cautious about its near-term performance, as this might dampen its profitability. DXC’s long-term outstanding debt significantly increased last fiscal. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby escalating its interest-cost burden.DXC currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Notably, the stock has underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. DXC has lost 12.1% of its value in the said period, while the industry has gained 10.1%.A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are On Assignment, Inc. (ASGN  -  Free Report) and Amdocs Limited (DOX  -  Free Report). On Assignment sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Amdocs holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.On Assignment and Amdocs have expected long-term EPS growth rate of 10% and 7.8%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

526,HPE,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 29. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not the leading global PC manufacturer will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.The company’s last quarterly results reflected overall revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter, after witnessing a prolonged period of decline. Furthermore, the Personal Systems and Print segments improved for the fourth straight quarter after 2010.Notably, the company has a decent earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and came in line in one occasion. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Notably, HP is one of the two companies which came into existence post the split from the parent company — Hewlett-Packard Company — in November 2015. The other company was Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report).What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that HP is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.HP currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second-quarter earnings remained unchanged, over the past 30 days.Nonetheless, the company is expected to register year-over-year improvements in the top and bottom lines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects earnings per share to increase 20% to 48 cents from the year-ago quarter figure of 40 cents. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues to be up 9.7%, year over year, to $13.59 billion.HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteLet’s check out the reasons behind this year-over-year improvement projection in revenues and earnings.Revamped PC Business Bears FruitPost the split from parent company, HP adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to spur demand for its PC products in the market. The company has launched various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave, over the past two years.The impact of these initiatives is well highlighted by the fact that the company has regained the pole position in the PC segment. Also, according to data compiled by International Data Corporation (“IDC”), during first-quarter 2018, the company’s PC shipment registered the eighth straight quarter of year-over-year growth after witnessing several quarters of decline.HP’s efforts to turn around the business have been commendable and seem to be on track, as indicated by its performance over the last few quarters. We believe benefits of the aforementioned initiatives will have positively impacted the to-be-reported quarterly results as well.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the PC segment is anticipated to have generated revenues of approximately $8.4 billion in the fiscal second quarter, reflecting 9.6% year-over-year growth.Print Segment Playing WellThe company’s efforts to revamp its printing business have also been impressive. It should be noted that HP has acquired Samsung Electronics’ printer business. The acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it expanded the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition to the above, the company is now focused on fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets due to their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.Nonetheless, these efforts have paid off well, with the company registering the fourth consecutive quarter of print-business revenue growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the Print segment is projected to have churned revenues of approximately $5.12 billion in the quarter to be reported, reflecting 7.9% year-over-year improvement.Escalating Component Prices Impeding ProfitabilityHP’s product innovation, differentiation, marketing and pricing strategies are paying off as evident from the year-over-year jump in PC segment revenues and shipments for the past few quarters. Nevertheless, escalating component costs have been marring its margins, thereby eroding the benefits of higher revenues. Prices of components, such as DRAM and NAND, are still very high and therefore, we believe this might have dampened the company’s fiscal second-quarter profitability.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

527,HPE,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24, after the market closes. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this IT services company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (“CSC”) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017. So, this will be the fourth quarterly result of the combined business. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that DXC Technology is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.06%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.20, which indicates a massive 91.3% year-over-year jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged, over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $6.12 billion, up approximately 224% from the year-ago quarter.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteSynergies from the merger of CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services business will likely have contributed to the company’s top and bottom-line results. Apart from this, strategic partnerships and acquisitions are anticipated to have brought in additional revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. However, escalating interest expenses resulting from increased debt burden might have dampened the company’s profitability, offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent.Let’s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail.Merger Synergies — The Key Growth CatalystThe above-mentioned merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom. Post merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the combined entity will have generated revenues of  more than $24 billion in fiscal 2018. Also, DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first fiscal and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Notably, the company registered more than 200% surge in revenues in all the preceding three quarters, mainly benefiting from the merger. The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology’s fiscal fourth-quarter top-line performance as well.Additional Revenues From AcquisitionsFollowing the footsteps of CSC, DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth. Since its formation, the company has announced six acquisitions — Tribridge, Logicalis SMC, Racemi, M-Power, eBECS and Stable37.Therefore, the buyout is likely to benefit the company’s soon-to-be-reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues.Partnerships Enhancing Customer BaseGoing ahead, the company’s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud-computing market is likely to aid the fiscal fourth-quarter results. The company, in August 2017, collaborated with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) and launched DXC Managed Cloud Services, supported by VMware's next-generation hybrid-cloud platform.It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT&T and HCL. It has also joined forces with Amazon to develop cloud-based solutions for enterprise and public-sector clients. In addition, it has entered into cloud-partnership agreement with IBM and SAP, as well. These alliances have increased its access to new technology, backed innovative product development and creation of new markets.Also, it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility, social networking and big data facilities. This, in turn, is likely to expand DXC Technology’s customer base and help garner additional revenues.Escalating Interest Costs to Impede ProfitabilityRising interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company’s profitability. As of Dec 31, 2017, DXC Technology has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.37 billion, while it had paid $231 million as interest expenses during the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, which was 166% higher than the previous fiscal-period tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt significantly increased last fiscal. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby escalating its interest-cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

For fiscal 2018, DXC Technology continues to expect revenues to be in the range of $24-$24.5 billion in constant currency. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $24.18 billion. Non-GAAP EPS is now anticipated to be in the range of $7.25-$7.75 per share (previous guidance $6.50-$7 per share). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $6.84 per share.Recent activityDXC Technology recently announced the spin-off of its USPS business, and subsequently merged the same with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions. The three companies have come together to form a publicly-traded IT service-providing company, primarily to the U.S. government. Notably, Vencore and KeyPoint are owned by private-equity firm Veritas Capital. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of March 2018.Per the agreement, the deal will be structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, consequently making the entire transaction as tax-free to DXC Technology and its shareholders.Upon conclusion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares. Along with this, the company will receive $1.05 billion of cash from USPS, upon the completion of its spin-off. The proceeds from USPS are intended to be used for debt repayments, share buyback and other general corporate purposes.Our TakeThe company reported stellar second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, where in both top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also provided an encouraging guidance for fiscal 2018.Post-merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe that the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology may be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance portfolio, which is likely drive growth over the long run. Further, the company is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Nonetheless, the market is very competitive with companies like CACI International Inc. (CACI  -  Free Report)  and Accenture, which could hurt DXC Technology’s top and bottom lines. Additionally, a challenging macroeconomic situation and uncertain IT spending environment remain headwinds.Currently, DXC carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.
