1,CINF,"Don't let the name of ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs (SDOG) fool you.The exchange traded fund hit a record high this past week and has been a remarkably steady performer. Excluding the Aug. 24, 2015, flash crash, the ETF's deepest decline has been 17%, from November 2015 to January 2016. Nearly all other declines since its inception four years ago were 10% or less. Shares broke out of a flat base last Monday past a 40.38 buy point.With a primary focus on large-cap dividend stocks, the ETF serves for smooth long-term sailing rather than momentum plays.The fund is designed around the Dogs of the Dow strategy, which basically seeks the 10 components of the Dow Jones industrial average with the highest dividend yields. The thinking is that those ""dogs"" are just temporarily out of favor and their share price will eventually catch up with the yield performance.ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs takes that premise and applies it to a larger universe, namely the S&P 500. It finds the S&P 500 stocks with the highest dividend yield in their respective sectors, so it always has exposure to the 10 broad sectors of the index.Those selected have a nearly equal weighting in the ETF. The 50 stocks range in weighting from 1.3% to 3.1%, according to the ALPS website.Most of the 50 components have been rebounding this year, even as some are forming price consolidations right now.A pair of health care stocks, Baxter (BAX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), have been some of the best-performing components in 2016. Baxter, which makes hospital and renal-disease products, is up about 10% from a breakout past a 40.66 buy point. J&J has advanced about 11% from its 104.88 buy point.Insurance firm Cincinnati Financial (CINF) has rallied about 13% since breaking out Feb. 12.The ETF pays a quarterly dividend of about 35 cents a share. That's good for an annualized yield of about 3%.                 The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

Back tested results show that stocks with a favorable VGM Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), comfortably outperform other stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Shares of Cincinnati Financial have also underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has lost 8.1%, massively wider than the industry’s 2.3% decline.  Further, valuation remains stretched at the current level. Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio, the best multiple for valuing insurers, the company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.42, higher than the industry average of 1.41.Cincinnati Financial has been incurring rising expenses over the past few years, primarily due to higher insurance loss and contract holders’ benefits besides underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses. We do not expect any major turnaround in this respect in the near term. It is important to note that escalating expenses are likely to restrict operating margin expansion, which in turn might hurt the company’s overall growth.Additionally, the company with its concentration on the Midwest region has been exposed to devastating events. To that end, it has been experiencing high level of catastrophe loss over a considerable period of time and will continue to endure the same given the unpredictability of weather-related occurrences and natural disasters. Further, such huge losses have also induced deterioration in the company’s combined ratio, hampering underwriting profitability.Moreover, Cincinnati Financial’s cash flow from operations has also been on the wane over an extended period of time and we expect volatility in this metric to continue in the near term. Dwindling cashflows might restrain the company’s financial flexibility.Choosing the StocksAlthough Cincinnati Financial doesn’t appear an attractive pick right now, there are a few solid stocks in the insurance space promising greater returns. Also, these companies have outperformed the industry’s rally so far this year.We have narrowed down to four investor-friendly stocks with an upside potential to enhance one’s portfolio through the aid of Zacks Stock Screener.

21,CINF,"The Finance sector, which has been in the spotlight since the U.S. Presidential elections in November 2016, reported impressive first-quarter 2018 results. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the S&P 500 finance stocks recorded 24.7% year-over-year earnings improvement. This was mainly driven by favorable macroeconomic factors, higher interest rates, decent loan and deposit growth, and lower tax rates.So far this year, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF  -  Free Report), which tracks the overall S&P Financial Select Sector Index, is up nearly 1.2%. The bullish trend is expected to continue, going forward.Performance of finance sector is directly related to the healthy of the economy. Per the ‘advance’ estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP increased 2.3% in first-quarter 2018. Driven by this favorable backdrop, performance of finance sector stocks will likely improve further as the U.S. economy continues to gain strength.Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance will support the stocks’ financials. Barring REITs, the other components of the Finance sector — banks, brokerage firms, asset managers and insurers — benefit from higher rates. The steeper yield curve helps the financial stocks to improve revenues.Moreover, as the bill on rolling back of the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation is expected to become a law soon, finance stocks are expected to reap benefits. The bill is aimed at lowering compliance costs and hence will help boost profitability.Apart from these, the new tax legislation will lower effective tax rates for almost all finance sector stocks. This will, thus, enable them to earn more profit. Reduced tax rates are expected to provide further stimulus to the economy, therefore indirectly to the finance sector.Despite these positive factors, there are quite a few finance stocks that are not expected to perform well, mostly owing to some fundamental weaknesses. So, one should reassess portfolio holdings in the light of the present environment and dump the worst performing stocks right away.5 Finance Sector Stocks to AvoidSelecting stocks to dump could be a bit tricky. However, with the assistance of the Zacks Stock Screener, one can locate stocks with a red flag.One could begin by selecting stocks that have lost more than 5% value year to date. Further, stocks that witnessed downward estimate revisions (over the past four weeks) for the current year are likely to plunge the most and should be dumped.Additionally, these stocks have a market cap of $3 billion or more. Under no circumstances one should buy a stock with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) coupled with a VGM Score of D or F.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Here are the five finance stocks that should be avoided now:Invesco Ltd.

23,CINF,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 8.14%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterCincinnati Financial as a property and casualty (P&C) insurer has been exposed to unpredictable weather-related events and a considerable catastrophe loss. Therefore, the company has possibly incurred cat loss in the first quarter, which in turn might dent its underwriting results and also impact the combined ratio.Further, the company has likely reported an increase in total benefits and expenses, mainly driven by higher insurance loss and contract holders’ benefits, underwriting, acquisition plus insurance expenses. This in turn might restrict the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  Nonetheless, Cincinnati Financial is expected to report top-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by higher premiums earned. This apart, a gradual improvement in insurance rates and several growth initiatives are anticipated to have contributed to this probable upside.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.4 billion, representing an improvement of 4.5% from the prior-year quarter.The company is likely to witness an increase in premiums written in the first quarter, attributable to a controlled expansion of Cincinnati Re that forms a substantial contributor to the P&C insurer’s earnings.Cincinnati Financial is estimated to have witnessed considerable growth in net investment income in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, mainly owing to improved interest rates as well as higher interest and dividend income.The tax cut, which reduced the tax rate to 21% from 35%, will aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a rise of 38.9% on a year-over-year basis.Cincinnati Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cincinnati Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cincinnati Financial Corporation Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cincinnati Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Cincinnati Financial has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 82 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cincinnati Financial carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 30. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +23.79% and a Zacks Rank #3.

25,CINF,"The insurance industry seems well placed at present. Favorable factors like benign catastrophe environment, improving rate environment and economic progression boost insurers for growth.Underwriting results, the major indicator of profitability for any insurer, are expected to improve on the back of a benign catastrophe environment. Due to a string of cat events such as the unprecedented hurricane activity and the California wildfires, the year 2017 emerged costliest in terms of catastrophe loss, weighing on the underwriting profitability.As a result of devastating nature’s fury, insurers braved price hikes that had remained flat for quite a while.  Within the insurance space, the property and casualty insurers are among the major beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. The Fed had promised to make three interest rate raises in 2018 and 2019, reflects the regulatory body’s confidence in the bettering U.S. economy. Last year, the Fed had implemented three rate hikes with the metric being now pegged at 1.5%.An increased rate is expected to positively impact the net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line. A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other upsides.Also, President Donald Trump’s tax reform policy, an overhaul of tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden. Notably, the tax rate lowered to 20% from 35% will likely act add an impetus to the industry players.Though the Property and Casualty Insurance industry is ranked at #138 (lies at the bottom half of the Zacks Industry Rank for 252 plus industries), it has outperformed the S&P 500 index’s gain of 2.4% year to date, registering a 2.8% rise.Here we focus on two property and casualty insurers. While CNA Financial Corp. (CNA  -  Free Report) offers commercial P&C insurance products, mainly across the United States, Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF  -  Free Report) markets property and casualty insurance as its main business. While CNA Financial has a market capitalization of $14.2 billion, Cincinnati Financial’s metric records $12.4 billion.Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It will be interesting to note which scores better in terms of fundamentals.Two better-ranked stocks from the same industry are Alleghany Corp. (Y  -  Free Report) and American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Compared with the Property and Casualty Industry’s P/B ratio of 1.64, Cincinnati Financial is underpriced with a reading of 1.51. Meanwhile, CNA Financial is much cheaper with a trailing 12-month P/B multiple of 1.16. This round again goes to CNA Financial as its shares are cheaper than Cincinnati Financial’s. Debt-to-EquityBoth companies have lower debt-to-equity as compared to the industry average of 32.29%. Cincinnati Financial with a leverage ratio of 10.32 has a visible edge over CNA Financial with the same of 23.34. Return on EquityBoth CNA Financial and Cincinnati Financial’s respective return on equity of 7.64% and 5.99% exceeded the industry average of 5.4%. With a higher mark, CNA Financial one more wins this round. Dividend YieldCincinnati Financial’s dividend yield was 2.64% in a year whereas CNA Financial’s was 2.29%.  Both have a dividend yield that outshines the industry’s average of 0.47%. Comparatively, Cincinnati Financial stays ahead of CNA Financial.Notably, Cincinnati Financial has been increasing the yearly dividend for the past 58 years, a record matched by only eight other publicly-traded companies in the United States.  Combined RatioCombined ratio, the percentage of premiums paid out as claims and expenses, determines the underwriting profitability of an insurer.CNA Financial’s combined ratio was 97.1 in 2017 while Cincinnati Financial’s is 97.5.

While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cincinnati Financial’s current-year earnings have been revised 2.4% downward but increased 5.5% for 2019 over the same time frame.For CNA Financial, the consensus mark for 2018 earnings per share is estimated to grow 19.5% on 1.4% revenue improvement.

26,CINF,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 7 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 9.43%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterWith the occurrence of Hurricane Nate and the California wildfires during the fourth quarter, Cincinnati Financial’s underwriting results will be significantly impacted in the soon-to-be-reported period. Such catastrophe loss will not only hurt the underwriting profitability of the company but also leave a noticeable impact on the combined ratio.Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer has projected loss of not less than $1 million each, relating to the aforementioned catastrophe events.Further, the company has possibly reported an increase in total benefits and expenses, mainly driven by higher insurance loss and contract holders’ benefits, underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses. This in turn might restrict the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  Nonetheless, Cincinnati Financial is likely to report top-line growth in the fourth quarter, fueled by higher premiums earned. This apart, a gradual improvement in insurance rates and several growth initiatives are anticipated to have contributed to this probable upside.On the back of a rising interest rate environment, the company is estimated to have witnessed substantial growth in net investment income in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Also, investment results are expected to have improved on higher interest and dividend income.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cincinnati Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

We expect moderate top-line growth at the segment as competitive pressures will somewhat offset modest price increases.Also an improving excess and surplus lines market should continue to drive performance at Excess and Surplus line.Appointing new agencies has been one of the key strategic initiatives adopted by Cincinnati Financial to shore up its premium. To that end, the company plans to appoint about 100 additional agencies that focus on high net worth personal lines clients and will market only personal lines products in 2017. Also, 100 independent agencies’ appointments remain in plan for property casualty insurance products in 2017.The company has been witnessing progress in net investment income despite a sustained low interest rate environment. With gradual improvement in interest rate, we expect the momentum to continue.Cincinnati Financial’s reliance on debt as a capital source has been low. Also, consistent cash flow and sufficient cash balances continue to boost liquidity.A strong capital position aids the company to return value to shareholders. For the past 57 years, Cincinnati Financial has been constantly hiking dividends, a record matched by only eight other publicly-traded companies in the United States. Its current dividend yield is 2.6%, better than the industry average of 1.7%. The company also engages in regular buybacks.

29,CINF,"The second-quarter earnings season is in top gear with 57.2% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of 286 index members (accounting for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization), having already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicates that total earnings have increased 11.3% on 6.1% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 74.5% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 69.2%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 70.5% companies on the S&P 500 Index that have reported quarterly results, shows 7.6% earnings growth on 5.1% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 79.1% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 68.7% for the top line is lower than the same of S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which are likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is $53 billion in the first half of 2017. A few insurers are anticipated to have incurred losses due to natural calamities in the second quarter, stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events, occurred during April and May in the U.S.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against capital reserve erosion, piled up on a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting confidence in the developing economic conditions. In fact, the Fed has raised interest rates thrice in three quarters. A better rate environment not only increased net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continuous low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Notably, an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment. This in turn might have also supported more policy writings, driving the premiums higher to generate a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line. Besides, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have probably boosted the insurers.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been ironing out the creases of pricing pressure. Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing soft pricing.Let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Aug 2.American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is engaged in a range of global insurance and insurance-related activities through its subsidiaries. Last quarter, AIG substantially beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.52%. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -0.83% leave our earnings surprise prediction inconclusive. The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.19 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.20.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We expect performance at its Commercial Lines segment to remain stressed. Individual Retirement business too has remained low due to uncertainty stemming from the Department Of Labor’s fiduciary rule and lower fixed annuity sales limiting the sales improvement. Sales growth has likely improved in Life Insurance business. Expenses too have possibly moderated.

32,CINF,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing with 251 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances indicate a 16% increase in total earnings on 10.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 64.9%, outperforming on the top-line front.On an encouraging note, the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now.Per the Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to grow 5.7% on 2.8% higher revenues.Industry OverviewThe insurance industry as an integral component of the Finance sector is likely to perform slightly better in the soon-to-be-reported quarter compared with the third. However, the insurers’ underwriting profitability is still likely to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter. This downside further added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimating cat loss at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn has even helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important ingredient of an insurer’s top line, is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment. Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace, the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers’ investment portfolios. Notably, the Fed kept its promise of three hikes in 2017, the last one made in December, having raised enough optimism among investors.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographical footprint and strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.Moreover, the tax reform policy — enacted in December 2017 reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% — is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable extent. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is estimated to make U.S. insurers more competitive, globally.With 482 companies (92 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings results this week, let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of quarterly releases on Feb 7.Stocks to ConsiderThe Allstate Corporation’s (ALL  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results are likely to be impacted by catastrophe loss, stemming from the California wildfires. This will not only put a dent in the company’s underwriting performance but also render volatility to the company’s bottom line. Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer expects to incur a loss of $516 million from the California wildfires.Nonetheless, the results are anticipated to gain from a decline in the frequency of auto accidents and improved profitability in auto insurance, reflecting the profit improvement actions initiated in 2015.Further, on the back of an improving interest rate environment, the company is likely to have witnessed investment income growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.57 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a 27.6% year-over-year decline. Allstate carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, combined with an Earnings ESP of -8.28% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read More: Will California Wildfires Hurt Allstate Q4 Earnings?)Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s (CINF  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results might take a beating by the occurrence of Hurricane Nate and the California wildfires during the period to be reported.

This apart, a gradual improvement in insurance rates and several growth initiatives might have contributed to the possible upside.On the back of a progressing interest rate environment, the company’s net investment income is predicted to have significantly increased in the quarter to be soon reported. Also, investment results probably have risen on both higher interest and dividend income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 86 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter represents a 14.7% year-over-year improvement.

The company, with its concentration in the Midwest region, has been incurring inclement weather-related losses over a considerable period of time. To that end, it has been experiencing a high level of catastrophe loss for a while now and the first nine months of 2017 were no exception, mainly stemming from the unprecedented hurricane activity in the third quarter.Further, massive catastrophe losses also resulted in deteriorating the company’s combined ratio, a measure of profitability used by an insurance company to denote its daily operational performance.Notably, the fourth quarter will bear the brunt of Hurricane Nate and the California wildfires and in each case of devastation, the company has projected losses of not less than $1 million. Thus, such cat events will put a dent in the company’s overall performance.This apart, Cincinnati Financial has been incurring rising expenses over the past few years and the first nine months of 2017 were no exception.

39,CINF,"The third-quarter earnings season is gaining pace with 87 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported quarterly numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of these index members (accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization) indicate that total earnings have increased 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 71.3% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 70.1%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 50.7% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported results so far shows 7.8% earnings growth on 3.3% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 71.4% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 50% for the top line is lower than the same of the S&P 500.  Insurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector, will witness soft results this yet-to-be-reported quarter. A soft performance from the insurance industry will drag the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our Earnings Preview, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 1.5% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. Moody’s Analytics earlier estimated economic losses from Irma to come in the $58-$83 billion band while that from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion. Mexican tremors have all the more added to the woes.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent.We do not expect pricings to have been strong in the third quarter.However, net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is likely to witness improvement courtesy three rate hikes approved since December 2016. Though rate environment is improving at a very slower pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The third quarter will also not be an exception.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continuous low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) set to report results this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 25.Chubb Limited’s (CB  -  Free Report) third-quarter underwriting results will be affected by a string of cat events. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio is currently pegged at 101%, a deterioration of 980 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Premiums earned likely have reduced the company’s inability to generate enough underwriting returns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is currently pegged at $7.2 billion, reflecting a decline of 2.8% on a year-over year basis.However, higher net investment income and continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. The company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $830 million and $840 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss is 26 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, reflecting a 108.9% year-over-year slump. Chubb currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. Further combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.

42,CINF,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions over the last 60 days, evident from its  bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Catastrophe loss dragging its underwriting performance as well as lower investment income will weigh on the company’s earnings results.Estimate Revisions: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 15.5% downward. Estimates for 2018 have declined 0.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third and fourth-quarter 2017 reflects year-over-year decline of 63.6% and 13.2%, respectively. The full-year estimate represents a 26.7% slump.Share Price Performance: Shares of Travelers have gained 2.9% in a year, lagging the industry’s growth of 12.2% as well as the S&P 500’s 13.5% gain.Earnings ESP and Surprise History: Travelers has an Earnings ESP of -3.34%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 87 cents, higher than the Most Accurate estimate of 84 cents. The company has a discouraging earnings track record, having failed to surpass estimates in two of the last four quarters.Our proven model does not conclusively show if the company is likely to beat estimates when it reports third-quarter results on Oct 19. This is because Traveler’s unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4 lowers the predictive power of ESP, thereby spoiling chances of an earnings beat. Further, combined with a negative Earnings ESP, surprise prediction becomes difficult.VGM Score: Travelers carries an unimpressive VGM Score of G. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum with the score being a weighted combination of all three factors. It presently has a Growth Score of F.Factors Weighing on the PerformanceExposure to catastrophe events has weighed on underwriting profitability. A string of hurricanes and two Mexican tremors will be a drag on insurers’ underwriting profits.  The company expects to incur pre-tax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million post-tax from Harvey.Being a property and casualty insurer, Travelers will certainly not escape the disaster caused by these tropical storms and earthquakes.  Due to inclement weather events, its underwriting results have taken a severe beating. Notably, the company has been witnessing high level of catastrophe losses for a considerable period of time. Specifically, the last quarter marked the maximum catastrophe losses since 2011. Combined ratio has also been deteriorating.In fact, the insurer has temporarily ceased its share repurchase program in the wake of the catastrophes as part of capital management strategy during a considerable stretch of catastrophic environment.Though the Federal Reserve is gradually increasing the interest rate, it still remains low. For 2017, Travelers anticipates about $15-$20 million of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis, compared with 2016.The company has also been incurring higher expenses, which has been heavily hurting the operating income as well as the bottom line.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report), Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) and Radian Group Inc.

43,CINF,"As a property and casualty (P&C) insurer, W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB  -  Free Report) is exposed to both natural and man-made catastrophe events. The company has also been incurring inclement weather-related losses over a considerable period of time. With the occurrence of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and earthquakes in Mexico, the company anticipates its underwriting results to get hurt in the near term. To that end, it has given a catastrophe loss projection of about $110 million, translating to $72 million after-tax.It is important to note that being a P&C insurer, W.R. Berkley cannot avoid the aftermath of such catastrophe events, which in turn poses a threat to weigh on the company’s underwriting profitability in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Irrespective of catastrophe mitigation techniques deployed by the company, exposure to weather-oriented calamities inevitably makes its earnings volatile.This apart, intense competition in the global reinsurance segment has resulted in downward pressure on rates for the near term, thus restricting growth. Therefore, the company anticipates the increasing competition to negatively impact reinsurance results in the short term, leading to an earnings decline and hurting the company’s overall performance in the process.Additionally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) P&C insurer’s unfavorable gross premiums trend has been a dampener over the past few years with the company not even expecting to bounce back anytime soon. The company has also been persistently experiencing rising expenses, which might hamper its operations and limit growth.Southbound Estimates: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 13.3% downward over the last 60 days. While the same for 2018 has slipped nearly 1.5% over the same time frame. This is reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank as well.An Underperformer: Shares of W.R. Berkley have gained 1.2% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s 12.5% rally. We expect substantial catastrophe losses, declining gross premiums as well as unfavorable global reinsurance results to throw challenges at the company’s overall functioning.Earnings ESP and Surprise History: The company is set to release third-quarter results on Oct 24, 2017. Our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this time around. This is because it needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. But that is not the case here as W.R. Berkley currently has a Zacks Rank #4 that lowers the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP  of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Also, the company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector include Principal Financial Group, Inc.

44,CINF,"Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) has successfully catered to the growing demands and expectations of its clients for years, building a solid product and service portfolio over time. Retaining this optimism, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) multi-line insurer continues to evolve stronger and looks set to repeat the success streak in the near future.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is $10.09 on revenues of $52.10 billion for 2017. Although the top line reflects a year-over-year slip of 0.3%, the bottom line improves 10.6%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $11.22 on $54.16 billion revenues. While earnings represent an 11.2% increase, revenues reflect a 3.9% rise.  Prudential Financial has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 8.5%.Northbound Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has inched up 0.1% in the last 60 days, while the same for 2018 has nudged up 0.2% over the same time frame. This is reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank.An Outperformer: Shares of Prudential Financial have surged 29.3% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 21.8% rally. We expect the company’s sustained operational performance, improving asset under management and a robust capital position to drive the stock higher in the near term.Attractive Valuation: Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio, which is the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, valuation looks attractive at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 0.9, falling significantly below the industry average of 1.4. Also, the stock carries Value Score of A. Back-tested results have shown stocks with Value Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 are best investment bets.Earnings ESP and Surprise History: The company is set to release third quarter results on Nov 1, 2017. Our proven model conclusively shows that it is likely to beat on earnings this time around as the company has a favorable Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.74%. Prudential has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters.Growth DriversThe insurer will continue to benefit from its massive reach and an in-depth expertise in the pension risk transfer (PRT) business. The company is also on track to establish a leadership position in the potentially strong PRT market, suitable to mobilize the insurance company’s skills in the management of group annuity.Interestingly, the company arrived at a decision to realign U.S. businesses to position itself better to leverage business mix and capture the long-term growth opportunities within and across domestic businesses.The company’s international operations too have placed it well for long-term growth. It is expected to gain from the AFP Habitat buyout, completed in the first quarter of 2016. The transaction, expanding its international footprint, is estimated to result in a stable rise, steady earnings and an adequate cash flow generation. Therefore, the organization remains focused on diversifying activities to enable it to accelerate overall growth and keep up the streak in the immediate term as well.  Additionally, Prudential has prosperously generated investors’ value. It has been approved to buy back worth $1.25 billion shares in 2017. The company remains committed toward maintaining a solid capital and liquidity status, thus protecting itself from market volatility.Near-Term Headwinds: However, an unfavorable currency impact and regulatory control remain challenges to tide over. In addition, rising expenses have been spoilers for the insurer and that does not expect a turnaround anytime soon.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry are Principal Financial Group, Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report), Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF  -  Free Report), each carrying the same bullish Zacks Rank of 2.

45,CINF,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 39.13%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterWith the occurrence of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria during the third quarter as well as the Mexico earthquakes, Cincinnati Financial’s underwriting results will be significantly impacted in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The massive catastrophe losses will not only affect underwriting profitability but also render volatility to the company’s earnings. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is 53 cents that represents a noticeable decline of 38.4% from the prior-year quarter.Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer’s unit, The Cincinnati Insurance Companies’ property casualty group, has projected third-quarter 2017 pre-tax catastrophe losses to range between $102 million and $114 million, approximately. This will leave an impact on the third-quarter combined ratio of about 860-960 basis points on the basis of estimated property casualty earned premiums.Additionally, the company projects its third-quarter property casualty combined ratio to range between 98.5% and 101.5%, including the effect of catastrophe losses.Further, the company has possibly recorded an increase in total benefits and expenses, mainly driven by higher insurance losses and contract holders’ benefits, underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses as well as other operating costs. This in turn might restrict the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  However, Cincinnati Financial is likely to report top-line growth in the third quarter, fueled by higher premiums earned. To that end, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is $1.4 billion that represents an increase of 3.5% from the prior-year quarter.Also, investment results likely have improved backed by an increase in both interest and dividend income.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cincinnati Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Cincinnati Financial has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 53 cents.

However, the securities exchange has not disclosed the purchase price of the transaction but aims to fund the same with cash in hand. Notably, the buyout marks the first transaction since the appointment of Adena Friedman, Chief Executive Officer of Nasdaq.Benefits of the AcquisitionThe takeover will allow Nasdaq to extend its current market surveillance technology to ultimately help the securities exchange further strengthen and expand position in the surveillance space, thereby enabling the company to become a leading provider to the buy-side industry. Hence, the transaction will permit the company to invest more into advanced technologies like cognitive computing, which is a very important part of the company’s strategy. Thus, the securities exchange will be able to further improve its service portfolio to boost overall results and result in long-term growth.With this transaction, Nasdaq will be able to fulfill its primary objective of making an entry into the buy-side market with a compliance solution.

51,CINF,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) and subsidiaries’ ratings were retained by the credit rating giant, A.M. Best. The rating agency has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A++ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “aa+” for Chubb’s North American property/casualty arms. These units comprise members of the Chubb Bermuda Insurance Ltd., Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd., ACE American Group, Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, Chubb Atlantic Indemnity Ltd. as well as Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd.’s parent company — Chubb Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd.  At the same time, the rating agency has reiterated the FSR of A++ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICR of “aa+” of Chubb European Group Limited.  Additionally, the rating agency has affirmed the FSR of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICRs of “aa-” for Combined Insurance Company of America and Combined Life Insurance Company of New York, collectively known as the Combined companies. This apart, A.M. Best has upgraded the Long-Term ICR from “a” to “a+” and also reiterated the FSR of A (Excellent) for Chubb Seguros Panama S.A. Furthermore, ACE Life Insurance Company’s FSR of A- (Excellent) and its Long-Term ICR of “a-” were also affirmed by the credit rating giant.  Finally, the rating agency has affirmed the ultimate parent company, Chubb’s  Long-Term ICR of “a+” as well as the Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR) and the same of Chubb INA Holdings Inc. The outlook for these aforementioned credit ratings remained stable.  Notably, following this news release, shares of Chubb had inched up 0.3% in the last trading session.  Ratings Representation of the North American Property/Casualty Subsidiaries The ratings of the core North American property/casualty units represent each subsidiary’s solid risk-adjusted capitalization, outstanding underwriting and overall operational performances, along with continued competitive advantages within its broad standard and specialty commercial plus high net worth personal insurance businesses. The ratings also acknowledge the units’ all-inclusive and rooted enterprise risk management, strict underwriting standards, solid franchise recognition and accessibility to additional capital mechanisms offered by the property and casualty insurer, Chubb.  However, intense competition within the market, exposure to catastrophe losses and a modest level of historical adverse loss reserve development, related to asbestos and environmental (A&E) liabilities, can partially offset the abovementioned positive rating factors.  The rating agency anticipates the catastrophe losses — following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, along with the recent earthquakes in Mexico — to remain within Chubb’s risk tolerance limits. Notably, the rating agency will continue to supervise the developments connected to such events and their apparent impact on the insurer itself.  Details Behind the Ratings of Some Other Subsidiaries The ratings of another unit, Chubb Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd., represent its ownership of Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd., forming the majority of the company’s financial profile along with the benefit of being part of the Chubb organization.  However, the abovementioned arm’s limited stand-alone business profile, its modest scale in comparison to subsidiaries and affiliates as well as the increased risk profile of variable annuity reinsurance business, might partially offset the positive rating factors.  On the other hand, the ratings of ACE Life Insurance Company reflect benefits received by the unit for being part of the parent Chubb organization, together with the sufficient risk-adjusted capital position, which supports the unit’s risk profile.  However, its narrow business profile and statutory losses that resulted in decreasing its absolute capital position in the past few years, have a possibility to offset the aforementioned positive rating factors. Additionally, the Combined companies’ ratings represent the perks they receive for belonging to the Chubb organization and their continued revenue growth trajectory, to name a few.  However, their current volatile earnings performance, an instable capital reserve and an elevated credit risk of the investment portfolio, are likely to offset the positive rating factors.  Interestingly, the upgrade made to Chubb Seguros Panama S.A.’s Long-Term ICR takes into account its consistent solid risk-adjusted capitalization, extended business profile as well as the company’s association with the parent entity, to name a few. However, the unit’s recent thriving market share within its insurance industry and the stiff competition within its insurance sector, can lead to a rating downgrade in the future. Lastly, the ratings of Chubb European Group Limited consider its brilliant stand-alone risk-adjusted capitalization, sustained operational performance and an outstanding business profile as commendable positives. This apart, the unit’s ratings derive benefits obtained from Chubb, the ultimate parent company.  Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an instrumental role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe such ratings to help Chubb retain investors’ trust as well as write more businesses going forward.  Zacks Rank and Share Price Movement Currently, Chubb carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of the company have gained 10.6% year to date, underperforming the industry’s increase of 12.6%. However, we expect sustained operational performance and a robust capital position to enable the stock to rebound in the near term.   Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are FBL Financial Group, Inc.

However, the rating agency has withdrawn the ratings of this unit on Premier Insurance’s request of non-participation in the rating agency’s interactive rating procedure.Ratings Representation of Travelers GroupRatings affirmation represent Travelers Group’s strong risk-adjusted capitalization, solid operational performance and favorable underwriting results, together with outstanding market position in commercial and personal lines plus an efficient management team. Also, the ratings also recognize the group’s active and inclusive risk management, underwriting and financial discipline, improved technology and internal information systems plus product and geographic diversification to name a few. Additionally, the ratings take into account the financial flexibility and liquidity contributed by Travelers.The current intensely competitive environment across property/casualty markets, substantial exposure to catastrophe events and disasters as well as issues faced in the company’s personal auto business might offset the aforementioned positive rating factors in its case. It is important to note that the rating agency anticipates a similar situation in 2017 in the wake of catastrophe losses pertaining to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, likely to ail the earnings performance.Details Behind the Ratings of Different SubsidiariesThe ratings of Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America and its 100% reinsured affiliate (Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of Europe Limited), which in turn are also the company’s two units mainly acknowledge their robust consolidated risk-adjusted capitalization, specialized underwriting experience, positive underwriting and operational performance as well as their leading position in surety, fidelity and management liability segments.However, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America’s constrained product diversification, together with the adverse effect that ongoing competitive property/casualty markets and difficult macroeconomic conditions might leave on premium and profitability levels, can partially offset the aforementioned positive rating factors of both the subsidiaries.Talking of Travelers Insurance Company of Canada, this unit’s ratings represent its excellent risk-adjusted capitalization, positive underwriting and operating profitability plus outstanding brand recognition to name a few.However, the ongoing soft market sentiment along with inflated expense ratio can partially offset the aforementioned positive rating aspects.On the other hand, The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company’s ratings reflect its strong risk-adjusted capitalization, superior brand recognition and well-established nationwide Canadian market presence to name a few.However, the subsidiary’s inconsistent operational performance, existent intense competitive environment and continued lower investment yields can offset the positive rating factors.Additionally, the ratings of First Floridian Auto and Home Insurance Company reflect the company’s robust risk-adjusted capitalization, local market focus as well as operational efficiencies to boot.However, the arm’s continued yet decreasing exposure to catastrophe losses along with a single state geographic concentration in Florida, might partially offset the positive rating factors.Lastly, The Premier Insurance Company of Massachusetts’ ratings consider its firm risk-adjusted capitalization, sustained operational performance and additional operational back up besides the financial flexibility provided by Travelers Group and the ultimate parent company, Travelers.However, the unit’s continual underwriting losses for over time, limited line of business as well as its single-state concentration are likely to partially offset the positive rating pointers.Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play a vital role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe that such ratings will help Travelers retain investors’ trust as well as write more businesses going forward.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementCurrently, Travelers carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

53,CINF,"Plagued with the ongoing malaise due to a flurry of hurricanes and other catastrophes, the insurance industry seems to have lost much of its sheen to the investors at large. Their sentiments got further dampened by the Fed’s announcement to keep the interest rate unchanged at its most recently held meeting.Havoc Wreaked by Weather Related EventsHaving been blessed by Mother Nature for many years now, the insurance industry has of late faced its immense wrath. Although benign catastrophes in recent years had favored the property and casualty players, their severities took a worse turn with a slew of hurricane strikes namely, Harvey, Irma, Maria, affecting parts of the United States one after another.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics. Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimates industry insured losses for Maria in the Caribbean between $40 billion and $85 billion.The AIR Worldwide firm has also provided an insurance industry loss projection following the huge impact of the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico in early September. The figure enormously ranges between $0.8 billion and $1.1 billion. Per the same global catastrophe risk modeler, the industry loss estimate is expected up to $2.1 billion, following another tremor that rocked Mexico on Sep 19, 2017.These losses are anticipated to create a dent in underwriting margins for the property and casualty insurers.

(ALL  -  Free Report) expects to incur a catastrophe (cat) loss of $593 million pretax ($385 million after tax) from Harvey.Another player, Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation, expects to suffer approximately $10-$15 million of weather-related loss.Low Interest Rates Add to WoesInterest rates are like a double-edged sword for the property and casualty insurers. Though low interest rates protect the value of bonds in their investment portfolio, it takes a toll on their investment yields. An increase in interest rates leads to higher investment income, which is another source of revenue for insurers.A near-zero interest rate from past many years has eaten into the insurers net investment income pie. Despite the rate hikes by the Fed (unchanged at the meeting concluded last month), interest rates remain pretty abnormally low to contribute meaningfully to investment income.Other headwinds the industry grapples with are soft pricing and stiff competition, prompting insurers to relax their rigid underwriting standards in order to gain more business. This exposes them to higher probability of incurring claim cost.How to Gamble With the Stocks for SurvivalThe uncertainty phase persisting in the industry makes it difficult for investors to pick up the right stock to invest in.The safest stock in this backdrop would be the one providing a steady stream of income. Significantly, the still-low interest rate scenario makes the dividend stocks a solid choice for investors looking for a steady benefit.A stock rewarding shareholders with consistent dividends would be the top stock pick in such a scenario.Here are some stocks that qualify our criteria:Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, 2017 marks the 35th year of consecutive dividend growth. Its current dividend yield of 2.1% exceeds the industry’s metric of 1.9% that it belongs to.We expect the company to continue with the dividend growth path, backed by a favorable U.S business and a strong balance sheet.  Though the company is facing weakness in Japan business, chances are slim that its dividend policy will be affected by it.Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF  -  Free Report) has increased dividend for 56 consecutive years, an impressive feat achieved by only seven other U.S. public companies. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its dividend yield of 2.6% outpaces the industry’s 0.5% yield. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.       .   There is no question of the company to deviate from the dividend growth track, given its strong diversified business, wide agent network, disciplined underwriting and a strong balance sheet, which should support future dividend growth.Old Republic International Corp. (ORI  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has raised dividend for 35 consecutive years. Its dividend yield of 3.9% is amply higher than the industry’s 1.9% tally.The company’s diversified revenue and earnings from general P&C and title insurance subsidiaries, good profitability, moderate use of financial leverage and high cash flow assure us of an impressive dividend growth story to continue in the long term.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

54,CINF,"Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) and property/casualty units plus affiliated insurance companies — collectively called Kemper Property & Casualty Group (Kemper P&C) — have recently received rating action from the credit rating giant A.M. Best. The rating agency has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a-” for Kemper P&C.Concurrently, the credit rating giant has affirmed the FSR of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of “a-” for Kemper’s life/health units, together known as Kemper Life & Health Group (Kemper L&H). Additionally, the rating agency has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “bbb-” and the Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR) to the ultimate parent company, Kemper. The outlook of the aforementioned credit ratings remained stable. Shares of Kemper gained 2.8% in the last two trading sessions.Ratings Representation of Kemper P&CThe ratings and outlooks of Kemper P&C represent the insurer’s robust risk-adjusted capitalization, sustained operational performance, risk management and the continuous efforts to minimize exposure to catastrophic loss.However, Kemper P&C’s weak operational performance and underwriting volatility in the past few years might partially offset the aforementioned positive rating factors.Substantial decline in operating results plus capitalization levels that do not meet the rating agency’s current rating level expectations along with prudent strategies and inability to generate material improvement in performance may result in negative rating action.Nonetheless, Kemper P&C might witness rating upgrades or outlook revisions in the future on the back of decent earnings and organic surplus growth across all phases of underwriting cycle without making any kind of curtailment in business profile.Details Behind the Ratings of Kemper L&HKemper L&H’s ratings and outlooks represent their comprehensive long-term presence as protection insurance providers within Kemper apart from their solid risk-adjusted capitalization level and profitable operational performance to name a few.The positive rating factors can be offset by the existing high levels of dividends, which may curb absolute capital growth as well as the result in difficulty to grow total net premium.A considerable decline in consolidated adjusted capital or deterioration in quality of capital, weak earnings performance with increased volatility and the rating agency’s diminished view of Kemper P&C’s financial strength are a few factors that might prompt negative rating action.Nonetheless, a substantial improvement in the rating giant’s perspective toward Kemper P&C’s financial strength may leave a positive effect on Kemper L&H’s ratings.Notably, Kemper’s adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio, which was 21.2% as of Jun 30, 2017, came within A.M. Best’s guidelines for the company’s ratings. Further, Kemper’s interest coverage was appropriate for its assigned ratings.Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe that such ratings will help Kemper retain investors’ trust and write more businesses going forward.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementCurrently, Kemper sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares of the company have rallied 23.0% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s increase of 6.6%. We expect sustained operational performance as well as robust capital position to drive the stock higher in the near term.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in other top-ranked stocks from the insurance industry may consider FBL Financial Group, Inc. (FFG  -  Free Report), CNO Financial Group, Inc. (CNO  -  Free Report) and Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

55,CINF,"Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) has prosperously met the ever-changing demands and expectations of clients, building a solid service and product portfolio over the years. The company’s target remains intact to maintain this goodwill and push the envelope further to enhance results.Unum Group is currently an industry-leading disability income writer as well as the second-largest writer of voluntary business in the United States. Despite the country’s challenging economic situation, the company managed to deliver favorable operating results across majority of its insurance entities in the past few years. Therefore, it expects to continue with such a sustained performance in the near term as well.Also, the company’s operating earnings have been displaying a substantial improvement in the last few years and the first half of 2017 was no exception. Unum Group also anticipates 2017 operating income per share to rise in the 5-8% band over the range recorded in 2016. This apart, the company’s conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to profitability in the past few years.Further, Unum U.S. and Colonial Life, two of the largest operating segments of Unum Group, have been experiencing the operating income growth over the past few years. This has been primarily supported by improving premium income and favorable risk results. Hence, Unum Group awaits a better performance from these segments in the shortterm to add to the company’s bottom line.Interestingly, the company projects sales increaseat Colonial Life to continue in 2017 and beyond. Also, management remains committed toward shifting to a mix of businesses with potential to result in higher growth and stable margins.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Accident and Health insurer has been displaying solid capital generation and a strong financial flexibility, enabling the company to undertake effective capital deployment activities. In fact, the company has been consistently boosting shareholders’ value through dividend hikes and share buybacks. It makes a continuous effort to reduce share count, thereby expecting to bolster earnings going forward.Shares of Unum Group have surged 45.5% in a year’s time, significantly outperforming the industry’s 22.2% rally. We expect both bottom-line and top-line growth, solid performance at Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments, plus a robust capital position to drive the stock higher in the immediateterm as well.However, the company has been displaying weak performances at its Closed Block and Corporate segments over a considerable period of time and it does not hope to see any turnaround in the short term. Additionally, Unum Group has been incurring higher expenses in the past few years, hampering the company’s overall results in turn.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are First American Financial Corporation (FAF  -  Free Report), CNO Financial Group, Inc.

56,CINF,"Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (AFH  -  Free Report) and its units’ ratings were reiterated by A.M. Best. The rating agency affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of B (Fair) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “bb” for American Service Insurance Company, Inc., American Country Insurance Company and Gateway Insurance Company. Together, the three companies are referred to as American Service Pool (ASI Pool), working under an intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement. They form the units of property and casualty (P&C) insurer, Atlas Financial. Notably, the outlook of the aforementioned ratings remained stable.At the same time, the credit rating giant affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “b-” for Atlas Financial, with the outlook of the rating remaining stable. Additionally, the rating agency affirmed the FSR of B+ (Good) and the Long-Term ICR of “bbb-” for Atlas Financial’s wholly owned subsidiary, Global Liberty Insurance Company of New York. The outlook of such ratings remains negative.Ratings Representation of ASI PoolThe ratings affirmations of the ASI Pool members represent an inconsistent and weak risk adjusted capital position of the group. Also, the ratings affirmations denote the group’s sub-par investment yields and the returns on its investment portfolio, besides the recent trajectory of recording adverse prior-year loss reserve development.However, gradual improvement in underwriting and operational performance over the past few years, along with management’s substantial experience and competence in its niche market, serving the public’s “for hire” auto market, might partially offset the aforementioned negative rating factors.In future, ASI pool can expect to see a positive rating action on the back of its improving operational performance or additional improvement in the risk-adjusted capitalization levels. However, a slump in the pool’s underwriting and operational performance, declining risk-adjusted capitalization level that cannot support the current ratings, along with a trend of recording material unfavorable loss reserve development, might result in negative rating action.Details Behind the Ratings of Global Liberty InsuranceThe ratings affirmation of Global Liberty Insurance represents its experience within the New York City metropolitan area’s for-hire-livery vehicle market and a robust capital position.However, the unit’s unstable underwriting and operational performance in recent years has partially offset the abovementioned positive rating factors.Notably, the Global Liberty Insurance’s negative outlook signifies the rating agency’s distress relating to the adequacy of the unit’s loss reserves as well as the current volatility in its underwriting and operational performance.Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe that such ratings will help Atlas Financial retain investors’ trust and write more businesses going forward.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementCurrently, Atlas Financial sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares of Atlas Financial have rallied 20.8% quarter to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 5.5% increase.
