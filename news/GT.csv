0,GT,"Here's your weekly Investing Action Plan: what you need to know as an investor for the coming week.

1,GT,"Today's cars and SUVs, packed with revolutionary technologies, are nothing like the vehicles of several decades ago. Nor is leadership among the world's largest automakers, including General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), as the industry confronts one of the most transformational periods in its history. The upstart, high-tech electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) has raised expectations on innovation,…
"
2,GT,"At this week's Los Angeles Auto Show, manufacturers are expected to introduce more than 50 brand-new vehicles to the car-buying public.As has been the custom of late, some of the most exclusive names in carmaking — Volkswagen's (VLKAY) Bentley, Bugatti, Ferrari (RACE), McLaren, and Rolls-Royce — are skipping the show altogether in favor of targeted driving and VIP events. That's an increasingly common decision by some of the world's leading luxury brands. Aston Martin and Fiat Chrysler's (FCAU) Maserati group, similarly, will wait until later shows to offer anything new.That doesn't mean all the luxury brands are sitting this one out, though. Others, including Fiat Chrysler's Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and Volkswagen's Porsche, will offer significant world debuts.""The luxury brands are cautiously optimistic this year,"" said Matt DeLorenzo, the managing editor at Kelley Blue Book. ""The market has hit a plateau, with the luxury segment still locked in at 12% of the total market. But on the other hand, it's a great time to be a luxury car buyer because the luxury market is full of options. The L.A. show is going to underscore that with plenty of new introductions.""Luxury-auto makers will primarily be showing large sedans, crossovers, and SUVs, the last of which makes sense considering the fact that the U.S. is the world's largest SUV market. Much attention will go to Alfa Romeo, which will introduce its first SUV, the Stelvio, on Wednesday.""The Stelvio is a big deal for Alfa Romeo if they really want to get a foothold and reestablish themselves here in the U.S."" DeLorenzo said. ""That SUV is going to be a make-or-break vehicle for them.""Details on the saccharine-sounding rig remain scarce other than the expectation that it will borrow its body design largely from the Giulia. Stelvio will compete against the Audi Q5 and BMW X3. It is expected to go on sale in early 2017.More concretely, Land Rover will show the First Edition Dynamic version of its best-selling Discovery SUV. BMW will show a new X5 xDrive 40e as well as updated models throughout its SUV and sedan lineup. Mercedes-Benz will premiere an AMG E63 Sedan along with an unconfirmed new car from its top-end Mercedes-Maybach line. Ahead of the show, Mercedes-Benz announced its new AMG GLE43 SUV, which will replace the GLE 400.One possible sleeper SUV that could garner some hype for its good looks is the Infiniti QX Sport Inspiration Concept. Nissan's (NSANY) Infiniti has released little information about the car, but preliminary images show that it has the gently rounded hood and sharp side angles of a futuristic luxury carriage.Among domestic makers, General Motors' (GM) Cadillac will bring the 2017 Escalade SUV and the enormous Escala concept sedan it showed briefly in August at the Pebble Beach Concours D'Elegance. The Escala, which takes its name from the Spanish word for ""scale,"" comes with a 4.0-liter V-8 engine and an interior lined in wood and aluminum. Buick will show its new Cascada Convertible, Encore, Envision and LaCrosse.The fact that Cadillac won't put an all-electric or autonomous powertrain in the Escala is surprising given how much hype those two drivetrains typically receive in L.A. press and popular coverage.What's more, the show this year has gone so far as to recast itself as an ""auto mobility"" show, with the first days of the event featuring seminars and panel discussions on such future transportation issues as autonomous driving, car sharing, and the connected car. The pivot is a way for the L.A. event to compete with the increasingly popular Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which automakers attend with increasing fervor. But analysts have pointed out a potential conflict with that shift: The purpose of an auto show is primarily to promote cars that consumers can buy in the near, rather than distant, future.""Autonomous driving cars are not here yet, that's the problem,"" DeLorenzo said. ""Their hype looms rather large. The purpose of an auto show is to sell cars. You can buy cars with semiautonomous features, but a full hands-free, drive-me-home-type car is still far away.""Maybe that's why Tesla has said it will not bring its upcoming Model 3 plug-in electric sedan to the show.Still, buyers looking for green(er) vehicles have plenty to choose from.Cadillac will show the CT6 PHEV, an all-new, rear-wheel electric car producing total system power of 250kW (equivalent to 335 horsepower) and 586 newton metro (roughly 432 pound-feet) of torque. Porsche will add an AWD Panamera Hybrid (priced a bit less than $100,000) to its sedan line, plus two newly efficient engine variants and a host of now-standard creature comforts.Elsewhere, BMW Group's MINI will give the world premier MINI Countryman with a plug-in hybrid option. The BMW brand will also offer a BMW 740e xDrive sedan, BMW 330e, and a massively updated BMW i8 super electric car.BMW won't be the only one to show a new halo car of sorts. Jaguar will also be announcing a totally new halo car at a swanky party before the show, along with showing a $1.4 million Classic XKSS at a separate, off-site event later in the week. Jaguar had announced earlier this year that it would indeed resurrect the classic XKSS, which was originally a two-seat D-Type that won Le Mans three years in a row from 1955 to 1957. The curved work of art is widely considered the world's first supercar.Mercedes will deepen its impressive lineup here with previews of the blisteringly fast AMG GT line: Spots with an AMG GT C Roadster, AMG GT Roadster, and AMG GT R are all planned. What it won't have, Mercedes executives say, is that rumored pickup truck: ""While a pickup is under consideration for the U.S. market at some point, no timeline is available for a decision to be made,"" a spokesman said in an email earlier this week.Along with an A5 Cabriolet, Audi will have a special collector's edition R8 V10 supercar that comes with laser lights.The Los Angeles company Divergent will show its 3D-printed Blade supercar; it claims the car will use a 700-horsepower bi-fuel engine that goes from zero to 60 in two seconds. Another fringe sub-brand, Aria, will show its first concept supercar at an event in downtown L.A. The brand has said the car is a two-door, two-seat, rear-wheel-drive Corvette V-8 engine machine. It will get 650 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque on its eight-speed transmission, according to a press statement.Fisker, which announced plans for a new supercar earlier this year, will not show in L.A., although its eponymous founder, Henrik Fisker, echoed the idea that the year will emphasize ""electric mobility.""There will still be one or two things for track-loving driving enthusiasts, however. Lamborghini will show a new Huracan Spyder rear-wheel drive. The open-top stunner is not a hybrid, and it's certainly not fuel efficient. But the aggressive Huracan will stand out as delightfully analogue among the myriad futuristic green machines expected at L.A.

4,GT,"The stock market opened lower early Wednesday, and the Nasdaq lagged, weighed down by weak earnings from Apple (AAPL) late Tuesday.The Nasdaq lost 0.5%, the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1% and the S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%.The stock market today opens with the Nasdaq struggling against an undertow caused by Nasdaq 100 bellwether Apple, which dropped more than 7% after reporting its first-ever drop in iPhone sales late Tuesday. Key supplier Broadcom (AVGO) fell hard early but reversed, rising 0.6%.Beyond the Apple effect, investors will be looking toward this afternoon's policy announcement from the Federal Open Market Committee, scheduled for 2 p.m. ET.Pending home sales numbers for March are due out at 10 a.m. from the National Association of Realtors.Crude oil jumped almost 2% early Wednesday after posting a 3% gain on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate traded just below $45 a barrel. The crude supply report from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showed an unexpected 1.1 million barrel draw on oil inventories. The Energy Information Administration releases its weekly inventories data at 10:30 a.m.The jump in crude prices helped energy stocks outperform in the S&P 500. Meanwhile, S&P 500 component and  IBD 50 stock Michael Kors (KORS) sewed up a 3% gain after Piper Jaffray upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral and lifted Kors' price target to 67 from 54.Take a look at Michael Kors' financial and technical vital signs using IBD's Stock Checkup feature.At the low end of the S&P 500, H&R Block (HRB) and Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT) plunged at the open. Goodyear slumped 6% after reporting a broad Q1 miss. H&R Block  cratered 15% after it forecast flat tax-season revenue after total returns prepared decreased nearly 5%.Early leaders in the Dow included United Technologies (UTX) and Boeing (BA). Boeing added 0.8% even though its Q1 earnings stopped short of analyst consensus views, hurt by a one-time charge related to its KC-46 tanker program. Revenue rose 2%, above expectations.Dreamworks Animation (DWA) spiked 15% on news that Comcast (CMCSA) was in talks to buy the movie maker for more than $3 billion. Comcast also reported stronger-than-expected Q1 earnings. Shares were up almost 3%.Security software developer Fortinet (FTNT) leapt 8% in early trade. The Sunnyvale, Calif., company reported a clean Q1 sales and earnings win late Tuesday.  Shares ended Tuesday up 34% from a February low, climbing the right side of a deep, eight-month correction.Twitter (TWTR) tumbled 16%. The microblogging site's Q1 revenue rose 36%, shy of analyst projections. EPS climbed a better-than-forecast 114%, but management's Q2 revenue guidance missed expectations by a wide margin.

5,GT,"WOW! What a day...the headlines are screaming...not sure what to say first! One of these headlines has to cause some action in the mkt.......Apple, Twitter, Trump, Clinton, Yellen, The FED, The Economy, Oil ???? and the list goes on.....Interestingly enough though - all of these negative headlines are not causing global mkts to go into implosion mode - and while Asian mkts ended the day lower (Apple ) , European mkts are mixed to slightly higher...US Futures this morning are off only 4 pts - which is a bit of a surprise considering all the talk last night after Apple (AAPL) reported a MISS on every line....Revenues, Sales, EPS, Margins etc.....the headlines detail the sentiment""Apple Sinks on IPhone Stumble""

"
13,GT,"So which one will she choose to give?Stocks were little changed yesterday as investors/traders held their breath all day waiting on the release of the Apple earnings, the results of the primaries, and speculation over what Janet would say next.....trading was light yet again as the economic data continues to point to growing weakness in the US economy.2 pm today brings us the long awaited FOMC speech......Now do not expect the FED to address any of the politics at all....but you can be sure that Saturday Night Live will have a field day with it.....Technically overbought? From a technical perspective the markets continue to hover in highly overbought territory - if you look closely at the indexes you will see that there is a technical weakening occurring across the broad number of issues despite prices mostly going sideways in April. We can credit the efforts by the FED as we headed into tax season and the April FOMC meeting – especially coming off a disastrous beginning to the 2016 year...now while the 1Q may have been a bit overdone to the downside - this 'forced' rally has clearly taken us well beyond on the upside as well.....which is why we keep struggling at 2100 on the S&P.After yesterday's key earnings disappointments and continued weaker eco data - a Hawkish FOMC speech will be the catalyst the mkt needs to back off.....how can anyone really expect the mkt to surge higher on a hawkish speech in light of all the negative data points? So clearly then, a Dovish speech will cause the algo's to hit the BUY button - sending the mkts higher - but will it change the psychology.....because in the end - a dovish speech at this point in the game (7 yrs) should not be taken as a positive at all...... Tomorrow brings us 1Q GDP and the estimates are all over the place - with some suggesting a negative print while the majority see a barely positive print. Either way - it is NOT suggestive of a strong, robust economy just yet.As noted - yesterday's Durable Goods report was a fairly large disappointment - now while it was positive - it was below expectations while Durable Goods EX transports missed miserably - coming in at -0.2% vs the expected +0.5%.Today's eco data includes Mortgage Apps - reported at -4.1%, Pending Home Sales exp at +0.5% and the big decision at 2 pm. Earnings include BHI, BA, GD, GT, IPP, GCI to name a few...but expect that much of the conversation will be all about Apple.....as nearly every station will be tearing the results apart as they try to connect the dots around the world..... Apple is currently trading down 8 pts or 7.5% at $96.50....it has clearly broken all major support and will have to work hard to hold the line.....US futures are now down 5 pts - while we still remain in the 2080/2100 trading range....now while individual names will get clobbered today.....and the Nasdaq may come under more pressure - both the Dow and the S&P will be less affected. It does not feel like a disaster is looming at all....but as the day progresses - and the speculation builds over what Janet will do - watch as the mkts react.....if they hold steady then expect speech B.....which is exactly what I expect we will hear. That being said - buyers will defend the position - because in the end - has anything really changed? ...None of the headlines are really new.....most of what we are seeing have been the expectations all along.....and we continue to live in La, La land.....Overnight in Asia - mkts all lower - but there was not the Apple implosion that so many expected.....the word is that investors there are much more interested in the comments by the FED as well as the BoJ and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand due out tomorrow. Japan -0.36%, Hong Kong -0.21%, China -0.37% and ASX -0.63%.European mkts are bucking the trend...all in slightly positive territory - seemingly unfazed by the Apple earnings at all.....Banks rallying on the back of some positive forward guidance coming from Barclays. Oil moving higher +1.7% - has now broken thru resistance at $44.23/barrel - paving the way for a surge to the psychological $50 number.

14,GT,"Last year, the New York Police Department’s mounted unit announced that it would move from the Hudson River Pier 76 stable it had occupied for a decade to a new uptown haunt, the Mercedes House. Maybe it was kismet that the new space, which has been home to 1,000 luxury-condo residents since 2011, has an automotive name. A car club -- the car club, if you live near New York -- officially took over the equines’ old spot April 1. It’s kind of a big deal.“While we might be a private club, Classic Car Club has never been elitist,” co-founder Michael Prichinello said recently during a private tour of its new space, which sits at the corner of 34th Street and the West Side Highway. “Now that we’re part of Hudson River Park, we will be increasing our event space and weekend activities, like car shows, gallery exhibits, mechanics, and educational programs for kids.”The Classic Car Club has been a gear head fixture for 11 years. It offers 38 supercars, including a McLaren 570S, BMW (BAMXY) i8, Shelby GT350, Lamborghini Huracan, ’66 Ford (F) GT, and an ’89 Lancia Delta rally car, plus a bunch of track-ready 911 GTs, all available to drive. If you're counting, that's well over $1 million worth of high-end autos. Its just-vacated far West SoHo space was one of the go-to spots for car parties, debuts and networking events for the automotive industry. This year alone it has hosted debuts for new Singer Design vehicles, Cadillac launches, and McLaren unveilings.The club works thusly: Members pay $180 in monthly dues and then must purchase “points” that buy them driving days for the car of their choice. A year of driving typically costs $9,000, plus dues, for 35 days behind the wheel. There’s no additional insurance fee; just make sure you return the car with a full tank of gas.Everything inside the SoHo space had been private, including the bar and lounge. And membership to the club was capped at 450 people. That will change, Prichinello said.The new club is bigger, with 28,000 square feet of internal space vs. the old club’s 9,400, plus additional parking and a 15,000-square-foot outside patio area, a quarter of which is right on the water. The old space held dozens of horses and offices for 20 officers. It had radiant-floor-heated stalls for each horse, plus a dirt-floor riding arena under a white dome out front; a hay loft dropped hay from a high attic area directly down to the main floor. That column-free warehouse is now the main showroom, with 31-foot-high ceilings and giant windows out onto the Hudson. Walking around the space, it was easy to see how the old police stalls -- with the hay loft and horse showers removed -- would afford ample sunlight and climate-controlled elegance, basically a state-of-the-art car gallery or museum. This time around, the public can finally have access to many of the cars, too (for looking, not driving).Prichinello said the club will start offering storage for an additional 20 classic and collectible cars (a MX-5 Miata, Mercedes AMG GT, and 2017 Ford GT are due to join the ranks in the next months), plus storage for boats and paddle boards and immediate water access on a reclaimed public beach. The club won’t provide kayaks for that beach, but people can store small watercraft there without having to buy a membership. A full cafe operated by the club and some educational rooms will operate toward the front of the building, accessible from the popular jogging and cycling trail that runs the length of Manhattan’s West Side Highway. There will still be a bar, for members only, inside a private lounge.The renovation will add tall windows, green areas, and places to sit right off the jogging trail so the formerly closed-off space is easily accessible to anyone who wants to ogle a cool car.Prichinello and two co-founders will allow an additional 25 members to join as driving members and extend “Club House” membership to 1,000 people. The latter grants access to the member lounge and the event space but keeps driving rights restricted.Club House membership costs $180 a month, with the price expected to exceed $200 later this year. Applications for those open Wednesday, with new members to be inducted in several batches during the summer and fall. (That may be a good option for getting in on this new version of the Classic Car Club early, since the waiting list for driving memberships is four-months long.)Development on the reconstruction has already started; most will be done by the end of the year. Rather than a grand opening, Prichinello said, he’ll host a series of dinners in the new main gallery for VIPs and friends of the club.It’s a smart move to do a few of those special suppers, especially considering that all anyone will want to do anyway is just sit with the cars and pick the one they want to drive. Prichinello is fully aware of the demand. It’s a blessing and a curse.“There will be a few new vintage convertibles for the summer,” he said, smiling. “Those we buy when the right one surfaces. We’re currently on the hunt.”

16,GT,"Stocks shifted into staggered losses as trade bucked higher on Friday, with earnings results and oil prices stirring a fair share of early action.The Dow and the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% apiece. The Nasdaq narrowed its early decline to trade a fraction lower, aided by a rally among chip equipment stocks.Volume rose sharply as options expirations drove early trade up 53% on the NYSE and 16% higher on the Nasdaq.Today's weak start was the stock market's first dip out of the starting gates in this holiday-shortened week. For the week, indexes still hold solid gains, with the Dow trading up 2%, the Nasdaq ahead by 2.8%, and the S&P 500 showing a 2.1% gain. The options expiration trade clouded the view a bit into behavior among institutional investors, as bulls are generally on the lookout for quiet action while leading stocks build bases.Oil prices contributed to the market's early weakness with West Texas Intermediate slipping more than 3%, back below $30 per barrel to traded effectively flat for the week. Baker Hughes (BHI) releases its weekly rig count data at 1 p.m. ET.Nearly all of the Dow index stocks traded lower, with Boeing (BA) and Chevron (CVX) at the bottom of the list, nearing 2% declines. Advancers held to gains of less than 0.2%.Chip equipment makers headed the S&P 500 as Applied Materials (AMAT) rose more than 9% after a narrow fiscal Q1 sales and earnings beat, followed by better-than-expected guidance. Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) were next in line with gains of 5% and 3%, respectively.Yahoo (YHOO) also figured into the mix, jumping 3% after announcing it had formed a committee of independent directors and enlisted services of JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and PJT Partners to explore strategic options. The company has been vexed over whether and how to spin off its stake in China's Alibaba Holdings (BABA), valued at nearly $40 billion.Among IBD 50 stocks, Surgical Care Affiliates (SCAI) popped more than 2% after its Q4 earnings met, and revenue easily topped consensus forecasts. The stock has been fighting to hold above its 10-week moving average as well as a 41.09 buy point since a mid-January breakout.Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT) retreated 3%, slipping to the bottom of the list.

29,GT,"A pair of automotive suppliers heading in different directions — Johnson Controls (JCI) and Delphi Automotive (DLPH) — topped quarterly earnings views Thursday but fell short on revenue, pushing shares lower.Likewise, Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT) also topped profit views and fell shy on sales.Johnson Controls logged adjusted earnings of $1.04 a share for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in September. That was up from 91 cents the prior year and 3 cents above consensus analyst views. Revenue fell 13% to $8.7 billion, below estimates.The No. 1 U.S. auto parts supplier guided fiscal 2016 Q1 earnings of 80 cents to 83 cents a share. That's below the 84 cents expected by analysts prior to Thursday's earnings report.Johnson Controls looks to reduce its automotive supply business so it can focus more on growing its battery-manufacturing and building heating and cooling segments. In July, the company announced plans to spin off its low-margin automotive-interiors business segment into a separate publicly traded entity.In contrast, Delphi continues to expand its auto business. In its third-quarter earnings release Thursday, the company announced the acquisition of Control-Tec, a provider of software that analyzes vehicle testing events during the late stages of product development.

30,GT,"""Fed Keeps December Rate Hike In Play - Officials remove explicit mention of concern at overseas tumult, delivering warning to markets"" - WSJ 10-29-15
"
31,GT,"The operative word in that headline is 'Play'....in this case Play is defined as 'engaging in activity for enjoyment or fun - to amuse oneself'  
"
32,GT,"""Federal Reserve officials explicitly said they might raise short term interest rates in December pushing back against investors who have bet that the central bank wouldn’t move this year.""
"
33,GT,"They continue to try and convince us that they are going to move in 2015....and December is their last opportunity.......but can they really?  US macro data continues to weaken,  The U6 Underemployment rates is still above 10%, inflation remains frustratingly low,  congress just approved a disastrous 'spending plan' kicking their responsibility into the NEXT CENTURY,  The ECB announces a new bigger & better QE type program to further stimulate that sagging economy, and China?  Well they cut short term lending rates last week in a last ditch effort to 'boost growth' while they continue to threaten another currency devaluation.....and Hilsenrath thinks that these moves signal 'STRENGTH'.........and pave the way for the FED to raise rates?   Now in a move to show us how serious they really are - the FED "" struck from their policy statement a sentence introduced in September that pointed to market turbulence and global developments as potential restraints on U.S. economic activity. As those concerns recede, the Fed has fewer impediments standing in the way of a rate increase.""
"
34,GT,"Now the funny thing is that the FED is clearly split....some say go, while other say no.......and yesterday's statement was supposed to remove any doubt at all about the coming increase.   Remember - the FED remains 'data dependent' so we will get two more months of 'data' before the FED meets again on Dec 16th/17th.....but remember - they may have wanted to send 'that wakeup call' but in the end - yesterday's statement DID NOT commit to a December move.....(they left the door slightly ajar so that they have an exit plan....) 
"
35,GT,"And amuse themselves is exactly what they did.....Stocks rallied early on prior to 'the announcement'  - the DOW was up 131 pts at 2 pm.....then the news hits...the mkts stumbles as it dissects the headline...then the algo's hit......sending stocks into a minor tailspin sending the DOW  - down 287 pts - from hi to lo.....in a matter of 13 mins.....only to reverse and surge higher into the close as the 'smart algos' realized that the statement didn't really say anything new...there was NO definitive decision....there was nothing in there that sets the path for a move in December at all.....Yeah - there was a vague reference to a move - but does anyone really believe it to be true?  Not yesterday anyway...as they closed the mkt on its highs  at 2090 on the S&P and 17,779 on the DOW..... You gotta love when the FED speaks out of both ends, no? 
"
36,GT,"It is interesting to think that all of a sudden the FED thinks that economy is ready to launch..... Remember!  The Fed hasn’t raised interest rates since 2006 - (they have only lowered them)  and here 9 yrs later  when we have zero interest rates (while some countries have negative rates)  - we also have manufacturing crashing, durable goods and retail sales plunging our national debt approaching $19 trillion, housing still struggling, healthcare costs soaring, wages stagnating,  entitlement programs exploding, Underemployment still in the double digits, weak commodity prices, struggling global economies, half the world in recession and the other half gasping for air and NOW she thinks it's the right time to launch?   Is it me?  Now all this says is that monetary policy alone cannot solve the world's problems....so I once again point the finger at leadership.....or lack of...but hey...that's a conversation for another time I guess.....
"
37,GT,"In the end - The FED made it clear that they won't raise rates until they are 'reasonably confident' that the data supports the move.....and that ain't happening in 60 days.....
"
38,GT,"Technically  - the mkt has enjoyed a surge off the August lows...making everyone 'feel better' but is it really better?   Have we moved too fast and now need to play catch up?  I think that answer is yes....and as the mkt gets used to the latest FED speak and analysts/strategists recalculate the possibilities - I suspect that we see the mkt back and fill..... Last night we ended at S&P 2090.....a good 30 pts above support.....earnings are coming to an end and so the focus will return to more broader global macro issues once again....For now - I think we are in the 2060/2100 range...and if the 'data' continues to disappoint then expect the mkt to find its legs and push higher (indicating NO rate increase) ....but if as Janet indicates - the 'data' becomes stronger -then yes....look for the mkt to back off as the reality of an 'increase' hits home....and the mkt re-prices.  Either way - I do not think we get a move in 2015...so I suspect that the mkt churns and attempts to return closer to the yearly highs (2150)  as we approach year end.
"
39,GT,"Now this morning - US futures are off 8 pts  as we await the first release of 3rd QTR GDP...and it does not have a 3 handle on it, and it does not have a 2 handle on it......we will be lucky if it has a 1 handle on it...as the Atlanta FED suggests it will be 0.9% (vs. the robust 3.9% in the 2nd qtr) and some of the biggest investment banks in the country are looking for 1.2% - 1.4% .  The 'official' (govt) expectation is for a reading of +1.6%.... and if it comes in stronger then I think someone will have 'a lot of 'splainin to do' ......
"
40,GT,"Look for earnings today from MasterCard (MA),Western Union  (WU), CME Group  (CME),Air Products  (APD), Good Year Tires  (GT), Coca Cola  (KO), Pitney Bowes  (PBI),  and Marathon Oil  (MRO).....
"
41,GT,"European mkts are in negative territory.....not big, but a bit softer....earnings are the focus.......DBK reports a loss of $6.5 bil  and said that they will CUT their workforce by some 26k jobs over the next 2 yrs - sending that stock lower.........Barclays also missed on their earnings....sending that stock down 4.5%... Frances Total Oil reports a 69% drop in revenue....(no surprise)  and they take the stock UP......Take good care. Kp

82,GT,"GT Advanced Technologies has reached a settlement agreement with Apple (AAPL) under which GT will exit the sapphire glass manufacturing business and pay back Apple for the money it was advanced.
"
83,GT,"GT Advanced filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Oct. 6. The Merrimack, N.H.-based company reportedly was having problems producing sapphire display covers for future iPhones and Apple Watches, and was missing milestones under its supply agreement with Apple.

85,GT,"If the agreement is approved by the bankruptcy court, GT Advanced will retain ownership of all production, ancillary and inventory assets located at the Mesa factory and will sell its advanced sapphire furnaces to repay Apple.

124,GT,"The saga of disgruntled, and bankrupt, Apple supplier GT Advanced Technologies will go on at least a little longer than planned, after a court hearing to discuss a bankruptcy settlement between GT and Apple was postponed to Dec. 10 from Nov. 25.Unsecured creditors of GT Advanced sought the postponement to give them more time to investigate possible objections to the settlement. GT itself has agreed to the proposed settlement after offering some harsh words for the world's most valuable company.Bankruptcy court documents that GT had filed over the past month shine a light on the otherwise secretive relationship of Apple with its suppliers, or at least one supplier, though Apple (AAPL) denies most GT allegations.GT claims that its contract as an Apple supplier was ""oppressive,"" driving it to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy.GT says that it had to sign a nondisclosure agreement calling for a $50 million penalty for leaking information. GT made scratch-resistant sapphire glass display covers to be used for high-end versions of the Apple Watch, slated for release early next year. The sapphire displays had been expected to be used for the new iPhone 6, but so far Apple has stuck with Corning 's (GLW) Gorilla Glass for its iPhones.Apple has a very different perspective. It claims to have ""bent over backwards"" to work with GT Advanced, making payments even though the supplier ""failed to meet performance milestones.""Apple calls itself flexible in negotiations. The firm adds that many allegations by GT Advanced are false and defamatory, and ""portray Apple as a coercive bully,"" according to court documents obtained by IBD.These details came to light after District of New Hampshire U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Henry Boroff unsealed the Apple supplier's court documents on Nov. 6, as the two companies were hashing out a settlement.Sought To Unseal DocumentsGT Advanced said that it had petitioned the court to allow it to reveal the nondisclosure details in the interest of creditors, equity holders and other stakeholders. It said that unsealing the details would ensure an ""open, transparent and fair process.""Apple is reputed to be a tough negotiator with great leverage in dealing with suppliers, and finding out specifics about its contracts can be impossible, says Srini Sundararajan, an analyst with Summit Research Partners.""Often, the best way is to look at 10-Qs and 10-Ks of Apple's current and prior vendors, a laborious process,"" Sundararajan said. Even then, the documents aren't likely to include much information, he says.GT Advanced claims that Apple's nondisclosure agreements ""provide that each breach of the confidentiality obligations will require (GT Advanced) to pay liquidated damages to Apple in an amount of $50 million per occurrence,"" according to the court documents.GT Advanced Chief Operating Officer Daniel Squiller said in an affidavit that his company had become a ""captive supplier"" of Apple, enduring ""constant interference"" and arbitrary changes in product specifications.GT Advanced said that it sold ""every unit of sapphire material at a substantial loss,"" racked up as much as $900 million in expenses and had to lay off 1,300 workers.GT Advanced stock plummeted from 19.77 on June 28 to 80 cents when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Oct. 6. It's now trading near 50 cents over-the-counter.Apple said in court documents that it will ""continue evaluating GTAT's progress on larger sapphire boule development,"" and will help bankruptcy-affected employees find new jobs.GT Advanced claims that Apple told it to ""put on your big boys pants and accept the agreement"" when GT pressed its concerns about terms of its sapphire agreement, which it says was ""strategically structured"" to benefit Apple.GT Advanced also said that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its sapphire business and that it is cooperating with authorities.Apple said in its own filing that GT Advanced's allegations made by contain ""extensive, unnecessary, scandalous and defamatory statements about Apple's alleged intent, motives and business tactics."" The document says that many of GT Advanced's statements are ""gratuitous, false and wholly irrelevant.""""These statements are intended to vilify Apple and portray Apple as a coercive bully,"" Apple stated in court documents.Despite the harsh words, on Nov. 4 GT Advanced said in an SEC filing that it has signed an amended settlement agreement with Apple and is seeking bankruptcy court approval.""We have been working diligently to develop a restructuring plan that will allow us to emerge from Chapter 11 as quickly as possible and with the operating flexibility and resources to position GT for long-term success,"" GT said in an Oct. 23 statement announcing the original settlement , which was amended on Nov. 5.GT Advanced plans to wind down its sapphire production and exit the market as a producer of sapphire materials to refocus as an equipment supplier and maker of products used to manufacturer sapphire as well as photovoltaic and polysilicon solar products. Apple will be able to recover $439 million in prepayments that it made to GT Advanced, say the documents.GT Advanced claims that it had to file for bankruptcy after the deal to provide sapphire for Apple's iPhones ""collapsed.""GT Advanced, which said that it has more than 40 years of experience developing ""technological innovations in connection with the manufacturing of furnaces to grow sapphire for industrial use,"" added that it had signed a contract in October 2013 to install more than 2,000 sapphire-growing furnaces to be operated in a facility that Apple would provide. GT said that the transaction had the potential to be ""revolutionary"" for its business and a ""significant achievement for Apple.""Time And Money IssuesGT Advanced added that Apple had negotiated over price and terms, and agreed not to buy the furnaces. Instead, GT Advanced would borrow money from Apple to purchase furnace components and assemble furnaces that would grow sapphire for Apple, court documents said. Under the deal's terms, GT Advanced said that it was to acquire 2,036 sapphire furnaces using $578 million ($439 million were fully paid) in total prepayments from Apple.But GT Advanced said it could not produce the volume of sapphire ""within the time frames the parties had agreed, and was more expensive than anticipated.""Apple said that it had paid GT Advanced $439 million in prepayments and spent another $700 million-plus in connection with the transaction despite receiving ""only a small fraction"" of the original commitment of GT Advanced.""Far from the villain in these Chapter 11 cases, Apple is the largest victim of the debtor's failure to perform under the agreements it negotiated at arms' length and with the advice of counsel,"" Apple stated in court documents.GT Advanced, however, claims that it could not modify its equipment, manufacturing processes or much of anything else without Apple's approval. GT also said that it had to offer Apple prices at least 5% below what it charged anyone else.Apple's contract instructed GT Advanced employees to refer to the sapphire display contract by the code name ""Onyx,"" court documents said.Apple noted that the impact of its deal with GT Advanced included a stock price hike for GT.""The price of a share of common stock of GT Advanced rose more than 20% upon the announcement by the debtors that they had entered into an agreement with Apple to supply sapphire,"" Apple said.

143,GT,"Skyworks Solutions A Big Winner In iPhone6 Chips.Skyworks Solutions' (SWKS) increased chip content inside Apple's iPhone6 models prompted Canaccord Genuity on Monday to raise its target price to 64 from 62 and reiterate a buy rating.""Based on our analysis, industry discussions and recent teardown reports, we believe Skyworks increased its dollar content share by more than 10% in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices vs. the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c models and remains a key leading RF (radio frequency) supplier to Apple (AAPL),"" Michael Walkley, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said in a research report on Monday.Skyworks stock, however, was down nearly 3% in afternoon trading in the stock market today list of top-performing stocks despite tumbling more than 8% on Wednesday.Canaccord's recent surveys indicate ""extremely strong demand"" for the iPhone 6 products that it says is likely to translate into strong Q4 sales and market share gains for Apple in the high-end smartphone market vs. Samsung and others.Apple's iPhone 6 will go on sale in China on Oct. 17, about a month after hitting store shelves in the U.S. The iPhone 6 models will be available in 115 countries by year-end, Apple said. Weaker than expected 4G smartphone sales in China could be a reason Skyworks stock is down Monday, TheStreet said.A look inside the iPhone 6 models by the tech-repair firm iFixit in Melbourne, Australia, on Sept. 19 revealed that Skyworks and other chip companies were the winners in supplying key components, while others missed out.GT Advanced Technologies' (GTAT) sapphire glass was not incorporated into the new iPhones, and on Monday the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Its stock was down 87% in afternoon trading, near 1.40.Among other chipmakers benefitingfrom the iPhone6 models are Avago Technologies (AVGO), TriQuint Semiconductor (TQNT) and RF Micro Devices (RFMD). RF Micro and TriQuint await final regulatory approval for their merger to create a combined company named Qorvo.RELATED:Skyworks Solutions A Big Winner In iPhone6 Chips.

146,GT,"As a rookie salesman, Harvey Firestone learned a vital lesson:
"
147,GT,"Focus energy on the big customer.
"
148,GT,"The result was a pumped-up life in business.
"
149,GT,"What did Firestone (1868-1938), who went on to create Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., mean by big?
"
150,GT,"The customer didn't necessarily have to own a big business. As Firestone put it, he or she could be on the way to having a big business.
"
151,GT,"The key, according to the son of a humble yet productive Ohio farming family, was to identify buyers who saw a chance to expand their business and boost sales fast.
"
152,GT,"Firestone grasped that point during his first job as a seller of vanilla flavorings, rose-scented lotions and other extracts for his employer and friend, O.D. Jackson.
"
153,GT,"Arriving in Apple Creek, a tiny town in northern Ohio, in the 1890s, Firestone spotted two general stores and several shops where he could sell his products.
"
154,GT,"Lacking confidence, he first tried the small stores. The owners flatly refused.
"
155,GT,"Not ready to give up, Firestone called on the owner of one of the big outlets. To the salesman's surprise, the busy boss made time to listen to his story, then made an order on the spot.
"
156,GT,"""Unless a man on the first approach shows signs of wanting to make money, it is a waste of time to try to convince him that he ought to buy,"" Firestone wrote in ""Men and Rubber"" with Samuel Crowther. ""Thereafter, when I entered a town, I always tried the largest and not the smallest store first.""
"
157,GT,"The Ford Drive
"
158,GT,"In 1905, after he co-founded a rubber tire company five years before that first served horse carriages and later cars and trucks, Firestone used that strategy to land a supply deal with Henry Ford for 2,000 sets of car tires.
"
159,GT,"It was Firestone's biggest order.
"
160,GT,"At the time, his firm was small fry — not big enough to join the G&J Clincher Tire Association.
"
161,GT,"Made up of well-established rubber-tire companies, the association worked like a monopoly. It set production quotas for each member firm and set prices uniformly.
"
162,GT,"The G&J also treated customers with arrogance. It offered Ford, who was on the verge of revolutionizing the car industry with mass production, a fixed price of $70 for a set of tires based on clincher technology, in which wheel collars held the tire in the rim's steel channel.
"
163,GT,"When Firestone heard that Ford aimed to make an order for 2,000 sets of tires, he sped to Detroit, met with the car magnate and pitched a better product that would cost only $55 (worth $1,450 now) per set.
"
164,GT,"Ford, after testing the tires, wrote Firestone the order.
"
165,GT,"Over nearly three decades, Firestone Tire achieved phenomenal growth. Sales at the Akron, Ohio-based firm bulged from $150,000 in 1902 to $115 million (worth $1.3 billion now) in 1920, a compounded annual growth rate of 44.6%.
"
166,GT,"By 1937, a year before Firestone's death, sales reached $157 million (or $2.5 billion today) while profit jumped to $9.2 million (worth $144 million now).
"
167,GT,"From 1900 to 1920, his company's workforce grew from 10 employees to 19,800. At one point, the shortage of Akron housing forced him to partner with rival companies and buy land to develop residential communities. This fostered worker loyalty.
"
168,GT,"During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many companies were crippled by union-backed strikes. Firestone avoided massive shutdowns by paying above-average wages and finding employees who enjoyed the challenge of working in a fast-growing industry.
"
169,GT,"""Firestone was one of the first among the big companies to work out accommodating contracts to unions,"" Daniel Nelson, professor emeritus of history at the University of Akron, told IBD.
"
170,GT,"He notes that in contrast, the 1936 strike at rival Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT) lasted until the start of World War II.
"
171,GT,"Japan's Bridgestone Group, a global tire maker, acquired Firestone Tire & Rubber in 1988.
"
172,GT,"Growing up in Columbiana in northeast Ohio, Firestone learned much about business just by observing his father, a small-time farmer.
"
173,GT,"The older Firestone, Harvey wrote, didn't necessarily work harder than other farmers in town. He just did things smarter.
"
174,GT,"Benjamin Firestone used a little more fertilizer than others to ensure high yields. He focused on cattle farming rather than dairy because it was more profitable and less labor-intensive.
"
175,GT,"And when he had a great year on the farm, he kept money in reserve to weather future bad harvests.
"
176,GT,"The son adopted a similar policy in the tire business.
"
177,GT,"Despite making a profit right from the beginning, he refused to pay shareholders a dividend. He plowed profit back into the firm to expand capacity, try new technology and hire more workers.
"
178,GT,"He also succeeded by sticking with a market on a roll: car tires.
"
179,GT,"""He saw the virtue of specialization of an industry,"" said Nelson. ""B.F. Goodrich and U.S. Rubber fell behind by making a range of items, like raincoats, galoshes and hoses.""
"
180,GT,"What else did Firestone do differently to achieve success?
"
181,GT,"• Innovated aggressively. By working closely with scientists and factory foremen, Firestone made solid-rubber tires that were higher in quality than the competition.
"
182,GT,"Even as his young company shifted sales and profit into high gear, Firestone focused on the new technology of air-filled tires.
"
183,GT,"Such tires became the standard in bicycles but busted under the weight of horse-drawn buggies.
"
184,GT,"Now with the car industry in the fast lane, Firestone knew he had to incorporate the technology to keep and expand his customer base.
"
185,GT,"So he employed the brightest engineers he could find. This led to the development of mountable tire rims, letting car owners easily replace air-filled tires.
"
186,GT,"Result: more driving, more tire sales.
"
187,GT,"• Chose managers carefully. The company boss wanted thoughtful, not loudmouth, talent.
"
188,GT,"He did not want ""the kind of man who can give me an instant decision on anything I may bring up, for, if he has not had the opportunity to give the question serious thought, then he is only guessing,"" Firestone wrote.
"
189,GT,"• Reserved time to think. In 1920, the U.S. economy froze after booming during the 1914-18 First World War. Sales orders were canceled across a bevy of industries, including car tires.
"
190,GT,"Firestone was vacationing in Europe and suddenly received a cable saying the company's bankers wouldn't lend a penny more. Production stopped due to no sales.
"
191,GT,"Firestone rushed back to Ohio to learn that his firm owed $43 million, worth $483 million today.
"
192,GT,"Deliveries for rubber and other raw materials were coming in with no money to pay for them.
"
193,GT,"Stacks of tires lay like bricks inside the company factories.
"
194,GT,"After listening to his brass on a Friday morning, Firestone told his staff that he needed time alone to think it over. He spent the weekend on his farm, then returned with a plan that shocked his team: Cut the price of tires by 25%. Now.
"
195,GT,"Managers voiced disagreement, but Firestone refused to budge.
"
196,GT,"The fire sale worked.
"
197,GT,"In September and October alone, Firestone Tire & Rubber sold $18 million worth of merchandise. That cash slashed the company's outstanding borrowing from $43 million to $31 million — or $273 million today.

He just did things smarter.Benjamin Firestone used a little more fertilizer than others to ensure high yields. He focused on cattle farming rather than dairy because it was more profitable and less labor-intensive.And when he had a great year on the farm, he kept money in reserve to weather future bad harvests.The son adopted a similar policy in the tire business.Despite making a profit right from the beginning, he refused to pay shareholders a dividend. He plowed profit back into the firm to expand capacity, try new technology and hire more workers.He also succeeded by sticking with a market on a roll: car tires.""He saw the virtue of specialization of an industry,"" said Nelson. ""B.F. Goodrich and U.S. Rubber fell behind by making a range of items, like raincoats, galoshes and hoses.""What else did Firestone do differently to achieve success?• Innovated aggressively. By working closely with scientists and factory foremen, Firestone made solid-rubber tires that were higher in quality than the competition.Even as his young company shifted sales and profit into high gear, Firestone focused on the new technology of air-filled tires.Such tires became the standard in bicycles but busted under the weight of horse-drawn buggies.Now with the car industry in the fast lane, Firestone knew he had to incorporate the technology to keep and expand his customer base.So he employed the brightest engineers he could find. This led to the development of mountable tire rims, letting car owners easily replace air-filled tires.Result: more driving, more tire sales.• Chose managers carefully. The company boss wanted thoughtful, not loudmouth, talent.He did not want ""the kind of man who can give me an instant decision on anything I may bring up, for, if he has not had the opportunity to give the question serious thought, then he is only guessing,"" Firestone wrote.• Reserved time to think. In 1920, the U.S. economy froze after booming during the 1914-18 First World War. Sales orders were canceled across a bevy of industries, including car tires.Firestone was vacationing in Europe and suddenly received a cable saying the company's bankers wouldn't lend a penny more. Production stopped due to no sales.Firestone rushed back to Ohio to learn that his firm owed $43 million, worth $483 million today.Deliveries for rubber and other raw materials were coming in with no money to pay for them.Stacks of tires lay like bricks inside the company factories.After listening to his brass on a Friday morning, Firestone told his staff that he needed time alone to think it over. He spent the weekend on his farm, then returned with a plan that shocked his team: Cut the price of tires by 25%. Now.Managers voiced disagreement, but Firestone refused to budge.The fire sale worked.In September and October alone, Firestone Tire & Rubber sold $18 million worth of merchandise. That cash slashed the company's outstanding borrowing from $43 million to $31 million — or $273 million today.By Oct. 31, 1924, the firm had wiped out all debt.Tighten OperationsFirestone realized operations needed smart cost cutting. The office force fell from 1,000 to 300. The statistics department shrank from 35 employees to three, without a drop in the quality of data needed to make proper decisions.""Thought, not money, is the real business capital,"" he wrote. ""If you know absolutely that what you are doing is right, then you are bound to accomplish it in due season.""

"
259,GT,"In the early 19th century, rubber fever was rampant.
"
260,GT,"Many believed the material could have thousands of applications and make its inventor and manufacturers fabulously rich.
"
261,GT,"But before the jackpot was a serious problem.
"
262,GT,"Rubber, in its natural state, was unstable. It had to be vulcanized — a chemical process that solidifies its physical properties.
"
263,GT,"""Without vulcanization, rubber in warm weather is soft and gooey and in cold weather hard and brittle,"" Keith Price, a spokesman for Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT), told IBD. ""Stability was the key to opening the rubber market.""
"
264,GT,"So the race was on among inventors worldwide to find a process that vulcanized rubber.
"
265,GT,"In the thick of that competition was Charles Goodyear.
"
266,GT,"He crossed the finish line first by unlocking the secrets of raw rubber and creating a global industry of rubber products.
"
267,GT,"Goodyear (1800-60) was born in New Haven, Conn., and grew up a serious and religious boy.
"
268,GT,"He drew some of his inventiveness from his father, Amasa Goodyear, who invented farming tools and was a leader in the development of hardware.
"
269,GT,"A Handle On History
"
270,GT,"In 1830, Charles joined his father's business. When it failed, the young man turned to something that might support himself and his family: rubber.
"
271,GT,"Rubber had an intriguing history.
"
272,GT,"Christopher Columbus visited Haiti in 1493 and watched natives toss a bouncing rubber ball. The balls were made from a milky fluid, the consistency of honey, which the Indians harvested by tapping trees and curing the fluid with the smoke of palm nuts.
"
273,GT,"In 1736, French astronomers visiting Peru brought home samples of a milky fluid and reported that Indians used it for waterproof shoes.
"
274,GT,"Also in the 18th century, Joseph Priestley, an English theologian and chemist best known for his discovery of oxygen, noted that pencil marks could be ""rubbed out"" by the puzzling substance. From this early use, rubber derived its name.
"
275,GT,"Goodyear, unlike Priestley, knew nothing of chemistry. Yet that didn't stop him from experimenting in the 1830s. His New England kitchen was often his laboratory, with pots and pans his scientific equipment. Other times he set up labs in New York and Philadelphia, wherever he could find space.
"
276,GT,"To keep his experiments on the hot burner, Goodyear borrowed money. He needed it, what with his and Clarissa's six children.
"
277,GT,"Finally came the big discovery in 1839. As he experimented with a mixture of rubber and sulfur, he accidentally dropped the mixture on a hot stove. He collected the mixture and found, surprisingly, that it was not sticky, but dry.
"
278,GT,"He then heated the mixture to a high temperature, cooled it and found the rubber was not sticky in hot weather or brittle in cold weather. It stayed soft and springy.
"
279,GT,"Goodyear had discovered vulcanization by adding sulfur to rubber.
"
280,GT,"Still, perfecting it — creating a formula and the precise degree of heat necessary to maintain a stable product — was a process.
"
281,GT,"Goodyear had made exceptional progress. Now his challenge was to find monetary backing.
"
282,GT,"He sold his worldly goods. He even sold his children's schoolbooks for a paltry $5. He would do anything because he believed he was on the verge of success.
"
283,GT,"At last, in 1844, Goodyear perfected his formula and landed his first patent for stabilizing rubber. Half a century later, his stabilization would launch the tire industry.
"
284,GT,"Goodyear's discovery appeared to some accidental, although he countered it was no more random than Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity while watching an apple fall from a tree.
"
285,GT,"Discover And Litigate
"
286,GT,"Goodyear said his discovery over the hot stove had meaning only for the man ""whose mind was prepared to draw an inference.""
"
287,GT,"Once he established his patent, he had to fight pirates who refused to pay royalties on his invention. Not one to back down from a fight, he hired lawyer and statesman Daniel Webster to prosecute 32 infringement cases. The legal wrangle went to the Supreme Court, where Webster prevailed in 1852.
"
288,GT,"Today, Goodyear's vulcanized rubber is used in millions of products, reports John Long, a rubber expert. ""But of these millions of products,"" he adds, ""rubber tires stand as the largest application of marketable rubber, capturing 70% of the rubber market and earning approximately $160 billion a year.""
"
289,GT,"Consider this factoid from Price: In 2011, 1,896,283,983 rubber tires were produced globally.
"
290,GT,"The other 30% of the rubber market bottomlessly involves shoes, outerwear, packaging, life rafts, boats, frogman suits, rubber bands, soccer balls, fire equipment, Frisbees, planes and medical supplies.
"
291,GT,"Clearly, Goodyear changed the world. Ed Miller, executive director of the American Chemical Society's Rubber Division, says the trajectory of Goodyear's discovery to rubber tires is clear.
"
292,GT,"He points out that as brilliant as the invention of the wooden wheel was in the fourth millennium B.C., it hardly offered comfort. Even 5,000 years later, the ride on the spheres was still rickety.
"
293,GT,"Imagine the discomfort of American pioneers traveling west on rutted roads in covered wagons rolling fitfully on wooden wheels.
"
294,GT,"Says Miller: ""First came the wheel, then the vehicle, then the rubber tire, then the auto industry and then, finally, highways. A key figure in this progression is, of course, Charles Goodyear.""
"
295,GT,"When he died at age 59, he had accrued 60 patents, some of which included intriguing rubber items: condoms and diaphragms. The Goodyears evidently didn't use them; they produced 12 children, six of whom died in infancy.
"
296,GT,"The Long Road
"
297,GT,"Goodyear lived to see his invention applied to several hundred products. He also lived to see some 60,000 people employed in the manufacture of rubber products, which, according to author Mary Bellis, produced $8 million worth of merchandise at the time — or $223 million in today's money.
"
298,GT,"In 1898 — 38 years after Goodyear's death — Frank Seiberling founded the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. The firm, headquartered in Akron, Ohio, really rolled in the 1990s, with its stock bolting 1,000% in the first eight years of the decade. Sales are still in the fast lane, reaching $23 billion in 2011.
"
299,GT,"In naming his company after Goodyear, Seiberling honored the right man. In any era, it would be tough to find anyone more optimistic about the tire's crucial substance than Charles Goodyear.
"
300,GT,"He envisioned rubber books, rubber checks, rubber bank notes, rubber flags, rubber ships, rubber jewelry. Goodyear's imagination ran wild, to the point where he wore a rubber tie, cap, vest and hat and carried a rubber purse. Even his autobiography was bound in rubber.
"
301,GT,"One wonders what Goodyear would think today about the astounding success of vulcanized rubber. What would he say about the annual global output of 2 billion rubber tires and millions of other rubber products?

Under the agreement, it will repurchase $200 million of its shares.Cooper's revenue increased 0.5% to $888.7 million, well above analyst consensus for $863.3 million. Earnings per share rose 7.2% to 59 cents vs. Wall Street's target if 80 cents.North America revenue grew 3% to $639 million on higher sales of new, higher-margin light truck and SUV products that Cooper introduced in the past year.Shares were up 1.6% in Thursday afternoon trading on the stock market today.No. 1 tire seller Goodyear Tire and Rubber's (GT) shares were up less than 1%. Titan International (TWI), the No. 3 tire seller behind Cooper, slid 0.6%.Cooper's strong U.S. sales were partly offset by an 8% drop in international sales to $327 million. Although international unit volume rose 5%, weakness in Russia and Eastern Europe impacted sales overall.Looking ahead, the company expects Q3 raw materials costs will be roughly flat with Q2. In the long term, the raw materials outlook is for costs to generally trend higher.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar .

GT stock touched an all-time high of 20.54 on Wednesday.GT has a contract with Apple for its sapphire glass, which is stronger than other glass and scratch resistent. But it's uncertain just how much the GT product might be used in smartphone and smartwatch displays.In the report, Jonathan Dorsheimer, an analyst for Canaccord Genuity, says Apple could severely limit the GT's sapphire cover glass in its upcoming iPhone 6 smartphone and iWatch devices. He rates GT stock a hold. Apple is widely expected to unveil its newest smartphone, the iPhone 6, and its first smartwatch, the iWatch, in September or October.""Earnings potential for GT Advanced Technologies lies somewhere behind a wall of Apple secrecy and numerous rumors. GT's sapphire material is reportedly going to be used in some unknown capacity as Apple moves toward releasing the iPhone 6 and other new devices,"" Dorsheimer wrote. ""We do not believe that the initial launch of the iPhone 6 will have a sapphire display in any material volumes, in either 4.7-inch or a 5.5-inch form factor,"" but might instead just be a limited volume premium option.Suppliers expected to benefit from Apple's iPhone 6 include Qualcomm.

375,GT,"Make no mistake about it, the Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) shorts are going to be covering.  We saw the first wave of shorts cashing in on a recent share price tumble, but what followed was only the start of what could be an epic run.The stock succumbed to a fabulous short ploy who called for bankruptcy in “a few months” – even though this was clearly a very low probability event.  Still, you have to hand it to Vilas Capital and their CEO, CIO and CFA charter holder who went on a PR campaign to help increase the value of his puts.That short term trade worked well for Vilas, but those that are short the stock are going to be feeling some pain soon.  Let’s take a look at the upcoming catalysts that will likely send shares of TSLA to new all time highs.Car Sales DataThe shorts won’t be helped if Tesla misses sales estimates.  I know that flies in the face of common sense, but the fact is that TSLA has come up short of expectations far more than it has beaten the number.Tesla announces quarterly car sales on or about July 6, 2018 – but the numbers don’t really matter.  To be clear, the numbers kind of matter, but we already know they are pretty good.  They will show solid growth for all models, but that isn’t the story.The story is all about getting the Model 3 to production levels of roughly 5,000 per week. As we get to the final two weeks of June, the company is ramping up its efforts to make more cars and meet this goal.  But let’s face it, Wall Street will not punish them if they don’t!5,000 A WeekWhether or not 5,000 comes in June or July or August, people want a new TSLA.  There is demand for these cars, far more than any other model being built (at these price points).The end idea is the cars are coming and buyers are there.  So when the company announces sales and does… or more likely doesn’t reach that level, the shorts will scream ‘bloody murder!’What the shorts seem to have forgotten is that 5,000 a week is only a stepping stone to 7,500 a week and then 10,000 a week.  But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.  It was only a few short months ago that the Model 3 was breaking 1,000 a week consistently.Sales EstimatesI would tell you that Model 3 sales numbers are the be all and end all if that were true, but they are not.  Each and every Model 3 TSLA makes in the year 2018 is basically already sold. They will not be able to satiate the demand for the car.News outlets like Bloomberg have produced a fancy model to track the VIN’s and ask buyers of the car to register it with them so they can more accurately forecast the production level.  If you go by their estimates you will come to around 24K cars made this quarter… give or take.That give or take is the idea that the model isn’t perfect and the numbers change on a daily basis.  Plus there is the idea of the final two weeks of the quarter likely to be the strongest so even if they just average 4K per week in those last two weeks the number balloons to 32K for the quarter.In TransitIt is important to note that TSLA is conservative with how it counts cars as actually being sold. They have to be delivered to the owner with all the paperwork being properly filled out. Over the last several quarters the in transit number has been a few hundred to a few thousand.This time around we should expect to see a number closer to 10K.  Maybe not more than 10K, but something close to that level. Why is that?Well with the production ramping up at the end of the month, it is rather unlikely that more than 10% of the cars made in the final week of the month will be counted as sales.  The week before will also have a solid production number but we should only expect 75% of those to reach their final destination.That in transit number from the prior quarter will help, but next quarter it will become MEANINGFUL.Summer SqueezeSo now that the shorts realize the number doesn’t matter, let’s focus on what is important.It really comes down to production consistency.  As that improves, and if the past is any indication that it will, then we could see another big squeeze.With 39M shares short, we could see the stock blister over $400 before the end of July.The 39M number was where we stood at the end of May.  The next time the number is updated will be after the close on 6/26 for shares short as of 6/15.Beyond that there is another update that will reflect the true panic of shorts as the sales number is about to hit.  On June 29, expect a healthy cover trade as brokers will have to report shares short and then release that data on July 11.  There was a big cover trade day on June 12, the day after the most recent report was released.  The stock closed at $332 the day before and rallied to close at $342 as volume spiked to 22M shares. The reason for that rally was the idea that the shorts were still holding their positions, or as we like to say, they were keeping their shorts on.  Fearing further exposure they covered in a blizzard of volume only to see shares continue to surge.What Lies AheadOf course there is an early August earnings release, and that will likely be a positive catalyst.  I say this because of comments from management that led Wall Street to believe the company will be nearly breakeven or better.Elon Musk has also suggested that a massive squeeze is coming and he has done this before… and been right. But what else could come to propel those shorts to cover?The small version of the Model X is coming, but that is further down the road.  So I thought about some more immediate potential catalysts for Tesla.PartnershipsI floated the idea that Google parent Alphabet  could make a strategic investment in the company.  GOOG has its own autonomous driving unit, which hasn’t had much in the way of breakthrough announcements.  Google Maps is already a big part of the Model 3 so there are reasons to believe that they come in and buy any future debt or equity offering.Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) or John Deere (DE  -  Free Report) also make sense from a partnership perspective. The heavy equipment makers have taken note of the potential for greater efficiencies for their vehicles, so a partnership would make a lot of sense.Another idea would be a supplier in the ecosystem stepping up. I mean how ironic would it be if Goodyear Tire (GT  -  Free Report) made a financial commitment to TSLA to remain the supplier of tires for the next few years … basically the complete opposite of what Vilas Capital proposed. My guess is that Elon Musk has an even bigger bunny in his hat.  The last few times he talked about massive short covering it came to fruition.  At the end of the day, that is what investors should really be paying attention to.Disclosure: Brian Bolan is long TSLA in his trading and retirement account.

Meanwhile, local TV ratings jumped as well on outlets such as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Fox Sports FOXA. This all comes in contrast to the NFL’s ratings declines over the last two years.Viewers and investors should also note that the NBA secured its first-ever presenting sponsor for the NBA Finals, with Google’s (GOOGL) YouTube TV featured throughout the broadcast in an array of ways. Going forward, the NBA’s close relationships with the likes of Google and other streaming services could play a huge role in its future success.But it’s not just the NBA’s TV partners benefiting from the league’s growth, the likes of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Western Union WU, Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Goodyear GT, and many more have joined in on the fun. And this comes on top of the major investments American Express AXP, Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) continue to make.Furthermore, Nike NKE looks poised to benefit from its new NBA partnership that might see it remain in business with the league for a long, long time—especially as the likes of Adidas ADDYY and Under Armour UAA become less relevant in the world of basketball.The NBA is already much bigger than nearly every sports league in the world on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). It has also established a strong relationship with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) through multiple Twitch streaming deals, which includes the rights to the league’s brand new esports league it developed with Take-Two Interactive TTWO.Looking ahead, the NBA’s growth in China—through partnerships with Tencent (TCEHY  -  Free Report) and Weibo (WB  -  Free Report)—will be intriguing to follow.As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

378,GT,"The NBA Finals begin Thursday night, with two of the league’s biggest stars, LeBron James and Steph Curry, set to face off for the NBA title. But while many will look at how the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors played up to this point, it’s also a great time to check out how some of the NBA’s biggest sponsors performed during the season.Sports Apparel The common thought among many investors is that Curry’s star power hasn’t helped Under Armour UAA stock much over the last year, as it tries to adjust to life as a much bigger company. Curry’s direct impact is debatable, but the company’s stock price has performed rather well since the start of the 2017-18 NBA season in mid-October.Let’s take a look at how it has stacked up against the NBA’s official jersey sponsor and basketball shoe juggernaut, Nike NKE, as well as Adidas ADDYY. Investors will see that despite some of the recent love thrown Adidas’ way, both Nike and Under Armour stock have greatly outperformed the German sports apparel powerhouse since the start of the NBA season. Clearly, there are many other factors impacting these stocks aside from the exposure that the NBA provides, but it is a fun exercise nonetheless.Jersey Sponsors  Nike, which became the official jersey sponsor of the NBA this season, greatly outpaced its two closest rivals. With that said, this season also marked the first time the NBA allowed jersey sponsorship patches. In total, 21 out of the 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with companies paying an average of $6.5 million per year to place their logo on a team’s jersey—worn by both the players and fans.The inaugural jersey patch season saw some major publicly traded companies join in on the NBA’s growing business. This list includes General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union WU, Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Lending Tree (TREE  -  Free Report), Sun Life (SLF  -  Free Report), Ultimate Software (ULTI  -  Free Report), and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report).Clearly, some of the bigger names on the list have all gone through a massively disappointing stretch during their first year as official team jersey sponsors. It’s also worth noting that three out of the four conference finals teams that had a sponsor this year—the Warriors and Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY; the Cavaliers and Goodyear; and the Boston Celtics and GE—all saw their stocks prices fall over 25% since the start of the season.But don’t be surprised if underperforming companies continue their sponsorships as these investments offer a ton of exposure for a relatively small amount of marketing dollars. This becomes even more likely when looking at the NBA’s television ratings, which saw an 8% surge across the league’s four TV-network partners, Disney’s ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV.TV Partners Investors might remember that the NBA is currently benefiting hugely from its nine-year, $24 billion rights deal with ESPN and Turner that runs through the '24-25 season. This is significant money even for these entertainment giants, which means it’s worth taking a look at how ESPN parent Disney and Turner owner Time Warner have performed throughout this season.Biggest Corporate Sponsors Lastly, it is worth taking a look at some of the NBA’s overall corporate partners, which not only advertise heavily but also sponsor the league. Three of the league’s biggest corporate partners are American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) via Frito-Lay, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade.Obviously, all of the companies touched on throughout this article have much larger priorities beyond their affiliation with the NBA. Therefore, none of this stock price movement is a direct reflection on the NBA’s growing business, which saw its overall sponsor revenue surge 31% to $1.12 billion—placing it not too far behind the NFL.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

379,GT,"The NBA Finals tip off Thursday night, pitting LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors for the fourth straight season. The speculation and predictions have already begun, but let’s leave the guessing to the NBA experts and look instead at the NBA’s rapidly growing business.James, who is set to play for his eighth straight NBA title, Curry, and Kevin Durant are all global superstars. All three are some of the biggest names for some of the biggest sports apparel companies in the world, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) for James and Durant, and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) for Curry.The three biggest names in the NBA Finals are also successful pitchmen as well as investors, making millions on and off the court. On top of the success of these superstars, the NBA has become one of the most successful sports leagues in the world and its business has never been bigger.TV RatingsThe NBA saw its overall national TV ratings climb 8% from last season to hit 1.28 million, according to Nielsen. This uptick comes across the league’s four television-network partners: Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV. The 2017/18 season also marked the NBA’s best overall ratings average since the 2013/14 season and stands in stark contrast to the NFL’s ratings decline.The league has also performed well on television throughout the playoffs. The struggling ESPN’s overall NBA playoff ratings were up 31% from 2017, with Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals drawing 13.305 million viewers—which marked the second-largest total for an NBA game in ESPN history. Meanwhile, TNT’s coverage of the Western Conference finals climbed roughly 33%.These ratings will be fun to pay attention to throughout the NBA Finals as the league’s performance on television might have major implications for sponsorship partners and help determine the NBA’s negotiating power going forward.  Sponsors The NBA introduced for the first time this season jersey sponsorship patches, which allowed teams to negotiate their own deals with companies for the rights to a 2.5 inch by 2.5 inch patch on players’ left sleeves. In total, 21 out of the league’s 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with notable teams from big markets, including the Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets, taking the court without patches.With that said, the rest of the teams made some big money from deals. The average patch deal brought in roughly $6.5 million per year, and accounted for roughly $137 million of total sponsorship revenue, according to IEG/ESP.The recent influx of new revenue helped the NBA pull in $1.12 billion in total sponsorship money this season, which marked a 31% surge from the $861 million last season. It is also worth noting that the NBA rested just behind the NFL’s $1.25 billion.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney, Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union (WU  -  Free Report), eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report)-owned StubHub, and Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report) were just some of the notable jersey sponsors in the inaugural season. The two teams that face off in the NBA finals stand to help provide even more exposure for their corporate sponsors: Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY for the defending champion Warriors, and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report) for its hometown Cavaliers.The 2018 NBA Finals mark another first for the NBA when it comes to boosting its top line, with Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV acting as the first-ever presenting sponsor for the NBA Finals. The YouTube TV logo will appear all over the place, including the official NBA Finals logo. Meanwhile, select markets are also expected to be able to watch ABC’s NBA Finals coverage on YouTube TV.Looking AheadFrom the NBA’s partnership with Take-Two Interactive and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch on its new esports league to its active expansion in China and other growth markets, the NBA’s business looks poised to keep on booming.Going forward, these deals should help the NBA become even more popular and relevant as it fights to stay on the cutting-edge of content distribution and outside the box business ventures.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

380,GT,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, Ben Rains speaks with GumGum Sports General Manager, Jeff Katz about how artificial intelligence is drastically changing the way we understand sports sponsorships.GumGum is a computer vision-based artificial intelligence company that uses its proprietary technology to work with advertisers and publishers, including McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Ford (F  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and many more, to help them place contextually relevant ads wherever their target consumers are most likely to see them. Katz is in charge of GumGum’s Sports division, which aims to help companies and brands understand the real value of sponsorships, from jersey ads to in-arena signage.GumGum’s AI helps to provide a more overarching view of the value of sports sponsorships by incorporating social media reach of non-owned and operated accounts. Katz and GumGum also hope to enlighten teams, leagues, companies, and everyone else involved about the impact of brand placement across television, desktop, mobile, and maybe most importantly, social media platforms.GumGum currently tracks the effectiveness of the NBA’s brand placements, where Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) has seen a great return on its investment during the first year of its multi-year rights deal—after taking over from rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report). Meanwhile, the NBA also became the first major North American professional sports league to adopt on-jersey advertisements, with Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), and many others all sponsoring teams during the inaugural jersey patch season.   The conversation flows from the NBA and UEFA Champions League soccer to the NFL and what social media outlets—Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Instagram, and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report)—provide the best exposure and impact. Katz also spoke about the future of live sports on streaming services such as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch, and how this could change the scope of sponsorships.Make sure to listen to the whole podcast to learn a lot more about how artificial intelligence is changing the way sports sponsorships are evaluated, and what companies are currently reaping the benefits.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

381,GT,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings numbers on Feb 8 before the market opens. Last quarter, the tire manufacturer witnessed a positive surprise of 6%. Of the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in three and missed in one with an average beat of 7.5%.In the last three months, shares of Goodyear have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 17.3% compared with the industry’s rally of 17.9% during the period.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Quote What’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Results?Goodyear invests in projects with high return rate. It is constructing a facility in Luxembourg in order to manufacture premium tires. Scheduled to open in 2019, the facility will enable the company to manufacture premium products, in line with increasing demand from the company’s growing customer base.Also, the company is trying to boost its shareholder value. In October, it announced a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per share, registering 40% growth from the previous amount of 10 cents. Further, it undertakes share repurchase programs. During 2017-2020, the company plans to make a capital deployment of $3.5-$4 billion.However, a competitive environment, weak demand and decline in operating income across all segments, are a few concerns for Goodyear.The company anticipates operating income of approximately $1.5 billion for 2017, down from the previous guidance of $1.6-$1.65 billion.For the soon-to-be-released quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of Americas, the company’s largest geographical segment (constituting almost 55% of total revenues), is pegged at $2.06 billion in comparison to the third quarter’s actual sales of $2.04 billion.For the second-largest geographical segment, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (30.2%), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales stands at $1.27 billion. While the third quarter’s actual figure for the EMEA segment net sales was $1.31 billion.Further, the consensus mark for Asia-Pacific’s (14.5%) net sales in the fourth quarter stands at $605 million, an increase from $569 million recorded in the third quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Goodyear is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — an Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Goodyear has an Earnings ESP of +12.00% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 84 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goodyear carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Thus, this combination raises the chances of an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other stocks worth considering from the same space with the right combination of elements to outpace earnings estimates this time around:Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.40% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. (AXL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.81% and the company is a Zacks #3 Ranked player. Its fourth-quarter 2017 results are expected to be released on Feb 16.Tenneco Inc. (TEN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.92% and the company is a #3 Ranked player. Its fourth-quarter 2017 results are slated to be announced on Feb 9.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

382,GT,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s leading tire companies, with operations around the world and one of the most recognized names in the business.It operates through three segments—the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; and Asia Pacific—developing, manufacturing, marketing, and distributing tires for most applications.Goodyear also operates roughly 1,100 tire and auto service center outlets where the company offers customers products for sale and provides automotive repair and other services.Sitting at a #5 (Strong Sell), Goodyear experienced unexpected headwinds this year that negatively impacted its performance.Disappointing Third Quarter ResultsGoodyear faced many challenges in its third quarter, including lower consumer replacement volumes, production cuts by automakers, and an over 30% increase in its raw material input costs.As a result, adjusted earnings fell almost 40% year-over-year to 71 cents per share, though the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus of 67 cents.Revenues of $3.92 billion only marginally beat our consensus estimate as well. Breaking it down by segment, revenues in the Americas slipped 1%, but EMEA and Asia Pacific revenues grew 6% and 5%, respectively.Goodyear said that tire unit volumes were 39.8 million, down 5% from 2016. Replacement tire shipments fell 4%, while original equipment unit volume declined 9% year-over-year due to lower volume sales.And, segment operating income dropped to $357 million in the reported quarter from $556 million a year ago.Hurricane ImpactThe decline in Goodyear’s Americas segment was due to the major hurricanes that devastated large swaths of the country earlier this year.It operates three chemical plants in Texas, and has tire distribution and retail operations in the affected areas that were either damaged or shut down.In particular, sales at company-owned locations were negatively impacted by about $23 million, and Goodyear incurred roughly $12 million in hurricane-related costs during the quarter.Overall, Goodyear estimated that the negative impact caused by the hurricanes on the U.S. consumer replacement industry was approximately 1%.Earnings Estimates LoweredSince the report, it seems that analysts are bearish on GT’s future outlook.For the current quarter, four analysts cut their estimates in the last 60 days, lowering the Zacks Consensus to 73 cents from 92 cents per share; this represents a year-over-year decline of 22.74%.This sentiment even spills over into next year, where six analysts revised their estimates lower over the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus now sits at $3.74 for fiscal 2018, down from $4.24.Can Shares Rebound?Shares of Goodyear have only returned 1.8% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500’s bullish gain of 18.8% in the same time frame.The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and Consensus The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and Consensus | The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company QuoteGoodyear currently trades at a forward P/E of 11.Major storms like Hurricane Harvey had a huge effect on companies in every industry, and Goodyear is just another example of one.Assuming we experience far less devastating hurricanes next year, and assuming Goodyear now has the knowledge to handle a situation like that, its Americas segment should be back on a growth track as well, joining its solid EMEA and Asia Pacific divisions.For investors looking for an auto space stock with more near-term potential, they should consider SORL Auto Parts (SORL  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock that anticipates 58% earnings growth for the year.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other. He believes in its short-term profit potential and also in its prospects to more than double by 2019. Today he reveals and explains his surprising move in a new Special Report. Download it free >>

383,GT,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Goodyear is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for GT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 84 cents per share for GT, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for GT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +12.00% heading into earnings season.The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Quote Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that GT has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Goodyear, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

384,GT,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 and full-year earnings on Feb 7, 2018. Last quarter, the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line beat the same.Also, at third-quarter earnings release, the company announced its outlook for 2017. Tesla had expected a year-over-year surge of 30% in its Model S and Model X deliveries. Further, it planned to manufacture about 10% fewer Model S and Model X in order to focus more on the Model 3 production.Now talking about the actual vehicle deliveries in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company witnessed a 27% year-over-year rise in deliveries to 29,870 vehicles. Of the total, 15,200 were Model S, 13,120 were Model X and 1,550 were Model 3.Tesla Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Tesla Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Tesla Inc. QuoteMoreover, Tesla delivered a total of 101,312 Model S and X vehicles in 2017, exceeding its projection by 3% over the previous year. This increase in deliveries will help uplifting the company’s Automotive segment revenues.However, for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Tesla expects its automotive gross margin to decline around 15%, sequentially. This downside is primarily due to a considerable escalation in Model 3 manufacturing costs. (Read more: Will Progress in Model 3 Production Aid Tesla's Q4 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s another segment, Automotive Leasing, stands at $311 million, up from the third-quarter’s actual net sales of $286 million.Per Tesla, Energy generation and storage segment is expected to see a contraction in its gross margin figure in the fourth quarter. This fall will be due to seasonality of generation by solar assets as well as the increasing mix of energy storage sales. However, this figure is expected to improve in the future with an amplified production capacity of Gigafactory 1, better capacity utilization and reductions in manufacturing costs.Also, in December 2017, the company started manufacturing its premium solar roof tiles at Gigafactory 2, installations of which, are likely to commence in the subsequent months of 2018.Moreover, a rise in the company’s used car sales has aided Service and Other segment revenues as well as the gross margin to augment in the third quarter, logging $304 million and $63 million, respectively. This uptrend is anticipated to continue in the following quarter with Tesla’s service network expansions.Earnings Schedules of Other Major Auto CompaniesAmong other automotive companies, Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN  -  Free Report) is expected to release results on Feb 14 whereas The Goodyear Rubber & Tire Company (GT  -  Free Report) and Tenneco Inc.

385,GT,"Fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is in full swing. A few auto companies have already come up with their quarterly numbers. One major automaker which has come out with quarterly results is Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report).

During the quarter, the automaker logged automotive revenues of $41.3 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.2 billion.In fact, it has not been a good week for Ford. Also, the vehicle maker was repeatedly been asked by a Washington-based auto safety group to recall around 1.3 million Explorer sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).

387,GT,"Welcome to the latest episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we explore the growing international business of the NBA at the halfway point of the 2017-18 season.Last season, NBA attendance hit a new high for the third year in a row. This year, television ratings are up as much as 25% on ESPN and TNT, while the NFL’s linear TV struggles draw near-constant headlines.The NBA’s multibillion-dollar media rights deals with Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and Time Warner  helped lift the league’s salary cap almost single-handedly. The league also tipped off its new Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) jersey sponsorship deal this season, which not only marked a 245% increase from the previous deal with Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), but also led the NBA to add sponsorship patches on jerseys for the first time.Japanese tech power Rakuten RKUNY reportedly shelled out $20 million per year to sponsor the Golden State Warriors, while the likes of Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), eBay’s (EBAY  -  Free Report) online ticket giant StubHub have also jumped on the first major U.S. jersey sponsorship deal.Meanwhile, at a time when the average NFL and MLB fan is getting older, the NBA has been able to keep the average age of its fans down. This has been driven in part by a push on social media, where the NBA outpaces the NFL on both Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) in terms of followers.The league also recently announced a new partnership with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch streaming service as it explores the possibilities of a streaming future. What’s more, through a partnership with Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report), the NBA is set to become the first major North American professional sport with its own esports league later this year.The league and its management have also focused a lot of resources to expand the NBA outside of the U.S., and this effort has helped the NBA become increasingly popular in the world’s second-largest economy, China. But the NBA’s popularity in China might just be heating up as the league continues its attempt to become an expanding global sports powerhouse. If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

Original equipment unit volume was down 12%, while replacement tire shipments declined 1% year over year.Segment operating income decreased to $87 million from $152 million, a year ago.

390,GT,"Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Oct 17, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.03%.Harley-Davidson is the world’s leading designer and manufacturer of heavyweight motorcycles. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter’s earnings being revised 2.4% downward over the last 30 days to 41 cents per share.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Harley-Davidson, Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing This QuarterIn the third quarter of 2017, the motor company expects to dispatch around 39,000-44,000 motorcycles, representing a decline of 10-20% from the year-ago period. Also, stiff competition and huge price discounting might hit Harley-Davidson’s retail sales.Additionally, Harley-Davidson will be paying $15 million as settlement charges to the Environmental Protection Agency due to its super tuners releasing harmful emissions despite power generation. Of the total amount, a whopping $12 million will be paid as civil penalty. Per the deal, the company will also buy back all the devices and discontinue future sales of the product. These actions will further add to its expenses.However, in order to increase its customer base, Harley-Davidson focuses on expanding product portfolio and making long-term investments. The company aims to launch 100 new motorcycle models by 2027. Further, to improve the international reach, it has been adding new dealerships with a target of clinching 150 to 200 new global contracts by 2020. With these initiatives, the company expects to achieve positive growth in overseas retail sales in the second half of 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Harley-Davidson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Harley-Davidson has an Earnings ESP of -4.45% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 39 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. A positive ESP on the other hand, serves as an indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Harley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and chances of an earnings beat. However, combined with a negative Earnings ESP, surprise prediction becomes inconclusive.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Price PerformanceShares of Harley-Davidson have declined 20.3% year to date, substantially underperforming the industry’s 26.7% rally.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks worth considering from the Auto industry as per our model, these have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:Magna International, Inc. (MGA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2.

398,GT,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings numbers on Apr 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the tire manufacturer witnessed a positive surprise of 30.3%. Of the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in three and missed in one, with an average beat of 12.7%.Over a year, shares of Goodyear have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 23.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 25.1%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Quote Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Goodyear is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — an Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Goodyear has an Earnings ESP of +6.29% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 47 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goodyear carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Thus, this combination raises the chances of an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Results?Goodyear invests in projects with a high rate of return. It is developing and launching a number of products and services to remain competitive in the market and boost sales. In March, the company offered a preview of its EfficientGrip Performance tire’s prototype. Developed to cater the electric vehicles segment, the tires are enabled with electric-drive technology and are sturdier than the regular ones. The specialized tires will be available in Europe by 2019.Further, the company also displayed the recent advances made in its intelligent tire prototype, developed for fleet operators. The prototype helps to manage tire issues, faced by the fleet operators that are important for the business model as well as customers.Based on these innovative product launches, the company anticipates achieving the segmental operating income target of $2-$2.4 billion in 2020. It aims to achieve profitable growth and reduce operating and structural costs by 2020.Also, Goodyear pays regular quarterly dividends and frequent share repurchases with an aim to boost shareholder value. In January 2018, it declared a dividend of 14 cents, to be paid on Mar 1, 2018. During 2017-2020, it plans to make a capital deployment of $3.5-$4 billion.However, competitive environment, increased raw-material costs and drop in worldwide volume sales are a few concerns for Goodyear.For the soon-to-be-released quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of Americas, which is the company’s largest geographical segment (constituting almost 53.4% of total sales in 2017), is pegged at $2 billion in comparison with the fourth quarter’s actual sales of $2.18 billion.For the second-largest geographical segment, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (32.1%), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales stands at $1.24 billion. While the fourth quarter’s net sales were $1.26 billion for the EMEA segment.Further, the consensus mark for Asia-Pacific’s (14.5%) net sales in the first quarter stands at $514 million, a decline from $623 million recorded in the fourth quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other stocks worth considering from the same space, with the right combination of elements to outpace earnings estimates this time around:BorgWarner Inc.

400,GT,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Goodyear Tire has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.2. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Goodyear Tire’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Rubber - Tires industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 8.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Goodyear Tire has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 7.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Goodyear Tire stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Goodyear Tire has a P/S ratio of about 0.4. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, GT is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Goodyear Tire currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Goodyear Tire a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Goodyear Tire is just 0.6, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.3. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 4.1, which is far better than the industry average of 7.1. Clearly, GT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Goodyear Tire might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F. This gives GT a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging. The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen two up and three down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 41% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has gone down by 6.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and Consensus The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and Consensus | The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineGoodyear Tire is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 18% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

Solid growth of 17.1% (19.2% ex-Financials) reported. Slowdown from fourth quarter pace of 30.9%, mostly due to super financial growth in 4Q. Growth ex-Financials as 19.8% in 4Q among the 495 that have reported.Quarterly net margins reported rise to 9.38% from 8.70% a year ago, up from 8.93% in fourth quarter. Margins excluding Financials rise to 8.22% from 7.53% last year, 8.05% in fourth quarter. In the second quarter 9.63% net margins expected, 8.56% ex-Financials.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 jumps 45.5% in 2010, expected to rise 14.8% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 14.6%. Financials a major earnings driver in 2010. Excluding Financials, growth was 27.4% in 2010, and expected to be 15.0% in 2011 and 13.2% in 2012.Total revenues for the S&P 500 rise 8.24% in 2010, expected to be up 5.30% in 2011 and 6.20% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues up 9.71% in 2010, expected to rise 8.94% in 2011 and 6.03% in 2012.Annual Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.39% in 2009 to 8.59% for 2010, 9.35% expected for 2011 and 10.11% in 2012.Margin Expansion major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.08% in 2009, 8.22% for 2010, 8.67% expected in 2011 and 9.26% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.42 for 2011, at 2.67 for 2012, both bullish readings. Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.59 for 2011, 1.84 for 2012, also very positive readings. Total revisions activity plunging.S&P 500 earned $545.6 billion in 2009, rising to $792.3 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $909.9 billion in 2011. In 2012, the S&P 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.043 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.13 in 2009: $83.15 in 2010 and $95.49 in 2011 expected bottom up. For 2012, $109.41 expected. Puts P/Es at 15.8x for 2010, and 13.8x for 2011 and 12.0x for 2012 -- very attractive relative to 10-year T-note rate of 3.18%. Top down estimates, $95.87 for 2011 and $103.94 for 2012.Still the Estimates Rise
"
404,GT,"The first quarter earnings season is almost done. We now have 496 (99.0%) of the S&P 500 reports in. Net income growth is 17.12%. While that is down from the extremely strong 30.9% that 495 of those firms posted in the fourth quarter, it is still a very strong growth rate. Almost all of the growth slowdown is from a failure of the Financial sector to repeat the massive growth they posted in the fourth quarter.
"
405,GT,"It’s not that the Financials are having a bad quarter, but they do face much tougher comps this time around. The 8.7% year-over-year growth they are reporting is not exactly awful (although it is below the rest of the S&P 500), it is that it pales in comparison to the 161.8% growth posted in the fourth quarter. That is despite a very strong sequential growth of 22.0%.
"
406,GT,"If we back out the Financials, total net income is up 19.2%, down just slightly from the 19.8% those firms reported in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the second quarter, growth is expected to continue to slow, falling 10.1%. Back out the Financials and growth is expected to be 12.6%.
"
407,GT,"Before the first quarter earnings season started, it was expected that growth would be just 6.7% for the S&P 500 as a whole, and 10.2% excluding Financials. Given the upward estimate momentum (more below) it seems highly likely to me that the actual growth in the second quarter will be significantly higher than the 10.1%/ 12.6% now expected.Revenue Growth Strong
"
408,GT,"Revenue growth is also very strong at 8.56%, up from the 8.31% growth they posted in the fourth quarter. Financials are a major drag on revenue growth, if they are excluded, reported revenue growth is 10.49%, up from the 8.35% growth posted last quarter. Revenue growth is also expected to slow in the second quarter, falling to 4.96% year over year for the S&P 500 as a whole. Revenue growth is expected to slip to 8.75% if the Financials are excluded.
"
409,GT,"Relative to the expectations before the quarter started, the revenue outperformance has been just as spectacular as the earnings performance. Before the earnings season started, growth expectations were just 1.41% overall, and 2.16% if the Financials are excluded.Net Margin Expansion
"
410,GT,"Net margin expansion has been a driver of earnings growth, but that expansion is slowing down, particularly if one excludes the Financials. Overall net margins are 9.38%, up sharply from 8.70% a year ago and from 8.93% in the fourth quarter.
"
411,GT,"Strip away the Financials and the picture is somewhat different, rising to 8.22% from 7.55% a year ago and from the 8.05% reported in the fourth quarter. At the start of the season, net margins were expected to be 9.13%, and 8.14% excluding the Financials.Cyclicals Lead the Way
"
412,GT,"The more cyclical parts of the economy are leading the growth charge this quarter. The highest growth comes from the Industrials sector, with growth of 66.0%. Three other sectors are posting growth over 40%, Materials (48.3%), Autos (46.9%) and Energy (40.6%).
"
413,GT,"Construction was by far the weakest sector, with net income plunging 34.3%. Utilities were the only other negative growth sector, with earnings falling 1.1%. Anemic -- but positive -- growth of 3.8% was posted for Staples.
"
414,GT,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.39% in 2009. They hit 8.59% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.35% in 2011 and 10.11% in 2012.
"
415,GT,"The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession; if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.08% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.22% in 2010. They are expected to rise to 8.67% in 2011 and 9.26% in 2012.Full Year Expectations Still Healthy
"
416,GT,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $792.3 billion in 2010, up from $545.6 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $909.9 billion, or increases of 45.5% and 14.8%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.043 Trillion.
"
417,GT,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $109.41. That is up from $57.13 for 2009, $83.15 for 2010 and $95.49 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding 3.03%, a P/E of 15.8x based on 2010 and 13.8x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 12.0x.
"
418,GT,"The analysts have responded to the better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter by raising their estimates for 2011. That’s not particularly shocking, as the first quarter is, after all, part of 2011, so if they did not increase in response to a positive surprise, they would implicitly be cutting their estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year.Impressive Estimate Increases
"
419,GT,"Still, the flood of estimate increases is impressive, with the revisions ratio sitting at 1.42. Total estimate revisions activity is now well passed its seasonal peak. Thus, over the next month or so, changes in the revisions ratio will be driven more by old estimates falling out of the four-week moving totals than by new estimate changes being made. The estimate increases are widespread, with the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to firms with falling estimates standing at 1.59.
"
420,GT,"There is no “mechanical reason for the estimates for 2012 to be rising; those are even stronger than the ones for 2011. The 2012 revisions ratio is now at 1.67, meaning that upwards estimate revisions are out pacing cuts by more than 5:3 for next year. The ratio of companies with rising to falling mean estimates stands at 1.84. Those are extremely bullish readings.Market to Continue Moving Higher
"
421,GT,"This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher. It is important to keep your eyes on the prize. There is lots of news out there -- and much of it is more dramatic than earnings results -- but rarely does it have more significance for your portfolio.
"
422,GT,"Earning are -- and are going to remain -- the single most important thing for the stock market. Interest rates are an important, but distant second....But Expect Some Turbulence
"
423,GT,"That does not mean that all is smooth sailing ahead. In a similar, but contrary nod to history, we are now at the softest part of the year (historically). There is a fair amount of truth to the old adage “Sell in May, but remember to return by November. Since 1945, the gain on the S&P 500 has averaged 6.8% (ex-dividends) from November through April, but only 1.3% from May through October.
"
424,GT,"The biggest threat to the market is if the debt ceiling is not raised by the beginning of August. If it looks like it will not happen; watch out. The Government of the United States defaulting on its debt is likely to have a somewhat larger impact on the markets and the economy than the impact of Lehman Brothers defaulting on its debts.
"
425,GT,"The nation would be shoved right back into recession, and one deeper than the one that followed the Lehman collapse. If that happens, then corporate profits would also collapse. However, when push comes to shove, I find it hard to believe that Congress would let that happen.
"
426,GT,"While not the most likely case, the chance of no increase by the time the ceiling is hit is a very real possibility. Given the disastrous potential consequences, taking out some insurance in the form of deep out of the money puts would make a lot of sense at this point.
"
427,GT,"We are already feeling the impact from lower government spending. First quarter GDP growth came in at just 1.8%, down from 3.1% in the fourth quarter. Total government spending was a drag of 1.09 points, up from being a 0.34 point drag in the fourth quarter.
"
428,GT,"In other words, 0.75 of the total 1.30 point growth slowdown (57.8%) was due to increased austerity in Government spending. The recovery is clearly slowing, but so far, that has not shown up in the analysts profit forecasts.Unemployment vs. Inflation
"
429,GT,"The unemployment rate bounced back up to 9.1% in May. Job growth slowed dramatically to just 54,000 in May from 232,000 in April. Overall job growth has been slowed by the loss of government jobs especially at the local level as stimulus funds dry up. Local governments laid off 28,000 in May alone and have handed out 267,000 pink slips over the last year.
"
430,GT,"Given that the unemployment rate has been higher than that in just 515% of the months since 1950, (more than half of which were during the Great Recession) one might expect that bringing down unemployment would be top of the agenda at both the Fed and on Capitol Hill. However, at Bernanke’s recent press conference, the focus was mostly on inflation.
"
431,GT,"The rate of headline inflation has been moving higher, but it is only up 3.2% over the last year. That is lower than what we have experienced for most of the last 40 years. Furthermore, commodity prices have just fallen sharply, so we might start to see some relief very soon. Core inflation remains very low, up just 1.3% over the last year.
"
432,GT,"This fear of phantom inflation is keeping further monetary easing off the table for bringing down unemployment. Because of the deficit, fiscal policy is also off the table. And despite tax revenue as a share of GDP being near a 60-year low, the growth slowdown due to the austerity campaign is likely to reduce tax revenues, and thus the budget-cutting will be very ineffective in it’s supposed goal of bringing down the budget deficit.
"
433,GT,"International Situation
"
434,GT,"The international situation clearly has the potential to abort the recovery as well. The disaster in Japan will clearly slow its economy dramatically in the second quarter, although much of that growth will be made up later in the year as the reconstruction process gets under way.
"
435,GT,"Many U.S.-made products have parts which are made in Japan and that is likely to disrupt production here. Factory output fell 0.4%, the first decline after 9 months of increases largely due to auto plants shut down for the lack of parts.
"
436,GT,"The debt crisis in Europe is not going away with Portugal now also getting bailed out, even as the ECB makes life tougher on the PIIGS by raising rates. Rates for the Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt are substantially higher than when the crisis first started. It is clear now that at least Greece will be forced to restructure (aka partially default) its debt. The austerity campaigns have weakened those economies and undermined tax revenues, and so the bailouts have not made the situation much better.Still Bullish Overall
"
437,GT,"On balance I remain bullish, and I think we will end the year with the S&P 500 north of 1400, but that does not mean we will have a smooth ride between here and there. Strong earnings are trumping a dicey international situation, and the drama in DC. However, be prepared to move to the exits (or have some put protection in place) if it looks like the debt ceiling will not be raised.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseFirst quarter season almost done. 495 (99.0%) of reports in. Results strong, with year-over-year growth of 17.12%, a 3.01 surprise ratio, and 3.70% median surprise. 67.5% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 359, falling EPS for 134 firms, 2.68 ratio, 72.5% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Construction only sector with more disappointments than positive surprises.Expected growth for 1Q at start of earnings season just 6.74%, 10.18% ex-Financials.Autos, Industrials, Discretionary, Conglomerates and Energy all have median surprises over 6.5%.Note that the sectors with high positive surprises also have best revisions.
"
438,GT,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus this quarter is about average.

"
443,GT,"In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
444,GT,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.

445,GT,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2011, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data.  The data is based on FY1, not based on 2011, even though I may call it 2011 in the report. All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.                    
"
446,GT,"The auto industry is highly concentrated, with the top 10 global automakers accounting for over 77% of production worldwide. In the first four months of 2011, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) led with a 19.6% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report) with a 16.2% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. (TM  -  Free Report) with a 14.1% market share, Honda Motor Co. (HMC  -  Free Report) with a 10.3% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 9.6% market share and Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY  -  Free Report) with a 8.5% market share.
"
447,GT,"The recent economic crisis provided the impetus for a massive structural change in the auto industry, setting the stage for growth over the next decade. Given the high barriers to entry and the need for scale economies (in operations, supply chain and marketing), the global auto industry landscape is expected to be ruled by global automakers and suppliers based in the six major auto markets – China, India, Japan, Korea, Western Europe and the U.S.
"
448,GT,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
449,GT,"To remain competitive, automakers will need to design vehicles that will meet the requirements of consumers in both mature and emerging markets. Automakers will focus on more user-friendly and low-cost vehicles that are also the most advanced technologically.
"
450,GT,"The automakers will continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. For example, Greater China and South America together are projected to represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015.
"
451,GT,"There are two underlying factors behind this location shift in the auto industry. The first is the cost factor. The cost of labor in emerging auto markets continues to be a fraction of that in the developed world. The second is the demand factor. Many low-cost regions, including the emerging auto markets, have high potential for growth. Thus, the shift in auto industry production facilities will lead to a localization of the manufacturing base that will bring down transportation costs.
"
452,GT,"The emergence of trading blocs is also giving this process a push in the auto market. It is likely that over time there will be fewer car imports from outside a trade zone.
"
453,GT,"The role of governments must not be overlooked. Governments in all major countries have become active auto industry players. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. 
"
454,GT,"Further, automakers have started to reduce the number of technological platforms with a greater diversity of models produced from each platform in order to remain cost competitive in the auto industry.
"
455,GT,"For example, Honda, with its flexible common platform, has developed three dimensionally distinct versions of the Accord, allowing for designs where 60% of the components are common. Ford aims to build 680,000 vehicles per core global platform by 2015, up from the current level of 345,000 units.""Green"" Cars
"
456,GT,"Higher fuel prices and concerns over global warming have pooled attention on the auto industry that either rely less on traditional fossil fuels or use renewable sources of less expensive energy. Thus, “green alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids will attract consumers in the wealthier countries while flex-fuels such as ethanol and natural gas will be highly sought-after in the emerging auto markets where the local climate or resource base favors their usage by automakers over petroleum.
"
457,GT,"Consequently, there will be a variety of powertrain technologies in the auto industry by the next decade. It is likely that “green cars will represent up to a third of total global sales in developed auto markets and up to 20% in urban areas of emerging auto markets by 2020. Some of the “green cars have already generated a huge response in the auto industry. These include the Ford Focus, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf, Toyota Prius and Daimler AG’s smart USA micro EV.
"
458,GT,"The market for hybrid cars was hit hard by the global economic recession in the second half of 2008 due to poor availability of consumer credit, low gas prices and other economic conditions. However, they are projected to become popular option for car buyers, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, as the economic backdrop has started improving again.
"
459,GT,"Globally, the hybrid market is ruled by Toyota and Honda. Meanwhile, other automakers such as Ford, General Motors and Nissan are also aggressively pursuing a plan to push hybrid sales.
"
460,GT,"U.S. is the largest hybrid car market in the world, with sales accounting for 60%–70% of global hybrid sales. According to J.D. Power and Associates, hybrid-electric vehicle sales volumes in the country are expected to grow 268% between 2005 and 2012. Presently, there are only 12 hybrid models available in the U.S., which would increase to 52 by 2012.Detroit’s Comeback
"
461,GT,"The ‘Big Three’ Detroit automakers – GM, Ford and Chrysler – lost consumer confidence in 2009 after they were severely hit by the global economic crisis. The crisis also exposed the inherent problem with the Big Three’s product portfolio, which lacked up-to-date engineering and extensive research and development.
"
462,GT,"Further, the majority of their sales comprised pickup trucks and SUVs rather than fuel-efficient vehicles such as the small cars that consumers have started to prefer. This skewed portfolio was further aggravated by the government’s push for fuel-efficient and environment-friendly cars. Ford rallied better than its hometown rivals, with an early response to the shift in consumer preference towards small cars.
"
463,GT,"However, the Detroit automakers, especially Ford and GM, have bounced back with a recovery in the global market and restructuring of the product portfolio at the end of 2009. In 2010, Ford’s sales went up 19% to 1.94 million vehicles, while sales of GM and Chrysler grew 7% to 2.22 million vehicles and 17% to 1.09 million vehicles during the year, respectively.
"
464,GT,"Ford focuses on its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury branded cars, shedding the Volvo cars, while GM concentrates on four core brands – Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac – withdrawing Saturn, Hummer, Pontiac and Saab.
"
465,GT,"Further, Ford has decided to expand its luxury Lincoln line-up at the cost of its Mercury line-up, which has been phased out at the end of 2010. The company plans to launch as many as 7 new Lincoln vehicles in the next 4 years, including a small car.
"
466,GT,"In the first quarter of 2011, Ford posted a profit ($2.61 billion or 62 cents per share) for seven straight quarters after years of losses. In fact, it was the biggest profit since the same quarter in 1998. GM posted its biggest profit in 11 years ($1.7 billion or 95 cents per share) since earning $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2000. Meanwhile, Chrysler posted its first quarterly profit ($116 million) since 2006.The Rise of Asian Automakers
"
467,GT,"The Asian countries, especially China and India, are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry over the next five to seven years. According to Global Insight – a U.S.-based provider of economic and financial information – 14.7% of growth is expected to come from India and 8.3% from China by 2013 (compared with 2008 levels) based on their rapidly growing economy.
"
468,GT,"Domestic automakers are likely to rule the key growth market of China as the government plans to consolidate the top 14 domestic automotive players into 10. These automakers would capture a share of more than 90% in the local market.
"
469,GT,"The Chinese automakers have been struggling hard to enhance their global profile by upgrading their technology to meet international standards. To this end, Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Group (BAIC) purchased the intellectual property rights from GM’s Saab in 2009 in order to develop its own brands and introduce new models. BAIC purchased the rights to certain powertrain, engine and gear-box technology for Saab's 9-5 and 9-3 sedans.
"
470,GT,"In a similar move, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group bought Volvo cars from Ford in order to tap China's high-growth auto market by acquiring modern, innovative technologies from the Swedish brand to upgrade its car lineup. In December 2009, Geely also signed up with Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) to be its global parts supplier.
"
471,GT,"The Indian automakers are also gearing up to beyond the domestic market. Tata Motors (TTM) has revealed plans to launch its European version of the small car, Nano Europa in 2011 and an U.S. version of the same car by 2012. India’s utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra has announced launching TR20 and TR40 pickups in the U.S. that are reportedly more economical compared to other pickups sold in the country.WEAKNESSES
"
472,GT,"Although automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors, developing the supplier networks remains one of the greatest challenges they face. Existing suppliers to automakers often lack the financial background to expand capacity in new markets. On the other hand, auto market suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties, which may result in new and lower-cost competitors.
"
473,GT,"Since 1999, more than 20 of the largest global auto parts suppliers have efiled for bankruptcy. The financial condition of the majority of auto market suppliers continues to deteriorate, resulting from a historically weak demand and higher dependence on automakers. According to the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, 12% of the auto industry suppliers do not have sufficient working capital to support a 10%–25% expansion in production.
"
474,GT,"Thus, despite the government’s sizable investment in the automakers, it is likely that there will be auto market suppliers who are unable to restart operations due to working capital shortfalls even as automaker production resumes.
"
475,GT,"Higher dependence on automakers makes the auto market suppliers vulnerable to several maladies, primarily pricing pressure and production cuts. Pricing pressure from automakers is constricting auto market suppliers’ margins. On the other hand, production cuts by automakers driven by frequent market adjustments are negatively affecting their operations.
"
476,GT,"Some of the auto industry suppliers who have a high reliance on a few automakers such as General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Volkswagen include American Axle and Manufacturing (AXL  -  Free Report), ArvinMeritor Inc. (ARM), Goodyear Tire and Rubber (GT  -  Free Report), Magna International (MGA  -  Free Report), Superior Industries (SUP  -  Free Report), Tenneco Inc. (TEN  -  Free Report) and TRW Automotive (TRW).
"
477,GT,"The shift in auto market consumer preferences towards hi-tech, fuel-efficient, environment-friendly vehicles, such as small cars/hybrids/EVs, is another issue. Auto market suppliers are expected to quickly adapt to the new technologies by investing in research and development, putting heavy capital burdens on them.
"
478,GT,"The automakers also face significant challenges in transforming the existing powertrain technologies into the new versions, as far as marketability is concerned. They are adapting the internal combustion engines to alternative energy, including ethanol and bio-fuels. Ultimately, a time may come when they switch to the all-electric powertrain as their sole powertrain solution. However, the shift in powertrain solution technology needs to be supported by adequate charging outlets in order to recharge batteries.Safety Recalls
"
479,GT,"Automotive safety recalls were brought into sharp focus after Toyota's announcement of a series of recalls staring in late 2009. Since November 2009, Toyota has recalled more than 14 million vehicles globally in about 20 recalls, crossing all other automakers. The U.S. Transportation Department imposed a fine of $48.4 million due to late recall of millions of defective vehicles.
"
480,GT,"Toyota’s recalls were related to problems such as faulty accelerator gas pedals, slipping floor mats and defective braking systems. They led the automaker to suspend the sale of its models several times and halt new car launches for the year.
"
481,GT,"However, Toyota has revealed that it has repaired 5 million vehicles related to its three biggest recalls announced in late 2009 and early 2010. Through the on-site SMART evaluation program since April 2010, the automaker has also noticed a sharp 80% drop in customer complaints related to the sudden acceleration problem.
"
482,GT,"In the spate of recalls following Toyota’s, other automakers’ recalls also came into the limelight. They include Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda and Nissan. Among them, GM recalled most frequently, followed by Ford.
"
483,GT,"Since the beginning of 2010, GM recalled more than 3 million vehicles in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and South Korea. Among these, the largest recall occurred in June last year, involving 1.5 million vehicles, in order to fix a problem with a heated windshield wiper fluid system. Meanwhile, Ford recalled nearly 600,000 vehicles throughout 2010 and more than 1 million vehicles year-to-date.Japan Disaster
"
484,GT,"The earthquake, tsunami and the nuclear crisis in Japan have thrown the global automotive industry out of gear. The auto parts supply chains have been paralyzed, triggering production shutdowns, work shift reductions and cancellation of orders.
"
485,GT,"Japan accounts for about 13% of the worldwide automobile production with the U.S. being its largest market. Production of as many as 40 auto parts manufacturer in the country has been jeopardized due to plant outages and power shortages following the earthquake.
"
486,GT,"Another crisis that the auto parts supplied from Japan poses is their uniqueness. Most of the auto parts sourced from Japan are very complex and specifically tailored. As a result, finding substitutes for such customized components becomes very difficult. Moreover, it is extremely painful to shift the production of these parts to unaffected areas, where Japan has excess auto parts supplying capacities.
"
487,GT,"According to IHS Automotive, the global automotive industry could face interruptions in supply of critical components such as transmissions, electric vehicle battery packs and electronic semiconductors for an indefinite period.
"
488,GT,"Due to these factors, none of the major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda and Nissan could provide any sales and earnings guidance for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012 due to uncertainties emanating from the crises in Japan.
"
489,GT,"On Mar 26, we issued an updated research report on The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report).In order to boost sales and remain competitive in the market, Goodyear frequently launches innovative products and services for its consumers. At the beginning of March, it offered a preview of its two latest products. One of the prototypes was of a new tire, designed to cater the electric vehicle market, which is anticipated to be available in Europe from 2019. Additionally, it is also developing a real-time communication application that will facilitate fleet operators to communicate in real time via a mobile application.Further, a strong balance sheet helps the company to pay frequent cash dividends to boost shareholders’ confidence. In January, Goodyear declared a quarterly dividend of 14 cents. Earlier in October 2017, it hiked the dividend payment by 40% from the previous amount of 10 cents.The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and Consensus The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and Consensus | The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Quote Goodyear reported adjusted earnings per share of 99 cents for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents. Quarterly revenues were $4.07 billion. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In 2018, the company anticipates operating income of $1.8-$1.9 billion in comparison with $1.6 billion recorded in the prior year.However, increased raw material costs, leading to unabsorbed overhead expenses have hampered Goodyear’s operating income. Also, taking up of new pension standards have contributed to rising expenses.Moreover, competitive environments, weak product demand in the market and difficult industry condition have led to the declined sales for Goodyear. In 2017, it witnessed a 4.2% year-over-year decline to 6.9 million units in its worldwide tire sales.The company’s stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings being revised 17% downward over the last seven days.Price PerformanceIn the last six months, shares of Goodyear have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.08% in 2009, 8.22% for 2010, 8.84% expected in 2011 and 9.32% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.96 for 2011, at 2.14 for 2012 -- both very bullish readings.  Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.96 for 2011, 1.96 for 2012, also very positive readings. Total revisions activity rising rapidly. S&P 500 earned $544.7 billion in 2009, rising to $792.0 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $922.2 billion in 2011. In 2012, the 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.047 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.13 in 2009, $83.08 in 2010 and $96.75 in 2011 expected, bottom up. For 2012, $109.79 expected. Puts P/Es at 16.1x for 2010, and 13.8x for 2011 and 12.2x for 2012 -- very attractive relative to 10-year T-note rate of 3.15%. Top-down estimates: $95.17 for 2011 and $103.05 for 2012.Into the Homestretch
"
491,GT,"The first quarter earnings season is almost done. We now have 435 (87.0%) of the S&P 500 reports in. We have enough of a sample now to be pretty sure this will be a good earnings season.
"
492,GT,"So far, we have income growth of 19.9%. While that is down from the extremely strong 31.4% those same 435 firms posted in the fourth quarter, it is still a very strong growth rate. Almost all of the growth slowdown is from a failure of the Financial sector to repeat the massive growth they posted in the fourth quarter.Tougher Comps for Finance Companies
"
493,GT,"It’s not that the Financials are having a bad quarter, but they do face much tougher comps this time around. If we back out the Financials, total net income is up 20.9% so far, actually up from the 19.0% those firms reported in the fourth quarter.
"
494,GT,"Looking ahead to the second quarter, growth is expected to continue to slow, but remain in the double digits at 11.7%. Back out the Financials and growth is expected to be 13.1%.
"
495,GT,"Revenue growth is also very strong at 9.49%, up from the 7.78% growth they posted in the fourth quarter. Financials are a major drag on revenue growth; if they are excluded, reported revenue growth is 12.14%, up from the 9.26% growth posted last quarter. Revenue growth is also expected to slow in the fourth quarter, falling to 6.53% year over year for the S&P 500 as a whole and 9.33% if the Financials are excluded.
"
496,GT,"Net margin expansion has been a driver of earnings growth, but that expansion is slowing down, particularly if one excludes the Financials. Overall net margins are 10.02%, up sharply from 9.15% a year ago and from 9.32% in the fourth quarter. Strip away the financials and the picture is somewhat different, rising to 9.43% from 8.74% a year ago and from the 9.18% reported in the fourth quarter.Cyclicals Drive the Market
"
497,GT,"The more cyclical parts of the economy will be leading the growth charge this quarter. The highest growth comes from the Industrials sector, with growth of 82.5%. Three other sectors are posting growth over 40%: Autos (46.9%), Materials (45.6%) and Energy (40.5%).
"
498,GT,"Construction is without a doubt the weakest of the sectors, with total net income plunging 34.3% from a year ago. The only other sector will declining net income are the Utilities, down 1.5% from a year ago. Anemic, but positive growth of 3.7% for is seen for Staples.Net Margin Expansion
"
499,GT,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.39% in 2009. They hit 8.59% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.49% in 2011 and 10.18% in 2012.
"
500,GT,"The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.08% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.22% in 2010.  They are expected to rise to 8.84% in 2011 and 9.32% in 2012.Full-Year Expectations Healthy
"
501,GT,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $792.0 billion in 2010, up from $544.7 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $922.2 billion, or increases of 45.4% and 16.4%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.047 Trillion.
"
502,GT,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $109.79. That is up from $57.13 for 2009, $83.08 for 2010 and $96.75 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding 3.15%, a P/E of 16.2x based on 2010 and 13.8x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 12.2x.
"
503,GT,"The analysts have responded to the better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter by raising their estimates for 2011. That’s not particularly shocking, as the first quarter is after all, part of 2011, so if they did not increase in response to a positive surprise, they would implicitly be cutting their estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year.
"
504,GT,"Still, the flood of estimate increases is impressive, with the revisions ratio climbing to 1.96 from 1.84. With total estimate revisions activity soaring, that increase is overwhelmingly being driven by new estimate increases, not from old estimate cuts falling out of the four-week moving totals. Changes in the revisions ratios are more significant when activity is rising than when it is falling (since it reflects new information).
"
505,GT,"The estimate increases are widespread, with the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to firms with falling estimates standing at 1.96. There is no “mechanical reason for the estimates for 2012 to be rising, yet those are even stronger than the ones for 2011. The 2012 revisions ratio is now at 2.14, meaning that upwards estimate revisions are outpacing cuts by more than 2:1 for next year. The ratio of rising-to-falling mean estimates stands at 1.96. Those are extremely bullish readings.
"
506,GT,"This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher. Yes, the market did not seem to have much of a reaction to the positive news coming out of Abbottabad last week, but then again, I cannot think of a single company that will earn a single extra dollar as a result of Hell getting just a little bit more crowded.Bumps in the Road
"
507,GT,"That does not mean that all is smooth sailing ahead. We managed to avoid a government shutdown, but only at the cost of large spending cuts that will slow the economy. The drama is not over -- that was just the end of the first act. The fight over raising the debt ceiling is going to be underway soon.
"
508,GT,"If it looks like the debt ceiling will not be raised, watch out. The Government of the United States defaulting on its debt is likely to have a somewhat larger impact on the markets and the economy than the impact of Lehman Brothers defaulting on its debts. However, when push comes to shove, I find it hard to believe that even Congress could be so stupid as to let that happen.   
"
509,GT,"We are already feeling the impact from lower government spending. First quarter GDP growth came in at just 1.8%, down from 3.1% in the fourth quarter. Total government spending was a drag of 1.09 points, more than the 0.34 point drag in the fourth quarter. In other words, 0.75 of the total 130 point growth slowdown (57.8%) was due to increased austerity in Government spending.
"
510,GT,"In the third quarter, government spending contributed 0.79 points of the 2.60% total growth. The lower growth will result in lower tax collections, so the impact on the budget deficit will be much less than the amount advertised. Job creation remains sluggish, but had been starting to show signs of picking up.
"
511,GT,"We created 268,000 jobs in the private sector in April, up from 231,000 in March, and 260,000 in February, but that is after a big upward revision to the February numbers. However, governments laid off a total of 24,000 people for the month, on top of 10,000 pink slips the month before. How is it that one can reduce unemployment by cutting jobs?Jobless Claims Starting to Trend Up
"
512,GT,"Recently though, the trend in Initial Claims for Unemployment has taken a nasty turn for the worse, with the four-week moving average moving back above the 400,000 level for the first time since January. Initial claims rose by 43,000 to 474,000 last week. Those numbers were not reflected in the April jobs report, but they are not a good omen for the May report.
"
513,GT,"The unemployment rate bounced back up to 9.0%. Given that the unemployment rate has been higher than that in just 6.17% of the months since 1960, one might expect that bringing down unemployment would be top of the agenda at both the Fed and on Capitol Hill.
"
514,GT,"However, at Bernanke’s recent press conference, the focus was mostly on inflation -- even though headline inflation has been higher than the current level of 2.7% in 65.4% of the months since 1960, and core inflation has been higher in 95.5% of the months. This fear of phantom inflation is keeping further monetary easing off the table for bringing down unemployment.International Concerns Remain
"
515,GT,"The international situation clearly has the potential to abort the recovery as well. The disaster in Japan will clearly slow its economy dramatically in the first quarter, although much of that growth will be made up later in the year as the reconstruction process gets underway. Many U.S.-made products have parts which are made in Japan and that is likely to disrupt production here. Still, there appeared to be no impact on Industrial Production in March as manufacturing output climbed 0.7%.
"
516,GT,"The turmoil in the Middle East is not going away, and that is likely to keep oil prices both high and volatile. High oil prices will also act as a depressing force on the economy.
"
517,GT,"The Debt Crisis in Europe is not going away either, with Portugal now also getting bailed out, even as the ECB makes life tougher on the PIIGS by raising rates.Housing Still Dire
"
518,GT,"The housing situation is still dire, even if new home sales were a bit better than expected in March at 300,000. That is still one of the lowest levels on record, and less than half of a “normal new home sales pace. Prices of existing homes continue to fall, and with them the housing equity wealth that makes up the bulk of the wealth of the middle class.
"
519,GT,"On the plus side, the dollar has been weak, and that should improve the trade deficit, and that will be a significant positive for the economy. The foreign operations of U.S. companies will be much more profitable when the results are measured in dollars. Inflation, other than in food and energy, is well contained, up only 0.1% in March and 1.2% year over year. That should let the Fed stay on Easy Street as far as monetary policy is concerned.Overall: Staying Positive
"
520,GT,"On balance I remain bullish, and I think we will end the year with the S&P 500 north of 1400, but that does not mean we will necessarily have a smooth ride between here and there. Strong earnings are trumping a dicey international situation and the drama in DC. However, be prepared to move to the exits (or perhaps have some put protection in place) if it looks like the debt ceiling will not be raised.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseThe first quarter season almost done. So far, 435 (87.0%) of reports in. Results strong so far, with year-over-year growth of 19.9%, a 3.14 surprise ratio, and 3.85% median surprise. 67.9% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 321 firms, falling EPS for 113 -- 2.84 ratio; 73.9% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.The percentages and ratios could change somewhat over next few weeks, but more at the sector level than for the S&P 500 overall. Five sectors done.Industrials, Autos, Discretionary, Conglomerates and Energy all have median surprises over 6.5%. Construction disappoints.
"
521,GT,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 4Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegIndustrial Products 82.53% 85.71% 8.26 15 3 14 4Auto 46.88% 100.00% 8.16 6 1 7 0Consumer Discretionary 20.40% 87.50% 7.41 22 3 22 6Conglomerates 33.65% 80.00% 6.81 7 1 8 0Oils and Energy 40.45% 100.00% 6.51 26 13 24 16Finance 15.89% 100.00% 5.36 54 18 58 21Basic Materials 45.56% 95.65% 5.05 20 2 21 1Medical 6.22% 91.49% 4.05 37 4 36 7Retail/Wholesale 8.42% 61.36% 3.64 19 2 23 4Aerospace 5.04% 90.00% 2.65 6 2 6 3Business Service 12.62% 89.47% 2.38 9 4 12 5Computer and Tech 28.48% 77.78% 1.90 35 15 42 14Consumer Staples 3.70% 75.00% 0.96 14 7 18 8Utilities -1.51% 80.95% 0.87 18 10 18 16Transportation 23.82% 100.00% 0.00 4 3 8 1Construction -34.25% 100.00% -4.17 3 6 4 7S&P 500 19.88% 87.00% 3.85 295 94 321 113Sales SurprisesStrong revenue growth of 9.49% among the 435 that have reported, median surprise 1.44%, surprise ratio of 2.38 -- 70.1% of all firms reporting better-than-expected revenues.

525,GT,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. The second shows the largest declines. To qualify, there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
526,GT,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.This week’s cut off +/- 5%, 51 make increase cut, 27 make decrease cut.Energy, HMOs dominate the increases list, heavy Financial exposure on the biggest cuts list.Over 10% of S&P 500 with increase of more than 5% is unusually strong.Biggest FY1 Revisions(Largest Increases) Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstGoodyear Tire GT 47.42% 6.69% 0.18 0.36 21.16 8.72Wynn Resrts Ltd WYNN 34.87% 22.43% 0.92 0.87 34.14 28.78Ak Steel Hldg AKS 33.24% 15.65% 0.50 0.38 12.88 8.73Anadarko Petrol APC 18.75% 12.98% 0.61 0.54 23.97 18.21Capital One Fin COF 18.41% 4.75% 0.80 0.73 8.38 9.40Peoples Utd Fin PBCT 16.08% 9.62% 0.93 0.93 20.51 15.84Keycorp New KEY 15.19% -4.54% 0.57 -0.44 10.91 11.03Huntington Banc HBAN 14.13% -1.07% 0.95 -0.16 11.26 9.73Aetna Inc-New AET 13.38% 3.39% 0.89 0.73 9.82 9.58E Trade Finl Cp ETFC 12.87% 8.22% 0.86 0.79 22.49 14.60Valero Energy VLO 12.54% 6.73% 0.50 0.39 8.20 7.40Eastman Chem Co EMN 12.13% 12.21% 0.70 0.73 11.42 10.45Meadwestvaco Cp MWV 11.83% 10.24% 1.00 0.91 16.19 14.33Intel Corp INTC 11.82% 9.49% 0.90 0.79 10.23 9.68Dow Chemical DOW 11.66% 3.00% 0.71 0.63 13.83 11.47Humana Inc New HUM 10.83% 6.59% 0.60 0.76 11.01 10.77Marathon Oil Cp MRO 10.12% 5.19% 0.74 0.44 8.16 7.90Intl Paper IP 9.96% 4.99% 0.79 0.85 10.64 9.17Unitedhealth Gp UNH 9.89% 7.05% 0.94 0.82 12.05 11.10Grainger W W GWW 9.63% 8.61% 1.00 0.94 17.15 15.39Caterpillar Inc CAT 9.39% 7.73% 0.42 0.68 16.07 12.68Tesoro Corp TSO 9.16% 5.72% 0.12 0.43 10.06 9.43Murphy Oil MUR 9.10% 5.78% 0.53 0.38 10.55 8.85Cummins Inc CMI 9.09% 8.29% 0.76 0.76 14.90 12.43Eqt Corp EQT 8.87% 12.79% 0.56 0.50 25.19 19.23Exxon Mobil Crp XOM 8.13% 5.86% 0.58 0.58 9.57 9.02Moodys Corp MCO 7.54% 5.50% 1.00 1.00 16.18 14.72Citrix Sys Inc CTXS 7.50% 9.22% 1.00 1.00 39.66 34.52Nucor Corp NUE 7.33% 2.44% 0.64 0.18 15.09 11.04Cbs Corp CBS 7.26% 5.21% 0.68 0.60 16.29 13.09Paccar Inc PCAR 7.20% 5.80% 0.63 0.67 20.02 13.76Conocophillips COP 7.05% 3.46% 0.43 0.15 8.98 8.27Pioneer Nat Res PXD 6.96% 6.77% 0.59 0.31 25.14 17.08Goldman Sachs GS 6.94% 0.10% 0.22 0.16 10.23 7.78Denbury Res Inc DNR 6.73% 9.68% 0.50 0.37 17.61 14.30Leggett & Platt LEG 6.47% 3.09% 1.00 0.67 18.68 15.17Williams Cos WMB 6.45% 1.76% 0.55 0.10 21.41 18.69Apple Inc AAPL 6.22% 6.80% 0.91 0.76 14.09 12.23Baker-Hughes BHI 6.11% 7.79% 0.77 0.80 17.28 13.38Wyndham Worldwd WYN 6.11% 6.32% 1.00 0.90 14.87 12.99Chevron Corp CVX 5.96% 3.81% 0.35 0.53 8.05 7.83Edwards Lifesci EW 5.91% 2.99% 1.00 0.75 42.77 31.50Motorola Solutn MSI 5.80% -13.39% 0.40 0.00 21.83 20.22Comerica Inc CMA 5.63% -0.80% 0.56 0.04 18.24 14.72Norfolk Southrn NSC 5.52% 4.88% 0.86 0.93 14.94 12.98Yahoo!

528,GT,"Auto Industry Outlook and Review  March 2011
"
529,GT,"Tickers: TM, NSANY, HMC, GM, F, AXL, ARM, GT, MGA, SUP, TEN, TRW, JCI, TTM
"
530,GT,"The auto industry is a highly concentrated one, with roughly 10 global automakers accounting for over 77% of total production worldwide. In 2010, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) led with a 19.1% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report) with a 16.7% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. (TM  -  Free Report) with a 15.2% market share, Honda Motor Co. (HMC  -  Free Report) with a 10.6% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 9.4% market share and Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY  -  Free Report) with a 7.8% market share.
"
531,GT,"The economic downturn provided the impetus for a massive structural change in the auto industry, setting the stage for growth over the next decade. Given the high barriers to entry and the need for scale economies (in operations, supply chain and marketing), the global auto industry landscape is expected to be ruled by global automakers and suppliers based in the six major auto markets -– China, India, Japan, Korea, Western Europe and the U.S.
"
532,GT,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
533,GT,"To remain competitive, automakers will need to design vehicles that meet the requirements of consumers in both mature and emerging markets. Automakers will focus on more user-friendly and low-cost vehicles that are also the most advanced technologically.
"
534,GT,"The automakers will continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. For example, Greater China and South America together are projected to represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production from 2008 to 2015.
"
535,GT,"There are two underlying factors behind this location shift in the auto industry. The first is the cost factor. The cost of labor in emerging auto markets continues to be a fraction of that in the developed world. The second is the demand factor. Many low-cost regions, including the emerging auto markets, have high potential for growth. Thus, the shift in auto industry production facilities will lead to a localization of the manufacturing base that will bring down transportation costs.
"
536,GT,"The emergence of trading blocs is also giving this process a push in the auto market. It is likely that over time there will be fewer car imports from outside a trade zone.
"
537,GT,"The role of governments must not be overlooked. Governments in all major countries have become active auto industry players. Their environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years.
"
538,GT,"Further, automakers have started to reduce the number of technological platforms with a greater diversity of models produced from each platform in order to remain cost competitive.
"
539,GT,"For example, Honda, with its flexible common platform, has developed three dimensionally distinct versions of the Accord, allowing for designs where 60% of the components are common. Ford aims to build 680,000 vehicles per core global platform by 2015, up from the current level of 345,000 units.
"
540,GT,"Green Cars
"
541,GT,"Higher fuel prices and concerns over global warming have pooled attention on the auto industry that either rely less on traditional fossil fuels or use renewable sources of less expensive energy. Thus, “green alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids will attract consumers in the wealthier countries, while flex-fuels such as ethanol and natural gas will be highly sought-after in the emerging auto markets where the local climate or resource base favors their usage.
"
542,GT,"Consequently, there will be a variety of power-train technologies in the auto industry by the next decade. It is likely that “green cars will represent up to a third of total global sales in developed auto markets and up to 20% in urban areas of emerging auto markets by 2020. Some of the “green cars have already generated a huge response in the auto industry. These include the Ford Focus, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf, Toyota Prius and Daimler AG’s Smart fortwo micro EV.
"
543,GT,"The market for hybrid cars was dealt a severe blow by the global economic downturn due to poor availability of consumer credit, low gas prices and other unfavorable economic conditions. However, they are projected to become a popular option for car buyers, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.
"
544,GT,"Globally, the hybrid market is ruled by Toyota and Honda at present. But other automakers such as Ford, General Motors and Nissan are also aggressively pursuing a plan to push hybrid sales.
"
545,GT,"The U.S. is the largest hybrid car market in the world, with sales accounting for 60%–70% of global hybrid sales. According to J.D. Power and Associates, hybrid-electric vehicle sales volumes in the country are expected to grow by 268% between 2005 and 2012. Presently, there are only 12 hybrid models available in the U.S., which would increase to 52 by 2012.Detroit’s Comeback
"
546,GT,"The ‘Big Three’ Detroit automakers –- GM, Ford and Chrysler -– lost consumer confidence in 2009 after they were severely hit by the global economic crisis. The crisis also exposed the inherent problem with the Big Three’s product portfolio, which lacked up-to-date engineering and extensive research and development.
"
547,GT,"Further, the majority of their sales comprised pickup trucks and SUVs rather than fuel-efficient vehicles such as the small cars that the consumers have started to prefer. This skewed portfolio was further aggravated by the government’s push for fuel-efficient and environment-friendly cars. Ford rallied better than its hometown rivals, with an early response to the shift in consumer preference towards small cars.
"
548,GT,"However, the Detroit automakers, especially Ford and GM, bounced back with a recovery in the global market and restructuring of the product portfolio at the end of 2009. In 2010, Ford’s sales went up 19% to 1.94 million vehicles, while sales of GM and Chrysler grew 7% to 2.22 million vehicles and 17% to 1.09 million vehicles during the year, respectively.
"
549,GT,"Ford focuses on its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury branded cars, shedding the Volvo cars, while GM concentrates on four core brands -– Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac -– withdrawing Saturn, Hummer, Pontiac and Saab.
"
550,GT,"Further, Ford has decided to expand its luxury Lincoln line-up at the cost of its Mercury line-up, which has been phased out at the end of 2010. The company plans to launch as many as 7 new Lincoln vehicles in the next 4 years, including a small car.The Rise of Asian Automakers
"
551,GT,"The Asian countries, especially China and India, are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry over the next five to seven years. According to Global Insight -– a U.S. based provider of economic and financial information –- 14.7% of growth is expected to come from India and 8.3% from China by 2013 (compared with 2008 levels) based on their rapidly growing economy.
"
552,GT,"Domestic automakers are likely to rule the key growth market of China as the government plans to consolidate the top 14 domestic automotive players into 10. These automakers would capture a share of more than 90% in the local market.
"
553,GT,"The Chinese automakers have been struggling hard to enhance their global profile by upgrading their technology to meet the international standards. To this end, Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Group (BAIC) purchased the intellectual property rights from GM’s Saab in 2009 in order to develop its own brands and introduce new models. BAIC purchased the rights to certain powertrain, engine and gear-box technology for Saab's 9-5 and 9-3 sedans.
"
554,GT,"In a similar move, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group bought Volvo cars from Ford in order to tap China 's high-growth auto market by acquiring modern, innovative technologies from the Swedish brand to upgrade its car lineup. In December 2009, Geely also signed up with Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) to be its global parts supplier.
"
555,GT,"The Indian automakers are also contemplating entry in the international markets by introducing their innovative products that could meet consumers demand abroad. Tata Motors (TTM) has revealed it will launch its European version of the small car, Nano Europa in 2011 and an U.S. version of the same car by 2012. On the other hand, India’s utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra has announced launching TR20 and TR40 pickups in the U.S. that are more economical compared to other pickups sold in the country.WEAKNESSES
"
556,GT,"Although automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors, developing the supplier networks remains one of the greatest challenges they face. Existing suppliers often lack the financial background to expand capacity in new markets. On the other hand, auto market suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties, which may result in new and lower-cost competitors.
"
557,GT,"Since 1999, more than 20 of the largest global auto parts suppliers have filed for bankruptcy. The financial condition of the majority of auto market suppliers continues to remain weak, owing largely to historically weak demand and heavy dependence on automakers.
"
558,GT,"Higher dependence on a handful of global automakers makes suppliers vulnerable on several front, primarily pricing pressure and production cuts. Pricing pressure from automakers is constricting auto market suppliers’ margins. On the other hand, production cuts by automakers driven by frequent market adjustments are negatively affecting their operations.
"
559,GT,"Some of the auto industry suppliers who have a high reliance on a few automakers such as General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Volkswagen include American Axle and Manufacturing (AXL  -  Free Report), ArvinMeritor (ARM), Goodyear Tire and Rubber (GT  -  Free Report), Magna International (MGA  -  Free Report), Superior Industries (SUP  -  Free Report), Tenneco Inc. (TEN  -  Free Report) and TRW Automotive (TRW).
"
560,GT,"The shift in auto market consumer preferences towards hi-tech, fuel-efficient, environment-friendly vehicles, such as small cars/hybrids/EVs, is another issue. Auto market suppliers are expected to quickly adapt to the new technologies by investing in research and development, putting heavy capital burdens on them.
"
561,GT,"The automakers also face significant challenges in transforming their existing power-train technologies, as far as marketability is concerned. They are adapting the internal combustion engines to alternative energy, including ethanol and bio-fuels. Ultimately, a time may come when they switch to the all-electric power-train as their sole solution. However, the shift in power-train solution technology needs to be supported by adequate charging outlets in order to recharge batteries.Safety Recall – The New Crisis
"
562,GT,"Automotive safety recalls were brought into focus by Toyota’s recalls in late 2009. Since November 2009, Toyota has recalled more than 14 million vehicles globally in about 20 recalls, crossing all other automakers. The U.S. Transportation Department had to impose a fine of $48.4 million due to late recall of millions of defective vehicles.
"
563,GT,"Toyota’s recalls were related to problems such as faulty accelerator gas pedals, slipping floor mats and defective braking systems. They led the automaker to suspend the sale of its models several times and halt new car launches for the year.
"
564,GT,"However, Toyota has revealed that it has repaired 5 million vehicles related to its three biggest recalls announced in late 2009 and early 2010. Through the on-site SMART evaluation program since April 2010, the automaker has also noticed a sharp 80% drop in customer complaints related to the sudden acceleration problem.
"
565,GT,"Following Toyota, other automakers had to issue recalls as well. They include Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda and Nissan. Among them, GM recalled most frequently, followed by Ford. Since the beginning of 2010, GM recalled more than 3 million vehicles in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and South Korea. Among these, the largest recall occurred in June, involving 1.5 million vehicles, in order to fix a problem with a heated windshield wiper fluid system that had been causing fire in the vehicles.
"
566,GT,"Meanwhile, Ford recalled nearly 600,000 vehicles throughout 2010 and more than 1 million vehicles in 2011-till date. The 2011 recall included 507,000 units of F-150 pickups and 525,000 units of its Windstar minivans due to a corrosion related problem.
"
567,GT,"The auto industry is a highly concentrated one. About 10 global automakers account for over 77% of the production worldwide. In the first quarter of 2010, General Motors (MTLQQ) led with a 19.2% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report) with a 17.3% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. (TM  -  Free Report) with a 15.1% market share, Honda Motor Co. (HMC  -  Free Report) with a 10.6% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 9.4% market share and Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY  -  Free Report) with a 7.9% market share.
"
568,GT,"The recent economic crisis has provided an impetus to a massive structural change in the auto industry, setting the stage for growth over the next decade. Given the high barriers to entry and the need for scale economies (in operations, supply chain and marketing), the global auto industry landscape is expected to be ruled by global automakers and suppliers based in the six major auto markets -- China, India, Japan, Korea, Western Europe and the U.S.OPPORTUNITIES

"
580,GT,"This skewed portfolio was further aggravated by the government’s push for fuel-efficient and environment-friendly small cars. Ford rallied better than its hometown rivals, with an early response to the shift in consumer preference towards small cars. In 2009, sales at Ford dropped 15% while sales at GM and Chrysler plunged 30% and 36%, respectively.Portfolio Skewing
"
581,GT,"With a recovery in the global market and restructuring of the product portfolio, the Detroit automakers, especially Ford and GM, bounced back at the end of 2009. December last year was Ford’s best month since May 2008, with a sales gain of 33%, driven by a wide acceptance of its redesigned Taurus, Fusion and Escape. Meanwhile, sales of GM’s four core brands grew 2% during the month.
"
582,GT,"Ford focuses on its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury branded cars, shedding the Volvo cars unit, while GM concentrates on four core brands -- Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac -- withdrawing Saturn, Hummer, Pontiac and Saab.
"
583,GT,"Recently, Ford has decided to expand its luxury Lincoln line-up at the cost of its Mercury line-up, which will be phased out by the end of 2010. The company plans to launch as many as 7 new Lincoln vehicles in the next 4 years, including a small car.
"
584,GT,"In the first half of 2010, Ford’s sales surged 27.2% while GM’s sales rose 14.3%. Toyota’s recent fall from grace due to its massive recall (touched upon below) has been a major boost to the Big Three’s fortunes, as well.The Rise of Asian Automakers
"
585,GT,"The Asian countries, especially China and India, are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry over the next five to seven years. According to Global Insight, a U.S. based provider of economic and financial information, 14.7% of growth is expected to come from India and 8.3% from China by 2013 (compared with 2008 levels). The growth in these markets can be attributed to government incentives and a rapidly growing economy, boosting up big-ticket purchases.
"
586,GT,"Domestic automakers are likely to rule the key growth market of China as the government plans to consolidate the top 14 domestic automotive players into 10. These automakers would capture more than 90% of the share in the local market.
"
587,GT,"The Chinese automakers have been struggling hard to enhance their global profile by upgrading their technology to meet international standards. To this end, Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Group (BAIC) has purchased the intellectual property rights from GM’s Saab in order to develop its own brands and introduce new models. BAIC purchased the rights to certain powertrain, engine and gear-box technology for Saab's 9-5 and 9-3 sedans.
"
588,GT,"In a similar move, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group bought Volvo cars from Ford in order to tap China's high-growth auto market by acquiring modern, innovative technologies from the Swedish brand to upgrade its car lineup. In December last year, Geely also signed up with Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) to be its global parts supplier.
"
589,GT,"The Indian automakers are also vying into international markets by introducing their innovative products that could meet consumers demand abroad. Tata Motors (TTM) has revealed it will launch its European version of the small car, Nano Europa, in 2011 and an U.S. version of the same car by 2012. On the other hand, India’s utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra has announced launching TR20 and TR40 pickups in the U.S. that is more economical compared to other pickups sold in the country.
"
590,GT,"WEAKNESSES
"
591,GT,"Although automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors, developing the supplier networks remains one of the greatest challenges they face in the auto industry. Existing suppliers to automakers often lack the financial background to expand capacity in new markets. On the other hand, auto market suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties, which may result in new and lower-cost competitors.
"
592,GT,"Since 1999, more than 20 of the largest global auto parts suppliers have filed for bankruptcy. The financial condition of the majority of auto market suppliers continues to deteriorate, resulting from a historically weak demand and higher dependence on automakers. According to the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, 12% of the auto industry suppliers do not have sufficient working capital to support a 10%–25% expansion in production.
"
593,GT,"Thus, despite the government’s sizable investment in the automakers, it is likely that there will be auto market suppliers unable to restart operations due to working capital shortfalls even as auto production resumes.
"
594,GT,"Higher dependence on automakers makes the auto market suppliers vulnerable to several maladies, primarily pricing pressure and production cuts. Pricing pressure from automakers is constricting auto market suppliers’ margins. On the other hand, production cuts by automakers driven by frequent market adjustments are negatively affecting their operations.
"
595,GT,"Some of the auto industry suppliers who have a high reliance on a few automakers such as General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Volkswagen include American Axle and Manufacturing (AXL  -  Free Report), ArvinMeritor (ARM), Goodyear Tire and Rubber (GT  -  Free Report), Magna International (MGA  -  Free Report), Superior Industries (SUP  -  Free Report), Tenneco (TEN  -  Free Report) and TRW Automotive (TRW).
"
596,GT,"The shift in auto market consumer preferences towards high-tech, fuel-efficient, environment-friendly vehicles, such as small cars/hybrids/EVs, is another issue. Auto market suppliers are expected to quickly adapt to the new technologies by investing in research and development, putting heavy capital burdens on them.
"
597,GT,"The automakers also face significant challenges in transforming the existing powertrain technologies into the new versions, as far as marketability is concerned. The original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are adapting the internal combustion engines to alternative energy, including ethanol and bio-fuels. Ultimately, a time may come when the OEMs switch to the all-electric powertrain as their sole powertrain solution. However, the shift in powertrain solution technology needs to be supported by adequate charging outlets in order to recharge batteries.
"
598,GT,"As the number of technology applications increases, automakers and suppliers will need to be selective. Their criteria for choosing what to include and what not to will depend entirely on what the customers are willing to pay for.
"
599,GT,"Safety Recalls – The New Crisis
"
600,GT,"Vehicle recalls have become the talk of the town after Toyota’s announcement of the largest-ever global recall of more than 8.5 million vehicles at the beginning of the year related to problems such as faulty accelerator gas pedals and slipping floor mats as well as faulty braking systems. The recall included popular models such as 2010 Prius hybrid and Toyota Camry. The recalls hurt the reputation of the automaker so much that it had to suspend the sale of 8 models in January 2010 and halt car launches for the entire year.
"
601,GT,"Later on, the automaker recalled a second batch, about 300,000 vehicles of its Lexus luxury sedans due to problems with their computerized steering systems, fuel tank leakage and defective valve springs. The recalls led the automaker to suspend the sale of its models several times and halt new car launches for the year.
"
602,GT,"In the spate of recalls following Toyota’s, other automakers started bringing back vehicles from the market. Nissan found faulty brake pedal pins and fuel-gauge component problems. Honda discovered flaws in air bag inflators and braking systems, and General Motors admitted to defects in steering wheels, fuel hoses and seating problems in certain models.
"
603,GT,"In order to break free from the backlash of safety recalls, Toyota began offering huge promotions, including cheap leases, zero-percent financing for 5 years and free maintenance for 2 years for return customers on most of its line-up. The company’s president, Akio Toyoda, has also apologized to the shareholders of the company.
"
604,GT,"However, Toyota’s peace offerings were in vain. The U.S. government has imposed the highest-ever fine of $16.4 million on the company, accusing it of a deliberate delay in recalling the vehicles by hiding its flaws. The company also faces numerous personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits, amounting to $4 billion in federal courts. A monthly survey by Consumer Reports has revealed that percentage of owners “most likely agree to buy another new vehicle from Toyota has reduced to 57% in April from 70% in December last year.
"
605,GT,"The auto industry is a highly concentrated one. About 10 global automakers account for over 77% of the production worldwide. Among them, Toyota Motors (TM  -  Free Report) leads with a 13.3% market share, while its domestic rivals, including Nissan Motor and its alliance with Renault account for 8.4% of the auto market, Honda Motor (HMC  -  Free Report) 5.6% and Suzuki 3.8%.
"
606,GT,"Among the Detroit automakers, General Motors (“GM) holds 11.9% of the auto market, Ford (F  -  Free Report) 7.8% and Chrysler-Fiat 6.4% of the auto industry.
"
607,GT,"The recent economic crisis has provided an impetus to a massive structural change in the auto industry, setting the stage for growth over the next decade. Given the high barriers to entry and the need for scale economies (in operations, supply chain and marketing), the global auto industry landscape is expected to be ruled by global automakers and suppliers based in the six major auto markets – China, India, Japan, Korea, Western Europe and the U.S.
"
608,GT,"In the key growth market of China, the domestic automakers are likely to be the most dominant ones as their government plans to consolidate the top 14 domestic automotive players into 10, with a more than 90% share in the local market.OPPORTUNITIES
"
609,GT,"To remain competitive, automakers will need to design vehicles that will meet the requirements of consumers in both mature and emerging markets. Automakers will focus on more user-friendly and low-cost vehicles that are also the most advanced technologically.
"
610,GT,"The automakers will continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. For example, Greater China and South America together are projected to represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015.
"
611,GT,"There are two underlying factors behind this location shift in the auto industry. The first is the cost factor. The cost of labor in emerging auto markets continues to be a fraction of that in the developed world. The second is the demand factor. Many low-cost regions, including the emerging auto markets, have high potential for growth. Thus, the shift in auto industry production facilities will lead to a localization of the manufacturing base that will bring down transportation costs.
"
612,GT,"The emergence of trading blocs is also giving this process a push in the auto market. It is likely that over time there will be fewer car imports from outside a trade zone.
"
613,GT,"Further, automakers have started to reduce the number of technological platforms with a greater diversity of models produced from each platform in order to remain cost competitive in the auto industry.
"
614,GT,"For example, Honda, with its flexible common platform, has developed three dimensionally distinct versions of the Accord, allowing for designs where 60% of the components are common. Ford aims to build 680,000 vehicles per core global platform within five years, up from current levels of 345,000 units. After emerging from its bankruptcy, General Motors has started focusing solely on four core brands – Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC.
"
615,GT,"Higher fuel prices and concerns over global warming have pooled attention on the auto industry that either rely less on traditional fossil fuels or use renewable sources of less expensive energy. Thus, “green alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids will attract consumers in the wealthier countries while flex-fuels such as ethanol and natural gas will be highly sought-after in the emerging auto markets where the local climate or resource base favors their usage by automakers over petroleum.
"
616,GT,"Consequently, there will be a variety of powertrain technologies in the auto industry by the next decade. It is likely that “green cars will represent up to a third of total global sales in developed auto markets and up to 20% in urban areas of emerging auto markets by 2020. Some of the “green cars have already generated a huge response in the auto industry. These include the Ford Focus, GM Volt, Daimler (DAI) Smart, Nissan Leaf and Toyota Prius.
"
617,GT,"The role of governments must not be overlooked. Governments in all major countries have become active auto industry players. Their investments through emergency loans and incentive packages, such as “Cash for Clunkers in the U.S., are a good example of this. Moreover, governments' energy and environmental policies will be highly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years.Detroit’s Comeback
"
618,GT,"The Big Three Detroit automakers -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- lost consumer confidence in 2009 after they were severely hit by the global economic crisis. The crisis also exposed the inherent problem with the Big Three’s product portfolio, which lacked up-to-date engineering and extensive research and development. 
"
619,GT,"Further, the majority of their sales comprised pickup trucks and SUVs rather than fuel-efficient vehicles such as the small cars that the consumers have started to prefer. In 2009, GM’s truck sales accounted for 54% of the cars and trucks sales, Ford’s 62% and Chrysler’s 73%.
"
620,GT,"This skewed portfolio was further aggravated by the government’s push for fuel-efficient and environment-friendly small cars. Ford rallied better than its hometown rivals, with an early response to the shift in consumer preference towards small cars. In 2009, sales at Ford dropped 15% while sales at GM and Chrysler plunged 30% and 36%, respectively.
"
621,GT,"However, with a recovery in the global market and restructuring of the product portfolio, the Detroit automakers -- especially Ford and GM -- stood up at the end of 2009. Ford focused on its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury branded cars, shedding Volvo cars, while GM concentrated on four core brands -- Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac -- withdrawing Saturn, Hummer, Pontiac and Saab.
"
622,GT,"In December last year, Ford saw its best month since May 2008 by posting a sales gain of 33%, driven by a wide acceptance of its redesigned Taurus, Fusion and Escape. Meanwhile, sales of GM’s four core brands grew 2% during the month. In the first quarter of 2010, Ford’s sales surged 39.5% while GM’s sales rose 17.4%. The recent fall from grace of Toyota due to its massive recall (touched upon below) has been a major boost to the Big Three’s fortunes, as well.WEAKNESSES

"
630,GT,"Vehicle recalls have become the talk of the town after Toyota’s announcement of the largest-ever global recall of 8.5 million vehicles related to problems such as faulty accelerator gas pedals and slipping floor mats as well as faulty braking systems. The recall included popular models such as 2010 Prius hybrid and Toyota Camry.
"
631,GT,"The recalls hurt the reputation of the automaker so much that it had to suspend the sale of 8 models in January 2010 and halt new car launches for the full year.

632,GT,"In the spate of recalls following Toyota’s, other automakers started bringing back vehicles from the market. Nissan found faulty brake pedal pins and fuel-gauge component problems. Honda discovered flaws in air bag inflators and braking systems and General Motors admitted to defects in steering wheels, fuel hoses and seating problems in certain models.
"
633,GT,"In order to break free from the backlash of safety recalls, Toyota began offering huge promotions, including cheap leases, zero-percent financing for 5 years and free maintenance for 2 years for return customers on most of its line-up. According to Autodata Corp., Toyota's incentive during March 2010 increased 46% to $2,310 per vehicle compared with GM's incentive of $3,174 per vehicle (down 19% year-over-year) and Ford's incentive of $3,035 per vehicle (down 2% year-over-year). 
"
634,GT,"However, incentives are mixed blessings. A dismal situation arrives once they inevitably expire and demand slumps back to the traditional level. Dealers run out of stock for popular models, compounded by a slow ramp-up of production by the automakers to replenish the lots. On the other hand, if the incentives are extended further, as announced by some automakers including Toyota, it exerts a lot of pressure on the respective automaker’s inventory and profit margins.
"
635,GT,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 15.4% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is GT due for a breakout?

638,GT,"Last week saw several a number of auto companies reporting results for the quarter ending on Sep 30, 2017. Two important companies which came up with results in the past week are Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report). While Honda registered better-than-expected earnings, Tesla’s loss per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Tesla fell short of its third-quarter 2017 production goals of the new and affordable Model 3 sedan. This indicates that production has not been as smooth as anticipated. However, in its third-quarter results, the company has somewhat moderated its target production of Model 3.On the other hand, auto companies which reported better-than-expected earnings are Autoliv, Inc. (ALV  -  Free Report), The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report) and Cummins Inc.

639,GT,"First-quarter earnings season is off to a good start from the standpoint of earnings surprises. Among the 249 companies within the S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P Midcap 400 and S&P Smallcap 600) to have reported as of Thursday evening, 151 have exceeded expectations and 64 have missed estimates. (The rest have matched forecasts.) This equates to a surprise ratio of 2.4, which is better than the 1.88 ratio we saw about the same time during fourth-quarter earnings season. 
"
640,GT,"Growth rates, however, have been notably slower. Average growth, excluding outliers, has been running at 4.3% versus 14.1% in the fourth-quarter. Banking and semiconductor companies have been a drag on the average growth rate. Investors should keep in mind that less than a quarter of companies have reported, so both the surprise and growth numbers are not fully representative of all industries. The expectation is that the average growth rate will rise as more reports come in.
"
641,GT,"Nearly 850 companies are confirmed to report during the week of Apr 23 - 27, 174 of which are members of the S&P 500. Dow components 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Du Pont (DD), Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) are on deck.

Wednesday features March durable goods orders and new home sales data. Thursday features the weekly initial jobless claims report. Nothing is scheduled for Friday.

All of the covering brokerage analysts took notice and pushed the consensus estimate up 10 cents to 11 cents per share. TSCO exceeded estimates by a penny last quarter.

"
654,GT,"The auto industry is a highly concentrated one. About 10 global automakers account for over 77% of the production worldwide. In the first nine months of 2010, General Motors (MTLQQ) led with a 19% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report) with a 16.7% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. (TM  -  Free Report) with a 15.2% market share, Honda Motor Co. (HMC  -  Free Report) with a 10.6% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 9.5% market share and Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY  -  Free Report) with a 7.8% market share.
"
655,GT,"The recent economic crisis has provided an impetus to a massive structural change in the auto industry, setting the stage for growth over the next decade. Given the high barriers to entry and the need for scale economies (in operations, supply chain and marketing), the global auto industry landscape is expected to be ruled by global automakers and suppliers based in the six major auto markets – China, India, Japan, Korea, Western Europe and the U.S.
"
656,GT,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
657,GT,"To remain competitive, automakers will need to design vehicles that will meet the requirements of consumers in both mature and emerging markets. Automakers will focus on more user-friendly and low-cost vehicles that are also the most advanced technologically.
"
658,GT,"The automakers will continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. For example, Greater China and South America together are projected to represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015.
"
659,GT,"There are two underlying factors behind this location shift in the auto industry. The first is the cost factor. The cost of labor in emerging auto markets continues to be a fraction of that in the developed world. The second is the demand factor. Many low-cost regions, including the emerging auto markets, have high potential for growth. Thus, the shift in auto industry production facilities will lead to a localization of the manufacturing base that will bring down transportation costs.
"
660,GT,"The emergence of trading blocs is also giving this process a push in the auto market. It is likely that over time there will be fewer car imports from outside a trade zone.
"
661,GT,"Further, automakers have started to reduce the number of technological platforms with a greater diversity of models produced from each platform in order to remain cost competitive in the auto industry.
"
662,GT,"For example, Honda, with its flexible common platform, has developed three dimensionally distinct versions of the Accord, allowing for designs where 60% of the components are common. Ford aims to build 680,000 vehicles per core global platform by 2015, up from the current level of 345,000 units.
"
663,GT,"Higher fuel prices and concerns over global warming have pooled attention on the auto industry that either rely less on traditional fossil fuels or use renewable sources of less expensive energy. Thus, “green alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids will attract consumers in the wealthier countries while flex-fuels such as ethanol and natural gas will be highly sought-after in the emerging auto markets where the local climate or resource base favors their usage by automakers over petroleum.
"
664,GT,"Consequently, there will be a variety of powertrain technologies in the auto industry by the next decade. It is likely that “green cars will represent up to a third of total global sales in developed auto markets and up to 20% in urban areas of emerging auto markets by 2020. Some of the “green cars have already generated a huge response in the auto industry. These include the Ford Focus, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf, Toyota Prius and Daimler AG’s Smart fortwo micro EV.
"
665,GT,"The role of governments must not be overlooked. Governments in all major countries have become active auto industry players. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years.Detroit’s Comeback
"
666,GT,"The Big Three Detroit automakers -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- lost consumer confidence in 2009 after they were severely hit by the global economic crisis. The crisis also exposed the inherent problem with the Big Three’s product portfolio, which lacked up-to-date engineering and extensive research and development.
"
667,GT,"Further, the majority of their sales comprised pickup trucks and SUVs rather than fuel-efficient vehicles such as the small cars that the consumers have started to prefer. In 2009, GM’s truck sales accounted for 54% of the cars and trucks sales, Ford’s 62% and Chrysler’s 73%.
"
668,GT,"This skewed portfolio was further aggravated by the government’s push for fuel-efficient and environment-friendly small cars. Ford rallied better than its hometown rivals, with an early response to the shift in consumer preference towards small cars. In 2009, sales at Ford dropped 15% while sales at GM and Chrysler plunged 30% and 36%, respectively.
"
669,GT,"However, with a recovery in the global market and restructuring of the product portfolio, the Detroit automakers, especially Ford and GM, bounced back at the end of 2009. In the first nine months of 2010, Ford’s sales went up 21%, while sales of GM and Chrysler grew 6% and 15% during the period, respectively.
"
670,GT,"Ford focuses on its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury branded cars, shedding the Volvo cars, while GM concentrates on four core brands -- Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac -- withdrawing Saturn, Hummer, Pontiac and Saab.
"
671,GT,"Further, Ford has decided to expand its luxury Lincoln line-up at the cost of its Mercury line-up, which will be phased out by the end of 2010. The company plans to launch as many as 7 new Lincoln vehicles in the next 4 years, including a small car.
"
672,GT,"Due to the restructuring of product portfolio and a recovery in the North American automotive market, Ford delivered a $1.04 billion improvement in profit during the third quarter of 2010. The automaker has indicated its strong and continues focus on product development plan by providing a capital spending guidance of $4 billion for the full-year 2010.
"
673,GT,"GM, on the other hand, will return to the stock market billboard through its initial public offering (IPO) of common stock, to be held in November 18, 2010. The IPO will raise about $10 billion for the company, which will be utilized mostly for repaying the U.S. government loans. With this, the company will succeed in shedding its government ownership to less than 50%.The Rise of Asian Automakers
"
674,GT,"The Asian countries, especially China and India, are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry over the next five to seven years. According to Global Insight -- a U.S. based provider of economic and financial information -- 14.7% of growth is expected to come from India and 8.3% from China by 2013 (compared with 2008 levels). The growth in these markets can be attributed to government incentives and a rapidly growing economy, boosting up big-ticket purchases.
"
675,GT,"Domestic automakers are likely to rule the key growth market of China as the government plans to consolidate the top 14 domestic automotive players into 10. These automakers would capture a share of more than 90% in the local market.
"
676,GT,"The Chinese automakers have been struggling hard to enhance their global profile by upgrading their technology to meet the international standards. To this end, Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Group (BAIC) has purchased the intellectual property rights from GM’s Saab in order to develop its own brands and introduce new models. BAIC purchased the rights to certain powertrain, engine and gear-box technology for Saab's 9-5 and 9-3 sedans.
"
677,GT,"In a similar move, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group bought Volvo cars from Ford in order to tap China's high-growth auto market by acquiring modern, innovative technologies from the Swedish brand to upgrade its car lineup. In December last year, Geely also signed up with Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) to be its global parts supplier.
"
678,GT,"The Indian automakers are also sallying into international markets by introducing their innovative products that could meet consumers demand abroad. Tata Motors (TTM  -  Free Report) has revealed it will launch its European version of the small car, Nano Europa in 2011 and an U.S. version of the same car by 2012. On the other hand, India’s utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra has announced launching TR20 and TR40 pickups in the U.S. that is more economical compared to other pickups sold in the country.WEAKNESSES
"
679,GT,"Although automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors, developing the supplier networks remains one of the greatest challenges they face in the auto industry. Existing suppliers to automakers often lack the financial background to expand capacity in new markets. On the other hand, auto market suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties, which may result in new and lower-cost competitors.
"
680,GT,"Since 1999, more than 20 of the largest global auto parts suppliers have filed for bankruptcy. The financial condition of the majority of auto market suppliers continues to deteriorate, resulting from a historically weak demand and higher dependence on automakers. According to the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, 12% of the auto industry suppliers do not have sufficient working capital to support a 10%–25% expansion in production.
"
681,GT,"Thus, despite the government’s sizable investment in the automakers, it is likely that there will be auto market suppliers who are unable to restart operations due to working capital shortfalls even as automaker production resumes.
"
682,GT,"Higher dependence on automakers makes the auto market suppliers vulnerable to several maladies, primarily pricing pressure and production cuts. Pricing pressure from automakers is constricting auto market suppliers’ margins. On the other hand, production cuts by automakers driven by frequent market adjustments are negatively affecting their operations.
"
683,GT,"Some of the auto industry suppliers who have a high reliance on a few automakers such as General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Volkswagen include American Axle and Manufacturing (AXL  -  Free Report), ArvinMeritor (ARM), Goodyear Tire and Rubber (GT  -  Free Report), Magna International (MGA  -  Free Report), Superior Industries (SUP  -  Free Report), Tenneco Inc. (TEN  -  Free Report) and TRW Automotive (TRW).
"
684,GT,"The shift in auto market consumer preferences towards hi-tech, fuel-efficient, environment-friendly vehicles, such as small cars/hybrids/EVs, is another issue. Auto market suppliers are expected to quickly adapt to the new technologies by investing in research and development, putting heavy capital burdens on them.
"
685,GT,"The automakers also face significant challenges in transforming the existing powertrain technologies into the new versions, as far as marketability is concerned. They are adapting the internal combustion engines to alternative energy, including ethanol and bio-fuels. Ultimately, a time may come when they switch to the all-electric powertrain as their sole powertrain solution. However, the shift in powertrain solution technology needs to be supported by adequate charging outlets in order to recharge batteries.Safety Recalls – The New Crisis
"
686,GT,"Vehicle recalls have become the talk of the town after Toyota’s announcement of a series of recall since September 2009. So far, the automaker has recalled about 11 million vehicles globally in greater than 15 installments, more than any other automaker.
"
687,GT,"Toyota’s recalls were related to problems such as faulty accelerator gas pedals, slipping floor mats and defective braking systems. They led the automaker to suspend the sale of its models several times and halt new car launches for the year.

703,GT,"An earnings announcement is an important event and has a large impact on an investors’ opinion about the current and future value of a particular company. A positive earnings report can lead to price appreciation, which produces higher returns for its investors.That said, earnings releases for different sectors, including the Auto segment, are now pouring in. Per the latest Earnings Outlook, as of Jan 31, 185 companies from the S&P 500 index have already announced results for the quarter ending Dec 31, 2017, registering earnings and revenue beat ratios of 82.2% and 80%, respectively. Earnings and revenues beat ratios for the companies coming from the Auto sector are 66.7% and 100%, respectively.The auto sector’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to register 10.3% growth, while the top line is likely to witness a 2.5% year-over-year decline. However, the S&P 500 companies are estimated to register 11.9% and 7.6% year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues, respectively, during the quarter.Now, let’s take a look at the auto companies slated to report results in the next few weeks. After a record 2016, auto sales in the United States declined in 2017. This is the first time since the financial crisis that auto sales have declined from the previous-year figure.According to Autodata, in 2017, auto sales in the United States were 17.2 million, down from 17.85 million in the prior year. Despite the decline, 2017 overall was a robust year for the auto industry. Auto sales are likely to decline further in 2018 despite a strong economy. Rising interest rates and return of a huge number of late-model used cars are coming in the way of new vehicle sales.Auto Sales: On A Rough TrackAuto companies have come up with January 2018 sales figures. In January, Ford Motor Company (F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. reported year-over-year sales decline, whereas General Motors Company (GM) and Toyota Motor Corporation reported an increase in sales.Major automakers expect auto sales in 2018 to remain weak. Dealing with consumers’ changing preferences; a shift from passenger cars to pickup trucks and SUVs will be a challenge for automakers.Also in the coming days, vehicle sales will depend not only on different conventional determinants such as the energy price and state of the economy, but also on some new factors, such as the progress made in the electric and autonomous vehicle driving front.Auto Stocks: Some Bright SpotsIn an otherwise gloomy environment, there are certainly some discernible bright spots. Healthy economic growth, better employment and record high consumer confidence are likely to give an impetus to auto demand. Also, the tax cuts should provide some extra advantage to profits and sales.Also, some investors are moving into auto stocks with the belief that the high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs will pull automakers through any downturn.The Zacks MethodologyIrrespective of the outlook of the auto sector, there are a few auto stocks which are likely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the fourth quarter.Figuring out such prospective stocks could be quite tough unless one applies the proper method. The Zacks methodology makes the task simple, by combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

710,GT,"Key Points:Almost done with earnings season, with 433 or 86.6% of S&P 500 second quarter results in. Total earnings growth low at 11.2%, but mostly due to one stock (BAC  -  Free Report). Ex-Financials, growth is 20.9% year over year. Total revenue growth 12.15%, 12.73% ex-Financials. Median earnings surprise 3.13% and median sales surprise 2.06%. Remaining firms (67) expected to grow 8.9%, 5.4% growth expected excluding Financials.If remaining firms all report in line, then 87.9% of earnings are now in. Final growth to be 10.95%, 18.80% ex-Financials. At start of earnings season 9.65% growth expected, 12.18% ex-Financials.Earnings beats top misses by a 3.42 ratio, sales beats top misses by 2.81 ratio, 69.5% of all firms report positive earnings surprise, 72.1% beat on revenues.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 jumps 45.6% in 2010, expected to rise 16.0% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 11.5%. Financials major earnings driver in 2010. Excluding Financials, growth was 27.7% in 2010, and expected to be 18.8% in 2011 and 10.8% in 2012.Total revenues for the S&P 500 rose 7.78% in 2010, expected to be up 6.72% in 2011, and 6.54% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues up 9.16% in 2010, expected to rise 11.14% in 2011 and 5.96% in 2012.Annual Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.40% in 2009 to 8.65% for 2010, 9.34% expected for 2011 and 9.83% in 2012. Margin Expansion major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.07% in 2009, 8.27% for 2010, 8.84% expected in 2011, and 9.25% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.61 for 2011, at 1.41 for 2012, both bullish readings. Up from last week and driven by new increases, not old estimates falling out. Ratio of firms with rising-to-falling mean estimates at 1.44 for 2011, 1.30 for 2012 -- bullish readings. Total revisions activity still climbing, but should peak soon.The S&P 500 earned $546.5 billion in 2009, rising to $795.4 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $922.2 billion in 2011. In 2012, the 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.028 trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.20 in 2009: $83.16 in 2010 and $96.47 in 2011 expected, bottom up. For 2012, $107.53 expected. Puts P/Es at 14.4x for 2010 and 12.4x for 2011 and 11.2x for 2012, very attractive relative to 10-year T-note rate of 2.56%. Top-down estimates: $96.26 for 2011 and $105.44 for 2012.  Problems Here and There 
"
711,GT,"Second quarter earnings season is almost over, with 433 of the S&P 500, or 86.6%, of the reports in. With the exception of a handful of financials, most notably Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), which had a $12 billion negative swing in net income from last year, this is another great earnings season.
"
712,GT,"The year-over-year growth rate for the S&P 500 is 11.2%, way off the 20.9% pace those same 433 firms posted in the first quarter. However, it you exclude the Financial sector, growth is 20.9%, down only slightly from the 21.2% pace of the first quarter.
"
713,GT,"The 86.6% reported figure slightly understates how far we are along in earnings season. If all the remaining firms were to report exactly in line with expectations, we now have 87.9% of the total earnings in. At the beginning of earnings season, growth of 9.7% was expected, 12.2% ex-Financials.
"
714,GT,"Top line results are also very strong, with 12.15% year-over-year growth for the 433, actually up from the 9.72% growth they posted in the first quarter. The top-line results are even more impressive if the Financials are excluded, rising to 12.73% from the 10.67% pace of the first quarter. Top-line surprises have been almost as good as than the bottom line surprises, with a median surprise of 2.06% and a 2.81 surprise ratio.
"
715,GT,"The revenue growth in the first half is remarkable, given only 0.4% GDP growth in the first quarter and just 1.3% in the second, with low overall inflation. High commodity prices helped revenues among the Energy and Materials sectors, and higher growth abroad and currency translation effects from a weak dollar have also helped.What to Expect from the Rest
"
716,GT,"For those (67) still to report, the rate of growth is expected to be well below what we have seen already, with growth of 8.9%, in total and 5.4% ex Financials. I suspect that the actual growth will be somewhat higher than is now expected. With six sectors now done, and many more sectors with only one or two firms left to go, use caution in interpreting the “expected tables at the sector level.
"
717,GT,"Revenue growth for the remaining firms is also expected to slow, falling 1.52% among those yet to report, down from +4.79% they reported in the first quarter. Excluding the Financials, growth is expected to be 4.63%, down from 4.75% of the first quarter.Net Margins Slimming
"
718,GT,"Net margins have been one of the keys to earnings growth, but cracks in the story are starting to appear. The 433 that have reported have net margins of 9.69%, down from 9.77% a year ago. That, however, is due to the Financials, especially BAC. Excluding Financials, next margins have come in at 9.08%, up from 8.47% a year ago. 
"
719,GT,"The higher margin firms have reported early, 31% of the remaining firms are retailers, and traditionally retail is the lowest margin sector. The remainder are expected to post net margins of 6.66% up from last year’s 6.02%. Excluding Financials, the expected net margins are 6.05%, up from 6.01% last year.
"
720,GT,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.40% in 2009. They hit 8.65% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.34% in 2011 and 9.83% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.07% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.27% in 2010. They are expected to rise to 8.84% in 2011 and 9.25% in 2012.Full-Year Expectations & Beyond
"
721,GT,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $795.2 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $922.2 billion, or increases of 45.6% and 16.0%, respectively.
"
722,GT,"The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 trillion mark to $1.028 Trillion, for growth of 11.5%. That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $107.53. That is up from $57.15 for 2009, $83.16 for 2010 and $96.47 for 2011.
"
723,GT,"In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding 2.56%, a P/E of 14.4x based on 2010 and 12.4x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 11.2x.Heavy Estimate Revisions
"
724,GT,"Estimate revisions activity is soaring (as is seasonally normal). During the seasonal decline in revisions activity, the ratio of increases to cuts also declined sharply, from over 2.0 at the height of the last earnings season, to slightly below 1.0 for both this year and next. Now as activity is ticking up, so are the revisions ratios standing at 1.61 (up from 1.45 last week) for 2011 and 1.41 (up from 1.36) for 2012.
"
725,GT,"The fundamental backing for the market continues to be solid. It is important to keep your eyes on the prize. There is lots of news out there, and much of it is more dramatic than earnings results, but rarely does it have more significance for your portfolio. Earning are, and are going to remain, the single most important thing for the stock market. Interest rates are an important, but distant second.  
"
726,GT,"At the micro level, earnings and valuations provide plenty of reason to be bullish. This is particularly true when one looks at the prevailing level of interest rates. Currently 160 S&P 500 (32.0%) firms have dividend yields higher than the Friday yield on the 10-year T-note, and more than half (295, or 59.0%) yield more than the 5-year note.
"
727,GT,"One thing is absolutely certain: the coupon payment on those notes will never go up, while companies have been raising their dividends at a rapid pace of late. Nearly one quarter of the firms in the S&P 500 have raised their dividend at more than a 10% per year rate over the last five years, and those five years include the worst economic downturn since the 1930’s.Encore Performance Scheduled
"
728,GT,"While major corporations, as represented by the S&P 500 are in great shape, not only with nicely growing earnings, but also with great balance sheets, all is not well in the markets, mostly because of political problems and a bad macro economy. In particular, there are major problems on both sides of the Atlantic. On this side, we managed to avoid an economic end of the world scenario last Tuesday when Congress passed a last minute raising of the debt ceiling. It only happened because President Obama caved in. He should have just invoked the 14th Amendment and told the Tea Party to go jump in a lake.
"
729,GT,"In effect, the Tea Party had held the economy hostage, and in the end Obama decided to pay a ransom. That ransom was about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade, and the formation of a “Super Committee to identify an additional $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade. If the Super Committee reaches an impasse by their deadline (Just before Thanksgiving) or Congress does not pass their plan (by Christmas), $1.2 trillion of spending cuts will automatically go into effect.
"
730,GT,"While the first part of the spending cuts are back-end loaded, with almost no spending cuts for the rest of 2011 and minimal cuts for 2012, the same is not true of the $1.2 trillion, which is a meat-cleaver approach and is very front-end loaded. Those cuts will kill the economy, which in turn will depress tax revenues by throwing us back into recession, and in the end might well result in a higher, not lower deficit. In other words, there is another hostage ripe for the taking.
"
731,GT,"If you enjoyed the debt-ceiling circus and are sad that the show is over, don’t worry -- there will be an encore performance just before Thanksgiving. It seems clear to me that the Super Committee is begin set up to fail and to reach an impasse. The GOP will appoint members who will not even discuss revenue increases. The Democrats will appoint strong defenders of Social Security, Medicare and programs like Food Stamps.
"
732,GT,"In the end, either the Democrats and Obama will once again fold like lawn chairs, or we will see the $1.2 trillion meat cleaver cuts go into effect. You think I’m being too political and over the top by calling the Tea Party Hostage takers? Don’t take my word for it, how about Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s?
"
733,GT,"“I think some of our members may have thought the default issue was a hostage you might take a chance at shooting, he said. “Most of us didn’t think that. What we did learn is this — it’s a hostage that’s worth ransoming.""S&P Downgrade Overblown, but...
"
734,GT,"This is exactly the dynamic that caused S&P to downgrade Treasury bonds to AA+ from AAA. Let me make one thing perfectly clear: as long as the debt is denominated in dollars (all of it is now) and the government owns a printing press that can print those dollars, the only way the government can default is if we make an absurdly stupid political decision to do so. That statement is true if the national debt is $14.5 trillion, or it is $114.5 trillion.
"
735,GT,"Could all that printing be inflationary? Of course it could. The debt covenants do not specify the purchasing power of the dollars paid back, just that they are paid back. However, right now inflation is not a problem. Right now the bond market, through the spread between regular T-notes and TIPS is forecasted to average about 2% per year over the next ten years, which is less than the 2.57% it has averaged over the last 20 years.No AAA Political System
"
736,GT,"What S&P is saying is not that we don’t have a AAA economy or ability to pay, it is saying that we don’t have a AAA political system. After all, we just had a large number of members of the Congress that were saying “Let's just go ahead and default. That should be the realm of wing-nut bloggers, not people who actually have the job of governing this country.
"
737,GT,"I should also make two points as well. The S&P rating is only an opinion about the probability of a default, and the S&P has been disastrously wrong in the past. They handed out AAA ratings like candy on Halloween to any pile of bad mortgages tall enough to ring the doorbell, and they assigned a AAA rating to Enron until just days before it wrote the eleventh and final chapter in the firm's history.
"
738,GT,"Second, this does not have to mean that U.S. interest rates are going to have to rise (other than some potential short-term volatility). In time of stress, T-notes are still going to be the first place that institutions look to park money when they want to flee to a safe place, regardless of what S&P says about how safe they are.
"
739,GT,"There are simply no other markets that are big enough to do the job. Not the Swiss franc, not gold, not AAA corporates. All of them are simply too small to do the job. S&P downgraded Japan a long time ago, and their long-term bond rates are even lower than ours are and have been since they were downgraded.
"
740,GT,"Are the Chinese going to dump their Treasuries? NO. What would they do with the money if they did? Buy bonds in euros or yen? If they did so they would have to sell dollars and buy either yen or euros. That would weaken the dollar and strengthen those currencies. That would make our exports cheaper and imports more expensive, and thus lower our trade deficit. That would be a good thing for the economy.
"
741,GT,"Thus I don’t think that the S&P downgrade is, in and of itself, a big problem. There are some areas where there might be some difficulty. For example, it is exceedingly rare, if not unheard of for a sub unit of government to have a higher credit rating than the sovereign, so the states that still have AAA ratings will probably face downgrades, and that could hurt them.
"
742,GT,"Also, the remaining AAA firms in the country may see downgrades as well. Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) are fine firms with excellent balance sheets, but to suggest that they are less likely to default than the U.S. government is silly. They don’t won a printing press that can legally churn out dollars, the government does.Some Very Real Problems Here
"
743,GT,"Growth is very weak. In the second quarter the economy grew at only 1.3%, far below the consensus estimates of 1.7% growth. The real shocker in the report was the downward revisions to past quarters. Most notably, the first quarter was revised down to just 0.4% from 1.9% and the fourth quarter was revised down to 2.3% from 3.1%.
"
744,GT,"It also showed that the recession was FAR worse than previously reported, with a total decline in Real GDP of 5.1%, not the 4.2% we thought we had suffered. We need at least 2% growth to bring down unemployment.
"
745,GT,"Obama now says he wants to fight for jobs. Unfortunately, he just bargained away all of the ammo he needs to fight with. It is not that the current round of spending cuts are that big in the short term -- they aren’t. The problem is it precludes taking any other fiscal action that could help on the growth and employment front.And Even Bigger Ones Over There
"
746,GT,"The drama was not limited to this side of the Atlantic. The sovereign debt crisis there is now focused on Italy. It is the third largest economy in the Euro Zone, and Spain, number four, looks to also be under attack. Both of which were supposed to be part of the lifeguard group that was going out to rescue Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Well, the first and most important requirement to be a lifeguard is the ability to swim, and Italy is proving itself to be no Michael Phelps. Its interest rates have spiked to over 6%, which is unsustainable.
"
747,GT,"There was a serious question during the week if the European Central Bank (ECB) would continue to buy, or continue to accept as collateral, Italian debt. That was the spark that lit the 513 point drop in the Dow on Thursday. On Friday, the ECB announced that it would, but only if Italy imposed a stiff austerity program right away, just like Greece, Portugal and Ireland are doing.
"
748,GT,"This “economic rescue that the ECB agreed to on Friday (and thus causing the market to rally back to finished mixed on Friday, rather than down hard again) is bound to fail, just as the packages for Greece, Ireland and Portugal are failing.
"
749,GT,"Ultimately, one of two things is going to have to happen. Either fiscal policy will have to be consolidated in Europe as a whole, which means that the individual countries will have to give up most of their sovereignty. Essentially Italy will have to become like Florida, and Germany like California. For that to happen, the overwhelming majority of people in Europe will have to think of themselves first and foremost as Europeans, not as French, German or Italian, just as most people here tend to think of themselves first and foremost as Americans, not as New Yorkers, Buckeyes or Hoosiers. Given historical, cultural and language differences in Europe, that seems unlikely to happen.
"
750,GT,"It would also mean that people in Germany and the Netherlands would see a big part of their tax dollars flowing to Greece and Spain, just like people in Connecticut and New Jersey see a big part of their tax dollars flowing to Mississippi and Alaska. If that doesn’t happen, the common euro currency has to fall apart.
"
751,GT,"Italy and Greece, unlike the U.S., do not have their own printing press. They have to rely on the printing press of the ECB, and that is largely controlled by the Germans. The process of unscrambling the euro-egg and going back to drachmas and lira is going to be a very messy one, and will result in huge dislocations, and thus potentially cause economic collapse. For example, if someone in Italy owes $1 million euros, how many lira will that be when there is no longer a euro to pay back?
"
752,GT,"European banks are heavily invested in the bonds of the PIIGS, and there is a real threat to the stability of the European banking system. If it goes down, ours will follow as night follows day.  This is not a problem caused here, and is not the fault of Obama, or Bush, or Congress for that matter. It is a mess of the Europeans own making, but its effects will be felt here, just as the effects of the mortgage mess of our making were felt there.This Too Shall Pass
"
753,GT,"All this said, I am still inherently optimistic. The U.S. has weathered many storms before -- world wars, depressions, terrorist strikes -- and has always proved resilient. Stock market valuations remain compelling, and it is good to buy when things are cheap. Usually the end of the world does not happen.
"
754,GT,"There are plenty of companies that are in great shape and which will continue to grow and prosper. In the final analysis, the value of a company is based on what it will earn in the future, and what interest rate you have to discount those future earnings by. Corporate earnings are still very strong and interest rates are very low. Still, these are perilous times on a macro level.
"
755,GT,"I first suggested taking out insurance against a debt ceiling fiasco in the June 30th edition of Earnings Trends. Then the 120 September SPY puts (my suggested vehicle, but just an example) were trading for $0.89. Now they are going for $4.65. If you followed my advice, sell off half of your position now. Close out the position if the S&P 500 falls below 1100, which would be just about a doubling from here.
"
756,GT,"On balance, I remain bullish. I am, however, pulling back on my year-end target price for the S&P 500. I had been looking for about 1400 by the end of the year (since December). With the slower economy, and the turmoil on both sides of the Atlantic, something more on the order of 1325 now looks more realistic.
"
757,GT,"Strong earnings should trump a dicey international situation, and the drama in DC. Valuations on stocks look very compelling, with the S&P trading from just 12.44x 2011, and 11.16x 2012 earnings. Put in terms of earnings yields, we are looking at 8.04% and 8.96%, while T-notes are only at 2.56%.
"
758,GT,"The old “Fed Model suggested that the forward earnings yield (call it 8.50%) should be in line with the 10-year note. On that basis, stocks are wildly undervalued. Even based on the 10-year trailing P/E, which includes two periods of very depressed earnings, and does not take into consideration interest rates, stocks are just about fairly valued. Between here and there could be a very bumpy ride though. The direct implications of the S&P downgrade are overblown, but the other problems we face are not.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseWe have another great earnings season underway. So far, 319 (63.8%) reports in. Total growth looks low at 12.24% but that is entirely due to a handful of Financials). We have a 3.13 surprise ratio, and 3.13% median surprise. Positive Surprises for 69.5% of all firms reporting.Positive year-over-year growth for 320, falling EPS for 104 firms, a 3.13 ratio, 75.3% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Six sectors done, most others down to one or two left to go.Autos, Discretionary and Tech lead in surprise; Transports, Industrials lag.
"

762,GT,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. The second shows the largest declines. To qualify, there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50.
"
763,GT,"In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
764,GT,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month. This week’s cut off +/- 5%, 55 make increase cut, 35 make decrease cut.Seventeen increases greater than 10%, 22 decreases.Financials, Energy and Steel dominate the decrease list.Biggest FY1 Revisions(Largest Increases) Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstZions Bancorp ZION 73.00% 2.39% 0.88 0.24 24.53 10.73Cabot Oil & Gas COG 51.81% 31.23% 0.67 0.67 43.61 23.97Whirlpool Corp WHR 38.03% -7.79% 0.00 -1.00 5.69 7.53Goodyear Tire GT 30.45% 1.42% 0.67 0.11 9.85 6.32Wynn Resrts Ltd WYNN 25.11% 20.57% 0.90 0.79 25.95 22.76First Hrzn Natl FHN 19.92% -1.21% 0.70 0.00 13.19 10.84Xl Group Plc XL 18.18% 4.04% 0.67 0.38 15.77 9.00Nrg Energy Inc NRG 13.53% -6.03% 0.14 0.00 24.01 30.50M&T Bank Corp MTB 13.05% 1.77% 0.80 0.38 10.99 10.32Keycorp New KEY 12.91% 4.62% 0.88 0.48 8.27 9.09Marathon Petrol MPC 12.43% 15.20% 0.40 0.40 5.58 6.46Ryder Sys R 12.12% 8.07% 0.86 0.93 14.13 11.67Cummins Inc CMI 10.75% 8.75% 0.80 0.80 10.49 8.78Allstate Corp ALL 10.48% -1.12% 0.52 0.00 19.34 7.01Cintas Corp CTAS 10.13% 8.87% 1.00 0.18 14.64 13.25Fifth Third Bk FITB 10.12% 5.11% 0.86 0.63 9.09 7.68Morgan Stanley MS 10.03% -2.29% 0.20 -0.13 15.83 7.18Halliburton Co HAL 9.93% 16.24% 0.97 0.97 14.16 10.48Harley-Davidson HOG 9.59% 5.16% 0.85 0.80 16.92 13.08Adv Micro Dev AMD 9.38% 5.35% 0.55 0.40 11.07 8.56Apple Inc AAPL 8.91% 9.75% 0.83 0.86 13.80 11.72Aetna Inc-New AET 7.99% 4.56% 1.00 0.61 7.98 7.79Humana Inc New HUM 7.97% 3.02% 0.94 0.55 9.29 9.22Lexmark Intl LXK 7.71% 6.15% 0.83 0.64 7.19 7.47Anadarko Petrol APC 7.42% 3.17% 0.39 0.25 20.06 15.99Chubb Corp CB 7.12% 2.77% 0.89 0.65 10.52 9.98Goodrich Corp GR 6.83% 6.74% 0.85 0.91 14.48 12.66Western Digital WDC 6.58% 1.08% 0.50 -0.08 7.59 7.12Natl Oilwell Vr NOV 6.56% 7.16% 0.78 0.82 15.19 11.93Us Bancorp USB 6.44% 3.09% 0.77 0.69 10.20 8.90Southwestrn Ene SWN 6.42% 1.44% 0.59 0.39 20.01 15.99Moodys Corp MCO 6.37% 1.79% 1.00 0.60 13.16 12.54Tesoro Corp TSO 6.13% 0.14% 0.29 0.13 6.30 7.09Motorola Solutn MSI 5.93% 11.21% 1.00 1.00 18.86 16.44Cf Indus Hldgs CF 5.89% 6.94% 0.36 0.20 8.42 9.37Eqt Corp EQT 5.84% 7.80% 0.33 0.29 24.42 17.76Newmont Mining NEM 5.79% 4.27% 0.20 0.13 12.60 11.43Cincinnati Finl CINF 5.60% -0.89% 0.00 -0.17 41.33 17.41Expedia Inc EXPE 5.52% 5.50% 0.86 0.71 15.85 13.91Wyndham Worldwd WYN 5.41% 5.36% 0.78 0.73 12.12 10.52Celgene Corp CELG 5.39% 5.63% 1.00 0.78 17.06 14.02Cbs Corp CBS 5.36% 5.10% 0.77 0.76 13.36 10.84Slm Corp SLM 5.28% 5.16% 0.80 0.67 7.65 7.14Google Inc-Cl A GOOG 5.20% 4.86% 0.68 0.82 18.65 15.59Biggest FY1 Revisions(Largest Declines) Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstAk Steel Hldg AKS -53.45% -18.03% -0.75 -0.75 15.81 6.29Genworth Finl GNW -46.81% -11.88% -1.00 -0.85 12.79 4.63Utd States Stl X -28.06% -14.06% -0.54 -0.50 17.95 7.05Juniper Netwrks JNPR -19.10% -16.61% -0.93 -0.79 22.17 16.69Amazon.Com Inc AMZN -18.42% -15.49% -0.77 -0.76 103.26 63.64Hartford Fin Sv HIG -18.24% -0.74% -0.89 -0.38 6.70 5.13Teradyne Inc TER -16.94% -15.25% -1.00 -0.73 8.66 8.20Memc Elec Matrl WFR -15.45% -13.35% -0.63 -0.44 6.23 4.62Avery Dennison AVY -15.41% -16.64% -1.00 -1.00 11.29 9.48Marathon Oil Cp MRO -15.03% -0.60% -0.09 -0.06 6.16 6.07Microchip Tech MCHP -14.55% -13.96% -1.00 -1.00 15.90 14.45Metropcs Commun PCS -14.52% -18.43% -0.77 -0.81 11.05 8.78Goldman Sachs GS -13.32% -6.27% -0.70 -0.62 10.86 7.33Linear Tec Corp LLTC -12.68% -11.72% -0.82 -0.50 12.94 11.47Noble Corp NE -12.52% -2.47% -0.92 -0.33 17.85 8.03Penney (Jc) Inc JCP -11.90% -7.72% -1.00 -0.60 14.75 11.69Southwest Air LUV -11.03% -9.51% -0.55 -0.38 13.54 8.53Murphy Oil MUR -10.77% -2.33% -0.69 -0.67 9.14 7.23Flir Systems FLIR -10.69% -12.75% -0.87 -0.93 16.20 14.06Plum Creek Tmbr PCL -10.43% -8.95% -1.00 -1.00 30.75 24.57Novellus Sys NVLS -10.35% -6.28% -0.71 -0.55 8.69 7.84Allegheny Tech ATI -10.11% -2.11% -0.80 -0.56 17.28 10.41Rowan Cos Inc RDC -8.70% -1.00% -0.24 0.05 18.70 9.15Pinnacle West PNW -8.21% -0.64% -1.00 -0.29 14.13 11.88Owens-Illinois OI -7.06% -7.59% -0.88 -0.88 8.75 6.95Travelers Cos TRV -6.92% -0.54% -0.90 -0.20 13.05 8.73Archer Daniels ADM -6.38% -4.20% -0.58 -0.43 8.96 8.21Janus Cap Grp JNS -6.29% -12.99% -0.73 -0.88 8.50 8.32Hess Corp HES -6.20% 0.30% -0.63 -0.25 8.21 7.11Cliffs Natural CLF -5.95% 1.35% -0.67 -0.29 5.62 5.06Kla-Tencor Corp KLAC -5.88% -8.87% -0.23 0.00 8.90 8.70Akamai Tech AKAM -5.35% -7.30% -0.88 -0.82 19.73 17.56Assurant Inc AIZ -5.25% 2.99% -0.70 0.50 7.30 6.10Centurylink Inc CTL -5.12% -5.90% -0.20 -0.07 13.28 12.65Waste Mgmt-New WM -5.12% -4.54% -1.00 -1.00 14.21 12.47Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 8/4/2011.

766,GT,"Key Points:First quarter season in the home stretch. So far 458 (91.6%) of S&P 500 reports in. Median surprise of 3.82% and surprise ratio of 3.03 for EPS, 1.40% and 2.27 for revenues. Solid growth of 17.5% (19.9% ex-Financials) reported. Slowdown from fourth quarter pace of 32.4%, mostly due to super financial growth in 4Q. Growth ex-Financials as 20.4% in 4Q among the 458 that have reported.Quarterly net margins reported rise to 9.84% from 9.18% a year ago, up from 9.31% in fourth quarter. Margins excluding Financials rise to 8.57% from 7.88% last year and 8.32% in fourth quarter. In the second quarter 10.29% net margins expected, 9.07% ex-Financials.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 jumps 45.5% in 2010, expected to rise 16.5% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 13.4%. Financials major earnings driver in 2010. Excluding Financials, growth was 27.5% in 2010, and expected to be 16.8% in 2011 and 11.7% in 2012.Total revenues for the S&P 500 rise 8.24% in 2010, expected to be up 5.38% in 2011, and 5.89% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues up 9.71% in 2010, expected to rise 8.90% in 2011 and 5.83% in 2012.Annual Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.39% in 2009 to 8.60% for 2010, 9.48% expected for 2011 and 10.17% in 2012.Margin Expansion major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.08% in 2009, 8.22% for 2010, 8.82% expected in 2011 and 9.31% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.92 for 2011, at 2.06 for 2012, both very bullish readings. Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.98 for 2011, 1.93 for 2012, also very positive readings. Total revisions activity close to seasonal peak.S&P 500 earned $544.7 billion in 2009, rising to $792.4 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $922.7 billion in 2011. In 2012 the 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.046 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.12 in 2009: $83.10 in 2010 and $96.82 in 2011 expected, bottom up. For 2012, $109.74 expected. Puts P/Es at 16.2x for 2010, and 13.9x for 2011 and 12.3x for 2012, very attractive relative to 10-year T-note rate of 3.22%. Top down estimates, $95.17 for 2011 and $103.05 for 2012.Earnings vs. Macro Factors
"
767,GT,"The first quarter earnings season is almost done. We now have 458 (91.6%) of the S&P 500 reports in. We have enough of a sample now to be pretty sure this will be a good earnings season.
"
768,GT,"So far, we have income growth of 17.9%. While that is down from the extremely strong 32.4% those same 458 firms posted in the fourth quarter, it is still a very strong growth rate. Almost all of the growth slowdown is from a failure of the Financial sector to repeat the massive growth they posted in the fourth quarter.Tougher Comps for Financials
"
769,GT,"It’s not that the Financials are having a bad quarter, but they do face much tougher comps this time around. It is not like the 8.7% year-over-year growth they are reporting is awful (although it is below the rest of the S&P 500), it is that it pales in comparison to the 161.8% growth posted in the fourth quarter. That is despite a very strong sequential growth of 22.0%.
"
770,GT,"If we back out the Financials, total net income is up 19.9% so far, down just slightly from the 20.4% those firms reported in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the second quarter, growth is expected to continue to slow, but remain in the double digits at 10.7%. Back out the Financials and growth is expected to be 13.1%.
"
771,GT,"Revenue growth is also very strong at 9.38%, up from the 9.03% growth they posted in the fourth quarter. Financials are a major drag on revenue growth; if they are excluded, reported revenue growth is 12.14%, up from the 9.26% growth posted last quarter.
"
772,GT,"Revenue growth is also expected to slow in the second quarter, falling to 4.62% year over year for the S&P 500 as a whole. That is mostly a Financial story. Revenue growth is only expected to slip to 9.33% if the Financials are excluded.Net Margin Expansion
"
773,GT,"Net margin expansion has been a driver of earnings growth, but that expansion is slowing down, particularly if one excludes the Financials. Overall net margins are 9.86%, up sharply from 9.18% a year ago and from 9.31% in the fourth quarter. Strip away the Financials and the picture is somewhat different, rising to 8.57% from 7.88% a year ago and from the 8.32% reported in the fourth quarter.
"
774,GT,"The more cyclical parts of the economy are leading the growth charge this quarter. The highest growth comes from the Industrials sector, with growth of 76.1%. Three other sectors are posting growth over 40%: Materials (48.3%), Autos (46.9%) and Energy (40.5%).
"
775,GT,"Construction is without a doubt the weakest of the sectors, with total net income plunging 34.3% from a year ago. The only other sector will declining net income are the Utilities, down 1.2% from a year ago. Anemic -- but positive -- growth of 3.5% has been posted for Staples.
"
776,GT,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.39% in 2009. They hit 8.60% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.48% in 2011 and 10.17% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.08% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.22% in 2010. They are expected to rise to 8.82% in 2011 and 9.31% in 2012.Full-Year Expectations
"
777,GT,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $792.4 billion in 2010, up from $544.7 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $922.7 billion, or increases of 45.4% and 16.4%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.046 Trillion.
"
778,GT,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $109.74. That is up from $57.12 for 2009, $83.10 for 2010, and $96.82 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding 3.22%, a P/E of 16.2x based on 2010 and 13.9x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 12.3x.Analysts Upping Estimates
"
779,GT,"The analysts have responded to the better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter by raising their estimates for 2011. That’s not particularly shocking, as the first quarter is, after all, part of 2011, so if they did not increase in response to a positive surprise, they would implicitly be cutting their estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year.
"
780,GT,"Still, the flood of estimate increases is impressive, with the revisions ratio sitting at 1.92. With total estimate revisions activity soaring, that increase is overwhelmingly being driven by new estimate increases, not from old estimate cuts falling out of the four-week moving totals. A few weeks from now, that will not be the case as revision activity will plunge.
"
781,GT,"Changes in the revisions ratios are more significant when activity is rising than when it is falling (since it reflects new information). The estimate increases are widespread, with the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to firms with falling estimates standing at 1.98. There is no “mechanical reason for the estimates for 2012 to be rising.
"
782,GT,"The 2012 revisions ratio is now at 2.06, meaning that upwards estimate revisions are outpacing cuts by more than 2:1 for next year. The ratio of rising-to-falling mean estimates stands at 1.93. Those are extremely bullish readings.Fundamentally Good News, but Not All Smooth Sailing
"
783,GT,"This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher. It is important to keep your eyes on the prize. There is lots of news out there, and much of it is more dramatic than earnings results, but rarely does it have more significance for your portfolio.
"
784,GT,"Earnings are, and are going to remain, the single most important thing for the stock market. Interest rates are an important -- but distant -- second.
"
785,GT,"That does not mean that all is smooth sailing ahead. We are now at the softest part of the year (historically). There is a fair amount of truth to the old adage “Sell in May, but remember to return by November.
"
786,GT,"The fight over raising the debt ceiling is now underway. If it looks like it will not happen, watch out. The Government of the United States defaulting on its debt is likely to have a somewhat larger impact on the markets and the economy than the impact of Lehman Brothers defaulting on its debts.
"
787,GT,"However, when push comes to shove, I find it hard to believe that Congress would let that happen. While not the most likely case, the chance of no increase by the time the ceiling is hit is a very real possibility. Given the disastrous potential consequences, taking out some insurance in the form of deep out-of-the-money puts would make a lot of sense at this point.
"
788,GT,"We are already feeling the impact from lower government spending. First quarter GDP growth came in at just 1.8%, down from 3.1% in the fourth quarter. Total government spending was a drag of 1.09 points, up from being a 0.34 point drag in the fourth quarter. In other words, 75 of the total 130 basis point growth slowdown (57.8%) was due to increased austerity in Government spending.
"
789,GT,"Job creation remains sluggish, but had been starting to show signs of picking up. We created 268,000 jobs in the private sector in April, up from 231,000 in March, and 260,000 in February, but that is after a big upward revision to the February numbers. However, governments laid off a total of 24,000 people for the month, on top of 10,000 pink slips the month before.
"
790,GT,"Recently, though, the trend in Initial Claims for Unemployment has taken a nasty turn for the worse, with the four-week moving average moving back above the 400,000 level. While we got some relief this week, with a drop of 43,000 new claims, we need to see that number continue to decline. Those numbers were not reflected in the April jobs report, but they are not a good omen for the May report.Unemployment Rate
"
791,GT,"The unemployment rate bounced back up to 9.0%. This was not due to, as many assume, people coming back into the labor force. It was due to the fact that the unemployment rate is derived from a separate survey from the one that measures the number of jobs gained or lost. The civilian participation rate has been stuck at the same low 64.2% level since January.
"
792,GT,"Given that the unemployment rate has been higher than that in just 6.17% of the months since 1960, one might expect that bringing down unemployment would be top of the agenda at both the Fed and on Capitol Hill. However, at Bernanke’s recent press conference, the focus was mostly on inflation. The rate of headline inflation has been moving higher, but it is only up 3.2% over the last year. That is lower than what we have experienced for most of the last 40 years.
"
793,GT,"Furthermore, commodity prices have just fallen sharply, so we might start to see some relief very soon. Core inflation remains very low, up just 1.3% over the last year. This fear of phantom inflation is keeping further monetary easing off the table for bringing down unemployment.International Concerns Remain
"
794,GT,"The international situation clearly has the potential to abort the recovery as well. The disaster in Japan will clearly slow its economy dramatically in the first quarter, although much of that growth will be made up later in the year as the reconstruction process gets underway. Many U.S.-made products have parts which are made in Japan, and that is likely to disrupt production here.
"
795,GT,"Still, there appeared to be no impact on Industrial Production in March as manufacturing output climbed 0.7%. The turmoil in the Middle East is not going away, and that is likely to keep oil prices both high and volatile. High oil prices will also act as a depressing force on the economy.
"
796,GT,"The debt crisis in Europe is not going away with Portugal now also getting bailed out, even as the ECB makes life tougher on the PIIGS by raising rates. Rates for the Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt are substantially higher than when the crisis first started. The austerity campaigns have weakened those economies and undermined tax revenues, and so the bailouts have not made the situation much better.
"
797,GT,"Here at home, the housing situation has not been showing many signs of improvement, and I doubt we will see much in the housing-related numbers due out this week. Note that the Construction sector is the weakest in terms of both surprises and estimate revisions.Remaining Bullish Overall
"
798,GT,"On balance I remain bullish, and I think we will end the year with the S&P 500 north of 1400, but that does not mean we will have a smooth ride between here and there. Strong earnings are trumping a dicey international situation, and the drama in DC. However, be prepared to move to the exits (or have some put protection in place) if it looks like the debt ceiling will not be raised.
"
799,GT,"As far as individual stock picks are concerned, look for the combination of a Zacks #1 Rank, with moderate P/Es and a reasonable dividend yield. The current issue of Earnings Trends has a list of the firms with the largest positive revisions for this year.
"
800,GT,"The best hunting ground for such firms seems to be in the Industrial, Materials and Energy sectors, but things are not limited to them. Some of the names to consider among the S&P 500 include AK Steel (AKS  -  Free Report), Caterpillar (CAT), Cummins (CMI), Dow Chemical (DOW), United Health (UNH) and Valero (VLO).Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseThe first quarter season almost done.

803,GT,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. The second shows the largest declines. To qualify, there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
804,GT,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.

806,GT,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Jul 28. Last quarter, the tire manufacturer delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.46%. Plus, it has delivered the same in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 9.77%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company QuoteFactors at PlayGoodyear is investing in projects having a high rate of return. Recently, it has invested $485 million to expand its tire factory in Pulandian, Dalian, China. The expansion, scheduled to complete in 2020, will increase the plant’s capacity by about 5 million tires per annum. It will help Goodyear in meeting the growing demand for premium, large-rim-diameter consumer tires in China and the Asia Pacific region.The company is trying to boost its shareholder value, strengthen the balance sheet and restructure its senior debt. It is also launching innovative products and services to boost sales.However, Goodyear faces pricing pressure from OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer). This will likely create a negative impact on the company’s profit margins as it sells about 30% of its tires to OEMs. Also, it anticipates a total segment operating income for 2017 to be approximately $2 billion, consistent with the 2016 level. Results will be adversely affected due to weaker demand and higher raw material costs.Earnings Whispers                                      Our proven model does not conclusively show that Goodyear is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Goodyear’s Earnings ESP is -13.33% as the Most Accurate estimate of 65 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goodyear carries a Zacks Rank #3. However, we need to have a positive ESP (as stated above) to be confident of an earnings surprise.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Price PerformanceGoodyear’s stock has lost 1.3% in the last three months, thus outperforming the 3.2% decline of the industry it belongs to.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.1% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to report its second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1.

822,GT,"The auto industry is a highly concentrated one. About 10 global automakers account for over 77% of the production worldwide. Among them, Toyota Motors (TM  -  Free Report) leads with a 13.3% market share, while its domestic rivals including Nissan (NSANY  -  Free Report) and its alliance with Renault account for 8.4% of the auto market, Honda Motor (HMC  -  Free Report) 5.6% and Suzuki 3.8%. Among the Detroit automakers, General Motors (GM) holds 11.9% of the auto market, Ford (F  -  Free Report) 7.8% and Chrysler-Fiat 6.4% of the auto industry.The recent economic crisis has provided an impetus to a massive structural change in the auto industry, setting the stage for growth over the next decade. Given the high barriers to entry and need for scale economies (in operations, supply chain and marketing), the global auto industry landscape is expected to be ruled by global automakers and suppliers based in the six major auto markets of China, India, Japan, Korea, Western Europe and the U.S.OPPORTUNITIESTo remain competitive, automakers will need to design vehicles that will meet the requirements of consumers in both mature and emerging markets. Automakers will focus on more user-friendly and low-cost vehicles that are also the most advanced technologically.The automakers will continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. For example, Greater China and South America is projected to represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015.There are two underlying factors behind this location shift in the auto industry. The first is the cost factor. The cost of labor in emerging auto markets continues to be a fraction of that in the developed world. The second is the demand factor. Many low cost regions, including the emerging auto markets, have high potential for growth. Thus, the shift in auto industry production facilities will lead to a localization of the manufacturing base that will bring down transportation costs. The emergence of trading blocs is also giving this process a push in the auto market. It is likely that over time there will be fewer car imports from outside a trade zone.Further, automakers have started to reduce the number of technological platforms with a greater diversity of models produced from each platform in order to remain cost competitive in the auto industry. For example, Honda, with its flexible common platform, has developed three dimensionally distinct versions of the Accord, allowing for designs where 60% of the components are common. Ford aims to build 680,000 vehicles per core global platform within five years, up from current levels of 345,000 units. After emerging from its bankruptcy, General Motors has started focusing solely on four core brands – Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC.Higher fuel prices and concerns over global warming have pooled attention on the auto industry that either rely less on traditional fossil fuels or use renewable sources of less expensive energy. Thus, “green alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids will attract consumers in the wealthier countries while flex-fuels such as ethanol and natural gas will be highly sought-after in the emerging auto markets where the local climate or resource base favors their usage by automakers over petroleum.Consequently, there will be a variety of powertrain technologies in the auto industry by the next decade. It is likely that “green cars will represent up to a third of total global sales in developed auto markets and up to 20% in urban areas of emerging auto markets by 2020. Some of the “green cars have already generated a huge response in the auto industry. These include the Ford Focus, GM Volt, Daimler (DAI) Smart, Nissan Leaf and Toyota Prius.The role of governments must not be overlooked. Governments in all major countries have become active auto industry players. Their investments through emergency loans and incentive packages, such as “Cash for Clunkers in the U.S., are a good example of this. Moreover, governments' energy and environmental policies will be highly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years.WEAKNESSESAlthough automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors, developing the supplier networks remains one of the greatest challenges they face in the auto industry. Existing suppliers to automakers often lack the financial background to expand capacity in new markets. On the other hand, auto market suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties, which may result in new and lower-cost competitors.The financial condition of the majority of auto market suppliers continues to deteriorate, resulting from historically weak demand and higher dependence on automakers. According to the Original Equipment Suppliers Association (OESA), 13 major U.S. direct auto market suppliers and 2 indirect auto industry suppliers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy or have had their assets foreclosed on, while many others in the auto industry have simply liquidated in the first half of 2009. They include prominent components auto market suppliers such as Visteon and Lear , who cater to General Motors and Ford.According to OESA, 12% of the auto industry suppliers do not have sufficient working capital to support a 10%–25% expansion in production. Thus, despite the government’s sizable investment in the automakers, it is likely that there will be auto market suppliers who are unable to restart operations as automaker production resumes due to working capital shortfalls.Higher dependence on automakers makes the auto market suppliers vulnerable to several maladies, primarily pricing pressure and production cuts. Pricing pressure from automakers is constricting auto market suppliers’ margins. On the other hand, production cuts by automakers driven by frequent market adjustments are negatively affecting their operations. Some of the auto industry suppliers who have a high reliance on a few automakers such as General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Volkswagen include American Axle and Manufacturing (AXL  -  Free Report), ArvinMeritor (ARM), Goodyear Tire and Rubber (GT  -  Free Report), Magna International (MGA  -  Free Report), Superior Industries (SUP  -  Free Report), Tenneco (TEN  -  Free Report) and TRW Automotive (TRW).The shift in auto market consumer preferences towards hi-tech, fuel-efficient, environment-friendly vehicles, such as small cars/hybrids/EVs, is another issue. Auto market suppliers are expected to quickly adapt to the new technologies by investing in research and development, putting heavy capital burdens on them.The automakers also face significant challenges in transforming the existing powertrain technologies into the new versions as far as marketability is concerned. As the number of technology applications increases, automakers and suppliers will need to be selective. Their criteria for choosing what to include and what not to will depend entirely on what the customers are willing to pay for.
