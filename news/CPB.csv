0,CPB,"Another chief executive fell victim to the slump in the U.S. packaged-food industry.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, 64, abruptly stepped down Friday after a lackluster seven-year tenure at the helm of the company. She tried — and never managed — to move beyond canned soup to ignite sales growth as Americans change how they eat and shop. The shares plunged the most in almost two decades.""They've had a rough go of it,"" said Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""The move into the fresh business has been problematic — they've had a lot of things that didn't work.""Morrison will be replaced on an interim basis by Keith McLoughlin, a 61-year-old former CEO at Electrolux who has been a board member since 2016, Campbell said. The Camden, New Jersey-based company didn't say who will permanently succeed her, but last month promoted industry veteran Luca Mignini to chief operations officer.Whoever replaces Morrison will face the same challenges that have claimed the leaders of other Big Food companies like Kellogg (K) and Mondelez International (MDLZ). The stock, down 38% in the past two years, plunged an additional 11% to 34.94 on Friday as Campbell also gave a bleak full-year forecast. Campbell is suffering its biggest intraday loss since January 1999.Morrison, who has been with Campbell for 15 years, took over in 2011 and less than a year later Campbell agreed to buy Bolthouse Farms, a maker of fresh juice and salad dressing that also operated a carrot-farming business. The deal was seen as a way to push the canned soup company into fresher and more natural products, which are on trend with modern consumers. But the merger has been hampered by operational issues and a recall that battered results. Campbell has since been mired in a three-year sales slump.The stock said it will start a strategic review of its businesses, which will ""take several months to complete."" It plans to update investors on the outcome when it reports fourth-quarter results in late August.Campbell has been seeking other sources of growth as it grapples with the soup slowdown. In December, the company agreed to buy Snyder's-Lance in a bid to push deeper into salty snacks — a bright spot in the struggling packaged-food industry. That deal gives Campbell, which makes Goldfish crackers, brands such as Cape Cod potato chips and Snyder's pretzels.The recently promoted COO, Mignini, 55, joined Campbell in 2013. He had been running the snacks unit, and is now overseeing Campbell's soup business in addition to managing the expanded portfolio of snacks.

2,CPB,"Kraft Heinz  (KHC) reportedly is interested in buying Campbell Soup (CPB), which is mulling strategic options as packaged-food giants struggle. Rivals such as General Mills (GIS) also could want to take a bite of the soup and snack giant.Campbell Soup stock jumped 9.4% to close at 42.23, and Kraft Heinz stock edged up 0.2% to 63.32 in the stock market today. General Mills stock added 1.8%. All three packaged-food stocks are still trading near multiyear lows.A Kraft-Campbell deal could boost Warren Buffett's exposure to the ailing packaged-food industry. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is a major shareholder of Kraft Heinz, which believes the soup and snack maker will likely put itself up for sale soon, sources told the New York Post.Campbell Soup said in May it was reviewing all aspects of its strategic plans and expects to discuss the outcome in August. CEO Denise Morrison abruptly resigned last month as Campbell Soup cut earnings guidance. The company has not yet named a permanent replacement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSoup giant Campbell looked for growth with purchases such as Bolthouse Farm juices, Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies. But its $6.1 billion buyout of Snyder's-Lance came just as the packaged-food industry slumped.The company's bleak full-year forecast pummeled the stock in May, ultimately taking a toll on the reign of its seven-year chief executive.The B-class shares of Berkshire Hathaway dropped 1.15% to undercut the May low of 188.62.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola (KO), another consumer products giant in which Berkshire holds a notable stake, rose 0.8%.Kraft Heinz arose through a 2015 merger of food giants Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz.Buffett owned 500 million shares of Heinz before the merger, while his investment partner, 3G Capital, owned a similar stake in Heinz. Buffett now owns 325.6 million shares of Kraft Heinz, valued at $20.3 billion as of March.Initially, Kraft Heinz stock rallied as the new owners boosted profits despite flat-to-falling sales by cutting costs. But like a ketchup bottle running low, cost-squeezing efforts seem to have run their course. Meanwhile, traditional branded food companies are facing multiple headwinds. They're struggling to appeal to changing consumer tastes toward organic and natural foods. Meanwhile, grocery sellers are stepping up house brands, with more attractive packaging and quality. Food companies also have cut marketing spending to boost short-term profit, but at the risk of losing long-term brand exposure.Kraft Heinz may see a Campbell Soup deal as a way to wring out more costs. Kraft in 2017 made a bid for Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever (UN), which rebuffed the offer.Buffett reportedly remains optimistic about companies that sell consumer packaged goods. Both Kraft Heinz and Coca-Cola are top-five stock holdings in his widely followed investment portfolio.

3,CPB,"Shares of General Mills (GIS) sank Wednesday after the Cheerios and Yoplait maker delivered mixed results and lowered its growth outlook citing significant cost headwinds.General Mills' dive spread contagion through the packaged food sector, taking down shares of Kellogg (K), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Campbell Soup (CPB), J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM), ConAgra (CAG) and Mondelez (MDLZ). Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup hit the sector last month on their weak quarterly reports.Shares of General Mills plunged 8.85% to 45.51 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest level in nearly five years. General Mills is by far the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.They have tumbled since their Jan. 25 high of 60.69. Kellogg crashed 4%. Kraft Heinz lost 1.9%, hitting its worst levels since August 2015, while Campbell Soup sank 2.2%, reaching a 4-year low. Mondelez slid 0.8% and J.M. Smucker retreated 4.2%.Kellogg, J.M. Smucker, Campbell Soup and ConAgra all were among the S&P 500 index's worst-performers.The Minneapolis-based company reported adjusted quarterly profit grew 10% to 79 cents per share, meeting the Zacks Investment Research consensus estimate. Revenue ticked up 2% to $3.88 billion, just short of views for $3.89 billion. Organic net sales — stripping out the effect of currency movements, acquisitions and divestitures — were up 1%.Cost pressures are impacting the full-year outlook, said General Mills Chairman and CEO Jeff Harmening. General Mills cut its adjusted earnings growth forecast to flat to up 1% from up 3% to 4% earlier.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Like the broader industry, we're seeing sharp increases in input costs, including inflation in freight and commodities,"" Harmening added. ""Because of our improved volume performance, we're also incurring higher operational costs.""Net sales for the North America retail segment rose 1% to $2.52 billion, thanks in large part to Canada. Yogurt and cereal sales fell in the U.S.Sales in the convenience stores and food service segment rose 3% to $460 million, driven by growth in frozen meals, cereal, and snacks.Europe and Australia sales grew 11% to $470 million, benefiting from favorable currency moves. Organic net sales slipped 1%.Asia and Latin America sales increased 3% to $435 million, also helped by foreign currency exchange. Organic net sales matched year-ago levels.  Asia markets saw higher sales, offsetting lower net sales across Latin America.General Mills said Wednesday its previously announced $8 billion acquisition of natural pet food brand Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BUFF) is expected to close before the end of fiscal 2018. Natural, wholesome and premium fare is in demand in pet food, as in human food, according to General Mills.Packaged food is under strain as private-label house brands as well as organic and natural offerings displace mainstream products on grocery shelves at the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Whole Foods.Walmart is General Mills' biggest customer, accounting for some 20% of sales.Packaged food companies have responded with cost cuts, including on marketing, to preserve profit margins, but that strategy is running out of steam. Kraft Heinz's latest results show the cost-cutting strategy is running out of steam.Blue Buffalo shares edged 0.3% lower Wednesday.

6,CPB,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross acknowledged on Friday that President Trump's 25% steel tariff could have a slight effect on raising auto prices.X While Ross aimed to downplay the potential inflationary impact of trade restrictions, Wall Street appeared to have a different take. Even as the Dow Jones industrial average fell yet again, Treasury yields moved higher as investors ratcheted up expectations for Fed rate hikes.Echoing Democrats' dismissal of Trump tax cuts for the middle class, Secretary Ross argued that Trump tariffs won't hike costs much.""There's about 1 ton of steel in a car,"" Ross said on CNBC. ""The price of a ton of steel is $700 or so, so 25% on that would be one half of 1% price increase on the typical $35,000 car. So it's no big deal.""UBS analyst Colin Langan wrote recently that a typical auto includes $830 of steel and $400 of aluminum, Bloomberg reported.Trump tariffs could raise costs for Ford (F) by $300 million and General Motors (GM) by $200 million, Langan said, at a time that they were already facing higher materials costs.Ross said the overall effect on prices would be ""broad"" but ""trivial,"" estimating that it could add 0.6 cent to the cost of a can of Campbell Soup (CPB).IBD'S TAKE: The sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff plan has changed the outlook for the stock market, The Big Picture column explained on Thursday. Now that stock market volatility has returned, it's more important than ever to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Still, automakers are protected in the near-term by steel-purchasing contracts that run from one to three years, noted RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak in a Friday note.Such contracts will limit the near-term upside of Trump tariffs for U.S. Steel (X), BofA/Merrill Lynch analyst Timna Tanners wrote Friday, downgrading the steel maker to neutral after its recent strong gains.RBC's Spak estimated that about one-third of Ford's commodity exposure in 2018 has pricing that is preset through contracts, noting that Ford is more exposed to aluminum pricing than GM, with aluminum bought at current market prices.BMO Capital Markets analyst Edward Sterck told the Financial Times that the U.S. lacks much flexibility to increase smelting capacity in the near term, so companies will have little choice but to pass on the 10% tariff on aluminum imports to the consumer.""We do not believe that the U.S. has significant flexibility to increase domestic smelting capacity in the near term, and that it will therefore have little choice but to continue to import Canadian produced material, paying the 10% higher import duty and passing on that cost to the consumer,"" said Edward Sterck, analyst at BMO Capital Markets.Yet even a slight uptick in inflation due to tariffs will complicate the job of the Fed as it tries, as Chair Jerome Powell told Congress this week, ""to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2% on a sustained basis.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Trump Tariff Sell-Off Triggers New OutlookTrump Says 'Trade Wars Are Good,' Doubling Down On Tariff MoveFed Inflation Gauge Stays Tame, But Here's 6 Reasons Why Investors Are NervousWhat Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon Vs.

The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2%, then pulled up to rise 0.1%, as Apple (AAPL) reversed its early loss and as Alphabet (GOOGL) led gains among three of the four among FANG stocks.The action across global stock markets was positive.

Coca-Cola (KO) popped 1% to take an early lead after its fourth-quarter results cleared estimates and full-year guidance topped expectations. Coke's shares recovered nearly 4% this week, seeking to regain support and trading about 8% below their Jan. 26 high.Apple opened down 0.3%, but quickly reversed to a 0.4% gain. Five sessions of mostly strong-volume gains have hoisted the stock back above its 50-day moving average, and turned its Relative Strength line from a negative to a positive indicator. Friday will be a test to see whether Apple can hold support at its 50-day line.The four FANG stock tech leaders posted mild gains and losses. Google parent Alphabet led the group with a 0.6% gain. Swiss-based drugmaker Roche Holding (RHBBY) said it would pay $1.9 billion to acquire Flatiron, a New York-based developer of software for cancer records-keeping and research.

The stock gained 9% for the week through Thursday, trading 11% below a May high and up 54% from their March 2017 IPO price.Investors continued to penalize earnings misses harshly, sending chip-equipment maker Cohu (COHU) down 14% after fourth-quarter earnings and first-quarter guidance fell short of targets.Arista Networks (ANET) tumbled 15%. The IBD 50 leader reported late Thursday its earnings were stronger than expected in the fourth quarter, but revenue only narrowly topped targets and the company's first-quarter outlook disappointed investors.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2017Trump's remarks were a reversal of what he said a day before, when he tweeted that he had plenty of CEOs who wanted to be on the panels to replace those who quit, and called the CEOs who left ""grandstanders.""Several more CEOs on the councils said after Trump's remarks that they had informed their respective panels that they would step down, suggesting that Trump scrapped the panels before they dissolved entirely.The strategy council, led by Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, said that participation had become an unwelcome ""distraction.""BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told staff in a Wednesday memo that he had informed the strategy council he was stepping down within the past 24 hours.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who earlier this year hailed Trump for reigniting ""animal spirits,"" said Wednesday afternoon that ""it is a leader's role...to bring people together, not tear them apart.""The strategy group is one of several the White House convened earlier this year to advise the president. Several CEOs from a manufacturing council quit this week, following blowback over Trump's remarks about racially charged violence in Virginia on Saturday.Pressure to leave the groups has grown following a press conference Trump held in New York Tuesday where he placed partial blame for the weekend violence on demonstrators protesting a gathering of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. A woman was killed during the event after a man rammed a car into a crowd.While more than half a dozen CEOs have quit a manufacturing CEO group, others have said they wanted to stay on the panels in order to influence White House policy.The manufacturing council hasn't met since February. The CEOs of Under Armour (UAA), Intel (INTC) and Merck (MRK) quit earlier this week. And on Wednesday Inge Thulin, CEO of 3M (MMM), left, as did Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison.""Following yesterday's remarks from the president, I cannot remain on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative,"" Morrison said in a statement. ""I will continue to support all efforts to spur economic growth and advocate for the values that have always made America great.""Jeff Immelt of General Electric (GE), Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Gregory Hayes of United Technologies (UTX) stepped down from the manufacturing council minutes after Trump said he was scrapping that body. Immelt said he had informed the council Wednesday morning of his decision.RELATED:Big Business Dumps Trump: 4 Execs Quit Council; But This One Is Staying

14,CPB,"McCormick (MKC) agreed to acquire Reckitt Benckiser Group's food business for $4.2 billion, adding French's mustard and Frank's RedHot sauce to its lineup of spices and seasonings.XThe deal brings a stable of well-known condiments to Sparks, Maryland-based McCormick. For Reckitt Benckiser, unloading the products continues an overhaul that began with an expansion into baby formula through the British company's acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.The transaction price equates to 20 times the division's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, ""which feels to us like a very high price for a U.S.-oriented ambient food business,"" James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note. He expects the transaction to dilute RB's earnings per share by about 1%.The deal comes as speculation swirls about the next round of consolidation in the packaged-food business. In February, Kraft Heinz (KHC) was spurned in a blockbuster bid to take over Unilever (UL), the British-Dutch maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soup. In the aftermath, Unilever was cited by analysts as a possible bidder for the Reckitt business.Nestle SA, the world's largest food company, is also shaking up its portfolio. Under activist pressure to improve results, it's considering selling its U.S. candy operations. Investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management this week set its sights on Procter & Gamble (PG), the U.S. giant that competes with Unilever in personal care.Led by Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor, Reckitt said it was looking to unload its food business in April, when the Slough, England-based company described the division as ""non-core."" With 411 million pounds ($536 million) in sales last year, French's Foods accounted for 4% of Reckitt's total revenue.French's and Frank's RedHot will become McCormick's second- and third-largest brands, respectively, CEO Lawrence E. Kurzius said in a statement late Tuesday. McCormick's pro forma 2017 annual net sales are expected to be approximately $5 billion, with significant margin growth, according to the statement.In acquiring Reckitt's food business, McCormick faced a large group of potential rivals. Bloomberg reported in May that the sale was expected to draw interest from Post Holdings (POST) and Conagra Brands (CAG). Other possible bidders included JM Smucker (SJM), Campbell Soup (CPB), Pinnacle Foods (PF) and Ajinomoto, people familiar with the situation said at the time.In addition to selling yellow mustard and hot sauce, the division makes ketchup, onion flavorings and other products. Hot sauce will continue to see robust growth, with opportunities for expansion, McCormick said. The company said it plans to expand the global presence of Frank's RedHot and French's products, whose sales are now concentrated in the U.S.McCormick dates to 1889, when founder Willoughby McCormick began selling flavors and extracts door to door. The company went after another U.K. business in 2016, when it considered buying Premier Foods. But the suitor walked away from takeover talks in April of that year, saying that Premier was demanding too high a price. McCormick's Kurzius said at the time that Premier was just one of the company's M&A ideas.Credit Suisse Group AG is serving as the financial adviser to McCormick on the RB Foods transaction, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP is legal counsel. Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial adviser to Reckitt and the company also received advice from Robey Warshaw.The deal is expected to be completed in the third or fourth quarter of McCormick's fiscal 2017, pending regulatory approvals. McCormick plans to fund the deal with a combination of equity and debt, and said it has obtained committed bridge financing.

15,CPB,"A stronger-than-expected June jobs report Friday fueled a low-volume rally on Wall Street. Tech stocks were back in favor, at least for a day, as the Nasdaq composite was up 1.1% in afternoon trading.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average also did well, up 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. The Nasdaq's tidy gain wasn't enough to lift the tech index back above the 50-day moving average, but it's getting close. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking about 5% to 10% lower than Thursday's levels.McDonald's (MCD) and Microsoft (MSFT) outperformed in the Dow with gains of more than 1.5%. Nasdaq 100 leaders included semiconductor names Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX). Both jumped nearly 4%.The IBD 50 served up plenty of strong movers as nearly half the names in the index rose 2% or more. Lumentum (LITE) was a top percentage gainer, up about 5%. It's been getting support at the 50-day moving average, albeit in light volume. Coherent (COHR), meanwhile, was trying to reclaim its 50-day moving average after a pullback. Shares jumped 5% in average volume.In economic news, nonfarm payrolls increased 220,000 in June, well above the consensus estimate of 170,000. The unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.4%. Bond investors were unfazed by the report as the 10-year Treasury yield edged higher by 1 basis point to 2.38%.Benchmark crude oil tumbled 2.5% to $44.35 barrel as excess supply remains a focal point in the oil market.In the stock market today, RV maker Winnebago Industries (WGO) gained 2.5% after Stifel Nicolaus initiated coverage with a buy rating and 40 price target, citing new products, a strong management team and a reasonable valuation. The stock is cheap, selling at 16 times trailing earnings and 12 times forward earnings. In the current fiscal year, earnings are expected to rise 33% with 22% growth seen in the next fiscal year.Meanwhile, Campbell Soup (CPB) announced a small acquisition, agreeing to acquire organic soup maker Pacific Foods for around $700 million. Campbell Soup, which has been hit hard by institutional selling in recent months, added 0.4% on the news, but the stock was poised for its sixth straight weekly price decline.RELATED:Top Builder Jumps Into Buy Zone As Home Closings Soar 75%Strong Job Growth Signals Economic Momentum; September Rate Hike In Play

17,CPB,"As changing technologies and preferences make government-funded broadcasting increasingly preposterous, such broadcasting actually becomes useful by illustrating two dismal facts. One is the immortality of entitlements that especially benefit those among society's articulate upper reaches who feel entitled. The other fact is how impervious government programs are to evidence incompatible with their premises.Fifty years and about 500 channels ago, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created to nudge Lyndon Johnson's Great Society — it aimed to make America great for the first time — the final inches toward perfection. Today, the CPB, which has received about $12 billion over the years, disperses the government's 15% of public television's budget and 10% of public radio's. Originally, public television increased many viewers' choices by 33% — from three (CBS, NBC, ABC) to four.Twenty-five years ago, Sen. Al Gore, defending another appropriation increase for the CPB, asked what he considered a dispositive question: ""How many senators here have children who have watched 'Sesame Street' and 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'? ... This is one thing that works in this country."" So, senators, mostly affluent, should compel taxpayers, mostly much less affluent, to subsidize the senators' children's viewing because it ""works,"" as measured by means that Gore neglected to reveal.Eighteen years ago, some public broadcasting officials, who understood the importance of being earnest — and imaginative — testified to Congress that public television's educational effects on the workforce give the economy a $12 billion boost. Fifteen years ago, however, the then-president of public television said, ""We are dangerously close in our overall prime-time numbers to falling below the relevance quotient."" Relevance? To what?Today, Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, thinks we can risk terminating the CPB. This would reduce viewers' approximately 500 choices to approximately 499. Listeners to public radio might have to make do with America's 4,666 AM and 6,754 FM commercial stations, 437 satellite radio channels, perhaps 70,000 podcasts, and other internet and streaming services.America, which is entertaining itself to inanition, has never experienced a scarcity of entertainment. Or a need for government-subsidized journalism that reports on the government. Before newspaper editorial writers inveigh against Mulvaney and in support of government subsidies for television and radio, they should answer this question: Should there be a CPN — a Corporation for Public Newspapers?
"
18,CPB,"The CPB was created ""to encourage public telecommunications services which will be responsive to the interests of people."" Of course: People's interests, not people's desires. The market efficiently responds to the latter. Public broadcasting began as a response to what progressives nowadays call ""market failure."" This usually means the market's failure to supply what the public has not demanded but surely would demand if it understood its real ""interest.""One reason many Americans are becoming ""cord cutters,"" abandoning cable and satellite television, is that they want an a la carte world. One reason ESPN has lost 12 million subscribers in six years is that it is an expensive component of cable and satellite packages and many of those paying for the packages rarely watch ESPN.Compelling taxpayers to finance government-subsidized broadcasting is discordant with today's a la carte impulse and raises a question: If it has a loyal constituency, those viewers and listeners, who are disproportionately financially upscale, can afford voluntary contributions to replace the government money. And advertisers would pay handsomely to address this constituency.Often the last, and sometimes the first, recourse of constituencies whose subsidies are in jeopardy is: ""It's for the children."" Big Bird, however, is more a corporate conglomerate than an endangered species. If ""Sesame Street"" programming were put up for auction, the danger would be of getting trampled by the stampede of potential bidders.The argument for government-subsidized broadcasting is perversely circular: If the public were enlightened, there would be no need for government subsidies. But, by definition, an enlightened public would understand the inherent merits of subsidies by which the government picks more deserving winners than the market does.However, since government-subsidized broadcasting exists, any argument for it would be superfluous, given what governmental inertia usually accomplishes for government enterprises. Long ago — in January — there was bold Republican talk about Congress restoring ""regular order"": There would be 12 appropriations bills and they would be enacted before the 2018 fiscal year begins Oct. 1. Instead, there probably will be another ""swallow this or shutter the government"" omnibus bill in which almost everything survives by sparing almost everyone the torture of choices. This is, of course, a choice.RELATED:Big Bird Is Rich, So Why Does He Need Taxpayer Money?

Bullard pointed to economic data that has been relatively weak since the Fed's meeting in March, saying ""U.S. inflation and inflation expectations have surprised to the downside in recent months.

20,CPB,"President Trump summoned some of America's most prominent corporate executives to the White House Thursday and told them he intends to put them to work restoring manufacturing jobs and U.S. dominance in trade.""They share our commitment to bring manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country,"" Trump said as he sat with the 24 business leaders, who included Dow Chemical (DOW) Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson, and Caterpillar (CAT) Chairman Doug Oberhelman.Trump used the public portion of the meeting to reiterate some of his campaign themes, blasting what he called ""unbelievably bad"" trade deals and singling out trade deficits with Mexico and China. He vowed to punish companies that move jobs outside the U.S. and promised to squeeze more money out of government contracts, citing his talks with Hewson, which he said cut the cost of Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet by more than $700 million.""She's tough, but it worked out well I think for everybody,"" Trump said of Hewson.Before meeting with Trump, the executives split into working groups to explore policy changes on topics such as taxes and trade, regulation, infrastructure and the future workforce. Joining them in the breakout sessions were administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence; Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, Harris Corp. (HRS) CEO Bill Brown, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky and David Farr, CEO of Emerson Electric (EMR), were among those who took part in the working group sessions with administration officials, who also included budget director Mick Mulvaney.  In a meeting with Cohn and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, business leaders including Corning (GLW) CEO Wendell Weeks and Nucor (NUE) President John Ferriola discussed indexing gasoline taxes to provide more money for transportation projects.Thursday's meeting grew out of Trump's December announcement of an advisory panel on manufacturing.Dow Chemical's Liveris, who is leading the panel, said afterward that he and the other executives were ""very encouraged"" by the pro-business approach being taken by the administration.Taking part in a session on the workforce of the future, Liveris said there must be a ""systemic fix"" to address the shortage of workers prepared for jobs requiring skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.""We have supply-side issues today,"" he said, ""half a million open STEM jobs that we can't fill. We need to fill them with Americans.""He also said community colleges need to provide more vocational training for ""the noble trades,"" which had been a priority of the Obama administration.Lockheed's Hewson told reporters that Trump is ready to take quick action on streamlining rules for businesses. ""It's very important that we reduce regulations, that we eliminate those that are burdensome that are unnecessary,"" she said.Ahead of the meeting, Business Roundtable, the lobbying group for U.S. corporate executives, sent a letter to Cohn laying out 16 regulations of top concern to its members. The letter touches on everything from the Affordable Care Act to net neutrality to environmental regulations — but also hints at CEO concerns about the economic impacts of Trump immigration and trade policy.Topping the Business Roundtable list is a 2015 move by the Environmental Protection Agency to tighten national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone, as well as EPA limits on new coal-fired power plants and expanded jurisdiction over state waters. The list also includes overtime regulations; Dodd-Frank provisions including CEO pay ratio disclosure, conflict minerals disclosure rules and margin requirements for uncleared swaps; and employer reporting and tax requirements under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the group is seeking expedited export controls and tightening eligibility and increasing exclusions for shareholder proposals.""While some of the listed regulations in isolation may not appear significant to growth, their cumulative effect has drained resources from innovation and job creation and directed them to non-value adding administrative and bureaucratic activities,"" said the letter, signed by Mark Costa, the chairman and CEO for Eastman Chemical (EMN) who leads Business Roundtable's smart regulation committee.At the same time, the letter said that as the administration ""considers new policies with regard to immigration or the expansion of 'Buy America' requirements, Business Roundtable stands ready to assist to prevent unintended consequences that would inhibit the ability for U.S. companies to drive economic growth and be globally competitive.""Trump has used previous meetings with companies to encourage corporate leaders to build their products in the U.S., offering tax breaks and lower regulation to bring down costs — and warning that he wants to raise tariffs on products produced overseas. The heads of labor organizations, automotive firms, national retail chains, drug companies, and airlines are all among the groups who have met with Trump in the West Wing in recent weeks.Neither Trump nor the CEOs indicated they had a detailed discussion of his plans to overhaul the tax code, which he has said he will deliver within weeks, or a border-adjustment tax proposal under consideration by House Republicans, which would shift the tax burden from exporters to importers.Republican leaders in the House, including Speaker Paul Ryan, argue a border-adjustment tax would benefit American manufacturing while providing revenue to make up for losses from reducing corporate tax rates. Several manufacturers, including Dow Chemical, are actively lobbying for the plan, which Trump has called ""too complicated."" Opponents, including net importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), oppose it and warn it will raise taxes on American consumers.

Chipmaker Nvidia still tops the IBD 50, but see what other takes make the list of stock that have performed the best over the past 52 weeks.""The good news is that Arista's U.S. contract manufacturer is up and running, which enables the company to supply its U.S. customers,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a research report Tuesday. ""The bad news is that legal uncertainty has reared its ugly head (just when we thought legal risks were subsiding), while both supply constraints and gross margins could be worse than expected in the near term.""Arista Networks has denied infringing o Cisco's patents. It also says it has modified its network software to resolve issues.

The ITC judge's ruling is subject to full commission review, which is expected to be completed by April 9.However, an eight-person jury in December ruled that Arista owed no damages over Cisco's claims of copyright infringement.It is important to understand that CBP has not ruled that Arista's products infringe,"" Arista said in a statement. ""Instead, CBP has expressed concern that its original ruling was incorrect, based on input provided by Cisco.""It is equally important to understand that Arista has not yet responded to Cisco's arguments and has not yet had an opportunity to address any concerns Customs may have as a result of those arguments.

30,CPB,"Campbell Soup (CPB) slid in early trading after the company forecast annual profit that trailed analysts' estimates, hurt by weakness in its Bolthouse Farms fresh-food business.Profit will be $3 to $3.09 a share in the fiscal year through July 2017, the Camden, N.J.-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts estimated $3.15, on average.The disappointing outlook -- as well as a fourth-quarter performance that missed expectations -- shows Campbell continues to struggle with the Bolthouse Farms business it acquired for $1.55 billion in a major push into fresh food. Since taking over the producer of carrots, juices and salad dressings four years ago, Campbell has been hampered by a drought that's hurt its main growing region in California as well as a recall of protein drinks in June.""The performance of our Campbell Fresh business, driven predominantly by execution issues, is disappointing,"" Chief Executive Officer Denise Morrison said in the statement. ""We have taken and are taking steps designed to ensure the business performs to its potential.""That includes axing the president of Bolthouse.Revenue from Campbell's fresh-food unit fell 4.7% to $223 million in the fourth quarter, hurt by declining sales of Bolthouse carrots and refrigerated beverages. Excluding the revenue added by last year's acquisition of the Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa company, the division's sales tumbled 12%. Campbell's full fourth-quarter profit was 46 cents a share, trailing analysts' 50-cent average projection.The shares slipped 3.7% to 58.50 at 8:51 a.m. ET in early trading.

Smucker's sales disappointed Wall Street on weakness in pet food and coffee. The package food sector is consolidating, and shares of some companies have soared recently amid increased M&A activity.Smucker's coffee revenue of $513.3 million in Q1 was down from $565 million a year earlier, in part on weak Dunkin' (DNKN) K-Cup pods sales and lower net prices. Sales of Kibbles 'n Bits, Meow Mix and other pet food  products collectively fell 6% to $519.5 million, in part on difficult comps vs. strong sales of new brands a year before.However, the company expects to achieve $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year as it consolidates after divestments and recent acquisitions, such as Meow Mix maker Big Heart Pet Brands, which it acquired in March 2015.Smucker maintained it outlook for full-year adjusted EPS of $7.60 to $7.75, the midpoint of which is a little below analysts' consensus for $7.70.

Revenue fell 1.6% to $1.87 billion, vs. analysts' $1.91 billion target, as sales of its Simple Meals business -- mainly condensed and ready-to-serve soups and beverages -- fell 3% to $999 million.But the company expects results to improve as it has expanded its product portfolio last year into fresh and organic foods, including bags of fresh carrots and organic soups.

39,CPB,"Bad things can happen to good stocks, even supposed safe ones that pay a generous dividend.That's the lesson from Campbell Soup (CPB), which disappointed investors Friday with its fiscal third-quarter report.Campbell Soup, which has been a mainstay in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, said it earned 65 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny. But sales of $1.87 billion missed estimates of $1.91 billion. Both were 2% below a year earlier. It was the first earnings decline in five quarters. CEO Denise Morrison said sales were hampered by a weaker U.S. soup season, challenges with the V8 line of beverages, and a weather-related disruption to the company's carrot supply.The stock was hammered Friday, falling more than 6% and undercutting the 59.74 low of a narrow flat base with a 65.58 buy point from which it had meandered May 12 in dull volume. Campbell's sell-off rattled investors in some big members of IBD's packaged food industry group. General Mills (GIS), which sells the competing Progresso brand of soup, was also down, although it was finding support at its 50-day moving average. It is close to completing a cup-with-handle base with a 65.21 buy point.Campbell had a high-volume down day Aug. 24, but the general market was in the midst of a furious correction. Campbell managed to finish down only 3.3% and quickly got back on track. For now, the stock's long-term uptrend remains intact. But further sharp declines and a failure to hold above the 40-week moving average could mean an investor should sell in order to avoid giving back all the solid gains over the past year.Campbell consolidated for two years before beginning an advance in the middle of 2015. Earnings-per-share growth stopped in 2014 but picked up again in 2015 and is seen rising 11% this year.It pays a 31.25-cent quarterly dividend per share, which works out to a 2% annualized yield.

The small cap S&P 600 chopped off 1.7%, and the Dow Jones utility average dropped 1.8%. Volume was higher across the board.The weekly charts of the indexes, however, raised the question of whether the market is putting in a floor or a trapdoor. The Nasdaq and S&P 500's recent weekly closes look like a floor — tight closes without much additional price movement south. Yet, the closes are coming low in the week's range, and the 10-week line is serving as fierce resistance, at least for the Nasdaq.Bulls and bears both need to consider three other factors:—The put-call ratio closed at 1.07 Tuesday, in line with closes of 1.15 Friday and 1.07 Thursday.

46,CPB,"The food and beverage sector is serving up plenty of red meat to investors looking for top-rated stocks near a buy point.The sector was ranked No. 6 out of 33 on Wednesday. It's been strong all year thanks to healthy earnings and dividend growth among leading companies in the sector, a big plus in a market that still favors defensive stocks to a good extent.B&G Foods (BGS) leads with a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, but the maker of jellies and hot sauces is extended after gapping up past a 40.60 cup-base entry April 29 following a strong quarterly earnings report.The stock sports a long-term dividend growth rate of 14%, according to IBD calculations, and the annualized dividend of $1.40 a share yields 3.2% at the current share price, well above the S&P 500 average.A more timely choice is Blue Buffalo (BUFF), which cleared a 26.08 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base Wednesday. The breakout came after the maker of premium dog food reported that Q1 profit rose 19% to 19 cents a share, beating Wall Street estimates. Revenue rose 12% to $279.8 million, also above views. Volume was heavy, but the stock pared gains.The base is the first since Blue Buffalo went public last July at 20 a share. The 47%-deep correction in the pattern may normally be a flaw, but some IPO bases can be unorthodox.Profit at the Wilton, Conn.-based company has increased sharply from 12 cents a share in 2010 to 62 cents last year. Earnings for this year are expected to rise 19% to 74 cents a share, followed by a 15% increase in 2017.Meanwhile, Monster Beverage (MSNT) pulled back below a 150.80 cup-with-handle entry Wednesday after breaking out the previous day on better-than-expected earnings. The maker of energy drinks boasts strong profit margins. Also, an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+ points to strong demand for the shares.Neither Blue Buffalo nor Monster offers a dividend, but Cambpell's Soup (CPB) and Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) have long-term dividend growth rates of 4% and 13%, respectively. Campbell's is trying to clear a 65.58 flat-base buy point , while Dr Pepper is just below a 95.97 potential entry.

50,CPB,"The Federal Reserve convinced markets that a June rate hike is on the table. Warren Buffett disclosed a big Apple (AAPL) stake. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Wal-Mart (WMT) reported strong results, but Target (TGT), Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) were among those with weak results or outlooks. Cisco (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) had upbeat reports that were good news for IT spending. General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles. He said a June rate hike is ""definitely live."" Other policymakers made similar comments. The next meeting will be held June 14-15, followed by another on July 26-27.April consumer prices had their biggest monthly gain in three years. Weekly jobless claims fell sharply after spiking to the highest since February 2015 in the prior week. Industrial production was strong in April, but manufacturing surveys for May from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed unexpected deterioration.Existing-home sales and housing starts rose for April, while builder sentiment was steady in May.Mega-investors piled into Apple. Warren Buffett disclosed on Monday May 13 that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought 9.8 million shares of Apple last quarter, valued at about $1.07 billion at quarter’s end. Midweek, Greenlight Capital disclosed it raised its stake in Apple 30.7% to 8.2 million shares, and billionaire George Soros' Soros Fund Management said it took a 3,100-share stake in Apple. Buffett's investment reflects confidence in Apple's pipeline of products, including future iPhones or even a rumored Apple Car. But it also suggests a shift in Apple's lifecycle from a growth company to a value play.Apple stock rose 5.2% for the week after hitting a 23-month low in the prior week.Playing catch-up, Alphabet's Google introduced a voice-activated Wi-Fi speaker system with built-in search.

Salesforce stock jumped 6.1% for the week, breaking out of a base and nearly hitting an all-time high.Cisco Systems reported a 6% adjusted EPS gain for its fiscal Q3, with revenue up 3%, both edging past analyst forecasts. Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts.

But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain. Target’s Q2 EPS guidance of $1 to $1.20 widely missed expectations for $1.36.Shares plunged 7.1%, hitting their lowest levels since late 2014.Wal-Mart’s Q1 profit fell 5 cents to 98 cents a share but beat estimates by 10 cents. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain. For Q2, Wal-Mart sees EPS of 95 cents to $1.08, with the midpoint above estimates for 98 cents.Shares popped 7.6% for the week, retaking their 200-day and 50-day lines after gapping down in sympathy with Target on Wednesday.Outshining its ailing department store peers, TJX (TJX) Q1 EPS and sales rose 10% to 76 cents and $7.54 billion, comfortably topping. Comps rose 7%. The off-price retailer guided full-year EPS up to $3.35-$3.42, still shy of estimates. Off-price peer Ross Stores edged past Q1 EPS views with a 6% gain, but revenue's 5% gain to $3.09 billion missed. Comps grew 2%. Q2 and full-year EPS guidance fell short of consensus. Ross Stores fell 3.4% for the week, while TJX climbed 3.7%.General Motors acquisition Cruise Automation confirmed that its self-driving technology was being tested on Chevy Bolts after photos of the all-electric cars surfaced online. Uber on Thursday also posted a photo of a hybrid Ford (F) Fusion outfitted with self-driving technology that it said would be undergoing testing.GM and Lyft plan to road-test autonomous Bolt taxis in the coming months, and Ford has established a subsidiary focused on autonomous-car technology and ride-sharing. But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance. But its Q2 profit margin shrank to 11.9% before interest and taxes, down from 14.4% in the prior quarter. Campbell said fiscal Q3 EPS rose 5% to 65 cents, beating by a penny. But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

51,CPB,"Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Starbucks (SBUX) were all near buy points ahead of their most recent quarterly reports, but have since dropped from those levels after issuing weak results. On the other hand, Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) had formed bases and were propelled higher by their strong earnings.Here's a look at four stocks that are trading near or in buy range ahead of their quarterly reports later this week: Applied Materials (AMAT), Autodesk (ADSK), Eight By Eight (EGHT) and Campbell Soup (CPB).You may not think of Campbell Soup when you think of top stocks, but the maker of packaged food has a high IBD Composite Rating of 92 out of 99. The company is expected to report Friday an earnings increase of 3%, a big slowdown from two quarters in a row of roughly 30% bottom-line growth. Revenue is expected to fall a fraction.Campbell breached support at the 50-day line Wednesday in above-average volume but was able to finish the session just above the line. Shares are now about 5% below their all-time high reached as the stock cleared a flat base buy point of 65.58.

Earnings are expected to drop 60% while revenue climbs 25% when it reports Thursday.Shares tried to break out of a cup-with-handle base with a 12.05 buy point Wednesday, but closed the session below that level. The stock is 13% below its January peak.Applied Materials is expected to see earnings grow 10% on a fractional sales decline. The chip equipment maker, which reports Thursday, has a Composite Rating of 66.Shares are trading in buy range from a cup base the stock initially cleared in March.

The company has a 49 Composite Rating.Shares recently breached support at the 50-day line and are dipping back below buy range from a cup-with-handle base.

"
56,CPB,"It's hard to grow in an economic downturn, but that may be what soup king Campbell Soup (CPB) has to do to continue what appears to be a successful transformation.Economic growth in the U.S. lost some gas in the back half of 2015 due to global headwinds, dumping of excess inventory and the energy-sector slump. In addition to economic uncertainty, Campbell also is grappling with a long-term trend among consumers away from shelf goods like canned soup and more toward fresh, natural foods.The fresh and natural trend hit grocery stores several years ago with the rise of Whole Foods Market (WFM), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and others. Mainstream supermarkets responded by adding more of those products.For example, No. 1 U.S. supermarket company Kroger (KR) -- parent of its namesake chain as well as Ralphs, Fred Meyer, discounter Food 4 Less and other brands -- rolled out its own line of natural and organic foods, Simple Truth, which has proved to be popular. This trend toward fresh and natural initially left Campbell Soup at a disadvantage.""Campbell is heavily reliant on soup. It's more than 50% of their business (by revenue). Long term, consumers are moving away from that market,"" Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo told Investor's Business Daily.Campbell says it garnered about 59% of all U.S. retail canned and packaged ""wet"" soup sales -- as opposed to the kind where you add water, like Unilever's (UL) dry-packaged Lipton soups -- in its latest quarter. But now it's focusing on fresh, natural ingredients and talking to consumers to find out what they want in their foods.As a result, Campbell is expanding in the fresh and natural category, selling everything from bags of fresh carrots to a new line of organic soups. It's also made a series of acquisitions to grow in that category and internationally.Campbell bought Garden Fresh Gourmet, a maker of fresh salsa, chips and hummus, in June for $231 million.In 2013, the Camden, N.J.-based company bought Plum Organics, the No. 2 U.S. provider of organic baby foods and snacks. To expand its global footprint, it bought the Kelsen Group, a Denmark-based maker of quality baked goods and snacks sold in 85 countries. Kelsen is the biggest provider of sweet biscuits in China, the world's largest consumer market.In August 2012, Campbell made its biggest purchase ever, paying $1.55 billion cash to a fund managed by Madison Dearborn Partners for Bolthouse Farms. Headquartered in Bakersfield, Calif., Bolthouse has market-leading positions in fresh carrots and premium health beverages such as smoothies and protein drinks, and is a growing presence in refrigerated salad dressings.Those moves get Campbell off the inner store shelves and into the coveted outer ring of items, according to Darren Seifer, executive director and food and beverage analyst for market tracker NPD.""Companies at the center of the store are having difficulty attracting customers. The place to be is the outside of the store, where the fresh vegetables, meats and deli counter are,"" Seifer said.Campbell's drive into those parts of the store is helping get customers engaged.""Campbell does try to keep their fingers on the pulse of what's happening in health. They're trying to stay on top of and maybe in front of the trend,"" Seifer said.Analysts say Campbell's recent rapid growth is due in large part to strategic initiatives launched by Chief Executive Denise Morrison, a 13-year company veteran who assumed the helm 4-1/2 years ago.In early 2015, Morrison announced the company was reorganizing into three business divisions, primarily by product categories rather than geographies or brand groups, and she began implementing a plan to trim costs by $250 million over three years, among other moves.""Generating growth in this environment has been and remains difficult,"" Morrison told analysts on the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings call at the end of November.But she also noted the company has made recipe changes to appeal to consumers, shifted marketing dollars to digital channels and is ""advancing the 'health and well-being' imperative across our company,"" including the launch a year ago of the Campbell Organic line of soups.Those soups, which include vegetarian and gluten-free varieties, come in recyclable paper cartons, as Campbell tries to move away from the traditional metal can to more environmentally friendly packaging.Campbell's stock price recently hit a series of highs. It rose 11% in just over three weeks to close at 56.69 on Feb. 1, and was nearing its all-time high close at 60.05 set in March 1998. Its stock has a 92 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 92% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Last quarter, Campbell reported a 28.4% jump in fiscal Q1 earnings per share to 95 cents based on originally reported figures, 22% when taking into account a recent accounting change, easily topping analyst consensus for 76 cents a share.Revenue fell 2.3% year over year to $2.203 billion in the company's first quarter, just below Wall Street's $2.207 billion target, due to the negative impact of currency translation. Campbell doesn't break out soup revenue, but it accounts for the bulk of revenue in its Simple Meals and Beverage division, which also includes broths, pasta sauces, V8 juices and other products. Simple Meal was $1.3 billion of the quarterly total.Edward Jones' Russo cautions that the company isn't seeing bubbling growth yet. Although EPS reversed from a drop of 12% two quarters ago to a robust 28% rise last quarter, its revenue growth rate has shrunk for four quarters in a row.A Dec. 16 Edward Jones report projected Campbell will report $2.85 EPS for 2016, up 16% year over year and above consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.82. Russo has a hold rating on the company.For 2016, Russo predicted: ""Soup will have a tough year, partly because the weather has been unusually warm across much of the U.S. The rest of their categories will be fine.""In particular, Russo looks to Pepperidge Farm, the 79-year-old maker of cookies, bread and crackers, to add flavor to Campbell's bottom line.

57,CPB,"To many new investors, technical analysis seems a bit like witchcraft — a magical skill that can’t really be trusted.But investors who learn to analyze a stock’s technical strength together with its fundamentals have a big advantage.“It’s not enough to buy a stock simply because it has good fundamental characteristics, like strong earnings and sales,” wrote IBD founder William J. O’Neil in “How to Make Money In Stocks.” “Fortunes are made every year by those who take the time to learn to interpret charts properly.”The Stock Checkup, located under the “Research” tab at investors.com, doesn’t discuss charts per se, but it offers technical indicators that can be used with charts to give investors a sense of a stock’s health.Stock Checkup is comprised of three sections — Market Direction, Fundamental Performance And Technical Performance. The first part of the technical section deals with stock price and volume to help you gauge whether institutional investors are buying or selling a stock.The Relative Strength Rating indicates how a stock has been performing relative to the rest of the market over the past 52 weeks. Each stock is assigned an RS Rating of between 1 and 99, with 99 indicating that a stock is outperforming 99% of all listed companies. Focus on stocks with RS Ratings of at least 80.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating tracks the degree of institutional buying (accumulation) and selling (distribution) over the past 13 weeks. It too is a barometer of a stock’s strength. An Acc/Dis Rating below C indicates distribution; above C points to accumulation.Investors should avoid Nasdaq stocks that trade below 15 a share and NYSE stocks trading below 20 because they tend to be illiquid and more speculative. An average volume of less than 500,000 shares per day is a sign of less institutional interest in the stock, unless the stock is high in price.After checking these indicators, now go to a chart. See where a stock is in relation to its 50-day moving average and its 52-week high. Stocks hitting new highs that are far above their 50-day lines could be near a top. But those getting support at the 50-day line just below their 52-week highs could be getting set to clear a buy point. Stocks trading sharply below their 50-day lines reflect weakness.The technical indicators of many former top growth stocks have turned negative amid the market’s correction. That’s not surprising, since growth stocks can fall up to 2.5 times as fast as the rest of the major indexes.Some defensive names are showing relative strength right now. Packaged food giant Campbell Soup (CPB), trades around 5% above its 50-day moving average; hence, a green dot next to that criterion in Stock Checkup means it passes the grade. Campbell is just off a 52-week high as it works on a flat base with a 55.18 buy point.The steady dividend payer boasts an RS Rating of 94; hence, the Stock Checkup gives it another green dot. An Acc/Dis rating of C indicates a net balance of buying and selling by the big funds.

58,CPB,"When it comes to mature markets, it doesn’t get much more mature than breakfast cereal, which was first introduced in the U.S. during the Civil War.That kind of mileage makes it difficult for leading cereal makers such as Post Holdings (POST) -- which traces its history to 1895 -- to find growth through the kinds of disruptive, gee-whiz advances you’ll find in other sectors of the economy. There’s only so many flavors you can pull out of cereal grains after more than a century of trying, and only so many ways to package and market them.So Post has looked for growth via acquisitions into different product lines. Since being spun off by Ralcorp in February 2012, the company has made nine buyouts. You can expect Post to keep scouting deals in coming months.“We believe we are quite well positioned with the considerable amount of cash on hand approaching $900 million,” Chief Financial Officer Jeff Zadoks said on the company's recent fiscal-first-quarter conference call with analysts. “We’ve got considerable secured debt capacity (and) a very rich pipeline of opportunities. I think we are going to have plenty of opportunities on the M&A front.”Acquisitions have helped Post grow its top line nearly 400% over the last four years — from $959 million in annual revenue in 2012 to $4.6 billion last year.Some have helped Post expand its traditional lineup of cereal brands. But the company also has moved into other product areas like pasta, protein bars, dried fruits, nuts, eggs, sports nutrition supplements and peanut butter. Among the company’s acquired brands: PowerBar, Attune Foods, Dakota Growers Pasta, American Blanching and Mom Brands.Post’s latest buyout came in October, when it spent $90 million to acquire Willamette Egg Farms, a producer, processor and wholesale distributor of eggs and egg products in the Northwest. The Willamette business is expected to add $80 million a year in net sales to Post and around $15 million a year in earnings before various adjustments, or EBITDA.Several different businesses fall under the Post corporate umbrella. The Post Foods business includes ready-to-eat cereal brands such as Grape Nuts, Post Raisin Bran and Pebbles. Mom Brands is geared more toward hot and value-priced cereals.Brands in the Michael Foods Group include Simply Potatoes hash browns, Dakota Growers pasta and All Whites liquid egg whites. The Active Nutrition segment features the PowerBar, Premier Nutrition and Dymatize Nutrition brands. Post also has a Private Brands group that includes Golden Boy peanut butter and nuts, as well as Attune Foods, which is heavy on organic and non-GMO granolas, cereals and snacks.Michael Foods is the biggest segment by sales, accounting for just less than half of the total. Post Foods contributes about one-third of sales, with the rest fairly evenly split between Active Nutrition and Private Brands. All of the segments saw declines in comparable sales during the first quarter.Post had a mixed performance during the quarter, which ended in December. The company logged adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share. That reversed a loss of $1.15 per share from the previous year and came in well above consensus estimates for 25 cents.But sales, which grew 16% to $1.25 billion, came in slightly below views. The gain was driven by Mom Brands, which Post acquired last year for about $1 billion. On a comparable basis that excludes the contribution of acquired brands, Post’s net sales declined 4.2% from the prior year.Still, the company’s share price hit a record high of 72.64 on March 3. The stock has also been helped by volatility in the broader market, which tends to push investors to the relative safety of the food business. In addition to Post, other food stocks that have set new highs in recent weeks include Tyson Foods (TSN), Sysco (SYY), Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM).“Underlying sales were negatively affected by the volume declines in the egg business, as well as the company’s transition in its Dymatize business to an outsourced production model following the closure of its manufacturing facility in the quarter,” Stifel analyst Christopher Growe noted in a first-quarter earnings report.On the upside, Post’s EBITDA for the quarter came in at $236 million, ahead of estimates. Post also raised its fiscal 2016 EBITDA guidance to a range of $810 million to $840 million from prior guidance of $780 million to $820 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Post to log full-year earnings of $1.61 a share, up from 62 cents in fiscal 2015. Earnings are seen rising another 30% to $2.09 in fiscal 2017.“The company noted that this new guidance range incorporates incremental investments (approximately $25 million) related to incremental marketing spending and achieving synergies from the Mom Brands acquisition,” Growe said.During the first-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Robert Vitale mentioned a couple of macro trends that work in his company’s favor. One is low energy prices tied to cheap oil, which helps keep manufacturing costs down.Another is the company’s low exposure to volatile international markets. Post gets less than 10% of its sales from outside the U.S., and most of that comes from Canada.“While this domestic profile is a challenge in delivering volume growth, it also provides a safe haven from recent currency headwinds,” Vitale said.

59,CPB,"The stock market has had a defensive posture for a while, and growth stocks generally remain out of favor.

60,CPB,"If the market launches a new uptrend that works, defensive stocks are likely to give way to stocks that tilt toward growth.With that thought, let's look at the dividend stocks that offer growth potential.We sifted IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, culling for the best earnings growth expected in 2016. (Not all those stocks appear on the table in the paper.) We considered only stocks with upward earnings revisions. The top five:Brinker International (EAT): The Street expects the owner of Chili's Grill & Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy restaurants to boost earnings 16% in the fiscal year ending in June. Pretax margin hit at least a nine-year high in fiscal 2015.On Feb. 2, Brinker declared an increase in the quarterly dividend from 28 cents a share to 32 cents. The annualized yield is 2.6%.Campbell Soup (CPB): Recently the soup maker has been acting more like a growth stock than a dividend stock. Analysts expect earnings to jump 14% the fiscal year ending in July, which would be the best annual growth since 1999.Campbell hasn't raised the dividend since 2013. The quarterly payout is 31.2 cents a share for an annualized yield of 2.1%.Air Products & Chemicals (APD): The Street is pegging earnings growth at 13% for the year ending in September. In 2015, Air Products raised its dividend for the 33rd year in a row. Look for another increase to be declared sometime in March. The  yield is 2.5%.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN): Analysts see earnings growth at 13% this year. That's up from 11% last year but below the three-year growth rate of 15%.  Dunkin' declared a dividend increase early this month. The quarterly payout was raised from 26.5 cents a share to 30 cents. The yield is 2.8%.CME Group (CME): EPS are expected to rise 13% this year. The company recently raised the quarterly dividend from 50 cents a share to 60 cents. The yield is 2.6%.Honorable mention: Hasbro (HAS) 12% EPS growth; Hormel Foods (HRL), 11%; and Clorox (CLX), 10%.

65,CPB,"No, it ain’t fish eggs. Instead, ROE means return on equity -- or more accurately, return on shareholders' equity.The gauge divides a company’s full-year net income by its shareholders' equity, then multiplies by 100 to get a percentage figure. IBD takes the average equity over the past two years. The result expresses how much profit it can generate for every dollar of net assets. IBD research into past big market winners shows a ratio of 17% or more as positive. Single-digit ratios could be cause for concern.ROE is a rough gauge for how efficiently management is putting capital to use and how its profitability is keeping pace with its growth as a publicly traded company.  As a company's equity grows, so does the challenge to maintain a high ROE. Earnings per share is another measure that weighs in on this question of ownership vs. profitability. But ROE does not take the number of shares into account.Where do you find it? Get a stock quote by using the search box at the top right corner of Investors.com. Under Stock/Company Data, you will find Annual ROE in the Company Fundamentals column. In addition, the minicharts presented with IBD’s Big Cap 20, Your Weekly Review and IBD 50 include ROE.Some companies often borrow debt to invest in new products and services to drive more profit. As a result, companies with high ROE sometimes also have somewhat elevated levels of debt.So as you perform your stock research, look at peer companies and compare their debt and ROE levels. If a target stock has a higher than group average ROE, and its debt is moderately higher, the two could be related.To be sure, a high ROE doesn’t compensate for unhealthy levels of debt. A long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 100% or more is considered high, even in certain industries known for heavy capital spending.If a stock has a low ROE (single digits and/or well below its group average) and very high debt, it could be a cause for concern.There is also a relationship between profit margins and return on equity. In some cases, you might allow for a below-peer ROE, if the company is churning out top-notch annual pretax margins. In general, annual pretax margin of 17% or higher is a sign of fundamental strength. You also want to see if a company's pretax margin is among the best in its industry.The average return on equity among current IBD 50 stocks is 28.4%. At the high end of the scale among companies that have thus far reported 2015 results, Campbell Soup (CPB) shows an unusually strong return on equity of 52.3%.That is well above peers like J.M. Smucker (SJM), with ROE of 7.2%, and even much larger players such as Kellogg (K), General Mills (GIS) and Kraft Heinz (KHC).Campbell’s pretax margins, 13.1% in fiscal 2015, are in line with these other food giants. Its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 185% is certainly on the high side. It helps boost Campbell's ROE above a company like Smucker, which shows a long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 84%.

66,CPB,"Eighty-year old companies that specialize in meat production aren’t usually looked upon as growth stocks, but Tyson Foods (TSN) aims to position itself as one anyway.The world’s largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef and pork plans to do so by putting more focus on branded products rather than commodities such as fresh poultry.Its ultimate goal? To become the ""leading branded protein company in the world,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer noted in a recent report.""Tyson continues to position itself as a growth company with advantaged brands within advantaged categories,"" Palmer said.Those categories include high-margin, ""value-added"" products such as marinated and breaded poultry; prepared foods, including what it calls its “Core 9” packaged brands like Jimmy Dean sausage and Hillshire Farms lunch meat; and antibiotic and gluten-free chicken.During the recent Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Fla., Tyson officials said 85% of the company’s chicken business consists of poultry that is more than just raw meat.""This further differentiates (Tyson) from its more commodity-oriented peers,"" Palmer noted.Tyson Chief Executive Donald Smith echoed that point on a fiscal first-quarter conference call with analysts.""I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio as well as the production flexibility created with our buy vs. grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure,"" Smith said. The ""buy vs. grow"" strategy refers to Tyson’s decision to purchase some of its chickens from other facilities and reduce the number of chickens it grows itself.Tyson officials have made no secret of their desire to change the way investors view the company. As JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman pointed out in a recent note, the first two words of Tyson’s presentation at the consumer group event were ""different company.""""Tyson remains firmly (and understandably) committed to convincing investors that it is a different company than it used to be,"" Goldman noted. ""The primary reason for the difference continues to be Tyson’s emphasis -- both in reality and perception -- on branded food rather than commodity protein.""One difference between branded food and commodity meat items is that the former carries higher prices and margins, Goldman says. Tyson’s Core 9 brands carry ""an 11% average premium over the category average.""Tyson also spent a lot of time talking about revenue growth during the consumer group event. That stood in contrast to other food companies, such as General Mills (GIS) and Nabisco parent Mondelez International (MDLZ), which mainly focused on cost-cutting.""These companies spent much, maybe most, of their time today talking about costs, whereas the opposite was true for Tyson,"" Goldman noted. ""It helps to have a category (meat/protein) growing at a better-than-average pace, as well as a category that responds well to mix- and margin-accretive innovation today.""There appears to be plenty of demand for Tyson’s meat products. Palmer cited Tyson research showing that 54% of U.S. consumers want to increase the amount of protein in their diets.Worldwide, long-term demand for protein is expected to increase more than 60% from current levels due to population growth and the emergence of a global middle class that can afford to buy more meat products.Favorable industry trends, combined with investor optimism over the food sector in general, have helped push Tyson’s stock price up more than 40% since Nov. 20. Its shares set a record high of 64.63 on Feb. 23 — the sixth straight session they reached a new high.Other large-cap food companies that have set new highs this month include Sysco (SYY), Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM).One reason for the recent stock gains is the defensive nature of the food business. When stock markets are volatile, many investors flock to consumer staples such as food. Companies in this industry aren’t as vulnerable to wide swings in performance and value and also tend to pay regular dividends. Some food companies also have benefited from cheap gas prices, which lower transportation costs.Meanwhile, Tyson has gotten a lift from falling food costs. Excessive supplies of cattle feed such as corn and soybeans have lowered production prices of beef, poultry and pork. Lower costs were one reason Tyson raised its full-year earnings forecast earlier this month to a range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share from prior guidance of $3.50 to $3.65.The company also recently reiterated its goal of 10%-or-better annual earnings-per-share growth in coming years, and suggested that its long-term margin goals might be conservative.“We would not be surprised if before the fiscal year ended, Tyson raised its long-term chicken margin to maybe 8% to 10% from 7% to 9% currently,” Goldman noted.Tyson posted earnings of $1.15 a share for its fiscal first quarter, which ended in December. That was up 49% from the previous year and well above consensus analyst estimates for 89 cents. It was the biggest quarterly EPS gain in nearly two years.On the downside, revenue declined 15% to $9.15 billion -- the first dip since the September 2012 quarter -- partly because of the divestiture of a few noncore businesses. The top-line result fell short of consensus for $10 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tyson’s full-year earnings to climb 27% this fiscal year and another 7% in fiscal 2017.

102,CPB,"After a few rocky quarters, earnings growth is heating up again for Campbell Soup (CPB). On Tuesday, Campbell delivered earnings of 95 cents a share for its fiscal Q1 of 2016 — up 22% from a year earlier and the firm's biggest gain in three years. In the four quarters prior, profit went from falling 13% to rising 18%.Q1's sales, however, were down 2% to $2.20 billion, hurt in part by currency headwinds. Campbell's top line has now fallen for four straight periods. Revenue was higher in only one of its three operating segments. Sales at its Campbell Fresh division, which includes juices, smoothies, dips, salsas and refrigerated soups, rose 8%. But sales at its Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and its Global Biscuits and Snacks units fell 2% and 6%, respectively.For its full fiscal 2016, Campbell expects sales to be flat to down 1% due to currency translations. Previously, the company expected sales to be flat to up 1%. Adjusted earnings are slated to rise 4%-7%, or to $2.75-$2.83 a share. Current consensus estimates call for $2.63 a share, up 5%.Earlier this month, Campbell declared a quarterly dividend of 31.2 cents a share to be paid Feb. 1 to shareholders of record Jan. 11. It last announced a dividend hike in September 2013. Campbell, which was founded in 1869, has paid shareholders dividends since going public in 1954.On an annual basis, Campbell pays nearly $1.25 a share, which works out to a yield of about 2.4%. Its yield is on the lower end of the 17 companies in the Food-Packaged industry group that do pay dividends. B&G Foods (BGS) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) have the highest yields at around 3.8% and 3.1%, respectively.On Tuesday, the stock gapped above its 50-day line and edged past a 52.47 buy point from a flat base intraday but lost some steam by the close. It gave a better showing Wednesday and touched its highest levels since January 1999.

121,CPB,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

134,CPB,"Campbell Soup (CPB) shares warmed up on Friday after the food company topped fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates and gave slightly optimistic full-year guidance despite currency headwinds.Earnings came in flat at 62 cents a share in Q3, above a Thomson Reuters analyst poll by 10 cents. Campbell, like other food giants, continued cost-cutting efforts and curbed promotions. Gross margin rose to 35.9% from 34.3% a year earlier.Revenue fell 3.6% to $1.9 billion, just below expectations for $1.93 billion, due to currency fluctuations and the impact of retailer inventory movements on its U.S. soup business, the company said. It was the second straight year-over-year sales decline and the worst drop in nearly three years.For the full year, Campbell expects revenue to fall closer to the lower end of its prior guidance for -1% to 1%. Analysts have calculated sales to drop 1.7%.Campbell sees full-year earnings closer to the favorable end of its range of $2.32-$2.38 a share, while Wall St. has estimated $2.35 vs. last year's $2.53.Shares climbed 1.8% to 47.78 in the stock market today intraday. Shares are nearing a 48.40 buy point from a flat base.Campbell has an IBD Composite Rating of 55 out of 99, meaning its shares outperform 55% of all stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors. Some of those factors are earnings and sales growth, return on equity, profit margins and relative price performance.WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), which was spun off from Dean Foods (DF) in 2012, leads the Food-Packaged industry group with a 93 Composite Rating. Earlier this month, WhiteWave, the maker of Silk nondairy milk and Earthbound Farms salads, reported Q1 earnings that topped views and sales that met views.WhiteWave's results were also affected by the strong dollar. Revenue from Europe would have risen 23% on a currency-adjusted basis, but rose just 4% on a reported basis.Still, WhiteWave raised its full-year earnings guidance.Natural and organic foods companyHain Celestial (HAIN) also raised its full-year guidance and sales outlook after issuing Q1 results earlier this month. Hain's earnings matched forecasts, while sales slightly topped views.Hain holds the No. 2 spot in the Food-Packaged group with a 90 Composite Rating.Other companies in the group include Kraft Foods (KRFT), Pinnacle Foods (PF), Conagra Foods (CAG), General Mills (GIS) and Kellogg (K).Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter: @IBD_AWilliams.

Whole Foods Market (WFM) recently announced a plan to launch a new store concept that appeals to millennial shoppers with ""modern"" design, new technology and lower-cost products.While the new Target arrangement isn't ideal for its longtime processed-food suppliers, this doesn't necessarily mean the end of premium shelf space for them. General Mills owns several organic and natural brands such as Larabar and recent acquisition Annie's, while Campbell owns Plum Organics in addition to its own line of organic soup.Target reports earnings Wednesday. Analysts expect earnings of $1.02 per share on revenue of $17.08 billion.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter: @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Whole Foods Targeting Millennials But Q2 Sales Weak.

214,CPB,"With all the economic gloom in the world, many have been perplexed: Why have stocks done so well, especially in the U.S.?
"
215,CPB,"Since the end of the Great Recession, U.S. stocks as measured by the S&P 500 have risen a whopping 128%.
"
216,CPB,"A new study from the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis suggests why. Its monthly report, released last week, shows that world trade has jumped 13.6% since its 2008 peak while total industrial output is up 11.9%. That might not sound like a lot, but it is.
"
217,CPB,"American Enterprise Institute fellow and frequent IBD contributor Mark Perry notes that trade and industrial output are at all-time highs, ""confirming that the global economy has made a complete recovery from the 2008-09 economic slowdown and is now in a new cycle of solid and sustained growth.""
"
218,CPB,"While governments teeter on bankruptcy, the private sector has slashed costs and become highly profitable and efficient. Despite numerous failed government interventions, innovators still do what they do best.
"
219,CPB,"This is a big reason global stocks are at record highs. At the Great Recession's nadir, the total value of all the world's stock markets fell to $27 trillion. As of October, they were at a record $64.7 trillion. That's a lot of wealth.
"
220,CPB,"Yes, 0% interest rates no doubt have made it more profitable to invest in companies. But that's not the sole reason for the big comeback.
"
221,CPB,"The free-market revolution that swept the world in the 1990s is still very much alive. Big companies and small businesses alike showed extraordinary resiliency in weathering bad economic conditions to, as Perry puts it, ""recover and prosper, even following the worst financial crisis and global economic slowdown in generations.""

224,CPB,"Developing trust is a vital building block of any relationship, whether it's with an organization, family or marriage, says Rodger Dean Duncan, a Liberty, Mo.-based executive coach.""I tell my clients that trust is the operating system of any culture,"" he told IBD. ""You can have wonderful software programs, but if the operating system is flaky, you're going to have a lot of problems.""Here's how to build that trust:• Get familiar. When Paul Hiltz took over as CEO of Mercy Hospital in Cincinnati in 2006, it was struggling financially and having problems retaining employees. Hiltz told Shawn Hunter, author of  ""Out Think,"" that he got to know each employee and got his to-do list from their suggestions. Some ideas weren't expensive, like fixing equipment and replacing carpet.""Instead of delivering edicts from on high, he asked people who had been there for 10 years,"" said Hunter, vice president of leadership matters at online education software provider Skillsoft. ""It gave them a sense of hope and aspiration.""• Be genuine. Howard Behar, former president of Starbucks' (SBUX) North America unit, once worked for a struggling company and had to fire a batch of people.He told Hunter that someone left a memo on the copier outlining the move, and employees found it. Some of his executives suggested he say the memo wasn't true. But his assistant said, ""Howard, only the truth sounds like the truth.""Behar came clean with employees, telling them about the firm's woes. They quickly pitched in with solutions. ""Truth and transparency build trust,"" Hunter said.• Be clear. Talking around a topic or giving selective facts — like saying you led a project without mentioning that six others helped lead it too — causes others to lose faith in you. ""Clear the fog,"" said Duncan, author of ""Change-Friendly Leadership."" ""Talk to people the way you want them to talk to you.""• Give useful feedback. People tend to tell people ""good job"" without explaining. Duncan suggests telling them what they did well, such as: They were attentive to the audience's needs and gave good examples during a presentation.• Show the way. Do what you've said you would. ""Otherwise, your credibility will be eroded immediately,"" Hunter said. One study showed kids were likelier to share candy with others when adults did so rather than told them to do it.• Listen. Campbell Jones, chief operating officer of auto auctioneer Manheim Australia, regularly gets out of the office to meet with customers, listen to employees' issues and back them up, Hunter says. That's important.• Seek dissent. Duncan worked at Campbell Soup (CPB) years ago when Gordon McGovern was CEO. When someone argued with him, McGovern would say, ""Oh, terrific, you disagree. Help me understand how you see it.""Said Duncan: ""You can use resistance as a springboard to dialogue.""• Display the result. Show your people the effect of their work. A study found that University of Michigan students were more effective in raising scholarship money when they met the potential recipients than if they didn't know who would get the money.""It gets people deeply vested in the process,"" Hunter said.• Emphasize the good. Duncan met a Scotland Yard expert in counterfeit currency who concentrated on what the real thing looked like. An NFL coach often stopped practice to tell a receiver what he did right. ""That's a wonderful leadership principle, to focus on the behavior we want,"" Duncan said.

264,CPB,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, the Invesco Russell 1000 Equal Weight ETF (EQAL  -  Free Report) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/23/2014.The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $442.41 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.31%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 13% of the portfolio. Industrials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, At&t Inc (T  -  Free Report) accounts for about 0.27% of total assets, followed by Campbell Soup Co (CPB  -  Free Report) and Mccormick & Co Inc/md (MKC  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 2.65% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskEQAL seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Equal Weight Index before fees and expenses. The Russell 1000 Equal Weight Index is composed of securities in the Russell 1000 Index and is equally weighted across nine sector groups with each security within the sector receiving equal weight.The ETF return is roughly 5.25% so far this year and was up about 16.68% in the last one year (as of 07/11/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $28.08 and $32.73.The ETF has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 13.68% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 974 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesInvesco Russell 1000 Equal Weight ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, EQAL is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $152.91 B in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $264.74 B. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.04% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

265,CPB,"Shares of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) rallied 9.4% yesterday on hearsay of a possible takeover by The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report). While both companies remained silent, sources revealed that Kraft Heinz looks keenly interested in buying Campbell Soup, which has been struggling with its soups and C-Fresh businesses for quite some time.These headwinds have been hurting Campbell’s top line for more than a year now, as a result of which this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has tumbled 17.7% in a year, wider than the industry’s decline of 7.3%. Also, Campbell is struggling with strained gross margins, due to input cost inflation, escalated supply-chain expenses (particularly in C-Fresh) and promotional spending (especially in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages).These factors, along with a soft C-Fresh performance, led to a disappointing third-quarter fiscal 2018. Unfortunately, management expects its ongoing challenges to persist, which along with its increased investment spending is likely to hurt fiscal 2019 performance. These factors led to a lowered earnings outlook for fiscal 2019.However, during the third-quarter conference call, Campbell’s interim CEO, Keith McLoughlin, revealed plans to bring the company back on track by carrying out a complete review of the company’s strategic plans, portfolio alignment, resource allocation and cost of capital, among others. Per sources, this strategic business review could also include a conceivable divestiture or division of the company’s operations. In fact, there have been speculations that apart from Kraft Heinz, Campbell could also get buyout proposals from General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), if it puts itself up for sale.As for the alleged buyout by Kraft Heinz, reports suggest that Campbell may not be a strategic fit for the company. This is because Kraft Heinz itself has been struggling with its top line, owing to shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. Thus, adding Campbell may not solve Kraft Heinz’ top-line issue, though it may augment the latter’s bottom line. Notably, Kraft Heinz has been making constant attempts to enhance its performance, through cost and productivity improvement efforts along with innovation and marketing strategies.All said, let’s see what’s in store for these food companies and if the aforementioned speculations actually surface. Talking of speculations, we had another one on similar lines, last week. Incidentally, there were rounds that Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) is trying to strike a deal to buy Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report). If the consolidation materializes, it is likely to create a robust frozen foods entity, at a time when demand for this category is booming. However, both Conagra and Pinnacle Foods remained silent on the matter.While Conagra has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), both Pinnacle Foods and Kraft Heinz carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

268,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is clearly off investors’ radar, especially after it slashed its earnings outlook for fiscal 2018, following third-quarter results. Shares of this convenience foods provider have lost 6.5% since the quarterly outcome, while this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has tumbled 14.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 0.8%.Campbell’s third-quarter performance was a disappointment for management, mainly due to factors hurting the gross margin and soft Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) performance. In fact, Campbell has been witnessing strained margins for a while now. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, adjusted gross margin contracted 390 basis points, mainly due to cost inflation, escalated supply-chain expenses (particularly in C-Fresh) and promotional spending (especially in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages) along with dilutive effect from recent buyouts.The cost inflation stemmed from increased prices of dairy, steel cans, meat and aluminum along with greater-than-expected rise in transportation and logistics expenses. Gross margin softness and higher adjusted marketing and selling expenses also weighed on Campbell’s EBIT margin. Management now expects fiscal 2018 gross margin to decline nearly 3 percentage points, which is worse than its previous forecast of 1% decline. Gross margin is expected to bear the brunt of cost inflation, weakness across C-Fresh, increased promotions and unfavorable mix due to the acquired businesses. Consequently, adjusted EBIT is now expected to decline in the band of 6-8% compared with prior guidance of decrease in the range of 5-7%.Moving to C-Fresh, results in this segment came way below management’s expectations in the third quarter. Though organic sales rose 1%, the segment posted an operating loss of $19 million, as against earnings of $1 million recorded in the year-ago period. This was accountable to dismal gross margin, which, in turn, was a result of lower manufacturing efficiencies and carrot crop yields along with inflated transportation and logistics expenses.Unfortunately, management expects its ongoing challenges to persist, which along with its increased investment spending is likely to hurt fiscal 2019 performance. As for fiscal 2018, the company now expects cost inflation of about 4%, due to sudden rise in transport and logistics costs. This along with weakness in C-Fresh and high promotional expenditure compelled management to lower its earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Also, Snyder's-Lance’s buyout is likely to impact results.Adjusted earnings are now envisioned in the band of $2.85-$2.90 per share, reflecting a decline of 5-6% from fiscal 2017. Earlier, management projected earnings per share in the $3.10-$3.17 band, which reflected growth of 2-4% from last year. These factors have also caused a downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018, which has gone down from $3.09 to $2.87 since management’s dismal view.Let’s see if Campbell’s focus on expanding the fast-growing snacking and organic foods categories, and robust cost-savings initiatives can do any good to the dwindling stock.Unsure About Campbell?

269,CPB,"Consumer staple companies came under pressure on Jun 5, after Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs on goods imported from the United States. The heat was primarily felt by packaged foods companies, as fears of a trade war fail to subside. Consumer staples have been suffering for a long time now with changing tastes and preferences of consumers and increased competition from online retail giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).In fact, the consumer staples sector fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, registering its worst performance since 1990. Trade war fears have added to the sector’s woes, as consumer staples continue to take a beating with retaliatory tariffs being imposed by the United States’ trade allies. That said, it needs to be seen how consumer staple companies fight back in the days to come.Mexico Tariffs Hit Consumer Staple Stocks The United States’ decision to impose 25% and 10% tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum followed by tariffs of another $60 billion saw China come up with retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. products that primarily hit the consumer staples sector.Moreover, the United States last week imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union (EU), Mexico and Canada. On Jun 5, Mexico announced that it will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products including pork, bourbon and some types of cheeses.This saw consumer staples stocks, in particular packaged food companies, taking a hit. Shares of Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) slid 2% and 1.8%, respectively. Also, shares of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  declined 0.1% each.Understandably, packaged food companies have reasons to worry with Mexico, one of United States’ biggest trade allies, now imposing retaliatory tariffs.Consumer Staples Suffer Longest DeclineConsumer staples stocks have been suffering for quite some time now, with the sector entering the longest monthly losing streak since November 2016. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples index declined 1.7% in May, registering its straight monthly fall. On a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 Consumer Staples index has declined 13.3%.Moreover, of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) was the second-worst performer in first-quarter 2018. The consumer staples sector didn’t have a good start to 2018, after having registered gains of more than 130% over a period of nine years. The sector has been under pressure owing to rising competition from online retailers and at the same time has been affected by rising commodity prices and transportation costs, and declining brand value.Packaged Food, Beverage, Tobacco Companies SufferChanging customer preference and inclination toward healthier options have seen a number of beverage, packaged foods and tobacco companies suffer. Year to date, shares of PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) have declined 15.1% and 5.3%, respectively. Similarly, shares of B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) have declined 20.3% and 18.4%, respectively, over the same time period.Tobacco companies too have been suffering with slower-than-expected adoption of alternate tobacco products in some markets and at the same time health-conscious people looking for healthier options. Shares of tobacco giants like Turning Point Brands, Inc. (TPB  -  Free Report) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) have declined 0.6% and 25.8%, respectively. Turning Point Brands carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bottom LineConsumer staples stocks have been considered a defensive bet, mainly because of its predictable growth rate and high dividends. However, a number of factors including changing consumer preference, declining brand value and stiff competition from online retailers are acting as tailwinds. Moreover, trade war fears have added to the woes, with countries like Mexico and China imposing tariffs on imported goods from the United States.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

270,CPB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Campbell Soup has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level is fairly below the highs for the stock, suggesting that this might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Campbell Soup has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 12.1, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Campbell Soup has a P/S ratio of about 1.3. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is a little below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Campbell Soup currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Campbell Soup a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.4, which is significantly lower than the industry average of 12.6. Clearly, CPB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Campbell Soup might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F. This gives CPB a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been bearish.  The current year and next have seen no estimates go higher in the past 30 days compared to six movements in the opposite direction.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current year estimate decreased 6.1% in the past month, while the next year estimate has decreased 10.5% over the same time frame. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Campbell Soup Company Price and Consensus Campbell Soup Company Price and Consensus | Campbell Soup Company QuoteCampbell Soup has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that while analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future, the stock’s growth story might be good over the long term. Thus, we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCampbell Soup is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 29%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past year, its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

271,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. However, sales came almost in line with the estimates.Further, shares of the company lost 10.8% in the pre-market trading as management trimmed its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. In the last three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 24.2%, wider than the industry’s fall of 9.2%. Q3 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of 70 cents per share increased 18.6% year over year and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents. Including one-time items, Campbell incurred loss per share of $1.31 per share compared to earnings of 58 cents in the year-ago quarter.Net sales of $2,125 million grew 14.7% and came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,128 million. The year-over-year improvement was owing to gains from buyouts of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods as well as currency tailwinds. Further, organic sales remained flat with year-ago quarter as declines in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division was compensated with gains from the Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh segments.Furthermore, the company’s adjusted gross margin contracted 3.9 percentage points to 32%. The decline was mainly due to cost inflation, escalated supply chain expenses and promotional spending as well as the dilutive effect from recent buyouts. This was somewhat negated by productivity improvements as well as gains from cost savings.Moreover, adjusted EBIT in the quarter was up 1% to $308 million. However, excluding the impact from the recent buyouts, adjusted EBIT fell mainly due to lower gross margin, partly offset by reduced adjusted administrative expenses and, adjusted marketing and selling costs. Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company Quote Segment AnalysisThe Latin America business is managed as part of the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment starting from fiscal 2018. Earlier, this division formed part of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Campbell reports its results under three segments namely, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh.Americas Simple Meals and Beverages: In third-quarter fiscal 2018, sales at the division rose 5% year over year to $1,010 million backed by gains from Pacific Foods buyout. However, the segment’s organic sales were down 2% mainly due to softness across Plum products, V8 Beverages and U.S. soup. Excluding gains from the Pacific Foods buyout, sales at U.S. soup dipped 1% on account of a drop in condensed soups, somewhat offset by broth and ready-to-serve soups sales.Global Biscuits and Snacks: Sales at this division surged 35% at $862 million. Excluding gains from the Snyder’s-Lance’s buyout and currency translations, organic sales grew 1% owing to strength in Pepperidge Farm snacks, representing growth in Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies.Campbell Fresh: Sales at this segment rose 1% to $251 million, mainly by gains from refrigerated soup. However, sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages remained flat with the year-ago period.FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $199 million, total debt of $9,843 million and total equity of $1,411 million. Additionally, the company generated $1,024 million as cash flow from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.Fiscal 2018 OutlookCampbell has completed the buyout of Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. in the reported quarter. This acquisition is likely to aid the company in fortifying its snacking brands’ portfolio, thus making it a snacking leader. However, it has been witnessing challenges related to the execution along with some external headwinds. Nevertheless, management has been considering its strategic plans and portfolio composition, which should enhance the company’s operating performance and boost shareholder value.Following the quarterly results, management trimmed its earnings forecast for fiscal 2018, while updated sales and adjusted EBIT views to include the effects from Snyder’s-Lance’s buyout. The company now projects sales growth to range from positive 10-11% compared with negative 1% to positive 1% guided earlier. Further, adjusted EBIT is expected to decline in the band of 6-8% compared with prior guidance of decrease in the range of 5-7%.Adjusted earnings are now envisioned in the band of $2.85-$2.90 per share, reflecting decline of 5-6% from fiscal 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $3.12, which is likely to witness a downward revision. Earlier, management projected earnings per share in the $3.10-$3.17 band, which reflected growth of 2-4% from last year.Campbell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking For Top-Ranked Stocks?

273,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 18, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23.5%. Though it reported a negative earnings surprise in three of the four trailing quarters, it delivered an average beat of 1.3%.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this consumer products company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 61 cents, reflecting an increase of 3.4% year over year. Earnings estimates for the quarter have declined in the past 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.14 billion, up about 15.6% from the year-ago quarter.Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteCampbell Soup has lagged the industry in the past month, reflecting a negative sentiment on the stock, ahead of the earnings release. The company’s shares have declined 5%, wider than the industry’s fall of 2.4%. The decline can be attributed to a volatile operating environment and a continued dismal performance at the company’s Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division.Factors at PlayPersistent challenges in the U.S. soup category and Campbell Fresh division have been weighing on the stock’s performance. Further, the company’s margins remain under pressure, owing to higher cost inflation, escalated supply-chain expenses and an adverse mix. Moreover, the company anticipates gross margin for fiscal 2018 to decline nearly 1 percentage point due to higher inflation and logistics costs as well as the impact of increased promotional-spending for soup. Backed by the soft gross margin forecast, the company projects adjusted EBIT to decline 5-7% compared with 2-4%, guided earlier.Further, Campbell Soup witnessed a 2% decline in organic sales in the fiscal second quarter, owing to lower volumes in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment due to the persistent challenges in U.S. soup category. Notably, U.S. Soup sales declined 7% on account of a drop in condensed soups as well as ready-to-serve soups. This decline was mainly due to Campbell Soup’s failure to reach an agreement with a key customer on a promotional approach for soup in fiscal 2018. Further, the company’s C-Fresh division results disappointed, driven by headwinds in the super-premium juice category.Campbell remains focused on getting the C-Fresh division back on growth track and solving its key customer issue, thereby expecting moderate soup sales in the second half of fiscal 2018. Entering the spring season, the company expects its initiatives to boost beverage results in the second half.  Further, the company’s solid focus on cost savings and core strategic imperatives are likely to drive growth in the long term. Despite efforts to improve these segments, the company anticipates sales growth to range from negative 1% to positive 1% for fiscal 2018.Further, Campbell is progressing well with its cost-saving plan as it raised the annualized savings target to $500 million, which is expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2020. It is making acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio and accelerate growth. Recently, Campbell completed the buyout of Snyder’s-Lance, Inc., which is likely to fortify its snacks portfolio.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that Campbell Soup Company is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

274,CPB,"Have you been paying attention to shares of The Chefs' Warehouse (CHEF  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.1% over the past month. CHEF hit a new 52-week high of $30.32 in the previous session. The Chefs' Warehouse has gained 37.3% since the start of the year compared to the -11% move for the Consumer Staples sector and the -11.2% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 9, 2018, The Chefs' Warehouse reported EPS of $0.03 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.1%.For the current fiscal year, The Chefs' Warehouse is expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share on $1.41 billion in revenues. This represents a 65.91% change in EPS on an 8.53% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.92 per share on $1.5 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 25.34% and 6.15%, respectively.Valuation MetricsThe Chefs' Warehouse may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for CHEF? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.The Chefs' Warehouse has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 38.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.5X versus its peer group's average of 12.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.75. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. Price and Consensus The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. Price and Consensus | The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, The Chefs' Warehouse currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if The Chefs' Warehouse fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though CHEF shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does The Chefs' Warehouse Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of The Chefs' Warehouse have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report), and Nestle SA (NSRGY  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 40% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CHEF, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

275,CPB,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Nomad Foods (NOMD  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10.6% over the past month. NOMD hit a new 52-week high of $17.80 in the previous session. Nomad Foods has gained 2.2% since the start of the year compared to the -11% move for the Consumer Staples sector and the -11.2% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 10, 2018, Nomad Foods reported EPS of $0.43 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.38 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.16%.For the current fiscal year, Nomad Foods is expected to post earnings of $1.4 per share on $2.55 billion in revenues. This represents a 23.89% change in EPS on a 15.7% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.52 per share on $2.65 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 8.1% and 3.82%, respectively.Valuation MetricsNomad Foods may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NOMD? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Nomad Foods has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 12.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 12.2X versus its peer group's average of 12.3X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Nomad Foods Limited Price and Consensus Nomad Foods Limited Price and Consensus | Nomad Foods Limited QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Nomad Foods currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Nomad Foods passes the test. Thus, it seems as though NOMD shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Nomad Foods Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Nomad Foods have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report), and Nestle SA (NSRGY  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 40% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NOMD, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

Successful integration activities of Moy Park buyout (closed in September 2017) primarily boosted Pilgrim's Pride’s European sales. Pilgrim's Pride Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pilgrim's Pride Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pilgrim's Pride Corporation Quote Costs/MarginsCost of sales in the reported quarter flared up 10.6% year over year to $2,459 million.

277,CPB,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

279,CPB,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term. So how about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

280,CPB,"The Fearless Girl facing the Manhattan financial district's famous Charging Bull near Wall Street will get a new permanent home by the end of this year in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Despite several criticism, the statue has become a tourist destination and a global symbol of female business prowess since its installation more than a year ago.About The Fearless GirlShe is a ponytailed, young, four-foot-tall bronze monument with fists on hips and chin held high as a symbol of empowerment. State Street Global Advisors at Bowling Green Park on Broadway Street originally installed the sculpture on the eve of International Women’s Day 2017. The Fearless Girl is a growing symbol for gender equality and the power of women in leadership. It spreads a message to encourage companies to recruit women to their board. The plaque at the statue’s feet reads “Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.”The ‘Fearless Girl’ is part of a campaign by State Street to encourage companies to add more women to their boards and to advertise SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE  -  Free Report), which comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership.Inside SHEThis ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that demonstrate greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector by tracking the SSGA Gender Diversity Index. Holding 168 stocks, it is moderately concentrated on the top firms as each account for less than 5.8% of assets. Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) are top three holdings. From a sector look, information technology takes the largest share at 22.2%, followed by healthcare (16.4%), consumer staples (13.1%) and consumer discretionary (12.0%). SHE has returned 10.2% over the past year versus the gain of 15.45% for the broad market fund (SPY  -  Free Report).Impact On Women-LeadershipOut of 700 companies in the United States, Britain and Australia that had no women serving on their boards, more than 150 companies have added a female director to their boards since the placement of the bronze girl statue, with another 34 pledging to do so. Currently, women make up 5% of CEOs in the Fortune 500 companies and 17% of the corporate board members among Fortune 500 companies.Today, a record number of women are in power this year. In the United States, 32 Fortune 500 CEOs are women, three women are in the Supreme Court, and three of the last eight U.S. Secretaries of State were women. Last year, 15 of 146 world leaders were women, eight of whom served as their country’s first female leaders. Some of the famous women leaders include Angela Merkel and Dilma Rousseff.In the corporate world, Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report); Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report); Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors (GM  -  Free Report); Angela Ahrendts, Senior Vice-President of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report); Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report); and Michele Buck, CEO of Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report) are leaders in their own right. Per several researches, companies led by women have a long history of outperformance.Bottom LinePlacing the Fearless Girl right next to the NYSE is the perfect metaphor to promote more companies to hire women to their boards, according to the State Street Global Advisors. With the move, the Fearless Girl will be more powerful standing alone outside NYSE than the her current home turf, which she shares with the Charging Bull. Hopefully, she will continue to stimulate the power of having women in leadership.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

281,CPB,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report), a global leader in spices and seasonings, has been setting quite a treat for investors lately. Apart from well-yielding buyouts, the company’s cost-containment measures and efficient product strategies have been driving performance. Moreover, benefits from the recent tax reforms have led management to undertake plans to improve wage structure and raise earnings view for fiscal 2018.Such aspects have aided shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to surge 8.2% in the past six months, while the industry declined 5.8% in the same time frame. That said, let’s take a closer look at some of the aforementioned drivers and see what hurdles the company has been facing, lately.

The buyout of the food division of RB Foods in August 2017, is the largest deal by the company till date. With iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Sauce and French's Mustard, RB Foods is likely to continue as an asset for McCormick’s spices portfolio. Prior to this, the company completed significant acquisitions, including Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA as well as Australia-based Botanical Food Company. Markedly, additional sales from buyouts of RB Foods and Enrico Giotti SpA drove sales by 12% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, benefiting performances of consumer and flavor solutions units.Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry such as Campbell Soups (CPB  -  Free Report), Kellog (K  -  Free Report) and Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) have been resorting to strategic buyouts to widen prospects.  Efforts for Containing CostsMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions amounted to $117 million in fiscal 2017, up from $109 million in fiscal 2016. Notably, cost savings aided in the improvement of the company’s gross and adjusted operating income margins during the first-quarter of fiscal 2018. This marked the company’s ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income margin expansion. The company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, wherein it plans to achieve savings of $100 million.Tax Cuts Aid Improving Wages & OutlookThe recent tax cuts have been a reason for joy to McCormick. Benefits from reduced taxes led management to rewarded employees with plans to provide bonuses and increase wage rates. Further, advantages from tax cuts led management to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Earnings are expected in the range of $4.85-$4.95, reflecting growth from the previous range of $4.80-$4.90. The raised outlook also takes into consideration the projected positive impact of nearly one percentage point from currency fluctuations.Can Savings Offset Cost Woes?McCormick has been concerned about escalating raw material costs along with increased brand marketing and freight expenses. Moreover, in fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits. McCormick is also increasing brand marketing expenses to drive sales.Nevertheless, we expect the aforementioned cost-related hurdles to be adequately cushioned by the company’s robust CCI program and efficient pricing strategies. Apart from these, management expects to continue reaping benefits from its acquisitions, product launches, expanded distribution network and brand marketing. With such positives, McCormick has plenty of reasons to stay encouraged and further raise investors’ optimism in the stock.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market.Click here to access these stocks>>

283,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) announced that it has restructured the company to resonate well with the fast changing food industry, apart from focusing more on its three growth strategies. Notably, the strategies are optimizing the value of its core units, including soup, simple meals, beverages and snacks portfolios; increasing health, food, beverages and snacks as well as pacing up distribution and latest business models.The latest restructuring mainly focuses on organizing the company’s core business functions under the new chief operating officer, Luca Mignini, who currently controls its Global Biscuits and Snacks division. Mignini is likely to lead the core businesses and administer the integration of Pacific Foods and Snyder’s-Lance into the company’s business, thus boosting growth across the entire business portfolio.Apart from directing the above operations, Mignini is expected to control the company’s meals and beverages portfolio, U.S. sales organization and the product development unit, within Research and Development worldwide.This strategic reorganization also includes the creation of a new accelerator unit to boost long-term growth in its faster-growing businesses including Campbell Fresh. Furthermore, the accelerator unit is expected to encompass Campbell’s existing digital and e-commerce business, a host of cross-functional teams as well as key capabilities and functions revolving around strategy, long-term innovation, distribution models and boost consumer experience. This unit is likely to aid the company to redesign the future of food by keeping up pace with an agile and vibrant operating business model.The unit is also expected to deeply analyze the consumer trends across its categories, marketing capabilities, consumers’ foresights, insights; build latest product platforms and models — including the company’s Science and Technology organization — and lead the creation and development of small brands and startups, besides identifying and capitalizing on external partnerships.Spanning across Campbell’s digital and e-commerce operations, the accelerator unit’s team is expected to continue supervising the enterprise e-commerce strategy, and expand digital marketing initiatives and opportunities. Also, the team will focus on aiding a turnaround for the Campbell Fresh division, which remained soft in recent quarters. Last quarter, the segment also witnessed headwinds in the super premium juice category. Consequently, the company projected moderate decline in soup sales for the second half of fiscal 2018.Moving ahead, the unit will also work on achieving improved growth rates for the packaged fresh category. Further, management remains on track to return the division’s CPG business to profitability by making innovations in the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages. While Campbell looks for a new chief acceleration officer to direct the newly-created unit, Ana Dominguez, president of Campbell Fresh, will oversee its operations.Meanwhile, management has made some leadership changes to promote the company’s entire strategy planning, development and measurement as well as accelerate growth of all its divisions.We believe that the strategic reorganization should help the company grab opportunities better and optimize the utilization of resources to maximize profitability. These changes also make the company’s business model more unified and simpler, which are likely to boost growth across all its segments, snacks and U.S. soup portfolios, in particular. Campbell closed trade at $43.48, reflecting a 0.6% upside yesterday.

284,CPB,"Wall Street and the White House are jittery as repercussions related to fears of a trade war with China, possibilities of three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year, and tech stock concerns regarding data privacy and antitrust risks continue to do the rounds. However, the Chinese government’s retaliation to the Trump administration’s levy of 25% tariffs on 1,300 imported goods from China topped the headlines.China’s president, Xi Jinping, recently levied up to 25% tariffs on 106 U.S. imports, including soybeans, cars, chemicals and more. With this, both countries are targeting about $50 billion tariffs on imports from each other.Signs of a U.S.-China trade war further became prominent with Trump’s intention to strike another $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. This has certainly sent shock waves across the entire global economy.The new tariffs framed by China's Ministry of Commerce are expected to hurt a host of U.S. industries, including consumer electronics, food, beverages, aircrafts and automobiles, among others. According to experts, the tariff is likely to be higher than anticipated, with the U.S. agricultural industry being the prime target.The tariffs will also affect meat-exporting companies, with the levy of 25% tariff on pork. Per sources, China is one of the largest markets for U.S. pork exports in terms of value and volume. Consequently, the hiked tariffs are expected to cause significant loss for China’s meat exporters and in turn, hurt their profitability.However, the effective date for the imposition of these tariffs has not been disclosed yet. While the United States stated that the tariffs will take effect after a public comment and consultation period lasting for about two months, China said that the imposition depends on Trump’s decision.Alleged intellectual property violations by Chinese companies led to a U.S. trade deficit of $504 billion with China, which sparked the trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies. To force changes in China’s intellectual properties practices, the Trump administration at first imposed a tariff of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports, particularly on steel and aluminum. In response, China retaliated by imposing tariffs worth about $3 billion on 128 American exports.Key U.S. Sectors at StakeAs is clear from the above discussion, the recently levied tariffs are likely to erode the profit margins of players in the Consumer Staples sector. This sector, which mainly comprises food, meat, beverages and agriculture stocks, is likely to be at risk after the imposition of the aforementioned tariffs.Generally, Consumer Staples stocks are considered most defensive, owing to their nature of fulfilling the basic necessities of daily lives. However, how these stocks will battle the current turmoil remains to be seen.Currently, Consumer Staples ranks among the top 50% of all Zacks sectors (8 of 16).Let’s take a closer look at some of the prominent players in Consumer Staples, highlighting their current position and ability to sail through the trade war scenario.Starting with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report), this leading food processing company remains on track with the accomplishments related to operational excellence and readiness program. Further, management remains encouraged to deliver growth through cost-saving efforts, enhanced capabilities, product innovations and global strength. Notably, the company has corn processing facilities in China and entered a joint development agreement with the China-based Qingdao Vland Biotech Group Co., Ltd to develop new enzymes for animal feed applications.  This exposure may call for troubles for the company if the trade-war intensifies. Nevertheless, the Illinois-based company sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has been witnessing rising demand across the Beef, Chicken and prepared foods segments. Moreover, its Prepared Foods category has been delivering solid growth in particular, courtesy of rising demand for protein-packed brands and synergies from the AdvancePierre’ buyout. However, the company continues to incur higher wage and freight costs due to tightening market conditions. Also, raw materials price volatility remains a threat. Though the US-China conflict should have little impact on the company at present due to its modest exposure in China, the war may stall its chances to expand in the Chinese market.Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), the major manufacturer and marketer of various meat and food products in the United States and international markets, carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company believes that marketing programs and elevated demand for on-trend branded products will continue to boost its revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, its near-term results are anticipated to improve on the back of the recently made acquisitions. However, its Jennie-O Turkey Store segment remains soft owing to excess meat stock in cold storage and fall in turkey prices. The company has a strong business in China and operates through exports, joint venture and licensing partnerships. Further, Hormel Foods is enhancing its global footprint with higher capital investments in China, which might be at stake due to improved tariffs.Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is progressing well with its cost savings plan. This is evident from the raised annualized savings target of $500 million. Also, the company remains keen on making acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio and boost growth. The company’s recent buyout of Snyder’s-Lance is likely to aid Campbell in fortifying its snacking brands’ portfolio, thus making it a snacking leader. Moreover, the company’s Kelsen brand has been delivering solid performance in China, which might be hampered due to the proposed changes in tariffs. Nevertheless, Campbell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report), the major producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages in the world, continues to gain from solid growth in underlying sales, persistent momentum at its focus categories and strength in Jack Daniels. This Zacks Rank #3 stock remains optimistic on growth at its premium American whiskey and tequila brands. Looking ahead, management sees higher growth potential in China as it accelerates investments in this area. However, any adverse changes to the US-China relations may stall the company’s aspirations to grow in the region.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

285,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) has completed the buyout of Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. for a total cash outlay of roughly $6.1 billion or $50 per share. This will be part of the company’s Global Biscuits and Snacks segment including the Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen businesses.In order to attain cost synergies and revenue opportunities better, management will integrate with the Pepperidge Farm, which together will form Campbell Snacks, a unified snacking firm in the United States. This acquisition is likely to aid Campbell in fortifying its snacking brands’ portfolio, thus making it a snacking leader.As part of Campbell’s strategic plan, this buyout creates a $10-billion entity with roughly 50% of the company’s annual net sales in the faster-growing snacks unit. Notably, the addition of Snyder’s-Lance is anticipated to realize nearly $170 million as cost synergies by the end of fiscal 2022. Further, the integration is expected to generate about $125 million from Snyder’s-Lance’s current cost-transformation program.The combined snacking portfolio is likely to offer a broad range of exclusive better-for-you snacks comprising certain recognized brands like Goldfish, Milano, Snyder’s of Hanover, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Lance, Cape Cod, Kettle Brand, KETTLE chips, Emerald and Late July.Additionally, Campbell has made a systematic way for both companies to rapidly adopt the major learnings and practices. The buyer will also unite the key control objectives together with supply chain and quality as well as finance.With the Snyder’s-Lance consolidation, management brought to effect some leadership changes to effectively manage the newly-formed Campbell Snacks unit and also to focus on the optimization of its U.S. snacks business. Those at the company’s helm are likely to concentrate on innovation and brand building across snacks business, end-to-end manufacturing quality, value capture and acceleration of business strategy among others.In fiscal 2017, Campbell's global baked snacks product unit, consisting of Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen businesses, grossed nearly $2.5 billion as net sales. Following the accretion of Snyder’s-Lance, snacking is likely to contribute about 47% to the company’s overall net sales annually as compared to the 32%, logged earlier. Further, the company’s soup portfolio will contribute roughly 26% to net sales in a year. Snyder’s-Lance generated net sales of $2.2 billion in 2017.Campbell has long been making acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio and expedite business growth. Prior to the aforesaid buyout, the company acquired a leading organic broth and soup producer named Pacific Foods, in a drive to widen its foothold in the fast-growing organic food space. Some other notable acquisitions are Garden Fresh Gourmet, Bolthouse Farms, the organic baby-food firm, Plum and the biscuit firm, Kelsen. Stock PerformanceFollowing the buyout news, shares of the Camden-based company did not swing much. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 1.4% in the past month, though narrower than the industry’s decline of 4.5%. Want Top-Ranked Stocks From the Same Industry?

286,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is progressing well on its cost-savings plan as is evident from the annualized savings target of $500 million, to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2020. Moreover, cost-saving efforts along with other initiatives helped the company to deliver earnings beat in second-quarter fiscal 2018, after three straight misses. Sales returned to positive surprise after lagging estimates in the past four quarters.However, these initiatives were not enough to counter the stock’s dismal performance. Shares of the company have lost 13.5% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 8.7%. So let’s see whether this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock will be able to regain momentum and is apt for your portfolio on the basis of the strategic endeavors. Campbell Poised to Grow on Cost-Savings PlanAs mentioned earlier, Campbell is well on track with its cost savings plan, which was announced in fiscal 2015. In fact, the company’s strategy of concentrating on supply chain efficiencies along with curtailing costs and reinvesting part of these savings in areas with high growth potential is likely to drive growth. In the recently-reported quarter, it generated savings of $20 million, thereby bringing the program-to-date savings to $365 million. Consequently, Campbell expects cost savings program to deliver $75-$85 million of savings in fiscal 2018, which is incremental to the productivity gains from ongoing supply chain initiatives. Also, its prudent investment and strategic efforts toward product innovation and brand building are likely to boost profitability.Strategic Acquisitions In an attempt to enhance its brand portfolio and accelerate future growth, Campbell remains keen on making acquisitions. Of late, the company acquired leading organic broth and soup producer, Pacific Foods, in a drive to expand in the fast-growing organic food space. This marks the company’s fifth buyout in the last five years. Moreover, it unveiled plans to purchase Snyder’s-Lance, Inc., which is anticipated to substantially enhance the company’s snacking business. Also, this buyout will be the largest in Campbell’s history. Following the completion of the Snyder’s-Lance buyout, management is expected to shift its portfolio toward faster-growing categories, and snacking will contribute roughly 46% to the company’s overall annual net sales.Robust Q2 Earnings & Outlook Underscore StrengthRecently, Campbell reported solid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates and improved year over year. Also, management updated its fiscal 2018 outlook to include the effects of the Pacific Foods buyout as well as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted earnings are now envisioned in the band of $3.10-$3.17 per share, representing increase of 2-4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $3.10, up 5 cents in the last 30 days.Headwinds Pulling Campbell’s Shares DownDespite these positives, Campbell has been struggling due to weak margins on account of higher cost inflation, escalated supply chain expenses and adverse mix. For fiscal 2018, the company expects gross margin to contract nearly 1 percentage point on higher inflation and logistics costs as well as the cost impact of increased soup promotional spending.Furthermore, Campbell witnessed soft organic sales in the fiscal second quarter. This can be attributed to lower volumes in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment owing to the persistent challenges in U.S. soup category. The U.S. Soup sales decline in the quarter was due to a drop in condensed and ready-to-serve soups. Also, Campbell’s failure to reach an agreement with a key customer on a promotional approach for soup in fiscal 2018, contributed to the decline. Additionally, the company’s C-Fresh division disappointed owing to headwinds in the super premium juice category.All said, we expect Campbell’s robust strategies to offset these concerns. Also, as the company is working on clearing the terms with the aforesaid customer, it expects sales declines in the U.S. soup category to be moderate in the second half of fiscal 2018.Want Solid Picks in the Same Industry?

287,CPB,"SUPERVALU INC.’s (SVU  -  Free Report) retail segment performance has long been eclipsed by adverse industry conditions, leading to store closures and decline in identical store sales. Moreover, in an effort to offload underperforming stores from the retail segment, the company recently announced selling off several of its Farm Fresh stores. That said, the company has lately been focused on strengthening its wholesale business and has undertaken several initiatives to this end.Retail Segment Crumbling DownWhile consumer inclination toward online shopping has been revolutionizing the e-commerce realm, the changing retail landscape has hit traditional stores hard. Additionally, in an effort to attract more shoppers to the stores, retailers have been engaging in intense promotional activities and price wars, further aggravating the competitive scenario and making survival a remote possibility for the weak.Notably, retail stores of SUPERVALU have also fallen victim to such downturns and have been gravely underperforming, causing the company to resort to store closures. Owing to these hurdles, the company’s identical store sales in the retail segment have declined over the past 11 quarters. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, identical store sales dropped 3.5%, which, along with store closures, dragged down net sales at the Retail unit by 4.1%. Also, the segment incurred adjusted operating loss of $3 million, while retail gross margin also contracted due to soft sales and high promotions. Unfortunately, management expects the retail segment to continue bearing the brunt of these headwinds in fiscal 2018 as well.Continuing with the company’s endeavors to cut down retail stores, SUPERVALU has entered into definitive agreements with Mid-Atlantic Division of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report); Harris Teeter and Food Lion to sell 21 of its Farm Fresh Food & Pharmacy stores, in a transaction worth nearly $43 million. The deal is expected to close in May 2018, subject to certain closing conditions. Looking back, during fiscal 2016, the company sold nearly 1,350 Save-A-Lot stores. The company is expected to undertake more Farm Fresh store closures in the near future, which is likely to pull down the retail segment’s performance even further.Moreover, such challenges have taken a toll on investors’ sentiments upon the stock. Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have plunged 36.9% in the past year, considerably wider than the industry’s decline of 13.2%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Focus on Wholesale BusinessWhile on one side SUPERVALU has been shuttering its retail stores, the company has also been undertaking endeavors to fortify its foothold in the wholesale arena. This move is backed by the motive of transforming the company’s business into a wholesale operational model. Thus, it is on track to develop wholesale operations, primarily through acquisitions. In this regard, the company concluded the buyout of Associated Grocers of Florida in the beginning of the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, while it acquired Unified Grocers in June 2017. Notably, Unified Grocers contributed sales worth about $860 million to SUPERVALU’s Wholesale business during the fiscal third quarter and the company remains on track to generate targeted synergies from this buyout. Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry, such as Campbell Soups (CPB  -  Free Report) and Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report), have been resorting to strategic buyouts and widening their growth prospects.  Apart from this, the company also has supply agreements with retailers like America’s Food Basket, which is expected to fuel sales growth at this segment. Also, management remains committed toward enhancing operating efficiency, reducing costs and optimizing distribution channels, information technology and logistics, which will lift margins.Backed by such dedicated growth efforts, sales from this segment grew 52% year over year to $2,888 million in the fiscal third quarter, representing roughly 73% of the company’s total revenues. All said, the company remains dedicated toward making investments in its Wholesale business to boost future growth.Wrapping it UpBy exiting from Farm Fresh and other retail banners, SUPERVALU has been able to allocate more resources toward the strategic expansion of its wholesale business. Given the fact that the retail segment has been going down in shambles, thanks to industry-wide headwinds, the company’s move to strengthen its wholesale business seems quite rational and is expected to uplift its performance in the forthcoming periods.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

288,CPB,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 8.6% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CPB due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Campbell Beats Q2 Earnings & Sales EstimatesCampbell Soup Company posted second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise after three consecutive earnings misses while sales returned to positive after four straight misses.Management stated that it was a tough quarter on account of persistent challenges in the U.S. soup category as well as Campbell Fresh division. In fact, this segment delivered lower-than-expected results due to difficulties in the super premium juice category.Adjusted earnings of $1.00 per share increased 9.9% year over year and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. Including one-time items, Campbell reported earnings of 95 cents per share that was significantly up from 33 cents in the year-ago quarter.Net sales of $2,180 million inched up 0.4% and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,174 million. However, organic sales dipped 2% on account of lower volumes mainly in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Further, the company’s adjusted gross margin contracted 2.2 percentage points to 35.2%. The decline was mainly due to cost inflation, escalated supply chain expenses and adverse mix, somewhat negated by productivity improvements as well as gains from cost savings.Moreover, adjusted EBIT in the quarter was down 4% to $402 million on lower gross margin, compensated with lower marketing and selling costs as well as a rise in other income.Segment AnalysisThe Latin America business is managed as part of the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment starting from fiscal 2018. Earlier, this formed part of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Campbell reports its results under three segments namely, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh.Americas Simple Meals and Beverages: In second-quarter fiscal 2018, sales at the division dipped 2% year over year to $1,196 million. Also, the segment’s organic sales were down 4% mainly due to softness in V8 Beverages and soup sales, somewhat mitigated by benefits in the Canada retail business. Excluding gains from the Pacific Foods buyout, sales at the U.S. soup decreased 7% on account of a drop in condensed soups as well as ready-to-serve soups. However, broth sales were comparable to last year.Global Biscuits and Snacks: Sales at this division rose 4% at $726 million. Excluding the impact of currency tailwinds, organic sales grew 3% backed by Pepperidge Farm snacks strength representing growth in Goldfish crackers, cookies and benefits from Kelsen cookies in China. Further, Arnott’s biscuits’ sales were comparable to the previous year, excluding the positive effect from currency.Campbell Fresh: Sales at this segment dipped 1% to $257 million mainly on lower sales at Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages.FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $196 million, long-term debt of $2,247 million and total equity of $1,949 million. Additionally, the company generated $660 million as cash flow from operations, in the first six months of fiscal 2018.Other DevelopmentsIn the quarter under review, management has completed the buyout of Pacific Foods to widen its foothold in the organic soup and broth categories. Further, it agreed to buy the leading snacks maker — Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. — which is likely to strengthen Campbell Soup’s portfolio of snacking brands, thus making it a snacking leader.Meanwhile, Campbell Soup remains on track with its multi-year cost-savings initiative as it achieved $20 million of savings in the fiscal second quarter, bringing the entire program-to-date savings to $365 million. Furthermore, the company has raised the annualized savings target from $450 million to $500 million, which is expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2020.Fiscal 2018 OutlookCampbell remains focused on getting its C-Fresh division back on growth track and solving its key customer issue, thereby expecting moderate soup sales in the second half of fiscal 2018. Going into the spring season, the company expects its initiatives to boost beverage results in the second half.  Further, its solid focus on cost savings and core strategic imperatives are likely to drive growth in the long term.Management updated its outlook for fiscal 2018 to include the effects of the Pacific Foods buyout as well as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

289,CPB,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) is offering investors a treat, courtesy of its spectacular earnings and sales history backed by well-chalked buyouts, robust savings efforts and effective marketing policies.Evidently, shares of this seasonings, spices and specialty foods giant have returned 12.4% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.2%. In fact, the company’s shares recently hit a new 52-week high of $111.46 during the trading session on Mar 12, eventually closing at $110.69.Let’s take a closer look at the factors driving the company’s impressive performance and see if it can add new strides to its growth story in the forthcoming periods.Acquisitions: A Vital Growth DriverMcCormick has been strengthening its presence through acquisitions to expand its portfolio. Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry such as Campbell Soups (CPB  -  Free Report), Kellog (K  -  Free Report) and Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) have been resorting to strategic buyouts and widen their prospects.  In fact, McCormick’s acquisition of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc (RB Foods) in August 2017, is the largest deal till date. The deal has enabled the addition of iconic brands to McCormick’s portfolio, thereby positioning the company in the leading U.S. condiments category.In the past, the company has made significant acquisitions, including that of Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA (Dec 2016) and Australia-based Botanical Food Company (April 2016). Markedly, additional sales from buyouts of RB Foods, Giotti and Gourmet Garden contributed 6% to the company’s constant currency sales growth in fiscal 2017. Also, management expects additional sales from RB Foods to contribute 8% to fiscal 2018 sales growth.Cost-Saving EffortsMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. The program has enabled the company to increase investments, which lead to higher sales and profits. Notably, cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $117 million in fiscal 2017, up from $109 million in fiscal 2016. McCormick is on track with its four-year targeted savings of around $400 million by November 2019. Notably, cost savings from CCI helped the company deliver double-digit adjusted operating income growth in the fourth quarter. The adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points (bps), marking the eighth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Further, gross margin increased 180 bps in the fourth quarter and is likely to expand in a range of 150-20 basis points in fiscal 2018. The company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, wherein it plans to achieve cost savings of $100 million.    Innovation & Inclination Toward Healthy Food OfferingsMcCormick regularly enhances products through innovation to stay competitive and tap the evolving demand for new flavors, spices and herbs. Health and wellness continues to bolster the innovation agenda. The company is planning to offer innovative flavors in breakfast platform and ready-to-serve gravies. McCormick is also shaping up its portfolio with gluten-free, non-GMO and organic products to cater to the evolving needs of consumers. In 2016, the company renovated its core products, with non-GMO labeling on everyday spices and seasonings.Escalated Costs a WorryMcCormick continues to incur higher raw material costs and witnesses increased brand marketing and freight expenses. Rising costs affected the company’s performance in the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits. Further, McCormick is also planning to increase brand marketing expenses to drive sales.Wrapping it UpAlthough McCormick has been struggling against escalated expenses, we expect such downturns to be sufficiently cushioned by the company’s well-planned savings and efficiency building initiatives. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s rich portfolio of iconic brands combined with sustained efforts keeps it well positioned to achieve greater highs in the forthcoming periodsYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

290,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise after three consecutive earnings misses while sales returned to positive after four straight misses.However, shares of the company have lost nearly 3.4% in the pre-market trading as management stated that it was a dismal quarter on account of persistent challenges in the U.S. soup category as well as Campbell Fresh division. In fact, this segment delivered lower-than-expected results due to difficulties in the super premium juice category.In the last three months, Campbell’s shares have declined 4.1% against the industry’s gain of 0.3%.Q2 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of $1.00 per share increased 9.9% year over year and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents.

However, organic sales dipped 2% on account of lower volumes mainly in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Further, the company’s adjusted gross margin contracted 2.2 percentage points to 35.2%. The decline was mainly due to cost inflation, escalated supply chain expenses and adverse mix, somewhat negated by productivity improvements as well as gains from cost savings. Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteMoreover, adjusted EBIT in the quarter was down 4% to $402 million on lower gross margin, compensated with lower marketing and selling costs as well as a rise in other income.Segment AnalysisThe Latin America business is managed as part of the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment starting from fiscal 2018. Earlier, this formed part of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Campbell reports its results under three segments namely, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh.Americas Simple Meals and Beverages: In second-quarter fiscal 2018, sales at the division dipped 2% year over year to $1,196 million. Also, the segment’s organic sales were down 4% mainly due to softness in V8 Beverages and soup sales, somewhat mitigated by benefits in the Canada retail business. Excluding gains from the Pacific Foods buyout, sales at the U.S. soup decreased 7% on account of a drop in condensed soups as well as ready-to-serve soups. However, broth sales were comparable to last year.Global Biscuits and Snacks: Sales at this division rose 4% at $726 million. Excluding the impact of currency tailwinds, organic sales grew 3% backed by Pepperidge Farm snacks strength representing growth in Goldfish crackers, cookies and benefits from Kelsen cookies in China. Further, Arnott’s biscuits’ sales were comparable to the previous year, excluding the positive effect from currency.Campbell Fresh: Sales at this segment dipped 1% to $257 million mainly on lower sales at Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages.FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $196 million, long-term debt of $2,247 million and total equity of $1,949 million. Additionally, the company generated $660 million as cash flow from operations, in the first six months of fiscal 2018.Other DevelopmentsIn the quarter under review, management has completed the buyout of Pacific Foods to widen its foothold in the organic soup and broth categories. Further, it agreed to buy the leading snacks maker — Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. — which is likely to strengthen Campbell Soup’s portfolio of snacking brands, thus making it a snacking leader.Meanwhile, Campbell Soup remains on track with its multi-year cost-savings initiative as it achieved $20 million of savings in the fiscal second quarter, bringing the entire program-to-date savings to $365 million. Furthermore, the company has raised the annualized savings target from $450 million to $500 million, which is expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2020.Fiscal 2018 OutlookCampbell remains focused on getting its C-Fresh division back on growth track and solving its key customer issue, thereby expecting moderate soup sales in the second half of fiscal 2018. Going into the spring season, the company expects its initiatives to boost beverage results in the second half.  Further, its solid focus on cost savings and core strategic imperatives are likely to drive growth in the long term.Management updated its outlook for fiscal 2018 to include the effects of the Pacific Foods buyout as well as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The company projects sales growth to range from negative 1% to positive 1%. Also, adjusted EBIT is expected to decline in the band of negative 7% to negative 5%. Adjusted earnings are envisioned in the band of $3.10-$3.17 per share, representing increase of 2-4%.

292,CPB,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. DPS is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14, before the market opens.Notably, Dr Pepper Snapple will be acquired by coffee-maker Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. in the second quarter of 2018.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%. Moreover, Dr Pepper Snapple surpassed earnings expectations in only one of the last four quarters, the average negative surprise being 0.6%.Let us analyze a few other factors that might affect Q4 results:Sluggish carbonated beverages volume trends have been hurting carbonated beverages category growth for quite some time. Cross-category competition as well as growing health and wellness consciousness are also denting the category. The diet drinks are also under pressure due to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.To fight the decline in volume trends, the company is trying to diversify by introducing healthier beverage options. The acquisition of Bai Brands indicates the company’s efforts to diversify beyond carbonated soft drinks.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Packaged Beverages segment sales (accounting for more than 73% of total revenues) will rise 5.7% in the quarter. Last quarter, segment sales increased 3% on favorable product and package mix.Beverage Concentrates segment revenues were up 3% year over year in the third quarter on an increase in price and shipments of concentrate and lower discounts. In the fourth quarter, revenues will grow 3.6% year over year, per the consensus estimate.Also, Latin America Beverages segment revenues will likely be up 11.1% in the to-be-reported quarter. Revenues increased 5% in the prior quarter owing to a 2% rise in sales volumes and favorable pricing.Overall, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.77 billion, reflecting a 5.4% increase from a year ago.This apart, the company’s Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) program to reduce inventory and storage costs as well as improve cash flows, looks impressive. The cash can be returned to shareholders via dividends and re-invested in the business to boost the top line.Which Way Are Estimates Trending?A look at estimate revisions lends us an idea of analyst’s expectations right before a company’s earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share declined by a cent in the past 60 days to $1.17. However, this reflects a year-over-year increase of 12.5%.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts.Dr Pepper Snapple has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Dr Pepper is 0.04%.

293,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 16, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.4%. However, it pulled off a negative earnings surprise in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average miss of 3.7%.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors minds’ is that whether this consumer products company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.

The company’s shares have improved 0.4% against the industry’s decline of 4.6%. However, the stock has been showing a declining trend , 27.9% in the past year mainly due to a volatile operating environment and continued dismal performance at the company’s Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division.Campbell Soup Company Price and Consensus  Campbell Soup Company Price and Consensus | Campbell Soup Company QuoteFactors at PlayCampbell Soup is striving to revive its top line, which has not witnessed year-over-year growth for quite some time. Also, revenues have missed the consensus mark for four straight quarters now. The underperformance was due to a volatile operating environment along with intense competition and fast evolving retail landscape.The volatile operating environment is characterized by a rapidly evolving retail sector and increased competition that has significantly weighed on the top line. Further, the bottom line remains strained by rise in cost inflation and higher carrot costs that have hurt the company’s Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division. Additionally, the increase in transportation and logistics costs owing to the recent hurricanes impacted earnings in the first quarter.Given a tough operating environment, the company trimmed its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 while sales growth forecast remains intact to range from negative 2% to flat. Adjusted earnings per share are now envisioned in the $2.95-$3.02 range, representing a decline of 1-3%. Earlier, the metric was expected to be $3.04-$3.11, reflecting growth range of flat to increase of 2%.However, Campbell remains focused on getting its C-Fresh division back on growth track.

294,CPB,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell.The company has been witnessing top-line weakness over the last couple of years, primarily due to lower demand in North America. The food industry in the region is experiencing changes in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food.Business in North America WeakThe North America business accounts for about 68% of Kellogg’s total revenues. Hence it is evident that the revenue generated from this segment largely impacts the overall revenues of the company. The segment is further categorized into U.S. Morning Foods, U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty and North America Other.In the prior quarter, Kellogg’s total North America sales declined 1.6% year over year to $2.18 billion, owing to the exit from its U.S. Snacks segment's Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system and continued consumption softness in U.S. cereal in traditional retail channels. Moreover, in the first nine months of 2017, sales declined 2.8% from the prior-year period. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America segment revenues is pegged at $2.06 billion, implying a 3.2% decline.North America Business by SegmentU.S. Morning Foods:  Kellogg’s mainstay U.S. cereal business, which accounts for 40-45% of sales, has been performing poorly for quite some time now. Lower demand for cereals due to competitive pressure from other breakfast alternatives, including yogurt, eggs, bread and peanut butter, has been hurting category growth. In the prior quarter, revenues slipped 3% and declined 5.3% in the first nine months. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter, with revenues likely to decline 3.4% per the consensus estimate.U.S. Snacks: This business has been struggling since 2013 due to weak volumes. In the prior quarter, sales declined 4.5% from the year-ago level due to reduced merchandising and SKU rationalization. Also, in the first nine months of 2017, the segment’s net sales dropped 3.6% year over year. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with revenues likely to decline 8.1% per the consensus estimate.U.S. Specialty: This segment’s sales rose 1.9% in the prior quarter, marking the ninth straight quarter of sales growth, given strength in the convenience and foodservice channels, such as K-12 schools. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Specialty segment revenues is pegged at $286 million, implying a 1.1% increase.North America Other: Segmental revenues grew 4.4% in the prior quarter on contribution from frozen foods. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with revenues likely to increase 3.2% per the consensus estimate.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.11 billion indicates a 0.4% uptick on a year-over-year basis. In the first nine months of 2017, net sales declined 2% (down 3.4% organically) with volumes down 4.1% as a result of soft consumption trends across most categories during the period.Kellogg Company Revenue (TTM)  Kellogg Company Revenue (TTM) | Kellogg Company Quote Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation. Also, revenues are expected to benefit from Pringles’ improved performance in Europe, the Parati acquisition in Brazil, better shipments and improvement in pricing and mix in Mexico and Australia.Earnings increased 9.4% year over year in the prior quarter and surpassed the consensus estimate by 12.9%. Also, Kellogg’s surpassed earnings in all of the past four quarter, the average beat being 7.9%. Notably, the consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 96 cents, reflecting a 4.4% year-over-year increase (read more: Kellogg Q4 Earnings: What's in Store for the Stock?).Bottom LineThe decelerating performance at the North American segment will likely continue in the quarter. Nevertheless, cost-saving initiatives as well as higher demand for frozen foods and Kashi snacks will likely help the company reverse the industry-wide soft consumption trend for packaged food items.Zacks Rank & & Upcoming Peer ReleasesKellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

295,CPB,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading beauty company will be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Last quarter, it delivered a positive surprise of 42.9%. However, the company has a mixed record of surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings miss of 9.4%.Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coty Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Strategic Buyouts & Initiatives to Drive Coty in Q2Coty has been making several strategic acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio, which have been augmenting its top line. Notably, the company’s top line surged more than 100% year over year in the previous quarter driven by contributions from the P&G Beauty business buyout. Contributions from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique also aided sales growth. In this regard, the company also concluded the buyout of its unique international license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare recently, which should further boost its performance.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2,473 million reflects growth of 7.7% from the year-ago reported figure.Further, Coty holds a strong position in fragrances and color cosmetics, and has a solid regional presence in the skin & body care. Also, management keeps on introducing new products in response to shifting consumer preferences, and market new and established products through strategic advertising and merchandising. In this regard, the company’s major introductions of Gucci Bloom and Tiffany’s debut fragrance in the fiscal first quarter are noteworthy. It also launched new campaigns for HUGO BOSS and Marc Jacobs Daisy in the same time period.Additionally, Coty is boosting its end-to-end digital transformation efforts including e-commerce across its divisions and regions. To this end, the company is making progress with COVERGIRL brand through its Custom Blend app, which helps customers to take a digital, social and influencer-led go-to-market approach and personalize and customize it as per desire.Coty also remains committed toward enhancing its cost structure as well. This is quite evident from the company’s year-over-year growth in gross margin for four straight quarters now.Possible Deterrents That Might Impact the QuarterHowever, Coty’s Consumer Beauty segment has been sluggish for the past few quarters. It has been struggling due to underlying challenges in North America, changing consumers’ preferences and a competitive environment. Evidently, organic sales at this segment tumbled 8% in the first quarter on account of persistent softness in the global mass beauty market along with weakness in some brands like retail hair. Though the company is working toward improving the segment, the recovery is likely to take time. This remains a concern for Coty’s upcoming performance.Analysts polled by Zacks expect earnings of 24 cents per share for the impending quarter. Though the consensus estimate has been stable in the past 30 days, it reflects a decline of 20% from the year-ago quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Nevertheless, our proven model shows that Coty is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Coty has an Earnings ESP of +1.99% and a Zacks Rank #3, making us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some other companies which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat.United Natural Foods, Inc.

296,CPB,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this apparel manufacturer and designer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Hanesbrands has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.Hanesbrands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hanesbrands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. Quote International Strength & Focus on Buyouts Remain DriversHanesbrands has been delivering top and bottom-line growth annually for more than a year now. Hanesbrands has mainly been gaining from its focus on buyouts and strength in its international division. These factors also fueled the company in third-quarter 2017, wherein Hanesbrands organic sales growth for the first time in eight quarters. This, in turn was backed by solid International sales that represented nearly 31% of the company’s top line.International sales were fueled by strength in Hanes Europe Innerwear; Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia, with global Champion sales growing 16% in the quarter. Notably, sales at the International segment jumped 14% on a currency neutral basis. Apart from the aforementioned factors, extensive online sales growth also bolstered sales improvement at the segment. Management expects the fourth quarter to mark another quarter of organic sales growth. Also, we expect the International segment to continue being a major driver in the fourth quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for International sales is pegged at $551 million, representing a 9.1% rise from the year-ago period.While these factors are likely to drive the top line, focus on Project Booster program should help the company generate cost savings and aid the bottom line. Notably, by 2019, this project is anticipated to produce nearly $150 million of annualized cost savings, out of which roughly $50 million will be reinvested in targeted growth avenues.Factors Raising ConcernsHowever, a tough retail landscape has been hurting Hanesbrands’ brick-and-mortar performance. Evidently, this marred Hanesbrands’ domestic sales in the quarter. Further, the company’s Innerwear segment has been delivering soft results for a while now on account of soft brick-and-mortar performance stemming from sluggish traffic. In third-quarter 2017, sales at this unit declined 5.2% in the quarter to $644.1 million, as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape.Management expects the soft retail U.S. trends to linger in 2017, which raises concerns over its fourth-quarter performance. Incidentally, for the fourth quarter, the consensus mark for Innerwear sales stands at $594 million, down 2.8% from the year-ago period.  Also, the fourth quarter is likely to be impacted by additional marketing investments; the recently announced buyout of Alternative Apparel and effects of Sears Canada bankruptcy.Q4 Expectations in NumbersConsidering all factors, the company projects fourth-quarter net sales in a band of $1.63 billion to $1.65 billion, with the mid-point depicting an increase of nearly 3% on an organic basis. This outlook is based on a conservative view for the U.S. sales landscape; sales of roughly $15 million expected from Alternative Apparel and negative effects from Sears Canada bankruptcy. Adjusted earnings are envisioned in a band of 51 cents to 53 cents, while GAAP earnings per share are projected to range from 47-49 cents.The earnings estimate (both GAAP and adjusted) includes 5 cents from higher marketing investment, greater mix of International sales and the expected adverse impact from Sears Canada bankruptcy somewhat negated by greater-than-expected buyout synergies.  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 53 cents, which is in line with the year-ago period. This estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,631 million, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclude that Hanesbrands is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

297,CPB,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this major tobacco player will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Unfortunately, Phillip Morris has lagged earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average miss of 5.4%.Philip Morris International Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Philip Morris International Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteHowever, the company is undertaking solid efforts to expand in the reduced risk products space, given the stringent regulations on tobacco products and consumers becoming more health conscious. Thus, let’s see if the company can reverse the dismal trend this time.Factors at PlayPhilip Morris has been bearing the brunt of lower cigarette volumes, which can be largely accountable to regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing, anti-smoking campaigns and higher excise duties. Apart from this, rising health consciousness among consumers also resulted in lower cigarette consumption globally. Together, these factors have been weighing on cigarette industry volumes. Incidentally, Philip Morris’ net revenues during third-quarter 2017 were hurt by 3.6% in combustible products. Total shipment volumes in this category also fell 4.1%. As a result, total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume dipped 0.5%.To make matters worse, the court recently issued an order which guides cigarette companies to put up self-critical advertisements circulated through television, newspapers, social media and store displays. Such headwinds plaguing the tobacco industry remain a concern for Philip Morris’ combustible products category performance. Well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter cigarette volumes is currently pegged at $207 million.Reduced Risk Products & Pricing – Major Growth DriversGiven the aforementioned industry conditions, Philip Morris diverted its attention to reduced risk products (RRPs) to propel growth. Evidently, Philip Morris launched the iQOS (in 2014), a smokeless cigarette, in approximately 31 markets globally and catered to more than 3.7 million consumers globally, excluding the United States. The company expects to gain from increased volumes in reduced risk tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, HeatSticks and iQOS products. Philip Morris has also been making several investments to expand the capacity of its heated tobacco products.Thanks to the growing popularity of such products, Philip Morris generated revenues worth $947 million from RRPs in third-quarter 2017, up from $212 million in the year-ago period. Also, revenues from RRPS, along with strong pricing more than offset soft cigarette volumes, helping Phillip Morris deliver year-over-year top and bottom-line growth in the third quarter. While, revenues declined in Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA), the same increased across Asia, and Latin America & Canada — largely fueled by greater revenues from RRPs. The consensus mark for net sales in Asia and Latin America & Canada is $6,648 million and $2,662 million, up from $5,517 million and $2,571 million, respectively.In fact, the company’s overall sales have been rising annually for more than a year now on the back of such efforts. Also, Phillip Morris enjoys a strong pricing power, which helps it maintain margins at the desired level. Though industry headwinds and unfavorable currency fluctuations remain the major killjoys for Phillip Morris, we expect the aforementioned growth initiatives to continue driving the company in the quarter to be reported.Q4 Estimates as a WholeThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.36, which represents nearly 24% growth from the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,372 million, up 20.1% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Philip Morrisis likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

298,CPB,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this major food company will be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6%.Let’s now take a look at how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence This QuarterTyson Foods has been benefiting from its strategic buyouts, focus on protein-packed brands and nutritious products as well as significant geographical foothold. Impressively, the company witnessed major sales from the markets of Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Middle East, South Korea and Taiwan. Also, the company’s focus on strengthening protein-packed brands portfolio is noteworthy. This is apparent from the recent investment in the food-tech startup, Memphis Meats, which is anticipated to expand Tyson Foods’ protein-rich offerings.Last quarter, management announced a Financial Fitness Program that is expected to enhance operating efficiency in the forthcoming periods. In fiscal 2018, the company plans to test line-up of meal kits and add more products to Hillshire snacking. All these initiatives are likely to drive growth in the first quarter.As a result, Tyson Foods’ shares have gained 18% in a year, rallying ahead of the industry’s growth of 13.7%.Meanwhile, we expect Tyson Foods to continue gaining from rise in demand at the chicken and the beef segments. Also, the company’s prepared foods category has been depicting solid growth owing to rising demand for protein-packed brands and synergies from the AdvancePierre’s buyout. Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at the chicken and the beef segments are currently pegged at $2,876 million and $3,671 million, respectively, up 6.3% and 4.1% year over year. Further, the consensus estimate for sales of $2,109 million from the prepared foods division is likely to witness growth of 11.3%. Similarly, the sales estimate of $1,284 million for the company’s Pork segment also depicts an improvement of 2.6% from the prior-year quarter.These estimates have aided the consensus estimate for the company’s total sales to witness an increase of 7.7% year over year, which is pegged at $9,892 million. However, the company’s earnings estimate of $1.51 for the fiscal first quarter has decreased by a penny in the last 30 days, alongside depicting a year-over-year decline of roughly 5% from the year-ago period. This might be due to the company’s exposure to the risk of raw material price volatility. Also, stiff competition and intense promotions remain headwinds. Rising wage costs also pose threats to Tyson Foods’ operating results.What Does The Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Tyson Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

299,CPB,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 6. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this food processing behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company posted a negative earnings surprise of 18.2% in the last reported quarter. Moreover, it has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. Consequently, the company has reported average negative surprise of 4.1% in the trailing four quarters.Additionally, the company has posted negative earnings surprise in eight of the last 10 quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 70 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of about 6.7%. Further, we note that earnings estimate for the quarter has declined by 1 cent in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16.4 billion, down 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, the company has a negative sales surprise history having lagged estimates for over three years now. This led Archer Daniels to underperform the broader Consumer Staples sector in the past year. The company’s shares dipped 2.6%, while the sector ascended 12.8%. The company’s dismal top-line performance makes us slightly skeptical about its upcoming results.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels has a dismal sales surprise trend due to lower sales at all segments. This drab performance history can be attributed to the fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins. In the most recent third-quarter 2017, earnings were hurt by a tough operating environment at the company’s Agricultural services and Oilseeds Processing segments, while sales declined across all segments.Additionally, the company’s margins remain under pressure due to soft operating performance at the Agricultural Services and Oilseeds Processing segments. Margins at Agricultural Services segment were hurt by soft merchandising and handling results for North America Grain due to lack of competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans in global markets. Further, lower crushing margins as well as lower South American origination margins resulted in reduced margins at Oilseeds Processing segment. Based on the dismal third-quarter performance and negative surprise trend, we remain apprehensive about the company’s future performance.However, Archer Daniels remains committed to strengthening capacities and geographic spread, through buyouts and other organic expansions. These factors and the prospects from Project Readiness, position it to deliver solid bottom-line growth in 2017. Moreover, the company’s transition from a period of costs and investments in acquisitions, new innovation centers and facilities, to focusing on reducing capital spending and increasing benefits from investments, is likely to aid results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

300,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) has decided to wind down its manufacturing facility in Toronto and integrate the Canadian soup and broth production to its three existing factories in the United States, namely, Paris, TX; Maxton, NC and Napoleon, OH. This action is in sync with the company’s cost-savings plan and is likely to bolster the operational efficiency of the North American thermal network.The Toronto facility will be shut down in phases, within a period of about 18 months, resulting in 380 job cuts out of 600. Further, the Canadian headquarters and related commercial operations will be relocated to the Greater Toronto Area, with around 200 job positions. It will house a modern Food Innovation Center that will serve the community with soup and broth recipes, to suit Canadian tastes.The decision to close this facility stems from the company’s recent review of manufacturing operations, which indicates that the plant is no longer competitively viable due to its age and size. This facility was opened in 1931 and happens to the company’s oldest plant in the thermal plant network.As mentioned above, the winding down of the Toronto plant is in accordance with the company’s cost-savings plan, which was announced in fiscal 2015. Campbell has been progressing well with this initiative and anticipates cost savings worth $450 million by the end of fiscal 2020. Notably, the company generated savings of $20 million in first-quarter fiscal 2018, bringing the savings to $345 million as of Oct 29, 2017. Additionally, the company expects the cost savings program to deliver $60-$70 million of savings in fiscal 2018 that is incremental to the productivity gains from ongoing supply chain initiatives.We believe that the company’s strategy of concentrating on supply chain efficiencies, along with curtailing costs and reinvesting part of these savings in areas with high growth potential is likely to drive growth.Stock PerformanceCampbell has lagged the industry in the past year due to dismal top and bottom-line trends in recent quarters.

301,CPB,"The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 2. We note that this cosmetics giant has delivered positive earnings and sales surprise for 13 and three consecutive quarters, respectively. The company has been gaining from focus on strategic acquisitions, sturdy foothold in the beauty space and robust online and travel retail network. Let’s see if Estee Lauder can keep its spectacular surprise streak alive this time too.Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Factors at PlayEstee Lauder has been witnessing year-over year top-line growth for more than two years now, while its bottom line depicted growth in the past three quarters. The cosmetics big-wig’s splendid past record and investors’ confidence in its prospects is well reflected by the 69.1% surge in its shares over a year. This also crushed the industry’s rally of 38%. Focus on Buyouts, Online & Travel Retail to Drive Q2 ResultsWe expect Estee Lauder to continue gaining from its robust brand portfolio across most categories, benefits from acquisitions and solid presence in emerging markets. Notably, the buyouts of BECCA and Too Faced (during first-quarter fiscal 2017) have strengthened Estee Lauder’s fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed significantly to sales growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Also, management expects these brands to contribute roughly 3 percentage points to the company’s overall sales growth in the second quarter. Also, the investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company is likely to aid beauty sales.Estee Lauder also has a strong online business and the company expects it to be a major growth engine for the upcoming years. Thanks to technological advancement and the growing popularity of social media, mobile sales constituted about 70% of the company’s online traffic in the last quarter and remains a major growth driver. Estee Lauder is also growing its sales in China through T-mall, the largest digital platform run by Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba. Estee Lauder remains focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Prospects from China Bode WellWhile Estee Lauder has a solid presence in emerging markets, solid prospects from China appear bright, as sales in this region soared nearly 50% in the first quarter. This was driven by double-digit growth in all brands, with MAC, Tom Ford and Lab Series businesses nearly doubling year over year. Also, management stated that its makeup business doubled for the second straight quarter, whereas performance of its skin care and luxury fragrance business also remained favorable in the quarter. The company’s operations in China have been gaining from rising demand from millennials. Management thus envisions continued strength in luxury products in China, which keeps it encouraged about making incremental investments in the region. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from Asia/Pacific region is pegged at $763 million, depicting year-over-year growth of 15.8%.Skin Care & Makeup Categories Remain Major DriversAll these factors, along with growth in travel retail have been spurring growth at Estee Lauder and are most likely to sustain this trend in the quarter to be reported. Among all categories, Estee Lauder’s skin care and makeup categories have been performing particularly well for nearly a year. In the last quarter, skin care and makeup sales advanced 16% and 18% year over year, respectively. We expect these categories to remain major drivers in the second quarter as well.Turning to estimates for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for skincare and makeup sales is currently pegged at $1,434 million and $1,515 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of about 15% and 16%, respectively. Further, the consensus mark for fragrance and hair care sales is $553 million and $147 million, compared with the year-ago period sales of $497 million and $137 million, respectively.Q2 Expectations as a WholeClearly, Estee Lauder is expected to continue with its top and bottom-line growth trend in the second quarter. Incidentally, management forecasts net sales growth of 13-15% in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales are expected to improve 10-11%. Currency is expected to positively impact second-quarter sales by 3-4%.Further, the company envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $1.38-$1.41 per share for the second quarter. The earnings range marks an increase of 13% to 15% over the prior-year earnings. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings are expected to improve 8-10%.Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings witnessed an uptrend in the past 30 days, and is now pegged at $1.43, which represents more than 17% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,673 million, up 14.5% from the year-ago reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Estee Lauder is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

302,CPB,"Hillenbrand, Inc. (HI  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this diversified industrial company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Well, the company has been delivering positive earnings surprise for six straight quarters now. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Hillenbrand Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Hillenbrand Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Hillenbrand Inc Quote What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 47 cents, which represents nearly 12% growth from the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $405 million, which is in line with the year-ago period figure.Factors at PlayHillenbrand hasn’t witnessed a single year-over-year decline in top and bottom lines for more than a year now. Well, the company has mainly been gaining from strength at its Process Equipment segment, which has also helped the company’s shares rally 20.8% in a year, surpassing the industry’s 15.5% growth. Robust demand has been favoring the performance of this segment, wherein revenues jumped 7% to $304 million in the last quarter. Incidentally, results were fueled by solid demand for systems and equipment that are used for food and pharma projects and engineered plastics. Also, increased demand for screening and separating equipment fueled segment revenues.Given these trends, the company has been focusing on capitalizing the opportunities provided by the process equipment market. In this regard, the acquisition of Coperion has also aided Hillenbrand’s pricing and productivity initiatives. Driven by such upsides, management expects Process Equipment unit to witness continued organic growth in fiscal 2018, supported by a robust backlog level.However, persistent softness at the Batesville business segment remains a hurdle. This unit has long been struggling with lower burial volumes in North America, as consumers depict a radical shift toward cremation. In the last quarter, segment revenues declined 4% to $139 million due to reduced demand for burial caskets which stems from families rising preference for cremation. Moreover, the performance of this segment remains challenged with higher commodity and fuel costs. Management expects these hurdles to linger and hurt revenues and margins in fiscal 2018, which remains a concern for the upcoming quarter.Nevertheless, we expect the flourishing process equipment business to tide over the aforementioned weakness and drive Hillenbrand this time around.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hillenbrand is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

Additionally, TreeHouse Foods has been bearing the brunt of rising freight and commodity costs.Treading on such rough roads, TreeHouse Foods’ shares have tumbled close to 38.7% in the past six months against the industry’s rise of 2.4%. Also, the company’s performance compares unfavorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the S&P 500 index’s gain of 2.7% and 12.5%, respectivelyIn an attempt to combat ongoing hurdles, TreeHouse Foods has undertaken several initiatives including business restructuring, focusing on organic food manufacturing and strategic buyouts.    Let’s now take a look into what’s been hurting TreeHouse Foods and the efforts put into place for inducing growth.Factors Weighing On TreeHouse FoodsConsumers’ changing preferences and the persistent threats emerging from Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) ever-growing dominance have led to heightened competition and waning store traffic for many food companies. These factors, combined with increased promotional activities create considerable pricing pressure, which remains a threat to TreeHouse Foods’ sales volumes and profit margins. Apart from TreeHouse Foods, companies like Unilever (UN  -  Free Report) and Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report) have also been reeling under such industry headwinds.In addition to the aforementioned challenges, the divestiture of the SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business marred the company’s top line during the third quarter of 2017. Further, escalated commodity and freight expenses significantly weighed upon the company’s operating performance, especially in Beverages and Snacks units.Unfortunately, management expects these headwinds to linger, which compelled it to curtail 2017 earnings outlook to a band of $2.70-$2.80 per share, compared with the previous range of $3.15-$3.30.Efforts to Counter ChallengesAdapting to consumers’ changing preferences is considered one of the best ways to keep afloat amid such conditions. To this end, TreeHouse Foods strives to widen organic food offerings, as consumers have been inclining toward healthier food options. Moreover, TreeHouse Foods witnessed positive comparable store sales growth trends in food away from home outlets, which mainly focuses on clean ingredients and labels, resulting in higher demand for “natural” or organic type products. The company expects sustained growth in these areas and has been developing new formulations and products in this category.Another vital strategic endeavor to improve performance is the TreeHouse 2020 initiative, which was announced in second-quarter 2017. The plan has been designed to restructure and realign the business as a whole in several phases. Along with cost savings, the initiative is expected to augment customer portfolio and optimize supply chain operations. Notably, this initiative is expected to improve the company’s operating margin by 300 bps by the end of 2020.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been constantly expanding product offerings through acquisitions. In February 2016, the company acquired Private Brands Business from ConAgra Foods. The inclusion of Private Brands has added to revenues and has helped the company pay off $470 million in debt over the last five quarters. Other noteworthy acquisitions include Associated Brands, Flagstone Foods and Naturally Fresh, Inc.Back by such dedicated efforts, TreeHouse Foods is expected to achieve a turnaround in performance and thereby offset present hurdles.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

304,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company’s (CPB  -  Free Report) performance has been dismal of late owing to volatile operating environment along with intense competition and strained margins. Consequently, the company delivered a negative surprise in recent quarters.Campbell has lost 6.1% in the last month against the industry’s 0.2% growth. Let’s analyze the factors affecting this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s performance.Difficult Operating Backdrop Hurts PerformanceCampbell is witnessing a rough phase due to a volatile operating environment marked by rapidly evolving retail sector and increased competition. This has significantly hurt the company’s top-line performance in the recent quarters. Meanwhile, the bottom line remains strained by rise in cost inflation and higher carrot costs that have hurt the company’s Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division. Additionally, the rise in transportation and logistics costs due to the recent hurricanes impacted earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.As a result, the company’s first-quarter results marked the third consecutive quarter of negative earnings surprise with fourth straight revenue miss. Moreover, the company’s earnings and sales declined year over year. Organic sales dipped 2% on account of lower volumes, mainly in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Margins Under PressureApart from hurting top- and bottom-line performance, higher costs have plagued the company’s margins. Gross margin contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to cost inflation, escalated supply chain expenses and adverse mix. Further, lower gross margin, soft sales and increased adjusted administrative costs weighed upon adjusted EBIT.A Bearish FY18 View Raises ConcernsGiven the tough environment, the company trimmed earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 while sales growth forecasts remains intact to range from negative 2% to flat. Adjusted earnings are now envisioned in the $2.95-$3.02 per share range, representing a decline of 1-3%.Further, the company anticipates gross margin for fiscal 2018 to be comparable to last year, which is below previous expectations. This is likely to be impacted by higher transportation and logistics costs as well as the cost impact of lower carrot yields. Consequently, the company projects adjusted EBIT to decline in the range of 2-4% versus earlier guidance of decrease of 1% to increase of 1%.Is There Hope for Revival?Despite the above-mentioned tailwinds, the company’s strategies are directed toward achieving profitable and sustainable growth .In the meantime, Campbell remains focused on a four-point plan that encompasses raising transparency of product ingredients, portfolio diversification, developing e-commerce capabilities and strengthening presence of its growing snacks brands. Also, the company’s practice of accelerating growth by acquiring new brands bode well for long-term growth.Do Consumer Staple Stocks Interest You?

Organic sales dipped 2% on account of lower volumes, mainly in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Further, the company’s adjusted gross margin contracted 2.1 percentage points to 36.5%. The decline was mainly due to cost inflation, escalated supply chain expenses and adverse mix, somewhat negated by productivity improvements as well as gains from cost savings.Moreover, adjusted EBIT for the quarter fell 14% to $417 million owing to lower gross margin, soft sales and increased adjusted administrative costs, partly compensated with lower marketing and selling costs.Segment AnalysisThe Latin America business is supervised as part of the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment starting from fiscal 2018. Earlier, this formed part of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Campbell reports results under three segments, namely, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh.Americas Simple Meals and Beverages: In first-quarter fiscal 2018, sales at the division dipped 5% year over year to $1,218 million, on account of softness in V8 beverages and soup sales. Sales for the U.S. soup dropped 9% owing to a drop in condensed soups, broth as well as ready-to-serve soups. This was somewhat offset by benefits from Prego pasta sauces.Global Biscuits and Snacks: Sales at this division rose 3% at $709 million. Excluding the impact of currency tailwinds, sales grew 2% backed by Pepperidge Farm snacks strength, representing growth in Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies.Campbell Fresh: Sales at this segment remained flat at $234 million on the back of greater Garden Fresh Gourmet sales, Bolthouse Farms salad dressings along with strength across carrot ingredients. This was partially offset by soft carrot sales. Also, sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages remained flat.FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $163 million, long-term debt of $2,269 million and total equity of $1,689 million. Further, the company generated $188 million as cash flow from operations during the first quarter.Fiscal 2018 OutlookCampbell remains focused on getting its C-Fresh division back on growth track, by solving the problems related to soft carrot sales and beverage products. Its solid focus on cost savings and core strategic imperatives are likely to drive growth in the long term.Management updated its outlook for fiscal 2018. Given a tough operating environment, the company still anticipates sales growth to range from negative 2% to flat. However, adjusted EBIT is expected to decline in the range of 2-4% versus earlier guidance of decrease of 1% to increase of 1%.Also, the company slashed adjusted earnings in the band of $2.95-$3.02 per share, representing decline in the range of 1-3%. Earlier, adjusted earnings per share growth were envisioned in the range of $3.04-$3.11, representing flat to increase of 2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $3.07.

307,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) has agreed to buy the leading snacks maker — Snyder’s-Lance, Inc.  — in an all-cash deal worth nearly $4.87 billion or $50 per share. The price reflects approximately 27% premium on Snyder’s-Lance’s closing stock price on Dec. 13, 2017. This will form part of the buyer’s Global Biscuits and Snacks segment including the Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen businesses along with the simple meals and shelf-stable beverages operations in Australia, Asia Pacific and Latin America. This buyout is likely to aid Campbell Soup in strengthening its portfolio of snacking brands, hence making it a snacking leader.The deal, which is expected to close in the early second quarter of 2018, is likely to be financed through $6.2 billion of debt involving both long-term and short-term debt. Further, it is anticipated to be accretive to adjusted earnings in fiscal 2019, which excludes integration and synergies expenses.For the past 12 months ending on Sep 30, 2017, Snyder’s-Lance has generated $2.2 billion in net sales.Notably, the transaction has been approved by the board of directors of both companies but awaits approval from Snyder’s-Lance shareholders along with customary regulatory authorities and other closing conditions. However, some members of the Warehime family who collectively has 13.2% of Snyder’s-Lance’s outstanding common stock have voted in favor of the deal.Furthermore, the deal results into the suspension of Campbell Soup’s share buybacks in order to maximize free cash flow for paying down debt. Yet, management plans to maintain its existing dividend policy.How the Transaction Will Benefit Campbell Soup?The latest deal is likely to boost the Campbell Soup’s overall sales, besides widening its footprint in the $89 billion U.S. snacking market. Following the acquisition, Campbell Soup’s snacking business is likely to add nearly 46% to the company’s net sales annually, on a pro forma basis. Earlier, it represented approximately 31% of sales. We note that the company’s soup portfolio, which includes the acquisition of Pacific Foods, would reflect roughly 27% of its yearly net sales.In fact, the deal is likely to speed up Campbell Soup’s access to faster-growing distribution channels, which also encompasses the natural channels. Additionally, it is expected to boost the company’s strategy and provide its customers with better variety of better-for-you snacks.As said earlier, the acquisition forms part of the Campbell Soup’s Global Biscuits and Snacks division, which contributed roughly 32.8% in first-quarter fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2017, the company’s baked snacks product portfolio generated nearly $2.5 billion net sales. We believe Snyder’s-Lance’s popular brands like Snyder’s of Hanover, Lance, Kettle Brand, Cape Cod and Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps among others are likely to diversify the segment’s brands portfolio, hence boosting its performance.Stock’s PerformanceCampbell Soup carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A look upon the stock’s price performance in the last six months shows that it has lost 9.2%, wider than the industry’s decline of 2%.Nevertheless, Campbell Soup remains keen on making acquisitions in a bid to enhance its brand portfolio and accelerate future growth. In fact, the afore-mentioned deal will mark the company’s sixth buyout in the last five years. We expect the potential acquisition to generate synergic benefits along with increasing the company’s overall profitability.Meanwhile, you can count upon some better-ranked stocks in the same industry that includes Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report) and Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.

309,CPB,"In a bid to go beyond chocolate and gain a solid footing in the fast-growing market for healthy snacks Hershey Co. (HSY  -  Free Report) inked a deal to acquire Amplify Snack Brands Inc.  — the maker of SkinnyPop and Tyrrell’s potato chips.Consequently, Amplify's shares were up 71.6% on Dec 18 while Hershey gained a mere 0.1%.Terms of the DealHershey agreed to buy all outstanding shares of Amplify Snack Brands for $12 a share, which is a 71% premium to Friday’s closing price. Valued at approximately $1.6 billion, the deal includes net debt and a make-whole payment of $76 million related to the Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA).Per the company, the transaction is slated to close in the first quarter of 2018 and will be funded with cash on hand and new debt.  In fact, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to Hershey's earnings in the first year following the deal closure..The accord is also anticipated to generate approximately $20 million in annual run-rate synergies over the next two years.However, the takeover is not expected to affect Hershey’s full-year 2017 guidance, projected earlier.Hershey and Other Food Biggies Diversify to Combat Fading DemandThe packaged food industry is suffering from waning consumer demand due to the shift in consumer preferences to healthier options. In this context, Austin, TX-based Amplify seems to be gaining ground as it offers the better-for-you food products. Apart from owing Skinny Pop popcorn and Tyrrells potato chips, Amplify also owns Oatmega bars made with whey protein from grass-fed cows in New Zealand.Over the past two years, Hershey acquired brands like Krave meat jerky and Ripple Brand Collective's barkTHINS as well. Notably, the company’s top-line performance was weak since 2014.  However, sales increased a meager 0.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in the first nine months of 2017. Persistent macroeconomic challenges in China continued to hurt the company’s result. Notably, soft international sales due to macro headwinds, changing consumer shopping habits and intense competition from the broader snacking environment in the United States were mainly responsible for the sales results.Apart from Hershey, other big food giants are gradually re-shuffling their shelves and are making niche acquisitions, given tepid demand.In a separate press release, Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) unveiled deal to buy Cape Cod chips-maker Snyder's-Lance, Inc.  for $4.87 billion in cash to fight declining soup sales. The No. 5 U.S. healthy savory snacks maker — Snyder's-Lance — also owns brands like Eatsmart veggie snacks.Although Campbell and Hershey operate in different section of food industry, their core products have been suffering from lower demand. Much of the sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products.Other biggies like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Co (K  -  Free Report) are also acquiring or investing in healthier options to boost sales and thereby profits. In line with the strategy to diversify its organic offerings, Kellogg entered into an agreement in October 2017 to acquire protein bar maker — Chicago Bar Company. Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, which is considered to be the fastest growing nutrition bar brand in the United States. The addition of “clean-label, high-protein” RXBAR can be expected to revive Kellogg’s wholesome snacks business, which has been weak over the past few quarters.Meanwhile, Conagra Brands Inc (CAG  -  Free Report) took over Boomchickapop popcorn maker — Angie's Artisan Treats — in September 2017.Currently, Hershey and these food companies are regularly bringing innovations to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. Hershey expects innovation to help it achieve its long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 10.5% year to date, as against the industry’s loss of 20.6%. Although the Hershey’s earnings estimates for the current quarter and current year remained unchanged, successful innovation and progress in multi-year productivity, and cost-saving initiatives are likely to drive growth for this largest producer of quality chocolate products.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

311,CPB,"So the rhetoric appears to have actions backing it up, after all: upon the event of a massive $85.4 billion merger between AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Time Warner , the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said “no way.” This came a bit out of left field, as the deal was assumed to be vertical — not to encroach on monopolistic terrain, as the companies do not directly compete with one another — and thus considered viable by the business community, and especially shareholders of AT&T and/or Time Warner stock.Considering that media companies are now competing on a massive scale with entertainment content providers like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), this merger appears to make sense in that it ups the ante for both media and telecommunications players going forward.

Initially, those close to these companies assumed this was perhaps a rift between President Trump and Time Warner entity CNN, which the President has very vocally critical of both during the election campaign and during the first year of Trump’s term in office. But what the DoJ argues today is that consumer costs are likely to spike as AT&T would be able to charge “hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner’s networks.” Basically, the DoJ is officially taking issue with antitrust laws, and that this merger may be in violation of them.AT&T, for its part, maintains its vertical merger stance, pointing to the routine passage of such agreements in other industries without unraveling any antitrust issues.

If we look at Campbell Soup’s performance in the trailing four quarters (excluding the quarter under review), the company has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.2%, with a miss in two quarters.Campbell Soup Company Price and EPS Surprise Campbell Soup Company Price and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteRevenues: Campbell Soup generated total sales of $2,161 million were down 2% year over year, while it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,180 million.

314,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 21. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this convenience foods behemoth will be able to come up with a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters. It delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter is pegged at 97 cents compared with $1 in the year-ago period. Estimates have been stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $2.2 billion, down 1% from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayCampbell Soup has been struggling to revive its top line, which hasn’t witnessed year-over-year growth for quite some time. Moreover, it has missed the Zacks consensus mark for three straight quarters now. Known for its canned foods, much of the sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Nevertheless, the company’s Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division recovered slightly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, after it was marred by lingering constraints related to the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks recall in June 2016.These factors have also weighed upon the company’s shares that lost 21.9% so far this year, wider than the industry's decline of 9.5%.  Further, the company anticipates the operating environment to remain challenging in fiscal 2018, wherein it expects to witness cost inflation. The company’s earlier guidance indicates that the first-half results will remain significantly soft.Additionally, stiff competition in the food industry and rising commodity prices might dent the company’s performance in the near term.Nevertheless, Campbell Soup is on track with its four core plans including focus on real food philosophy and transparency, undertaking robust digital endeavors, portfolio diversification and concentrating on growing its snacks brands. Meanwhile, the company is progressing well with its cost savings plan, which evidently helped it achieve gross margin, EBIT and earnings growth in fiscal 2017.So let’s wait and see whether these obstacles are offset by the company’s robust brand portfolio, solid cost-savings and four core plans.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that Campbell Soup is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteWhile Campbell Soup has an Earnings ESP of +0.70%, its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. (OLLI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.82% and a Zacks Rank #3.Mondelez International, Inc.

315,CPB,"The Consumer Staples sector is home to daily-use products that makes it to an extent immune to economic headwinds. In fact, the sector is considered defensive and is currently benefiting from buoyant economy and improving consumer confidence, despite a competitive landscape and geopolitical turmoil.Despite belonging to the sector, Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report), the manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products, has been struggling to find place in investors’ good books. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s shares have declined 23.6% so far this year, wider than the industry’s loss of 10.2%.A Deeper Insight Into Campbell’s PerformanceWe note that Campbell’s top and bottom-line results have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters. Moreover, the company has reported an average negative earnings surprise of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters.Furthermore, the company’s top-line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine of the trailing 10 quarters, and hasn’t witnessed a single quarter of year-over-year top-line growth for a while now. As Campbell is known for its canned foods, much of its sales debacle could be attributed to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Also, the company’s Campbell Fresh division has just witnessed slight recovery in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, before which it was marred by lingering constraints from the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks recall in June 2016.Moving ahead, the company expects the operating environment to remain tough in fiscal 2018, wherein it also expects to witness cost inflation. Well, management stated that it anticipates the first-half results to remain significantly soft, which clearly remains a concern in the near term.Additionally, the company faces intense global competition for nearly all its key products. Consequently, excessive pressure from competitors is likely to cause Campbell to incur greater marketing and other costs or reduce prices, all of these are likely to hurt the company's overall performance.How is the Consumer Staples Sector Positioned?Though Campbell is plagued with problems at the moment, there are many stocks in the Consumer Staples space that seems to be gaining from the improving economic situation. A look at the sector’s performance shows that it has gained 10.1% year to date, narrower than the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 13.8%. Nevertheless, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #3 (out of 16), placing it at the top 19% of the Zacks classified sectors.4 Trending PicksWhile Campbell deals with the aforementioned challenges, here is a look at the four food companies that carry a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned to benefit from the current scenario.

318,CPB,"More than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Campbell Misses on Q4 Earnings & SalesCampbell Soup posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein adjusted earnings of 52 cents per share jumped 13% year over year, though it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. Including one-time items, Campbell reported earnings of $1.04 per share, against a loss of 26 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter.Net sales of $1,664 million slipped 1% and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,689 million, mainly owing to soft organic sales. Organic sales dipped 1% on account of lower volumes.Nonetheless, the company’s adjusted gross margin grew 80 basis points to 36.9%, thus reverting to its expansion trend after last quarter’s downside. The gross margin growth was mainly accountable to productivity enhancements and benefits from cost-curtailing efforts, somewhat negated by cost inflation and escalated supply chain expenses.Moreover, adjusted EBIT for the quarter advanced 11% to $282 million, thanks to reduced marketing and selling costs, and improved gross margin. This was somewhat marred by soft sales.Segment AnalysisCampbell reports its results under three segments, namely, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh.Americas Simple Meals and Beverages: In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, sales at the division dipped 3% year over year to $815 million, on account of softness in V8 beverages and soup sales. During the quarter, sales for U.S. soup dropped 4%, on account of a drop in broth, ready-to-serve soups and condensed soups.   Global Biscuits and Snacks: Sales at this division remained flat at $624 million, as Pepperidge Farm snacks strength across Australia was countered by weakness in Indonesia.Campbell Fresh: Sales at this segment climbed 1% to $225 million on the back of greater Garden Fresh Gourmet sales, along with strength across carrots and carrot ingredients. This was partially offset by soft sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages, which continued being hurt by supply constraints.FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $319 million, long-term debt of $2,499 million and total shareholders’ equity of $1,645 million. Further, the company generated $1,291 million as cash flow from operations during fiscal 2017.Fiscal 2018 OutlookManagement remains impressed with some key achievements of fiscal 2017. These include raising the company’s multi-year cost-savings goal to $450 million by 2020. The company also anticipates significant gains from its pending buyout of Pacific Foods. Finally, Campbell remains focused on getting its C-Fresh division back to growth path, by solving the problems related to capacity constraints. With solid focus on cost savings and its core strategic imperatives, Campbell remains well-placed for long-term growth.However, given a tough operating environment, management expects sales growth for fiscal 2018 to range from negative 2% to flat. Adjusted EBIT growth is anticipated in a range of negative 1% to 1% increase. Adjusted earnings per share growth is envisioned in the range of flat to 2% rise, to $3.04-$3.11.Currency headwinds are expected to have a nominal impact on the company’s fiscal 2018 performance.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 7% due to these changes.Campbell Soup Company Price and Consensus  Campbell Soup Company Price and Consensus | Campbell Soup Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Campbell Soup's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is more suitable growth investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We are expecting a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

319,CPB,"Troubles don’t seem to be end for Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) which has been reeling under soft top-line trends. Well, this premium food products company hasn’t witnessed a single quarter of year-over-year top-line growth for a while now, and has also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate for three consecutive quarters. As Campbell is known for its canned foods, much of its sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products.Battered by these industry challenges, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has tumbled 25.4% year to date, faring worse than the industry’s 11.1% decline. So, let’s take a look at what’s hurting Campbell’s top-line performance, and if there’s any scope for revival in the near term.Industry Challenges Take a TollWhile food and beverage is one of the most attractive and profitable markets, it remains vulnerable to alterations in consumers’ tastes and preferences; worldwide demographic changes and adverse effects of technological advancements. Of late, the food space has been grappling with problems related to intense competition and promotional activities stemming from consumers’ evolving preferences.In this regard, competition from e-commerce trends mainly owing to Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance is a major retail hurdle that is also expected to linger and pressurize grocery and mass networks.Unfortunately, Campbell has been bearing the brunt of these headwinds, as evident from its past performance. Evidently, net sales at Campbell Soup dipped by 1% in each of the last three quarters of fiscal 2017. While sales remained flat year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, it witnessed declines for seven successive quarters prior to that.Q4 Bears the Brunt as Well, Outlook Remains BleakCampbell Soup posted lower-than-expected results for the fourthquarter of fiscal 2017, as both earnings and sales came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Management blamed the murky quarter on a difficult scenario in the packaged food industry, where sales remained soft due to consumers changing food preferences, evolving shopping trends and a tough retail environment. Also, the company’s Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division just saw slight recovery in the quarter, before which it was marred by lingering constraints from the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks recall made in June 2016.Incidentally, the company expects the operating environment to remain difficult in fiscal 2018, wherein it also expects to witness cost inflation. Considering these obstacles, management expects sales growth for fiscal 2018 to range from negative 2% to flat. Adjusted EBIT growth is envisioned in a range of negative 1% to 1% increase. Well, management stated that it anticipates the first half results to remain significantly soft, which clearly remains a concern for the near term.Estimates Trend Downward, Where’s Campbell Headed?Owing to the dismal trends and murky outlook, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and fiscal 2018 have moved from $1.05 to 97 cents and from $3.22 to $3.08, respectively in the past 30 days.While Campbell Soup remains on track with its solid cost-savings plan and four key strategic imperatives, the aforementioned barriers keep us on the sidelines, at least for the near term.Not Happy With Campbell?

Let’s find out.Well, one most prominent sector in the lot is Consumer Staples, which deals in essential and non-durable goods that form a part of our daily lives. Products ranging from everyday grocery, food items, beverages, tobacco, and other household essentials generally make up this sector’s business. Notably, highly competitive environment, shift in preference towards organic food products, new store formats and evolving business models are major challenges plaguing the sector.Consequences of These HeadwindsWhen discussing the consequences, we can rightly quote the example of the grocery industry, which is a key segment of this sector. The industry has been grappling with intense competition, highly promotional landscape and change in customers’ taste resulting in the increased demand for organic products.As we all know, competition in the traditional grocery space mainly relates to strengthening franchises and shift to low-priced private label brands. Further, the recent intrusion of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. on Aug 28 has intensified the competition. Following this, Amazon has started slashing the prices of Whole Foods’, giving its brick-and-mortar rivals goose bumps.Moreover, as quoted earlier, change in consumer tastes to healthy products has significantly altered the fate of the food industry, where the canned products and packaged goods are falling out of customers’ favor. The impact of this trend can be clearly seen in the performance of Campbell Soup Company, which is struggling to find a place in customers’ carts for its canned soup products. This is also true for other categories, including Cereal, which is also witnessing a decline.Additionally, packaged-food manufacturers are struggling to get the right promotional pacts in place with grocery retailers and other vendors. This has left them scrambling to occupy the center grocery aisle in a store. Some retailers battling for protecting shelf space are Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report), General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), and Campbell Soup.These challenges have left industry players scrambling for options to improve businesses. Apart from protecting shelf space, the food industry is feeling the pressures of some serious price wars, lower market share, diversifying products, and exploring acquisitions and mergers.Other headwinds like strained margins, high operating expenses, declining volumes, slowing emerging markets growth, uncertain international markets and foreign currency impacts may also hinder growth.How the Consumer Staples Sector is Placed?We note that the Consumer Staples sector has been underperforming the S&P 500 market lately. In the last six months, the sector recorded 3.2% growth, a notch below the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 5.2%. However, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #7 (out of 16), placing it at the top 44% of the Zacks Classified sectors.While the sector Rank is encouraging, its dismal performance relative to the S&P 500 Index makes us cautious about placing bets in the sector.Earnings Trend for Sector PlayersThe second-quarter earnings season, which marked the second straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the S&P 500, is well behind us.Shedding light on the Consumer Staples sector, the aforementioned challenges surely call for a tough quarterly performance for industry players. We note that many major sector participants came up with dismal earnings for the quarter and slashed their forward outlooks. Further, estimates for these companies declined considerably following the earnings.Also, as is the general case, share prices of these companies have plunged following the dismal results. These factors considerably reduce the visibility for these stocks to beat estimates in the quarter ahead.Surely, investing in companies that deliver positive surprises can fetch handsome returns for investors. On the flip side, investors prefer to sideline stocks that have a dismal surprise trend to avoid portfolio mishaps.Here is the key to any investment portfolio, picking the most lucrative stocks and doing away with stocks that have little visibility.Consumer Staples Stocks to Avoid After Earnings SlumpHence, we bring you five stocks from the Consumer Staples sector that have disappointed in the most recent quarter and witnessed decline in share price following the results. We suggest avoiding these stocks, which also carry Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell), possess a negative surprise trend and have witnessed downward estimate revisions.First on the list is Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report), a global direct-selling beauty company offering cosmetics, fragrances, toiletries, jewelry, and accessories. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #5 and reported negative earnings surprise of 150% in second-quarter 2017. Results for the most recent quarter were primarily impacted by strong comparisons with the prior-year quarter. Another major setback for the company has been weak Active Representatives growth, which is hurting results for the past few quarters. The company has lagged earnings estimates for four consecutive quarters, with an average miss of 90.7%. Additionally, estimate for the current fiscal has declined 55% to 9 cents per share in the last 60 days. Moreover, the stock declined a solid 25.9% since reporting dismal earnings on Aug 3, underperforming the industry’s 1.7% gain.Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #4 and earnings miss of 5.5% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, is also in the red. This worldwide manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters, reporting an average negative surprise of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters. Much of this debacle could be attributed to a difficult packaged food industry landscape, where sales have been soft due to consumers changing food preferences, evolving shopping trends and tough retail environment. Also, the company expects a tough operating scenario in fiscal 2018, which led to a cautious view. Estimate for the current fiscal has declined 3.7% to $3.10 per share in the last 30 days. Further, the stock has fallen 5% since reporting results on Aug 31, against the industry’s 1.1% upside.Another stock to avoid is Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report), a leading processor and distributor of milk and other dairy products in the United States as well as a leading manufacturer of various specialty food products. The stock has declined 26.1% since posting dismal second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, wider than the industry’s fall of 23.9%. Moreover, the company has reported negative earnings surprise in four of the last five quarters, with an average four-quarter miss of 15.2%. The company has been facing a tough retailing on account of fast-evolving consumer trends. Moreover, Dean Foods’ volumes have been under pressure due to stiff competition and macro factors. These factors, along with high raw milk costs led the company to post a negative surprise of 30% in the second quarter. Estimate of 85 cents per share for full-year 2017 has declined 37% in the last 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Next is B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report), the manufacturer, seller and distributor a portfolio of shelf-stable, and frozen food and household products in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 16.3% in second-quarter 2017, mainly hurt by industry-wide challenges. Further, it lowered adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017. The company has an average negative surprise of 8.1% in the trailing four quarters. Further, estimates for 2017 dipped 1.9% to $2.12 per share in the last 30 days. This Zacks Rank #4 company has declined 3.4% since reporting second-quarter results on Aug 4, underperforming the industry’s 2.6% downside.Lastly, we would suggest avoiding Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (SPB  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #4 and a negative earnings surprise of 10.9% in third-quarter fiscal 2017. The lower-than-expected results were due to lower volumes, foreign currency headwinds and soft sales at personal care and small appliances segments. This consumer products company has reported earnings miss in the last two quarters, with an average negative surprise of 2.7% in the trailing four quarters. Moreover, estimate for the current fiscal has fallen 0.4% to $5.57 per share in the last 30 days. Further, the stock has fallen 14.5% since reporting earnings on Jul 27, compared with the industry’s 5.7% declineLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?  Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

321,CPB,"Camden, NJ-based Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) ended fiscal 2017 on a dismal note with the company missing on earnings as well as sales as a tough operating environment continues to prevail across the food industry.Although macro-economic conditions continue to improve in the United States, shifting demographics, changing consumer preference and technology advancements continue to change the consumer food and retail landscapes. Increasing competition, new store formats and evolving business models including the growth of store brands and the influx of e-commerce and meal delivery services represent major challenges.Campbell Soup also provided a disappointing outlook for fiscal 2018. Revenues will remain under pressure with sales in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages expected to decline while the V8 Beverage business will remain flat. The Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh segments are expected to record sales growth. Meanwhile, U.S. soup sales will be impacted, especially in the first half of fiscal 2018, due to the inability to reach an agreement with a large customer on a promotional program (Read more: Campbell Misses on Q4 Earnings & Sales, Stock Loses 5%).The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 3.7% downward over the last 30 days and has lost 21% of its value year to date versus the 7.7% decline of its industry.With Campbell Soup being a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock, we advise investors to avoid the stock and focus on other names in the sector. Although the industry remains under pressure and has lagged the broader market, cost savings, margin improvement and consolidation are some of the factors that could help support the sector.While it may seem like a daunting task to select winning stocks in this sector, we have zeroed in on three companies that sport a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

324,CPB,"Shares of Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report) got canned on Thursday after the company reported both fourth quarter and full-year sales declines. Campbell’s poor performance also helped send the rest of the packaged food industry lower, nearly across the board.Campbell’s fourth-quarter revenues fell by 1% from the year-ago period to $1.664 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.689 billion. The company also failed to meet our earnings estimates, posting earnings of $0.52 a share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55.The canned soup giant’s full-year sales dipped by 1% to $7.890 billion, based mostly on an overall drop in organic sales due to lower volume and greater promotional spending. Campbell’s now projects that full-year revenues could fall by as much as 2% next year.“The operating environment for the packaged foods industry remains challenging due to shifting demographics, changing consumer preferences for food, the adoption of new shopping behaviors and the dynamic retailer landscape,” Campbell’s President and CEO Denise Morrison said in a statement. “In these times, sales growth remains a challenge.”The CEO noted that drastically changing consumer shopping trends have greatly impacted the company’s non-refrigerated canned and bottled goods sales, which are now seemingly outdated. Morrison also pointed to the rise of self-cooking delivery companies, such as Blue Apron (APRN), as well as an increase of private label brands, as major reasons for Campbell’s poor sales.Campbell’s biggest business sector, its soup and juice division, saw its sales sink 3% in its fourth-quarter. Sales of its packaged snack segment, including Pepperidge Farm and Goldfish, were flat. On the bright side, Campbell’s Bolthouse Farms fresh food sector experienced a 1% gain.Still, Thursday’s report marked Campbell’s 11th straight quarterof falling sales. Campbell’s stock tanked by over 7% and touched a new two-year intraday trading low of $46.43 a share.Packaged Food Industry  Campbell’s rough day helped send the rest of the packaged food industry down overall, as the soup maker’s predicament is hardly unique. With companies such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) growing larger, brands hold less and less leverage in price negotiations.“Right now, the retailers, they’re doing better in this round of the fight,” Warren Buffett said in a recent interview with CNBC.Buffett, an investor and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) board member, saw shares of the packaged food powerhouse fall 1.72% on Thursday. Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report) stock dropped by 2.03%, while shares of Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) dipped 0.82%.Shares of General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) both sunk to new 52-week intraday   lows.

325,CPB,"Stock market closed higher on Wednesday following a couple of bullish economic reports, even as the S&P 500 notched up a four-day winning streak. Markets digested the ongoing geopolitical tussle between North Korea and U.S. and also the fallout of Hurricane Harvey. Moreover, President Trump’s speech in Springfield regarding tax reforms boosted investor sentiment. Nasdaq outshone the other benchmarks due to a rally in tech and biotech shares. The Dow also finished in the green following gains from Caterpillar and Microsoft.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,892.43, gaining 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.5% to close at 2,457.59. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,368.31, increasing 1%. A total of only around 5.12 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 5.84 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.66-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.69-to-1 ratio.Strong Economic Data Overshadows Geopolitical TensionsStellar economic reports on Wednesday overshadowed the lingering political tensions between Pyongyang and Washington and the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. The second estimate of the gross domestic product showed that the U.S. economy expanded by 3% during the second quarter 2017, whereas the consensus estimated it would grow by around 2.7%, notching its fastest rate of growth in more than two years. This was the result of increased consumer spending and business investment for the quarter.Increase in consumer spending was pivotal in driving the GDP to 3% growth rate. Consumer expenditure was up 3.3% in the second quarter on account of increased expenditure on goods and services which also include car purchases. This is the best increase reported in a year. Moreover, business investment rose 0.6% in the second quarter. Also corporate adjusted pretax profits increased 6.7% over the past year.Meanwhile, ADP released its employment report for August which showed that the private sector has added a total of 237,000 jobs to the U.S. during this month, significantly higher than the estimate of 185,000 job additions. This is the highest growth it experienced since March when a total of 255,000 jobs were added.Such stellar economic data boosted investor sentiment, leading to broad based gains for the market. Consequently, analysts expect a rate hike by the Fed possibly in December due to strong economic results.  Economists believe President Trump will bank on the current rate of economic growth to pay for his planned tax cuts and increase infrastructural spending.Early on Tuesday, North Korea tested a missile over Japan, inviting criticism from across the world. This did little to deter the investors’ spirit as it was outdone by great economic reports. Trump tweeted on Wednesday: “The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years,” adding that “talking is not the answer!” Measured statements from leaders across the globe also added to gains for the market.Also, Hurricane Harvey has halted more than 16% of the country’s total refining capacity sending gasoline futures higher and oil prices lower. This too failed to have an overall impact on the market due to splendid economic results.Trump’s Tax Speech in SpringfieldIn a speech in Springfield, President Trump announced that he wanted the U.S. corporate tax rate to decline to 15%. Trump believes that this would create additional jobs and increase wages at the same time. Such comments boded well for the investors and markets gained following Trump’s speech. However, the administration has not laid out a detailed plan on tax reforms and has left it to Congress to take a decision on this issue.S&P 500, Nasdaq Post Stellar ShowingThe S&P 500 posted gains for the fourth straight session on Wednesday. Eight of its 11 main sectors finished higher. Such performance was achieved not only due to strong economic conditions but also due to a near 0.8% increase in the tech shares. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) was up 0.7% after shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) increased 1.1% and 0.2% respectively. This was the S&P 500’s longest winning streak in last three months. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Nasdaq also gained on Wednesday, notching up 66.42 points and outshining other benchmarks. Such a showing was possible due to a rally in tech and biotech shares. Shares of Gilead SciencesInc. (GILD  -  Free Report) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) notched up 7.3% and 5.6% respectively. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) gained 1.9% on Wednesday.Stocks That Made HeadlinesChico's Falls on Earnings & Sales Miss, Guides LowChico's FAS, Inc. (CHS  -  Free Report) disappointed the investor community again with dismal second-quarter fiscal 2017 financial results.  (Read More)Campbell Misses on Q4 Earnings & Sales, Stock Loses 5%Campbell Soup Company(CPB  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with sales marking its third straight miss.

326,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with sales marking its third straight miss. Management blamed the murky quarter on a difficult scenario in the packaged food industry, where sales remained soft due to consumers changing food preferences, evolving shopping trends and a tough retail environment.Nevertheless, the company’s stringent focus on cost-savings initiates fueled year-over-year growth in the bottom line as well as adjusted EBIT. However, the lower-than-expected results and not so encouraging outlook for fiscal 2018 sent shares of the company down by nearly 5% in the pre-market trading session. While Campbell has lost 10.7% in a year, it has fared better than the industry’s 12.4% decline.Q4 in DetailsAdjusted earnings of 52 cents per share jumped 13% year over year, though it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. Including one-time items, Campbell reported earnings of $1.04 per share, against a loss of 26 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteNet sales of $1,664 million slipped 1% and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,689 million, mainly owing to soft organic sales. Organic sales dipped 1% on account of lower volumes.Nonetheless, the company’s adjusted gross margin grew 80 basis points to 36.9%, thus reverting to its expansion trend after last quarter’s downside. The gross margin growth was mainly accountable to productivity enhancements and benefits from cost-curtailing efforts, somewhat negated by cost inflation and escalated supply chain expenses.Moreover, adjusted EBIT for the quarter advanced 11% to $282 million, thanks to reduced marketing and selling costs, and improved gross margin. This was somewhat marred by soft sales.Segment AnalysisCampbell reports its results under three segments, namely, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh.Americas Simple Meals and Beverages: In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, sales at the division dipped 3% year over year to $815 million, on account of softness in V8 beverages and soup sales. During the quarter, sales for U.S. soup dropped 4%, on account of a drop in broth, ready-to-serve soups and condensed soups.   Global Biscuits and Snacks: Sales at this division remained flat at $624 million, as Pepperidge Farm snacks strength across Australia was countered by weakness in Indonesia.Campbell Fresh: Sales at this segment climbed 1% to $225 million on the back of greater Garden Fresh Gourmet sales, along with strength across carrots and carrot ingredients. This was partially offset by soft sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages, which continued being hurt by supply constraints.FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $319 million, long-term debt of $2,499 million and total shareholders’ equity of $1,645 million. Further, the company generated $1,291 million as cash flow from operations during fiscal 2017.Fiscal 2018 OutlookManagement remains impressed with some key achievements of fiscal 2017. These include raising the company’s multi-year cost-savings goal to $450 million by 2020. The company also anticipates significant gains from its pending buyout of Pacific Foods. Finally, Campbell remains focused on getting its C-Fresh division back to growth path, by solving the problems related to capacity constraints. With solid focus on cost savings and its core strategic imperatives, Campbell remains well-placed for long-term growth.However, given a tough operating environment, management expects sales growth for fiscal 2018 to range from negative 2% to flat. Adjusted EBIT growth is anticipated in a range of negative 1% to 1% increase. Adjusted earnings per share growth is envisioned in the range of flat to 2% rise, to $3.04-$3.11. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged way higher at $3.21.Currency headwinds are expected to have a nominal impact on the company’s fiscal 2018 performance.Campbell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Interested in Consumer Staples?

328,CPB,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 31. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this convenience foods behemoth will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Campbell reported negative earnings surprise of 7.8% in the last quarter and has a mixed record of earnings surprises in preceding quarters. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Campbell Soup Company Price and EPS Surprise  Campbell Soup Company Price and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 55 cents, compared with 46 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $1.7 billion, up marginally from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayCampbell Soup has been struggling to revive its top line, which hasn’t witnessed a single year-over-year improvement for quite some time now. This has also caused the company’s shares to decline 10.7% so far this year, compared with the industry's 6.1% drop.Incidentally, the company’s results declined year over year and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last quarter. Management cited that the tough macroeconomic scenario in the food industry, wherein sales remained generally soft due to lower consumption led to the dismal quarter. In fact, consumer spending grew at its lowest rate, in about eight years — which considerably hampered the top line. Also, results were marred by continued competition from the rising eCommerce trends — a major retail hurdle that is expected to linger and pressurize grocery and mass networks.Apart from this, persistent weakness across the Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division has long been a deterrent. In this regard, the company has been undertaking various initiatives to revive C-Fresh’s performance. While these efforts are likely to help the segment recover, management continues to expect capacity constraints through the final quarter, which we believe is likely to hurt the overall top line. Given a soft quarter and the tough operating environment, management lowered its fiscal 2017 sales outlook, anticipating sales growth to range from negative 1% to flat, compared to the old forecast of flat to a 1% increase.Nevertheless, the company is on track with its four core plans, including focus on real food philosophy and transparency; undertaking robust digital endeavors; adding organic foods to portfolio and concentrating on growing its snacks unit. Moreover, Campbell’s strategy of concentrating on supply chain efficiencies, along with cutting costs is likely to drive growth. The company has generated solid results from its three-year cost savings program, which led management to raise the lower end of its EPS and EBIT views for fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings for the fiscal are envisioned to grow in the range of 3-5% to $3.04-$3.09 per share, whereas Adjusted EBIT is expected to rise 2-4% year over year. However, we cannot ignore the aforementioned obstacles and thus prefer remaining on the sidelines for the time being.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Campbellis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

329,CPB,"“Change is the only constant” – this one liner summarizes the state of all consumer-driven industries at the moment, as consumers’ accelerated shift toward online shopping has hit several industries, like apparel/shoe, departmental stores, and the food industry among others. A major player in the food industry, Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is also striving to keep up with these evolving trends, in order to serve consumers better and tap greater sales.Moving on these lines, this convenience foods products behemoth provided details on its four key strategies at its annual investor day yesterday, alongside reiterating its fiscal 2017 and long-term forecasts.Can Latest Plans Save CPB Stock?Campbell’s four strategies include plans to win consumers’ confidence via real food and raised transparency; speedy e-Commerce and digital marketing endeavors; maintaining focus on portfolio diversification; and strengthening its footprint in the growing snacking space. Shares of the company grew 3.1% in yesterday’s trading session.However, Campbell has slumped 17% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified industry that lost 10.8%. This could be largely accountable to Campbell’s waning top line which hasn’t witnessed a single year-over-year improvement for quite some time now. So let’s delve deeper into the plans outlined at the investor day, and see if they can save the day for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Four Core Strategies in DetailFocus on Real Food Philosophy & TransparencyCampbell remains focused on its real food philosophy, as part of which it plans to invest nearly $50 million to develop products as per the changing consumer preferences. Also, the company inked a deal with The Sage Project to reveal its ingredients online by leveraging Sage’s food data platform. Sage is engaged in offering online food labels, providing information on several attributes associated with food like ingredients, nutritional value and calories. Thus, partnership with Sage will enhance Campbell’s food transparency to its customers. Notably, Campbell is also on track to bring its real food philosophy to its soups category, and achieve significant results by the end of this year. In fact, it’s Well Yes! Soup will mark the company’s first product on Sage’s platform.Robust Digital Endeavors Bode WellAmazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) takeover of Whole Foods Market, Inc.  is testimony to the fact that e-Commerce has gained significant ground in the food industry. That said, Campbell is on track to strengthen its digital operations. Incidentally, the company announced plans to build an e-Commerce unit in North America, which will represent Campbell’s all three segments. Management appointed Shakeel Farooque to lead this e-Commerce team and anticipates delivering online sales of roughly $300 million in the next five years. Farooque’s past experience with behemoths like Amazon, eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) is likely to benefit Campbell, given his combined knowledge of consumers and technology. Well, Campbell’s focus on e-Commerce is also evident from its recently announced $10 million investment in online meal kit firm, Chef’d.Adding Organic Foods to Portfolio Should Lure ConsumersThe organic food space that surged at a compound annual growth rate of 15.3% in the last four years has become an over $11 billion category in the country. This is mainly due to consumers’ evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Thus, Campbell has been undertaking several steps to diversify its portfolio and expand in the fast-growing organic space. In this regard, the company recently announced plans to acquire leading organic broth and soup producer, Pacific Foods. This marked the company’s fifth buyout in the last five years. Other buyouts in this connection include Bolthouse Farms, Plums Organics and Garden Fresh Gourmet. Thanks to these buyouts, the company’s organic kitty currently ranks among the top 10 in the industry. Also, annual fresh products sales have reached approximately $1 billion, reflecting prospects of this category.Concentration on Growing Snacks UnitWith the growing demand for snacks, Campbell plans to undertake significant expansion at its Global Biscuits and Snacks’ segment, in fiscal 2018. The company plans to solidify this segment’s footprint geographically, and also go beyond its existing biscuits and bakes snack items. The company plans to prepare snacks using real food ingredients, which is also in sync with its first strategy. Also, the company plans to introduce soups, small meals and fresh snacks, which are expected to augment overall sales by about $200 million in the next five years.We believe that these strategies reflect Campbell’s commitment toward establishing a differentiated and significant position with the consumers’ community and in the food industry. In addition to elaborating on its strategic imperatives, management reaffirmed its fiscal 2017 and long-term goals, while it provided an update on its cost savings and cash flow targets for the fiscal.Fiscal 2017 & Long-Term OutlookManagement anticipates sales growth for fiscal 2017 to range from negative 1% to flat. Adjusted EBIT is expected to rise 2–4% year over year, while gross margin is anticipated to be 38%. Adjusted earnings for the fiscal are envisioned to grow in the range of 3–5% to $3.04–$3.09 per share. Coming to cash flows from operations, Campbell expects generating roughly $1.25 billion this fiscal. Also, the company plans to achieve cost savings worth $310 million by the end of fiscal 2017.Moving to the long term, management still projects organic sales growth in a range of 1–3%. Further, adjusted EBIT growth is envisioned in a band of 4– 6% and adjusted EPS is expected to grow 5–7% over the long term (both on a constant currency basis). Finally, the company continues to project cost savings from its ongoing initiatives to be around $450 million (roughly 6% of sales) by the end of fiscal 2020.
