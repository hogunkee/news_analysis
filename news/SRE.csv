0,SRE,"Utility stocks ran at the top and the bottom of the S&P 500 in an unusual session Monday. Sempra Energy (SRE) soared 15%, spurred by interest from activist hedge fund Elliott Management. PG&E (PCG) tanked almost 5% on liability concerns related to last year's Northern California wildfires.Both are diversified utilities, dealing with both power generation and natural gas. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit Stock Market Today.)Only one other utility stock in the 34-stock diversified industry group, Allete (ALE), moved more than 2%. Duluth, Minn.-based Allete dropped 2.5%. The result left the overall Utility-Diversified group up 0.4% for the day.A letter from Paul Singer's Elliott Management to Sempra's board outlined changes that the activist investor would like to see in order for the company to unlock investor value. Those changes included replacing six board members, as well as launching a strategic review of operations and assets.Elliott Management is a hedge fund with $34 billion in assets under management. The fund had played a key role in guiding Sempra, based in San Diego, to pay $9.45 billion to acquire Energy Futures Holdings. EFH held an 80% stake in Dallas-based power producer Oncor.At the time of the sale, Oncor reported more than 11 million customers. That lifted Sempra's total to more than 43 million. Elliott Associates, Elliott International and partner Bluescape Resources reportedly hold a 4.9% stake in Sempra. The letter to Sempra estimates that the utility can unlock between $11 billion and $16 billion in value. That would translate roughly to a $139 to $159 per share boost to the utility stock.In San Francisco, PG&E said Monday that it anticipates a ""significant liability"" after a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection report released Friday found PG&E equipment had caused at least 12 of the 24 blazes that tore through California's wine country in October. The fires killed 44 people and caused an estimated $10 billion in damage.The state is still investigating the Tubbs Fire. The largest fire in California's history, Tubbs was part of the overall October conflagration, responsible for 24 deaths. PG&E claims that fire was started by a power line installed and owned by a private property owner.Uncertainty over liabilities led PG&E to suspend its dividend in December. On Monday, Wells Fargo kept its market perform rating on the stock, and lowered the price target to 46, from 48. Investment research firm CFRA carved its price target to 36, from 46, and downgraded the stock to strong sell, from hold.PG&E dived more than 8% in opening trade, then eased to a 4% loss. That put shares down 45% since September 15.RELATED:This Tool Is An Investor's Best Friend; Do You Know How To Use It?Mining Giant Makes These Big Moves On Car Battery MetalsThis Stock May Go Totally Bonkers When Earnings Come Out LateRussia Hacks U.S. Nuclear Plants, Infrastructure 'Hundreds Of Thousands Of Times A Day'Energy Future Holdings, One Of The Largest-Ever Energy Bankruptcies, Nears Finish

1,SRE,"Stocks opened to very tight gains on Monday, ahead of a heavy week of political and policy events. The world's attention is trained on Tuesday's summit between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, but a Wednesday press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be a focal point for investors.The Dow Jones industrial average managed a 0.2% gain. The S&P 500 added 0.1%, with utilities Sempra Energy (SRE) and PG&E (PCG) posting the index's largest rise and fall, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite struggled with a gain of less than 0.1%,The Dow posted a 2.8% gain last week, its best since early March. The S&P 500 climbed 1.6% and the Nasdaq notched a 1.2% gain. The result left the Nasdaq at a new high, the Dow holding comfortably above the 25,000 mark and the S&P 500 less than 1% below 2,800.On the political front, markets showed little reaction to an early U.S. exit from a fractious G7 meeting over the weekend. The result set a disappointing tone on progress toward international trade agreements, but markets settled into the quiet trade that is customary head of Federal Reserve meetings.A diplomatic summit set for Tuesday between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is historic, although it has no specific targets. The tone of the two leaders, and the tweets that follow the meeting, could have some bearing on market behavior.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the market's central focus this week is likely to be on the two-day U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting and the policy meeting of the European Central Bank.The FOMC meet begins Tuesday, and wraps up with a policy announcement and a press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Wednesday afternoon.Investors project a 92% probability that the Fed will hike rates a quarter point. Powell's press conference will be of particular interest, as investors look for clues as to whether the Fed is leaning toward one or two more rate hikes for the rest of the year.Bond markets also will be under the microscope as the ECB meets on Thursday. Few expect the bank will increase its interest rates. But expectations are high the bank will lay out an exit strategy from its massive bond-buying stimulus program begun in 2009.Sempra surged nearly 15% after a letter from activist hedge fund Elliott Management to the San Diego-based company's board outlined a strategy to unlock value in the $26.6 billion market capitalization stock. Moves included replacing six board members, and creating a Strategic Review Committee of the Board. Sempra shares are down 18% from a November 2017 high.PG&E skidded 6% lower. A report released late last week by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection determined that 12 fires in Northern California, which killed 18 people and burned 174,000 acres in October 2017, were the result of power lines or equipment owned by PG&E. PG&E shares ended Friday 42% below their September high. A note from Wells Fargo maintained the stock's Market perform rating, but lowered its price target to 46, from 48.A handful of quarterly reports will add interest during the week.

Analysts expect a 51% rise in earnings and a 22% gain in sales when the company reports Thursday.FedEx rose 1% at the open, climbing further up the right side of a six-month base pattern. The stock ended Friday less than 6% below a buy point at 274.76. Shares are up 26% over the past 12 months, but the stock's Relative Strength line is lagging.Oil prices pulled back sharply, continuing recent volatility ahead of a June 22 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries. News reports said Saudi Arabia was increasing production ahead of the meeting. Many expect Saudi and non-OPEC member Russia to alter or remove production caps put in place in 2016. In addition, Reuters reported that the Trump administration, a day before exiting the Iran anti-nuclear deal, made a direct request for Saudi Arabia to increase production in order to offset the oil price impact of renewed sanctions against Iran.Oil traded down about 1% early Monday. West Texas Intermediate was hovering just at the $65 per barrel level, down about 11% from a May 22 high.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:These 5 Financial Stocks Are In Or Near Buy ZonesFed Rate Hike, Trump-Kim Summit, E3: Investing Action PlanTop Stock Ends Week In Buy Zone; Poised To Pop Next Week?Earnings Options: RH Rallies Ahead Of Earnings, But There Are Risks

2,SRE,"The long-running bankruptcy saga of Energy Future Holdings is coming to a close now that Texas has approved the sale of the company's crown jewel.X The Texas Public Utility Commission authorized Sempra Energy's (SRE) $9.45 billion purchase of Oncor Electric Delivery, the state's largest utility, on Thursday. It was the last major step needed to end the almost four-year-old Energy Future bankruptcy, which rivaled Enron's as the largest ever for an energy company. A bankruptcy court approved Oncor's sale last month.""It's the end of a long and twisting road,"" said Paul Patterson, a utility analyst for Glenrock Associates. ""Sempra was able to prevail over several suitors.""Hit by a collapse in natural gas prices, Energy Future was forced to sell Oncor, one of the most sought-after U.S. utilities, as it worked to restructure almost $50 billion in debt. Sempra beat out Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), NextEra Energy (NEE) and a group backed by Hunt Consolidated, which all tried and failed to buy the utility in recent years. Berkshire took a pretax loss of $837 million on a $2 billion Energy Future debt investment in 2013, and Buffett has called it ""a big mistake,"" saying he wishes he'd never heard of the company.""Sempra Energy is committed to being a good partner for the state and is supportive of Oncor's mission to provide Texans with safe, reliable and affordable electric service,"" said Debra L. Reed, chairwoman, president and CEO of Sempra Energy, who called the approval a ""significant milestone.""PUC Chairman DeAnn Walker thanked Sempra for agreeing to conditions that the agency required for an Oncor sale. Attendees at the meeting in Austin, Texas, broke out in applause as the three-member commission voted to approve the transaction after many failed attempts.""It's so appropriate for a round of applause for all the work that has gone into this,"" Commissioner Brandy Marty Marquez said. ""It's been enormous.""Dallas-based Oncor offers steady, regulated returns in a state with a growing population and the highest electricity sales in the country. Oncor is Texas' largest transmission operator, managing about 134,000 miles (216,000 kilometers) of power lines that deliver electricity to about 10 million customers.Sempra runs power and gas utilities in Southern California, Chile and Peru that together serve more than 32 million consumers, according to the company's website. It also owns and operates almost 2,400 megawatts of renewable energy capacity with partners.""They like Texas,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kit Konolige said of Sempra. ""It's obviously the center of the energy industry.""Before the bankruptcy, Energy Future was the target of the largest-ever leveraged buyout, when it was taken private for $48 billion in 2007 by a group led by KKR & Co. (KKR) and TPG Capital LP.Meanwhile, in commodity markets, West Texas Intermediate crude fell 1% to $60.53 a barrel. Gold dropped 0.4% to $1,320.68 an ounce.

3,SRE,"Russian hackers are attacking critical U.S. infrastructure, including the energy grid, nuclear power plants, and airports, according to U.S. government officials.XWater processing plants are among the other targets being repeatedly tested by rolling attacks. Last year, more than a dozen power plants in seven states were breached due to Russia's ongoing campaign of cyberattacks.Energy Secretary Rick Perry told the House Appropriations Subcommittee Thursday cyberattacks are ""literally happening hundreds of thousands of times a day. ... The warfare that goes on in the cyberspace is real, it's serious, and we must lead the world.""Such attacks were cited as being one of the reasons the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a series of Russian organizations and individuals Thursday. In a doomsday scenario, such attacks could leave millions without water and electricity.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUtility giant Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) was up 2.1% on the stock market today. Duke Energy (DUK) rose 1.1%, Sempra Energy (SRE) 0.7%, Edison International (EIX) 1.8% and Southern Co. (SO) 0.6%.An alert issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI Thursday laid out in more detail what the Russians have been targeting, and how they are going about it.""Since at least March 2016, Russian government cyber actors ... targeted government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors,"" the alert said.The techniques being employed include sending spear-phishing emails from compromised legitimate accounts, host-based exploitation and the targeting of industrial control system infrastructure.Russian operatives are also using the hacks for credentials gathering and open-source and network reconnaissance.While the alert did not disclose how successful the attacks were, it said hackers ""targeted small commercial facilities' networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks."" They also tried to hide their activities by creating new accounts on the staging targets to perform cleanup operations.While information theft was one of the goals, a key prize would have been gaining control of systems used by infrastructure. They could then launch attacks that could leave millions without water and power.An even more worrying prospect would be hackers gaining control of a nuclear power plant. A sudden shutdown can trigger safety systems designed to disperse excess heat and prevent a meltdown, though safety systems themselves may be vulnerable to attack. However, the operating systems used at such plants are usually decades-old legacy controls that cannot be exploited by hackers.The Department of Homeland Security previously said cyberattacks on critical infrastructure are ""one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:As Trump Sanctions Putin's Russia, Will Dems Revert To Their Fallback Position — Appeasement?

5,SRE,"Dominion Energy (D) will buy Scana (SCG) for $7.9 billion in a stock-for-stock deal, scooping up a utility battered by a failed nuclear project that's drawn scrutiny from federal and state regulators.The transaction is valued at about $14.6 billion including the assumption of debt, according to a statement Wednesday. Scana shareholders will receive 0.669 share of Dominion for each share of Scana, equal to about 55.35 a share as of Tuesday's close. The acquisition is expected to close in 2018 pending regulatory and shareholder approval, according to the statement.Scana made an attractive target as the company's market value plummeted after the utility halted a controversial nuclear expansion in late July. Federal and state investigators are probing the project, which triggered a review of the law that allows utilities to charge customers for unfinished or abandoned power plant projects.""Dominion acquiring Scana makes a lot of sense,"" Shahriar Pourreza, a New York-based analyst for Guggenheim Securities, said by phone Wednesday. Dominion is building a major natural gas pipeline, the Atlantic Coast line, to the South Carolina border, and state officials want it extended, he said. The line could serve Scana customers.Scana shares were trading 22% higher at 47.39 before the opening bell on the stock market today. They had dropped 47% over the past year. Dominion traded down 4.7% to 76.50 a share.The deal is the latest in a string of massive utility mergers: The industry saw a combined $68.2 billion of acquisitions in 2017, the most in a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stagnant electricity prices and tight profit margins have stoked the buying spree.The acquisition would include a more than $1.7 billion write-off of existing V.C. Summer 2 and 3 capital and regulatory assets, allowing the elimination of all related customer costs over 20 years.Last year's biggest utility deal was the Sempra Energy (SRE) acquisition of Oncor Electric Delivery Co., the largest transmission-line operator in Texas, for $18.8 billion. Sempra outbid Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), which had offered $18.2 billion. In October, Dynegy (DYN) and Vistra Energy (VIST), both in Texas, agreed to merge in a transaction valued at $10.5 billion.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Should Top China Tech Stocks Alibaba, Baidu Be On Your Radar?How To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

Buffett is known for shying away from bidding wars.Sempra said that as part of the deal, Oncor CEO Bob Shapard will become executive chairman of the Oncor board.

36,SRE,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) won a major contract to supply utility-scale battery to Southern California Edison to prevent shortages following a massive methane leak that took months to plug and displaced some 8,000 Californians.Tesla will supply 20 megawatts -- 80 MW per hour -- of battery storage for SoCal Edison, the largest subsidiary of Edison International (EIX). That's enough to power 2,500 homes for a day, Tesla said.Tesla said the batteries will be in place and running by the end of the year, becoming ""the largest lithium ion battery storage project in the world.""The exact size of the deal is unclear. A two megawatt battery costs $2.9 million, but the company and Edison likely negotiated given the project's size.Tesla shares rose 2% to 200.42 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla shares rose Thursday on the battery news and general market rally, retaking its 10-day moving average for the first time since Aug. 23. But the stock is far below a proper buy point. But take a look at four top stocks breaking out Thursday. CEO Elon Musk has long wanted to make Tesla more than just an electric car company, creating a Tesla Energy unit. Tesla is building a battery Gigafactory that will supply its cars but also home and utility-scale storage.Musk also has cited Tesla's storage capabilities as justification for buying SolarCity (SCTY), the solar installer and panel maker.SolarCity rose 1.3% to 17.10.

53,SRE,"Update: The Energy Department on Wednesday approved federal loan guarantees for two green energy projects totaling more than $1 billion. It approved $337 million for a Mesquite Solar project in Arizona and $737 million for a Solar Reserve project in Nevada. The projects would create a total of 52-55 permanent jobs, according to earlier DOE figures and company statements. That's about $20 million per permanent job.****The Department of Energy is set this week to announce whether nine federal loan guarantees amounting to $6.5 billion for green energy projects will get final approval.The number of full-time, permanent jobs they would create? According to the DOE's own figures, a grand total of 283. That is nearly $23 million per job.It's also a drop in the bucket toward the five million green jobs President Obama promised as a candidate in 2008.It's not clear how many of the loans will get approved. The DOE refused comment prior to the announcements.In the last week, the DOE has approved three loans totaling $624 million and creating 110 permanent jobs. But two other big loan projects totaling nearly $2 billion reportedly fell through.The program has come under increased scrutiny ever since solar panel maker Solyndra went bankrupt late last month. Taxpayers are potentially on the hook for $527 million.Jerry Taylor, senior policy analyst for the free-market Cato Institute, says the whole program shows that the federal government should not be picking private-sector winners and losers.""It's a lot of money for very few jobs if you do the math,"" Taylor said. ""If nobody in the private sector is willing to invest their capital, that's a pretty good signal.""That also goes for loans to projects like nuclear power, which Republicans tend to favor, he added.Some projects do get private capital as well — Solyndra did — but the federal loans can be key to bringing in private funds.The program, part of the 2009 stimulus, ""catalyzes American innovation and private-sector investment behind promising companies,"" the DOE said in a statement.So far, the DOE has issued over $10 billion in loan guarantees for 21 projects — including Solyndra — and claims to have created about 2,300 permanent jobs.""The program expires on the 30th, so they cannot close any more loans after that,"" said DOE spokesman Damien LaVera.Most of the nine potential projects are seeking several hundred million dollars in loan guarantees. None proposes to create more than a few dozen permanent jobs. Ironically, Nordic Windpower USA, despite seeking the smallest loan, $16 million, has reportedly promised the most permanent jobs, 75.The nine projects also would create about 3,650 construction jobs, but those are temporary.Sempra Energy (SRE), for example, wants $398 million for its Mesquite Solar Project in Arizona. It's projected to employ 300 people during construction, but just seven full-time positions.Spokesman Scott Crider told IBD that Sempra actually is seeking $375 million. He defended the project despite the handful of jobs created. The loan will be paid back, he said, adding: ""We are going to have a 150-megawatt solar facility supplying clean energy to California.""That the funds are loans, not grants, is often cited by green jobs fans. But the Solyndra failure has underscored the risks.

64,SRE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) recently made an announcement regarding its plan to sell several energy infrastructure assets, including its entire U.S. based renewable portfolio and midstream assets. The company's board of directors gave the final nod for the asset sales on Jun 25, based on a comprehensive strategic review of its businesses and asset portfolio over the past year.Details of the Optimization InitiativesIn an attempt to transform itself into a leading energy company, Sempra plans to sell the company's entire U.S. wind and solar asset portfolio along with some of its midstream assets. This sellout comes as the first phase of a multistage portfolio optimization initiative that the company has lately designed for further strengthening its strategic focus and creating value for shareholders.The planned sales include the company’s solar and wind assets with a total generating capacity of approximately 2,600 megawatts, along with projects already in development stage. It also includes joint-venture and some tax-equity investments.Also, part of the planned sales are its domestic Midstream assets that include the Mississippi Hub, an underground salt dome with 22 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas storage capacity, compression and pipeline facilities, and its 90.9% ownership stake in a 20 Bcf natural gas storage facility named the Bay Gas Storage Company.Several important factors were taken into consideration, pertaining to the strategic portfolio review. These factors include the deployment of additional capital for improving critical utility infrastructure, changes in the U.S. tax code and regulatory developments, and strategic growth opportunities in California.The company expects to have incurred after-tax impairment charges of approximately $870-$925 million in the second quarter of 2018 due to the planned asset sales.Benefits of the InitiativeThe latest announced strategy of Sempra Energy comes as part of the company’s Vision 2022 plan that includes a disciplined, three-phase execution of portfolio optimization and divestitures, for strengthening its focus on North American business model. Per this plan, the company expects to witness a solid 13% annualized growth in its earnings per share (EPS) for the period of 2018-2022. We assume proceeds from the latest divestiture deal to partially boost Sempra Energy’s aforementioned EPS growth expectations.Portfolio optimization typically maximizes expected return from investment and minimizes costs. In this line, the planned monetization of Sempra Energy’s assets should favorably support the company’s future growth opportunities in its other U.S. businesses. The proceeds from the planned asset sales may further help Sempra Energy in reducing its equity financing.Such strategic implementation of plans, in turn, should strengthen the company’s balance sheet, along with positioning it to meet global customer needs and drive additional shareholder value.Price PerformanceSempra Energy has underperformed the industry in the last year. During this period, the company’s shares have gained 3.5% compared with its industry’s growth of 11.3%. The underperformance may have been caused by stiff competition that Sempra Energy faces throughout the United States. Zacks Rank & Key PicksSempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space include Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWN  -  Free Report), Atmos Energy (ATO  -  Free Report) and Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (CPK  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

65,SRE,"Match Group, Inc. (MTCH  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results on Aug 1.The company went public in Nov 2015 and in its first earnings announcement, as a publicly-traded company, Match Group had missed earnings estimates by 5.3%.The succeeding quarters proved to be better, with the company’s earnings missing estimates just once and managing two beats in the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 3.2%. Last quarter, it missed estimates by 20%.Let's see how things are shaping up for its seventh earnings report as a public company.Key Factors Influencing Q2 ResultsMatch Group is the world’s foremost provider of dating products and operates a portfolio of over 45 brands. Three of its biggest and best known brands are Match.com, OkCupid and Tinder. The company’s reputation, established user base and size should prove to be favorable in the upcoming earnings.About 60% of the company’s revenues come directly from users of its dating services in North America, mostly in the form of membership subscriptions. Online dating has been expanding, as users from more demographics join the fray. Most of Match Group’s users connect from mobile devices, where conversion to paid members is also higher. Last quarter, its dating revenues rose 15% year over year, driven by solid contribution from Tinder, PlentyOfFish, Pairs and Meetic. This momentum bodes well for the company’s top-line growth in the quarter under review.Match Group has been making profits for the past three years and recording top-line growth as well. The company is currently enjoying strong growth, driven by robust growth momentum at Tinder, solid performances from Meetic and Match, as well as the recently acquired, PlentyOfFish.However, the company is vulnerable to the cannibalization of users and revenues across its competing platforms. In fact, its average revenue per paying user was flat year over year in the last reported quarter, reflecting the shift of the company’s focus toward lower-paying brands, such as Tinder and OkCupid. The numbers were also adversely affected by appreciation of the U.S. dollar. These factors might dent the company’s top line in this quarter too. Also, the company has planned higher marketing expenditure for the second quarter, which should burden profits.In addition, the company’s performance has suffered due to Affinity brands and their continued control run-off, which has reduced the paid member count (“PMC”) significantly on a year-over-year basis.Further, the company has been struggling with monetization of its services, in the face of intensifying competition in the online dating space, with apps like Bumble, Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel. This might just prove detrimental to the company’s top-line growth in the coming quarters.Match Group had earlier anticipated year-over-year revenue growth of 15–20% in 2017. However, recent currency trends (strengthening U.S. dollar against the Euro and the Yen), will likely hurt those projections. Also, the company expects ARPPU growth to be flat in the near future.In the last quarterly report, Match Group had reiterated its revenue projections of $1.26–$1.31 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of $450–$470 million for full-year 2017.Match Group, Inc.

69,SRE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) has received an approval from California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to add nearly five energy storage projects totaling 83.5 megawatts (MW) to its current storage capacity. Also, the company won a nod for the demand response program of 4.5 MW from CPUC. The company expects to this project to come online by next year to continue its initiative for a greener San Diego.Energy storage is essential to conserve electricity to be used later when demand is high but supply is low.The company is committed to supplement more energy storage is the system and has plans to add another 330 MW of storage facility by 2030. The increased storage capacity will help it improve power grid reliability and provide more of renewable, cleaner and sustainable future to its customers.Need for Storage CapacityRenewable Energy is attaining popularity as no pollutant is released during electricity generation. However, the greatest drawback of producing energy from a renewable source is the non- availability of the primary resources of sunlight and wind pressure 24X7. Sometimes, excessive renewable energy output is issued when the weather is favorable and demand for power is low.Energy Storage facilities are a solution to above-mentioned problems. Renewable energy stored in the batteries could be used during high demand without weighing on the fossil fuel plants. In a way, these energy storage facilities will help accelerate growth of renewable energy generation plants and lower the emission level.  As of Mar 31, 2018, per U.S. Department of Energy, the United States boasts an electric energy storage capacity of more than 25 gigawatts (GW). Of the total capacity, 94% is in the form of pumped hydroelectric storage and the rest 6% in the form of battery, thermal storage, compressed air and flywheel.Importance of RenewableRenewable Energy source has been gaining momentum globally. Wind and solar power have been two of the fastest growing sources of electricity generation on the international front over the past decade. In 2017, global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11%, bringing the global total to 540 GW. Projections by the International Energy Agency indicate that renewable energy will continue to grow more rapidly than fossil fuels over the next two decades.Per U.S. Energy Information Administration report, during 2014-2017 time period, renewable sources accounted for more than 50% of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States. In 2018, 9 GW of new solar and wind assets will be added, showing the rising significance of renewable sources across the United States.Sempra Energy’s Take on RenewableAs for renewables, the company is focused on adding solar, wind and hydro assets to its portfolio. As of Mar 31, 2018, IEnova (one of the company’s units) plans to invest $130 million in development, construction and operation of the Don Diego Solar Complex, a 125 MW solar facility in Sonora, Mexico. Management expects operations at the solar project to commence in the second half of 2019.Last December, the company’s portfolio contained 1,590 MW of solar and wind power operations. Looking forward, realizing the growth opportunities in the renewable energy sources, onshore wind and PV solar capacity additions are expected to average 8 GW and 12 GW, respectively, for the company per year through 2021. A steady focus on the expansion of its renewable capacity will enable the company to provide emission-free power to its clients.Price MovementIn the past month, shares of Sempra Energy have underperformed the Zacks Utility industry.

74,SRE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) recently closed the acquisition of Energy Future Holdings Corp., the parent company of Oncor. Energy Future had 80% indirect ownership in Oncor. The buyout  now has thus transferred Oncor’s 80% stake to Sempra EnergyDetails of the DealThe deal has a total enterprise value of about $18.8 billion, including Oncor’s debt and a cash worth $9.45 billion.Notably, the company entered into the buyout agreement on Aug 21, 2017 and was recently granted regulatory approvals from The Public Utility Commission of Texas and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Post the buyout, Allen Nye — Oncor’s senior vice-president will be its new CEO, succeeding Bob Shapard, who becomes the company’s new chairman.Benefits of the BuyoutWith the completion of the Oncor takeover, Sempra Energy has the largest U.S. customer base. Moreover, the buyout has added Texas’ largest electric transmission and distribution provider to Sempra Energy’s portfolio, thereby expanding its market size where it currently operates only 10 power plants. Notably, Oncor’s plants provides electricity to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses in Texas and with its acquisition Sempra Energy’s customer base is thus poised to grow.Apart from expanding the company’s regulated earnings base, the deal is poised to enhance Sempra Energy’s business mix and boost its future growth in the Texas energy market and U.S. Gulf Coast region.Moreover, per terms of the agreement, Sempra Energy will support Oncor's plan to invest $7.5 billion of capital over a five-year period to expand and reinforce its transmission and distribution network. Such planned investments will enhance the service territories of Oncor and thereby enable Sempra Energy to profitably grow in size and numbers.Sempra Energy earlier anticipated that the buyout would be accretive to the company’s earnings post acquisition. In line with this, during its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, the company announced that it expects the Oncor buyout to be accretive to its 2018 earnings by 20 cents per share. We expect the company’s upcoming results to duly reflect these positive synergies from the Oncor buyout.Price PerformanceSempra Energy has marginally underperformed the broader industry over a year. During this period, the company’s shares remained muted versus the industry’s gain of 1.0%. The underperformance may have been caused by stiff competition throughout the U.S. and the company’s exposure to foreign currency risks.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksSempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Just Energy Group, Inc.

PUCT’s sanction is a significant milestone achieved by the company as it will facilitate the completion of the pending Energy Future Holdings Corp. (“EFH”) buyout, the parent company of Oncor.What’s the Deal?In August 2017, Sempra Energy announced that it is set to buy EFH and in turnTexas’ electrical grid giant Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC (Oncor) as well.  Including Oncor’s debt, the enterprise value of Sempra's proposed offer for the Oncor buyout is $18.8 billion. Notably, the company aims at acquiring 80% ownership of Oncor.

(BRK.B  -  Free Report) that has been bidding for this regulated utility since July 2017.Synergies from the AcquisitionThe deal will add Texas’ largest electric transmission and distribution provider to Sempra Energy’s portfolio, thereby expanding its market in the state where it currently operates only 10 power plants. Apart from expanding the company’s regulated earnings base, this deal will boost Sempra Energy’s future growth in the Texas energy market and U.S. Gulf Coast region.Meanwhile, management at Sempra Energy believes this transaction will enhance the company’s business mix and provide increased and more geographically diversified utility earnings.Sempra Energy earlier announced that the buyout, expected to be over by the first half of 2018, will be accretive to its earnings, beginning in 2018.

77,SRE,"Sempra Energy’s (SRE  -  Free Report) Mexican subsidiary, Infraestructura Energética Nova, S.A.B. de C.V. (IEnova) recently unveiled a liquid fuels project worth approximately $130 million. Per the terms, IEnova will construct a marine liquid fuels terminal at the La Jovita Energy Hub in the port city of Ensenada. The terminal, which is known as Baja Refinados, will operate as a receipt, storage and send-out terminal.Details of the ProjectPer the contract, in addition to developing the terminal, IEnova will be responsible for obtaining permits and providing engineering, construction and financing services. It will also supervise the work related to operations and maintenance.On completion, the Baja Refinados terminal will have a capacity to supply 1 million barrels of gasoline and diesel in the Mexican state of Baja California. IEnova expects to commence operations at the project around the second half of 2020.Moreover, IEnova entered into a long-term agreement with Chevron Combustibles de México, which will allow it to utilize 50% of the facility's storage and fuel capacity for supplying liquid fuel to Chevron service stations and other commercial and industrial consumers in the Baja California region. The agreement will also enable Chevron to acquire 20% of the project’s equity ownership, once its commercial operations commences.Our ViewThe new liquid fuels terminal project marks an expansion of business operations for IEnova in Mexico, where the company already enjoys a strong presence. Moreover, realizing the growing energy market in the region, IEnova has been making significant investments lately. In this line IEnova plans to build and operate two storage terminals near Puebla and Mexico City with storage capacities of 500,000 and 800,000 barrels, respectively.Notably, Mexico’s growth prospects in terms of its energy sector has improved lately, catalyzed by the comprehensive Energy Reform implemented in 2013, after it suffered a major setback a few years back owing to its declining oil-production. Per a report published by the International Energy Agency, Mexico’s total energy demand is expected to increase by approximately 20% by 2040 from 2016’s level, with increasing dominance of liquid fuels in power generations. This has prompted energy services provider like Sempra Energy to expand its footprints in the nation by constructing new projects like the latest one.Over the next five years, the Zacks’ estimate for Sempra Energy’s long-term EPS growth stands at 8.99%, with a total capital investment assumption of $24.8 billion. Considering the above mentioned developments, we believe the recent liquid fuel terminal project further strengthens Sempra Energy’s confidence in the IEnova unit as one of its major growth drivers over the next several years.Price PerformanceSempra Energy has marginally underperformed the broader industry over a year. During this period, the company’s shares lost 1.1% as against the broader industry’s loss of 0.1%. The underperformance may have been caused by stiff competition throughout the United States and the company’s exposure to foreign currency risks. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderSempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same space are South Jersey Industries (SJI  -  Free Report), NewJersey Resources Corporation (NJR  -  Free Report) and Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (CPK  -  Free Report). While South Jersey Industries andNewJersey Resources sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Chesapeake Utilities carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

80,SRE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings. On a bright note, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 13.49%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayLast September and October, Sempra Energy entered into membership interest purchase agreements with financial institutions to form tax equity limited liability companies that include a wind power generation project located in Huron County, MI, and a solar power generation project near Fresno, CA. The company expects to gain cash proceeds of $270-$300 million in the period from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2018. We believe part of this cash will boost the upcoming quarterly results.However, the Aliso Canyon gas leak event led to an estimated loss of $841 million at the end of the third quarter, wider than the prior-quarter loss. These costs may rise considerably, which in turn will adversely the company’s quarterly earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sempra Energy’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.13 billion, displaying an 8.9% annual gain. The same for earnings stands at $1.40, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 7.9%.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Sempra Energy this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, Sempra Energy lacks both the attributes, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

81,SRE,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Sempra Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.9. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Sempra Energy’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Gas Distribution industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Sempra Energy has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 19.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Sempra Energy stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Sempra Energy has a P/S ratio of about 2.5. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Sempra Energy currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Sempra Energy a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Sempra Energy is just 2.2, a level that is lower than the industry average of 3.7. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, SRE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Sempra Energy might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A This gives SRE a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging. The current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched UP by 0.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:PRICE AND CONSENSUS CHARTDespite this bullish trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Sempra Energy Price and Consensus Sempra Energy Price and Consensus | Sempra Energy QuoteSempra Energy is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 40% out of more than 250 industries) further strengthens its growth potential. So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

83,SRE,"Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (CPK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 3. Last quarter, the company reported a negative surprise of 19.86%.Let’s see how things are shaping prior to this quarter.Factors to ConsiderChesapeake Utilitiesexpects to incur approximately $241 millions in organic capital expenditure for 2017. Heavy expansion expenses in this front are likely to have a material impact in the to-be-reported quarter as well.In first-quarter 2017, the company’s Xeron subsidiary, engaged in propane and crude oil trading, began winding down operations. This is likely to be partially reflected in the company’s gross margin number, in the second quarter. However, we can expect a decline in pre-tax losses and severance costs arising out of this business previously.To support and continue the company’s growth objectives, management has expanded resources around Eastern Shore, with additional expansion expenses in its transmission system. Such expansion along with continued growth in Aspire Energy, PESCO and Eight Flags businesses, would require additional staff and corporate resources. This in turn is likely to get reflected in the company’s increased operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, margins per retail gallon have rebounded to normal levels recently, driven by higher propane prices and better market conditions. We expect this stability to continue in the second quarter also and get duly reflected in the upcoming results.However, stiff competition with other propane suppliers along with fluctuations in the availability and price of alternative energy sources may hurt the company’s margins in the upcoming quarterly results.Chesapeake Utilities Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Chesapeake Utilities Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chesapeake Utilities Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Chesapeake Utilities is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

84,SRE,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 3.Quanta Services has had a dismal earnings surprise history, with three misses and one in-line earnings over the trailing four quarters, for an average negative surprise of 17.3%. Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.5%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderQuanta Services has been deriving strong benefits from its diligent three-pronged growth strategy. The strategy focuses on the timely delivery of projects, leveraging on its core business areas to expand in complementary service lines and venturing into new service lines as well.Quanta Services’ thriving engineering and project management services are expected to boost its revenues for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Of late, the company has been witnessing a solid rebound in its end markets, on the back of key growth drivers, like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and implementation of clean energy initiatives.Moreover, the company is currently pursuing several high-voltage electric transmission award opportunities, amid substantial bidding activity, in Australia, Canada and the U.S. Quanta Services’ optimism stems from healthy backlog levels which are anticipated to benefit the results in the to-be-reported quarter. We believe that these positive industry trends will act as major growth catalysts for the quarter to be reported.Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteThis apart, robust pipeline projects in the oil and gas sector, supported by active bidding and negotiating environment, can also act as huge profit churners for the top line in the second quarter. In addition, Quanta Services’ previously completed acquisitions are likely to contribute significantly to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment’s top line.However, Quanta Services has been grappling with adverse weather conditions in recent times. In the last reported quarter, the company’s revenue growth was marred by regulatory delays on some large mainline pipe projects and fluctuations in timing of large projects. Also, the company believes that obtaining sighting and permission for energy infrastructure projects may continue to dent profitability.Going forward, the company expects fluctuations in backlog due to its faster book-and-burn nature and the timing of larger pipeline project awards. Moreover, there is the risk of oil and gas customers delaying commencement of work, which could impact margins in the quarter to be reported.Further, the initial optimism surrounding Donald Trump's infrastructure plan seems to have waned, as worries grow about the feasibility of the plan. The plan to improve America's infrastructure could have provided a welcome boost to Quanta Services’ operations and profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quanta Services will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at -6.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 47 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Quanta Services’ Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, but its negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.25% and a Zacks Rank #2.

85,SRE,"GoPro, Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell on Aug 3.The company has had a decent earnings history, having beaten estimates thrice over the trailing four quarters, for a modest average positive surprise of 4.2%. Last quarter, GoPro trumped estimates by 1.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderGoPro’s HERO5 cameras are enjoying impressive market traction and this is likely to reflect well on the company’s quarterly results. The HERO5 camera is proving to be particularly popular in China and Europe. Also, the company has been booking strong accessory revenues lately, and this is anticipated to boost the top line in the quarter under review as well.GoPro’s first-quarter results were favorably impacted, backed by significant reduction in operating expenses. Interestingly, the first-quarter earnings results reflected some of the first positive developments the company has seen in several quarters. The to-be-reported quarter’s profits should also benefit from its intensive cost-cutting and restructuring measures.GoPro’s optimism stems from its company-wide restructuring efforts, which include a combination of programs to cut costs. These comprise reduction of total workforce by 15%, shutting down the entertainment division and reduction of office space. These efforts will undoubtedly drive earnings for the quarter higher.The company’s stock has had a dismal run on the bourse – having declined 34.3% over the past one year – in stark contrast to the industry’s average position return of 21.6%.We believe that GoPro is well poised to capitalize on the fast-growing consumer drone market through its Karma. Karma’s success is an integral part of GoPro’s return to growth, along with the Hero5 cameras.In light of a relatively strong first quarter, the company gave a decent guidance for second-quarter 2017. It projects revenues of about $270 million (+/- 10 million) for the quarter. The company expects gross margin to be 33.5% (+/- 1%).However, in light of the recent positive developments at the company, some analysts have become increasingly bullish on the stock lately, with the company’s estimates moving north over the past month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 narrowed from a loss of 50 cents to a loss of 43 cents over the past 30 days.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GoPro, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that GoPro will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 34 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: GoPro has a Zacks Rank #3, but the company’s ESP of 0.00% reduces the chances of a positive earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.25% and a Zacks Rank #2.

86,SRE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) announced that its Mexican subsidiary — Infraestructura Energética Nova, S.A.B. de C.V. (IEnova) — has secured a $150 million contract for liquid fuels project from the Topolobampo Port Administration in Mexico. Per the terms of the agreement, IEnova will construct and operate a marine liquid fuels terminalin Sinaloa.Notably, this latest project will operate as a receipt, storage and send-out terminal.About the ProjectPer the deal, IEnova will conduct the entire development process of this terminal that includes obtaining customer contracts and permits, engineering, procurement and construction as well as providing financing services. It will also supervise the work related to operations and maintenance.On completion, the first phase of the Topolobampo terminal will have a capacity to store 1 million barrels of gasoline and diesel. IEnova expects to commence operations at the terminal in the fourth quarter of 2020.Details of future phases of the project are not yet been disclosed but may have provisions for additional fuel storage capacity and storage of petrochemicals.Our ViewPer a report published by the International Energy Agency, Mexico’s total energy demand is expected to increase by approximately 20% by 2040 from 2016’s level, with increasing dominance of liquid fuels in power generations. This surely reflects solid growth prospects of the energy sector in Mexico, with liquid fuels at its center. This has set the stage for energy services providers like Sempra Energy to expand its footprints in Mexico by constructing new liquid fuels projects like the latest one.Impressively, with Mexico opening up its energy sector to private investment in 2014, IEnova has invested more than $7.7 billion in assets and ranks among the largest energy companies in the country. In liquid fuels market, which has a value of $10 billion, the company is increasingly engaging in construction of fuel terminals.For instance, in April 2018, IEnova announced that it will construct a marine liquid fuels terminal worth $130 million at the La Jovita Energy Hub in Ensenada. In sync with this, the latest Topolobampo project marks further expansion of business operations for IEnova in Mexico, where the company already enjoys a solid presence.Such project constructions and their subsequent operationsshould increase Sempra Energy’s shares in the Mexico’s energy market, which the company believes to have a value of $45 billion.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, Sempra Energy has underperformed the industry it belongs to. Shares of the company have gained 4.4% compared with the industry’s 12.6% rise. This underperformance may have been caused due to stiff competition that Sempra Energy faces across the United States as well as its exposure to foreign currency risks.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSempra Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Atmos Energy Coporation (ATO  -  Free Report), ONEOK, Inc. (OKE  -  Free Report) and Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (CPK  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

90,SRE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 37.50%. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 14.78%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Sempra Energy may beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components.Zacks Rank: Sempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Sempra Energy has an Earnings ESP of +0.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.06, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The combination of Sempra Energy’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayAt the onset of the third quarter, Sempra Energy’s Mexican unit IEnova secured a liquid fuels project worth $155 million from the Mexican authority. Per the terms, IEnova will construct a receipt, storage and send-out liquid fuels marine terminal on the Mexican Gulf Coast. This deal will expand business operations for IEnova in Mexico by exploiting the booming energy market in the region.We believe impacts from this project to get reflected in the company’s third-quarter sales growth. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus estimate for Sempra Energy’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.78 billion, displaying a 9.5% annual upside.Moreover, Sempra Energy faces foreign exchange exposure in Mexcio and South America, wherein it does not hedge additional costs. These might weigh on the company’s quarterly earnings. Nevertheless, during second-quarter earnings call, management declared that it expects to gain $30 million of additional hedge income in the second half of the year, which in turn will largely offset its year-to-date foreign exchange losses in Mexico. Surely, this additional hedge income will have a partial favorable impact on the company’s to-be-reported quarterly result.Further, the Aliso Canyon gas leak event lead to an estimated loss of $832 million for the company by the end of the second quarter, higher than the prior-quarter figure. On a bright note, Sempra Energy received approval to reinstate natural gas injections at the Aliso Canyon storage field. However, management has expressed concern in relation to system reliability for resuming these gas injections this summer and in the coming winter given the limitations on targeted gas storage levels.A disciplined cost-management system has been driving Sempra Energy’s earnings. In line with this, for the third quarter, our consensus estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at $1.05, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.7%.Sempra Energy Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sempra Energy Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sempra Energy QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other players in the Utility sector that also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NiSource, Inc.

92,SRE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Infraestructura Energética Nova, S.A.B. de C.V. (IEnova), has acquired Pemex Transformación Industrial's (Pemex) participation in Ductos y Energeticos del Norte. Thanks to this acquisition, IEnova’s share in the Los Ramones II Norte pipeline will increase to 50% from 25%.Deal DetailsLos Ramones II Norte connects the Los Ramones I pipeline and the Los Ramones II Sur pipeline in central Mexico. IEnova acquired Pemex’s share in this pipeline for $231 million and also assumed Pemex’s debt in it of $289 million.This 452 km 42-inch diameter Los Ramones II Norte pipeline commenced operations in February 2016. It transports natural gas from Nuevo Leon to San Luis Potosí. This pipeline has the ability to transport 1.42 billion cubic feet day (Bcf/d) and has two compressor stations.This acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017, once all the necessary approvals are received from the concerned authorities.Mexico’s Demand for Natural GasMexico has been registering an increase in demand for natural gas, primarily due to its electricity and industrial sector. Per a report from FTI Consulting, Mexico’s natural gas demand will grow to 9.2 Bcf/d or 22% above 2015 levels by 2030 and imports will rise 53% to 5.4 Bcf/d.In excess of 50% of the natural gas demand in Mexico will be met through imports and the natural gas producers of United States will play a key role. The natural gas pipelines will play a crucial role to transport this much needed volume of natural gas to Mexico from the United States.Our ViewGiven the current capacity of Los Ramones II Norte Pipeline, it nearly accounts for nearly 19% of the total natural gas transported in Mexico. No doubts, increasing stake in such a pipeline will boost the profitability of Sempra Energy.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Its efforts on maximizing shareholders value through regular dividend payments will retain investors’ interest in the stock.Notably, strong capital deployment strategies may have led the company to outperform its broader industry. Evidently, Sempra Energy’s share price has gained 19.3% on a year-to-date basis, higher than the broader industry’s 11.2% gain.On the flip side, Sempra Energy has been suffering, with the nuclear industry facing difficult times, given the availability of low-priced natural gas and the government-subsidized wind sector. Meanwhile, the permanent shutdown of Units 2 and 3 of the company’s San Onofre Nuclear Generating Stations (SONGS) in California is likely to worsen the situation. Moreover, the company continues to incur considerable expenses in relation to the Aliso Canyon gas leak, which in turn may bring down its operating profit.The company also faces tough competition from its peers like Just Energy Group, Inc. (JE  -  Free Report), NewJersey Resources Corporation (NJR  -  Free Report) and Clean Energy Fuels Corporation (CLNE  -  Free Report).Zacks RankSempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The same for earnings is at $1.67, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 4%.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not indicate earnings beat for Sempra Energy in the quarter to be reported.

99,SRE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Aug 4.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 9.43%. Moreover, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 0.16%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Sempra Energy is likely to beat estimates this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates, and Huntington Ingalls has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +11.25%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 89 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Sempra Energy holds a Zacks Rank #2, which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Sempra Energy Price and EPS Surprise Sempra Energy Price and EPS Surprise | Sempra Energy QuoteFactors at PlayAt the onset of the second quarter, Sempra Energy issued its long-term outlook, wherein apart from reiterating its 2017 EPS guidance, the company announced plans to invest $14.2 billion over the next five years. The announcement also included a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for EPS in the range of 10–11% and completion of 100 megawatts renewable projects, over the same period. Although the overall impact of these plans will be realized over the long term, the company most likely has started taking initiatives toward achieving them, which is expected to get reflected in the upcoming second-quarter results as well.During its first-quarter earnings call, Sempra Energy announced that its IEnova unit projects will complete three natural gas pipelines, worth $900 million by the end of the second quarter. Further updates on this project can be expected once Sempra Energy releases its second-quarter results. If completed, it will successfully boost the company’s growth.On the flip side, the Aliso Canyon gas leak event caused the company to incur estimated cost of $799 million in the first quarter, higher than the prior-quarter figure. Although, the company has resolved a number of key issues related to this event, there still remain a few that might continue to weigh down on the second-quarter results.Moreover, Sempra Energy faces foreign exchange exposure in Mexcio and South America, wherein it does not hedge the additional costs. These may hurt the company’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 80 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1.77%. Meanwhile, the estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.52 billion, displaying a 16.75% upside.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other Utility stocks worth considering on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat.Ameren Corp.

105,SRE,"As of Aug 2, 79.3% of the S&P 500 index’ market cap has come up with quarterly results. Out of this, 74% came up with an earnings beat, while 68% surpassed revenue estimates. Overall, earnings are now expected to record a 9.7% increase on 5.4% higher revenues, with 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors expecting positive earnings growth. The picture should become clearer by the end of this week, as a number of the index members are scheduled to come up with results.As far as the Utility sector is concerned, 58.6% of the stocks in this space have reported their quarterly results as of Aug 2. Of them, 64.7% came up with an earnings beat, while 58.8% exceeded revenue estimates. For Q2 as a whole, sector earnings are likely to improve 1.7% on 7.2% higher revenues. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our Earnings Outlook.Notably, companies in this space, characterized by their defensive nature and domestic orientation, need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This is likely to hurt the utilities.On a brighter note, the U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which has further boosted growth prospects for these utilities as opposed to those that are engaged in expanding their renewable resources.   Let’s take a look at four utilities – Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report), Ameren Corp. (AEE  -  Free Report), Vistra Energy Corp. (VST  -  Free Report) and Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.
