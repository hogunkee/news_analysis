4,AAP,"Regulation: As Facebook's privacy crisis grows, so too are calls for the government to regulate it, including from Republicans, the tech industry and Mark Zuckerberg himself. What could be wrong with that?Utah Republican Rep. Chris Stewart, for example, told CNN that ""I actually think it probably is"" time to regulate Facebook (FB) and other social media companies because ""these companies gather our private information and they monetize it.""Speaking at a China Development Forum in Beijing, Apple (APPL) Chairman Tim Cook said, when asked about Facebook, ""I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary.""Zuckerberg himself says that ""I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated,"" adding that ""I actually think the question is more 'What is the right regulation?' rather than 'Yes or no, should it be regulated?' ""So, with everyone seemingly in agreement — including the very company at the heart of the current scandal — why not regulate these companies?Let's leave aside for a moment the government's spectacularly bad track record when it comes to regulations, which include most recently the financial crisis in the heavily regulated banking industry.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe first question to ask is why should a company like Facebook be regulated?Here's Tim Cook's answer: ""The ability of anyone to know what you've been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life — from my own point of view it shouldn't exist.""But what Cook leaves out is that every bit of information Facebook has on its users — just as every bit of information Apple has on its own customers — has been volunteered by them, after they've agreed to the company's privacy provisions.Nor does he mention that consumers often volunteer personal information in exchange for a benefit or service — such as grocery store discount cards.Or why companies like Facebook — and Apple, and Google (GOOGL) and others — are interested in such data. It's not to snoop, but to create more personalized experiences and better targeted ads.Nor has Cook, or anyone else for that matter, made the case that the private sector can't handle this issue faster and more efficiently than a few dozen bureaucrats in Washington grinding out thousands of new rules.Facebook users are free to cancel their accounts, or switch to other social media services, if they think Facebook's privacy protections are insufficient. That's exactly what many are doing right now in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, with #DeleteFacebook even trending on Twitter.And it's why Facebook is buying full-page ads in newspapers proclaiming that if Facebook can't protect your information ""it doesn't deserve it"" and promising to ""do better for you.""Cook also labors under the delusion that the government is capable of ""well-crafted regulation."" If such a thing exists, we'd like to see it.Mostly, the government regulations manage to either make things worse or require endless new rules to deal with the distortions the previous ones created.Regulations tend to impede progress, not accelerate it. And more often than not, they hurt the very consumers they are supposed to help by raising prices and blocking competition. If you don't think so, look at the Federal Communications Commission's long and terrible history of consumer harm, which IBD has detailed.But there's a bigger problem here with these calls for regulations. Particularly when they come from industry.While conventional wisdom has it that companies oppose regulations, the opposite is more often the case, at least when it comes to large companies.As we have noted in this space before, big businesses often lobby for regulations. Why? Because big companies can hire an army of lobbyists to make sure the rules are written to their advantage. And they can absorb the costs of complying with those regulations. The same is not true for smaller competitors.As a result, regulations end up protecting existing industry giants — like, say, Facebook — who want to thwart new competition.That's why the airline industry bitterly fought against deregulation in the late 1970s, why some auto companies urged federal fuel economy standards, why Philip Morris backed tobacco regulations, why Goldman Sachs supported the heavy-handed Dodd-Frank banking regulations (admitting that Goldman would ""be the among the biggest beneficiaries of reform""), why H&R Block supports federal regulation of tax preparers.It was self-interest, not consumer protection, that prompted Google, Facebook, Netflix (NFLX) and others to aggressively support the FCC's massively intrusive ""net neutrality"" regulations, and then fight against their repeal.Has Facebook abused its trust with its members? That seems obvious, and Facebook is paying for this mistake and will likely continue to do so. If Facebook has violated any laws, it deserves what it gets in court.Meanwhile, the message to other social media companies is loud and clear — violate consumer trust at your own peril.By the time regulators get around to crafting rules for social media companies, the problem will have already been dealt with.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Funny, When Obama Harvested Facebook Data On Millions Of Users To Win In 2012, Everyone CheeredUber And Lyft Are Hurting Mass Transit?

O'Reilly was trading at its worst levels since the end of 2014.The news also slammed industry peers on the stock market today, with Advance Auto Parts (AAP) tumbling 11%, AutoZone (AZO) dropping more than 9% and Genuine Parts (GPC) falling 4.8%. Advance Auto Parts and AutoZone both hit 52-week lows.Shares of most aftermarket auto-parts retailers hit multiyear lows in early morning trade.O'Reilly, the largest auto-parts retailer by market capitalization, blamed the poor results on ""continued headwinds from a second consecutive mild winter and overall weak consumer demand.""""The comparable-store sales shortfall will also have a consequent impact on our operating profitability, which we will report in our full second-quarter earnings release on July 26,"" added O'Reilly CEO Greg Henslee.Shares of auto-parts retailers are also under pressure in recent months on concerns that Amazon (AMZN) could enter the market.Automakers including General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) also posted moderate losses early Wednesday.

"
22,AAP,"If you ever need proof of how traditional market forces can get turned upside down, look no further than the auto parts retail sector, where leaders like O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) continue to churn out strong financial and share price growth despite what would normally be a big threat to business.Normally, one would think auto parts retailers would worry in the wake of last year's robust market for new car sales. In the past, a rise in new car sales would have been bad news for the aftermarket auto parts business. New cars require less maintenance and repair work than older ones, meaning there is less demand for the kind of parts and services supplied by O’Reilly, as well as rivals such as AutoZone (AZO), Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and Genuine Parts (GPC).But that dynamic no longer applies, analysts say.""The kinds of things that benefit new vehicle sales -- an improving economy, improving employment, higher income -- also benefit the auto parts sector,"" CRT Capital Group analyst Ali Faghri told IBD.The figures might seem daunting. In 2015, the U.S. auto industry posted sales of 17.5 million light vehicles, according to the Automotive News Data Center, breaking the previous record of 17.4 million set in 2000 and marking a 5.7% increase from 2014.But a rise in new car sales doesn’t necessarily mean older cars end up at the junkyard. Thanks to advances in technology, cars last much longer nowadays.So when someone buys a new car, chances are his old car will be resold instead of junked. It’s not unusual for vehicles with 120,000 miles or more to make their way onto used car lots.This trend has led to an ever-aging fleet of cars in the U.S. The average age of cars on the road is a record 11.5 years, according to industry researcher IHS Automotive. That figure is expected to creep up to 11.6 years in 2016.The obvious benefit to auto parts retailers is that as cars get older, they require more replacement parts, as well as repair and maintenance services. This feeds demand for the industry’s Do-It-Yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics; as well as the ""Do-It-For-Me"" segment that targets professional technicians and installers.The sector has also gotten a lift from the improving economy and job market, which have given many consumers more cash to spend on replacement parts and repairs.Meanwhile, O’Reilly and its peers have benefited from lower gasoline prices, which encourage people to drive more.""Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled -- leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales -- and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,"" Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a research report to clients.It all adds up to a robust market for O’Reilly. The company’s stock price trades near 269 and has been creeping back up toward the high of 277.96 set in late October. Shares have risen about 6% since the beginning of the year.Financially, O’Reilly is in the midst of a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth, helped by a stock repurchase program that began more than four years ago. Revenue has risen in double digits the last four quarters.The company earned $2.19 a share during the 2015 fourth quarter. That was up 24% from the prior year and well above consensus estimates. Revenue gained 10% to $1.95 billion, slightly above views. Comparable-store sales increased 7.7% vs. a 6.3% rise during the third quarter.""Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable-store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher,"" O’Reilly Chief Executive Greg Henslee said on a conference call with analysts. ""For 2016, we expect to see positive tailwinds from continued modest improvements in total employment and low gas prices.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O’Reilly to grow full-year EPS 16% in 2016 and another 13% in 2017.For all of 2015, O’Reilly’s comparable-store sales rose 7.5% -- the biggest annual gain since it grew comps 8.8% in 2010. O’Reilly opened 209 stores in 2015, bringing the total store count to 4,571 at year's end. It plans to open another 210 stores this year.""DIY market share gains have accelerated, and this is adding a new leg to same store-sales growth, which could lead to earnings upside,"" JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said in a report.Many of those market share gains have come at the expense of Advance Auto, he says, especially in East Coast markets.Because the fourth quarter includes parts of the winter season -- when cars tend to undergo more wear and tear -- O’Reilly and other parts retailers benefit when the weather is severe. That wasn’t the case during much of the 2015 fourth quarter, however.""While O’Reilly noted that its retail business suffered slightly in November due to abnormally warm weather, pressuring demand for products like anti-freeze, it successfully captured this demand in December as temperatures fell,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli noted in a report. ""Management believes winter weather has been fairly neutral to its business.""
"
23,AAP,"AutoZone (AZO) topped quarterly earnings views early Tuesday and delivered another solid same-store sales gain as the No. 1 U.S. auto parts retailer benefited from upbeat industry trends and higher margins.Reporting before the open, AutoZone earned $7.43 a share for its fiscal second quarter, which ended in February. That was up 14% from the prior year and comfortably above consensus analyst estimates for $7.28.Net sales rose 5% to $2.26 billion, matching views. Same-store sales climbed 3.6% from a year earlier after rising 3.5% during the first quarter.Gross profit as a percentage of sales widened to 52.7% from 52.2% the prior year, driven by higher merchandise margins.AutoZone shares closed up 2.1% on the stock market today.The company continues to benefit from strength in the auto parts industry’s do-it-yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics. That segment has gotten a leg up from several favorable trends -- including lower gasoline prices and an aging fleet of cars on the road -- and helped boost business at rivals such as O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY).“Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled (leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales) and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,” Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a recent report.More than 80% of AutoZone’s sales are to consumers rather than professional mechanics, he says, making it the “best positioned to take advantage of the relative strength in the DIY segment.""AutoZone also has gotten a lift from a new “mega hub” distribution strategy designed to improve inventory coverage through increased shipping frequency from its distribution centers to its retail stores.The company continues to roll out the strategy to more stores. About 1,300 of its 5,200 U.S. stores were serviced by the new strategy at the end of Q2, with about 2,000 stores expected to be serviced by the end of the fiscal year.“Our results to date continue to meet or exceed our expectations, further confirming our new inventory deployment strategy,” AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes said in a statement. “While we continue to strategically invest in our business in order to support our growth, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively.”While AutoZone and O’Reilly continue to pump out robust revenue and earnings growth, other auto parts retailers have seen a recent slowdown in business.Advance Auto Parts (AAP) reported lower sales and earnings during its 2015 fourth quarter -- the first time in more than three years that both metrics dipped during a single quarter.Meanwhile, Genuine Parts (GPC) has logged three straight quarters of flat earnings and two straight quarters of lower revenue.

26,AAP,"When a new uptrend begins, individual investors should strive to do two things.First, they should resist the temptation to pile into either the previous uptrend’s winners or the stocks that led during the bear market.Leaders of one cycle rarely lead the next go-around. And stocks that did well in a downtrend are often too defensive to lead an uptrend.Second, investors should identify new leadership.Stock Spotlight (today's IBD on B9) is a good place to hunt. The stocks in this screen have good fundamentals and are either basing or hitting new highs.The Spotlight screen is less stringent than the Sector Leaders and the IBD 50 screens. And that’s a good thing.If the market uptrend comes after a long bear market, the Spotlight screen will pick up potential winners that have imperfect ratings but are getting their act together.Let’s look at a classic example, the March 12, 2009, follow-through day.What sort of stocks would an investor have found in the Spotlight screen?Several stocks had been leaders, even during the bear market. They included AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP). Car parts stores have defensive characteristics.In the 12 months previous to the March 2009 follow-through day, AutoZone gained 41% and Advance Auto 18%. During the same period, the S&P 500 fell 41% and the Nasdaq slid 35%.An investor might have concluded that auto parts might not be an ideal place if the market started rewarding boldness.This proved true. After March 2009, AutoZone and Advance was rangebound before finding traction 12 to 14 months later. Meanwhile, two stocks hammered in the bear market began to show promise: Carter's (CRI) and Cree (CREE).Success can go one of two ways.A stock can become a one-shot wonder, unable to sustain positive action beyond that first breakout. Or the stock can deliver a long run.Unfortunately there’s no way to know which will be which. You just have to play the game and respond appropriately.Here’s a tip: When an uptrend begins, don’t forget to look for trendline breakouts. This is often the earliest chance to get into a stock.On the follow-through day, Carter’s had cleared a trend line the day before. An aggressive investor could’ve entered around 18. A traditional handle entry came at 19.70. In four months, Carter's advanced 50% to 64%, depending on the entry. Carter’s, though, never developed a well-carved, second-stage base.Cree cleared a 25.03 entry in a cup-with-handle April 1, 2009, best seen on a daily chart. The stock advanced 155% in almost 10 months, forming two bases along the way.

The S&P 500 rallied back to retake its early-morning high. The Nasdaq posted its high of the day just ahead of Yellen's testimony.The day's economic data had a mixed effect on trade, including a more slight-than-expected drop in weekly unemployment claims and a smaller-than-forecast increase in core producer prices for June.Thursday's action left the Nasdaq composite ahead nearly 2% for the week and tracking toward its best weekly finish since late May.  The S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the Dow Jones industrial average held a 0.6% gain.Six of the 10 strongest gains among industries came from retail groups, with department stores and auto parts chains leading the procession.Target (TGT) appeared to launch the retail rally, rising nearly 5% after boosting its second-quarter same-store-sales and earnings guidance, based on strong April and May traffic. Dillards (DDS), Kohl's (KSS) and J.C. Penney (JCP) all surged 5% or more. Wal-Mart (WMT) climbed 1.5% to lead the Dow industrials.Apple (AAPL) was hot on Wal-Mart's heels, up 1.4% as it reached to test resistance at its 10-week moving average. The stock has been trading below that line since a heavy-volume drop on June 9.Among auto parts retailers, AutoZone (AZO) and Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) popped 3%, while O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) thrashed out a 5% advance.Automakers, on the other hand, posted one of the day's two worst declines among industry groups. Tesla (TSLA) underwrote that decline, tumbling 2% in weak trade. The stock is in its second week below its 10-week moving average, ending 17% below its June 23 high.Applied OptoElectronics (AAOI) sprung up 7% and triggered a rally in fiber-optic plays after preannouncing June-quarter earnings and revenue above analyst expectations. The stock spiked to new highs, but its consolidation was too short to be a cup base and too deep for a flat-base pattern, so offered no valid buy point.Fiber-optic peer Lumentum Holdings (LITE) bolted 6% higher, gaining volume support on its rebound from its 10-week moving average.RELATED:For Vacation, Watch These Travel Stocks: Investing Action PlanNetflix Earnings Power Underappreciated, Gets Price Target HikeFiber Stocks Rally As Applied Opto Preannounces Q2 BeatIs Apple Basing Now?

"
29,AAP,"Driven by a quest for consistency in this volatile stock market and iffy economy, investors have been drawn to stable companies that boast a track record of steady profit gains.AutoZone (AZO), a retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories, hits the mark for many investors, analysts say. The company has enjoyed double-digit profit gains in all but one of the past 19 quarters and has consistently delivered sales growth -- with the exception of one quarter -- over that time frame.On top of that, AutoZone’s stock climbed 19.7% last year, easily outpacing the broader market.“AutoZone has been putting up pretty decent top-line growth in an environment where we're seeing mixed data points pertaining to the health of the consumer,” Northcoast Research analyst Nicholas Mitchell told IBD. “So investors are willing to pay a little bit more of a premium to get the consistency in top-line (growth) and earnings-per-share growth.""""When there's mixed signals about the strength of the economy, auto parts retailers are a pretty good place to hide out,"" Mitchell went on to say. ""Demand for replacement auto parts is a lot less cyclical than that for other consumer discretionary items. There's less exposure to e-commerce for this industry too. Less than 5% of overall volume is done via e-commerce. ”If analysts are on the money, AutoZone will show it kept up that streak in with double-digit earnings growth as it reports fiscal-second-quarter results on March 1. Auto parts retailers overall have benefited from low gasoline prices, a trend that has prompted people to drive more and add wear and tear on their cars, sparking demand for auto parts.Good job growth and better wage growth also have helped the industry, as has the do-it-yourself segment -- from which AutoZone gets an estimated 80% of its sales -- analysts say.“AutoZone is benefiting from a market-leading position in (do-it-yourself),” Mitchell said. “The (do-it-yourself customer) tends to be the low-to-mid-income consumer, who tends to be more sensitive to changes in the employment market and gas prices.”AutoZone and peers O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) offer their do-it-yourself and commercial customers elements of value that are difficult for online rivals, including giant Amazon.com (AMZN), to duplicate: parts, advice and services in real time and on an as-needed basis.Several other factors come into play in terms of AutoZone’s draw for investors and the rise in its stock price.“People are attracted to its high return on invested capital, the consistent growth profile of the business and the defensiveness of the business,” Stephens analyst Ben Bienvenu told IBD. “It’s a fairly fragmented industry dominated by three players -- AutoZone, O’Reilly Automotive and Advance Auto Parts. There’s a lot of market share for them to continue to take, despite the fact they’re in a dominant position. And (AutoZone) management is fantastic. They’re very disciplined in their deployment of capital, and they run the business very efficiently.”Wedbush analyst Seth Basham upgraded AutoZone’s stock to an outperform from a neutral in a report on Tuesday.“We think the near term is pretty good for these guys,” he told IBD. “Low gas prices are helping to boost sales for the (do-it-yourself) industry segment, and we think AutoZone is executing well, leading to market share gains. Lower gas prices put more spending power in the lower-income consumer's pockets and encourage people to drive their vehicles more, both of which lead to more part sales. Other drivers for DIY have been good job growth, improving wage growth and rising low-end consumer confidence.”Basham says AutoZone is also getting a lift from a new distribution strategy.AutoZone has been testing two new concepts of its supply chain strategy: increased frequency of delivery to stores and “significantly expanded parts assortments” in select stores called “mega hubs.” A mega hub carries inventory that’s approximately twice what a “hub” store carries, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.“AZO continues to increase the number of stores with multiple deliveries from its distribution centers,” Basham said in his report. “More frequent deliveries enable lower part depth and higher breadth.”The company currently has around 1,000 stores on multiday delivery of three to five times a week. That's around 19% of its domestic store base, with “potential to more than triple this figure,” he said. At the same time, he adds, AutoZone is adding mega hubs to select markets to “broaden on-demand part availability.”As of late November, the company had a total count of 5,635 stores, including those outside the U.S.“With strong results to date, we see potential for these distribution enhancements to enable a $1,500 (plus) per-week per-store sales lift,"" Basham says. ""This amounts to (about) a 2.8% comp lift over (around) a three-year period and based on the current rollout pace, at least (around) a 70 basis-point run-rate comp lift in (fiscal) '16.”In the first quarter, AutoZone’s earnings climbed 14% to $8.29 per share. Sales rose 5.6% to $2.4 billion. Domestic same-store sales increased a healthy 3.5% from a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year fiscal 2015 earnings to rise 13% to $40.68 a share. They see a 12% gain in fiscal 2016 and 11% increase in 2017.They expect second-quarter earnings to be reported on March 1 to rise 12% to $7.28 a share.“My sense is AutoZone fared very well in the second quarter,” said Bienvenu. “We’re expecting strong results.”He expects the warmer winter had a “negative impact” on sales of car parts that get a lot of stress from cold weather and often require repairs, like batteries, starters and alternators. But it’s difficult to know the “extent” to which it will show up in the numbers, he adds.

30,AAP,"Shares of U.S. auto parts retailers O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and AutoZone (AZO) moved higher Tuesday on positive analyst calls, as both stocks continue to benefit from favorable industry trends.

"
31,AAP,"Auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) have been some of the market’s strongest performers in recent years as consumers have shown a willingness to keep their cars on the road longer, rather than buying a new car.The do-it-yourself trend hasn’t exactly hurt new-car sales in the U.S., though, as auto sales hit a record high of 17.47 million in 2015, topping the old record of 17.35 million set in 2000.O’Reilly has the largest market capitalization in the auto parts group at around $25 billion. AutoZone (AZO) is next at $22 billion, followed by Advance Auto Parts (AAP) at nearly $12 billion.When O’Reilly reported Q3 results in late October, profit and sales growth accelerated sequentially from the second quarter, rising 25% and 11%, respectively. Same-store sales, which exclude sales at newly opened stores and are a key industry metric, rose an impressive 7.9%. In Q2, same-stores had risen 7.2%.Stern Agee on Tuesday upgraded O’Reilly to buy from neutral and with a 300 price target, saying O’Reilly’s recent pullback offered an attractive entry.Q4 results are due Feb. 10. Quarterly profit is seen rising 18% to $2.08 a share with sales up 8% to $1.91 billion.
"
32,AAP,"Is O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) getting ready to shift into overdrive and rally again? Shares of the auto parts retailer, up more than 33% this year, are working on a new flat base with a potential 278.06 buy point.O'Reilly is outpacing most of its rivals. AutoZone (AZO) is up about 20%. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) is down nearly 5% since Jan. 1.And it's not just the stock that's outperforming. The Springfield, Mo.-based company sports the top Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings in its nine-stock group. Where O'Reilly and its rivals used to mostly rely on the do-it-yourself shopper, the growing DIFM business is providing an additional revenue stream.O'Reilly started the year off with a Feb. 5 breakout, an 8% gap up past a 196.90 flat-base buy point. It immediately went on to form a new flat base, which it cleared in mid-March. Since then, it's shaped and broken out of two more bases.At its Feb. 5 breakout, the stock boasted a 97 Composite Rating; 95 EPS; 92 Relative Strength; Sales+Profit Margin+ROE of A; and B- for Accumulation/Distribution.When it began to climb past a new flat-base entry on June 19, O'Reilly's ratings remained solid: 95 Composite, 96 EPS, 91 RS,SMR of A and Acc/Dis of B-.And when the stock cleared its latest buy point on Oct. 12, its Composite Rating had risen to 99. The 95 RS and B Acc/Dis ratings also showed improvement.Because O'Reilly already has cleared a series of bases over the past two years, its current pattern is late-stage, which tends to be riskier than earlier stage bases. Also, an up-down volume ratio below the neutral 1.0 level implies weak share demand. (See the ratio at IBD Stock Checkup, found under the ""Research"" tab on Investors.com).All the bases it's formed this year have been third stage, since the stock hasn't gained 20% from the breakouts.Aside from the October 2014 (1) and February breakouts (2), weekly volume has been rather tepid. Yet the chart shows numerous weeks of gains in heavy trade. Plus, O'Reilly has been finding support near its 10-week moving average as it trends higher. Despite the late-stage nature of its bases, the stock has offered investors chances to buy or add shares at breakouts and pullbacks to the 10-week line.The number of funds owning shares rose to 1,341 in Q3 from 1,118 in last year's Q4. Plenty of top-rated funds bought a stake or added to their position in Q3.

Still, absent a surprise, the Fed seems likely to announce in September that it will gradually scale back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, inflated with Treasury and mortgage bonds purchased in response to the financial crisis.The ECB's policy signals have been jarring because they represent a pretty dramatic, if gradual, potential change from the central bank's long-running asset-purchase program.ECB President Mario Draghi indicated last week that the eurozone monetary authority could begin scaling back its asset buys, which economists now expect to happen by early 2018.

General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) saw sales drop 5%, 5% and 7% respectively year over year, while Toyota Motor (TM), Nissan (NSANY) and Honda Motor (HMC) grew sales modestly. Overall, the industry posted its sixth straight month of falling or flat sales, despite higher use of incentives. Consumers continued to spurn the car segment for SUVs, crossovers and trucks. Sales of new vehicles have slowed this year as freshly off-lease vehicles have flooded the market. Even the red-hot SUV segment is starting to show softness. June sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.4 million, the lowest rate of the year.An eight-day win streak came to sharp end on Wednesday, while even a sharp drop in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories couldn't give prices much of a boost.

51,AAP,"The $13.7 billion Amazon (AMZN) acquisition of natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) Friday stunned the market, clobbered grocery stocks, and spurred jokes and jibes in Twitterverse. One wag tweeted ""@jeffbezos this wasn't exactly the wealth redistribution we had in mind when you'd asked yesterday.""Bezos to Alexa: ""I need some groceries.""Alexa: ""I bought you Whole Foods.""🙃😋🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍕📈📊— Samppa Lahtinen (@SamppaSOS) June 16, 2017So where could Amazon go next? Here are five potential industries for the e-commerce giant.XAmazon already was said to be considering an entry into the pharmaceuticals market. While speculation had centered on online drug deliveries, Amazon also could conceivably add pharmacies to Whole Foods locations, several analysts noted Friday, creating further synergies between food and drugs and online orders and in-store purchases.If Amazon enters the field, it could send tremors across the pharmaceutical food chain, from drugstore chains such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) to pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts (ESRX) and distributors such as Amerisource Bergen (ABC).Amazon did have a finger in this pie once. It backed Drugstore.com before that online retail pharmacy was acquired by Walgreens, which then shut it down.Walgreens shares fell 5% and CVS Health 3.8%, though that reflected at least in part the immediate investor concern about the impact on their food sales. Express Scripts and Amerisource Bergen also were lower.Amazon Business, its B2B or business-to-business unit launched in 2015, sold over $1 billion worth of lab equipment, deep fryers and other gear sought by business owners in the first year of operations.If the division continues to grow at such a torrid pace, it could eat the lunch of W.W. Grainger (GWW), HD Supply (HDS) and other firms in the industrial supplies sector. That market is extremely fragmented, with some 5,000 estimated players and a value of about $75 billion per year. Amazon could disrupt it with a streamlined marketplace.While HD Supply fell 1% Friday, Grainger rose 2%.Meanwhile home improvement stores Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Floor & Decor (FND) have been Amazon-proof so far, but that may not always stay true.Amazon has automotive ambitions too. That is, it is rumored to want to move aggressively auto parts, carving out a slice of the $50 billion DIY aftermarket parts market.News that it is eyeing the auto-parts retail sector sent brick-and-mortar retailers such as AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower in January. One report at that time said the online juggernaut already has contracts with Dorman Products (DORM) and other parts makers.Shares of auto-parts retailers are still mired near 52-week lows, with AutoZone 3.1%, O'Reilly Auto 1.1% and Advance Auto Parts 0.75% all falling Friday.Messaging service Slack Technologies targets the corporate chat room. That is said to make the Silicon Valley startup attractive to Amazon, which is a big player in the enterprise services market alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others.Having a messaging service could help win corporate business for Amazon Web Services. Microsoft and Google, which have their own cloud-computing businesses, have Slack-like messaging features.AWS has been key to the internet giant's streak of stellar earnings. In fact, Whole Foods could switch allegiance to Amazon Web Services from its current status as a Microsoft cloud customer given Friday's news.Slack is said to have a value of at least $9 billion, so it would be the biggest-ever acquisition for Amazon, surpassing Whole Foods.Amazon issued $1 billion in small loans in the past year to merchants on its online platform, Bloomberg reported June 7. It issues loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan and has plans to expand to key markets such as China.As its lending business gains momentum, Amazon could weigh on online lenders such as Lending Club (LC) as well as payment processors such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), who also offer credit to users. Banks that lend heavily to small businesses could also take a hit.The lending program could also keep customers loyal to Amazon, which is seeing rivals such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) step up their e-commerce strategy.Amazon's lending program, launched in 2011, allows it to profit both directly and indirectly — through interest rates and from more transaction fees as merchants grow sales.Shares of Amazon were rising 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above Amazon's 42 offer price.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesNew Flooring Retailer Manages To Sidestep The Amazon Squeeze

86,AAP,"The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite hit record highs on Thursday, completing a quick recovery from the May 17 market plunge as FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) led the way. Oil prices, which had been steadily rising ahead of OPEC's key meeting, tumbled after the cartel extended production cuts. Meanwhile, Best Buy (BBY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were among the few retailers to defy the sector sell-off with strong earnings and share gains. Ford (F) ousted its CEO amid woes for the auto sector.The S&P 500 rose 1.4% and the Nasdaq 2.1%, both hitting record highs. The Dow advanced 1.3% Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) rose strongly to new highs, with Amazon and Alphabet nearly hitting the 1,000 price level. Oil prices retreated after OPEC extended but didn't deepen production curbs, leaving intact a status quo that encourages shale producers. Best Buy (BBY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) soared to record highs as they prove to be Amazon-resilient, while Lowe's (LOW) and Tiffany (TIF) struggled. Red-hot Chinese social media and live-streaming video app Momo (MOMO) cooled off despite crushing views.At its meeting Thursday, OPEC extended production cuts through March 2018 but didn't deepen output curbs as some had speculated, while keeping Libya and Nigeria exempt for the foreseeable future even as their output rises. Oil prices tumbled 4.8% that day, wiping out gains made in the weeks leading up to the meeting. On Wednesday, EIA data showed U.S. oil inventories fell for the seventh consecutive week, while production rebounded from its first dip in three months. After a Friday rebound, U.S. crude futures closed the week down 1.8% to $49.80 a barrel.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) posted a beat-and-raise Q1 that surpassed expectations, sending shares jumping to an all-time high Friday. The specialty beauty retailer's same-store sales growth of 14.3% defied conventional wisdom about traditional sellers and beat consensus for 11% comps. Profit rose 32% to $1.91 a share on 22.5% revenue growth to $1.31 billion. E-commerce sales popped 70.9%.Costco (COST) beat on both the top and bottom lines as same-store sales rose 5%, sending shares upward Friday morning. The membership warehouse is upping its annual fee next week. Dollar Tree (DLTR) fell short of views by a penny with 98 cents EPS and met sales forecasts for $5.29 billion. Comps edged up 0.5%. Outlook for Q2 was light. Burlington Stores (BURL) EPS beat by 9 cents though sales of $1.35 billion were just a hair short of estimates. The midpoint of full-year profit guidance exceeded current estimates. Burlington's shares rose Thursday but erased those gains Friday.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) and video game vendor GameStop (GME) each reported April quarter results that beat views. But while Best Buy guided Wall Street higher for the current quarter, GameStop gave an in-line outlook. Best Buy stock soared to a record high, while GameStop sank below its 50-day moving average.The China-based social media and live-video streaming app on Tuesday reported adjusted first-quarter earnings that skyrocketed 630% vs. a year a year ago, with revenue rising 421% to $265.2 million. Those were well above estimates. But Momo (MOMO), which had reversed lower from a record high on Monday, kept falling, losing 10% as of Friday afternoon, though it did find support at its 50-day line.Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) galloped 14% to a record high stock price after delivering better-than-expected March-quarter results. Investors shrugged off the news that Take-Two is delaying its highly anticipated Wild West shooter game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" to spring 2018 from this fall. The focus at Take-Two has shifted from big game releases to long-term recurring revenue from major game properties like ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" and ""NBA 2K"" through downloadable content and online services.Ford (F) dumped Mark Fields after the stock and earnings had fallen sharply, lagging peers. New CEO Jim Hackett, who had run Ford's autonomous driving unit, is seen as a turnaround specialist. Meanwhile, the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), accused it of cheating on emission tests on many diesel pickup trucks. General Motors faced a new private lawsuit for allegedly installed software 'defeat devices' for various diesels as well. The diesel emissions saga took off in 2015, when Volkswagen (VLKAY) came under scrutiny.Toll Bros. (TOL) topped fiscal second-quarter earnings estimates, helped by demand for ""affordable"" luxury homes. But shares of Toll and other builders retreated as U.S. new-home sales for April fell to a level well below expectations. Existing-home sales also sank more than expected. Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) Q1 results missed.Investors punished suppliers of automotive replacement parts for big earnings misses. AutoZone (AZO) gapped down 12% Tuesday to its lowest level in more than two years. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sank nearly 5% Tuesday, then fell 5% Wednesday after its own miss. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), which tumbled below its 50-day line after its April 27 earnings report, fell 1.1% for the week, well off weekly lows. Their weak results and stock performances come as Amazon (AMZN) reportedly mulls breaking into the auto parts market.Adjusted profit per share advanced 47% while revenue grew 32% to $157.9 million, both comfortably topping Wall Street estimates. The cloud-based software maker for the life sciences industry also gave guidance above the Wall Street consensus. Veeva (VEEV) shares jumped 8.2% to a new record high Friday.Dycom said its adjusted Q3 earnings were $1.30 a share, up 20% from a year earlier, with revenue rising 18% to $786.3 million for the period ended April 29. Both topped views. But the telecom installer forecast EPS in a range of $1.35 to $1.50 and revenue in a range of $789 million to $810 million vs. consensus estimates of $1.79 and $849.4 million. Dycom shares plunged more than 22% for the week.Upscale jeweler Tiffany (TIF) reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings Wednesday, but revenue fell short and same-store sales unexpectedly declined. Signet Jewelers (SIG), parent of mall-based Kay Jewelers, Zales, and Jared The Galleria of Jewelry, missed on earnings. Shares of both retailers tumbled.NetApp (NTAP) topped earnings and sales views, but gave weak guidance. Shares, which fell late Wednesday, rallied 3.5% in Thursday's regular session, retaking its 50-day line. But NetApp gave up some of those gains Friday.Splunk (SPLK) reported a smaller-than-expected Q1 adjusted per-share loss while revenue topped views, but shares fell 7% Friday, dropping back below a buy point. The data analytics firm gave in-line guidance.

96,AAP,"Under normal circumstances, auto parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) might expect to see a slowdown in sales and earnings in a year when U.S. vehicle sales are on pace for their highest total in 15 years. But since this isn't a normal market, O'Reilly is expected to deliver another round of solid gains when it reports Q3 results after Wednesday's…
"
97,AAP,"Forget the current banner year for new-car sales — auto parts retailers are forging ahead undaunted, benefitting from a host of favorable industry trends.
"
98,AAP,"Cheap gasoline prices, an increase in miles driven and an aging fleet of cars on the road have helped leading players such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) maintain decent growth.
"
99,AAP,"They've accomplished that even as vehicle sales are at their highest point in over a decade — something that normally would act as a headwind to the auto parts sector.
"
100,AAP,"Auto parts chains have also largely avoided competition from Amazon (AMZN).
"
101,AAP,"O'Reilly, the sector's biggest by market cap, has shown particular strength, with a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth. It extended that streak after Wednesday's close, logging a 28% year-over-year EPS gain and breezing past consensus views.
"
102,AAP,"O'Reilly shares touched a new high of 263.66 on Wednesday and moved even higher after hours. AutoZone shares set their own new high Wednesday, while Advance Auto hit a new record last week.
"
103,AAP,"IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group — which also includes Genuine Parts (GPC) and LKQ (LKQ), among other stocks — ranks No. 8 out of 197 industries surveyed.
"
104,AAP,"Pep Boys Acquired
"
105,AAP,"The group is doing so well that even members considered to be laggards are attracting attention.
"
106,AAP,"Case in point: Monday's news that auto parts supplier Bridgestone will acquire Pep Boys — Manny, Moe & Jack (PBY) for about $835 million. Bridgestone will pay $15 a share in cash, a 23% premium over Pep Boys' Oct. 23 closing price. The deal is expected to close early in 2016.
"
107,AAP,"Bridgestone paid the premium even though Pep Boys has underperformed for most of this decade. The company's annual revenue has barely budged over the last three years, and it hasn't grown annual earnings since 2011. The fact that Pep Boys brought such a rich buyout offer says a lot about how much auto parts retailers are valued right now, analysts say.
"
108,AAP,"""It certainly signifies the health and strength of the industry when you see a company pay that much for Pep Boys, which historically has been a laggard in the industry,"" Sterne Agee CRT analyst Ali-Ahmad Faghri told IBD. Faghri follows several auto parts stocks, including O'Reilly and AutoZone, but not Pep Boys.
"
109,AAP,"The industry's strength is the result of several dynamics, analysts say. One is the average age of cars on U.S. roads: a record 11.5 years, according to research firm IHS Automotive. Older cars require more of the replacement parts, maintenance and repair work that auto parts retailers provide.
"
110,AAP,"The aging fleet has also put more vehicles on the road — a record 250 million, according to Bloomberg. More cars lead to higher demand for auto parts and services.
"
111,AAP,"Lower gas prices have been a boon as well. When consumers pay less for gas, they have an incentive to drive more, which increases demand for parts and services.
"
112,AAP,"""Miles driven has been a critical growth driver — we've seen a nice uptick there,"" Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck told IBD. ""Consumers are increasing their miles driven, which increases the wear and tear on cars.""
"
113,AAP,"Do-It-For-Me Fuels Retailers
"
114,AAP,"Meanwhile, a growing number of consumers are outsourcing maintenance and repair to auto parts retailers rather than doing it themselves. This Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) side of the business has provided an additional revenue stream for auto parts retailers, which used to rely almost exclusively on the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) market.
"
115,AAP,"""We continue to see growth in the Do-It-For-Me market, which has been a major growth driver for these companies,"" Fleck said.
"
116,AAP,"Finally, auto parts retailers — unlike most other retailers — have not been hurt by Amazon and other e-commerce sites. That's mainly because when someone needs an auto part, he or she doesn't like to wait around for it to arrive by mail.
"
117,AAP,"""Given the focus of service and speed, online retailers like Amazon haven't disrupted the auto parts retailers,"" Faghri said.
"
118,AAP,"These favorable trends have helped offset what is normally a headwind for auto parts retailers — rising vehicle sales.
"
119,AAP,"U.S. auto sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18.2 million in September, the highest rate in more than a decade.
"
120,AAP,"September was particularly strong because it included the full Labor Day weekend. Some experts expect the pace to slow in October, though the annual rate should still be the highest since before the Great Recession.
"
121,AAP,"Last week, auto industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive raised their forecasts for 2015 auto sales to 17.3 million vehicles from 17.2 million.
"
122,AAP,"And while more new cars on the road previously translated into less demand for replacement parts and maintenance services, previous conditions no longer prevail.
"
123,AAP,"One thing that's different these days: older cars aren't being sent to the graveyard just because their owners are buying new ones. Instead, owners are trading their old cars in or selling them.
"
124,AAP,"""You've seen this boom in new-car sales, and yet the average age (of cars) has continued to tick up,"" Fleck said. ""Cars last longer than they used to, so there's a secular shift going on there. There's still a growing need for auto parts as the age continues to rise, and that's a big positive.""Forget the current banner year for new-car sales — auto parts retailers are forging ahead undaunted, benefitting from a host of favorable industry trends.Cheap gasoline prices, an increase in miles driven and an aging fleet of cars on the road have helped leading players such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) maintain decent growth.They've accomplished that even as vehicle sales are at their highest point in over a decade — something that normally would act as a headwind to the auto parts sector.Auto parts chains have also largely avoided competition from Amazon (AMZN).O'Reilly, the sector's biggest by market cap, has shown particular strength, with a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth.

134,AAP,"XKey U.S. index ETFs held small gains Wednesday after the Fed minutes showed officials in favor of gradually shrinking the balance sheet. S&P 500 tracking funds were poised to break out.SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), up 0.1%, neared a potential breakout past a 240.42 flat-base buy point. It had climbed past the entry twice last week but closed below the buy point both times. SPY advanced 5% from its prior flat-base breakout in early February to the start of the current pattern.Keep an eye on iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) too, which edged 0.2% closer to pennies away from a 241.91 flat-base entry. ProShares Ultra S&P 500 (SSO) advanced 0.3% to take out an 87.74 flat-base buy point.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), up 2%, also crept closer to a breakout. The blue chip tracking ETF is 1% below a 211.69 flat-base buy point.Among sector plays, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) rose 0.2% and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) added 0.4%. SOXX is just out of buy range from a 138.06 flat-base entry. Nvidia (NVDA) popped 1l.5% to a new high amid reports that Japan's Softbank (SFTBY) has taken a $4 billion stake in the graphics chip designer.VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) was down 1.1% as gold futures pared an earlier loss to 0.1%, at $1,254.40 an ounce.SPDR S&P Retail (XRT), down as much as 1% earlier, trimmed its loss to 0.2%. On Tuesday, it fell 2%.

135,AAP,"The main indexes were mildly higher at midday Wednesday as three FANG stocks saw unusually heavy trading, while the retail sector took another blow.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were up 0.1%. Dow component Visa (V) made a new high in active trading. The small-cap Russell 2000 fared a bit better, up 0.3%.The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.2%. Three of its major components — Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — were up 0.3% to 0.9% in volume well above normal levels. Turnover in Facebook was tracking three times more than its average, while Alphabet and Amazon saw smaller spikes in trading. That suggests institutional investors are moving money into their favorites.Price movements in the three were modest, yet significant. Amazon and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, hit new highs. Facebook continued to make progress from a pullback to the 50-day moving average.Volume was running lower compared with the same time Tuesday.Brick and mortar retail, which is having an awful year, saw several stocks drop in heavy volume after a series of disappointing results.Tiffany (TIF) gapped down 7% in intense trading after the jewelry chain's same-store sales for the April-ended quarter dropped surprisingly and revenue missed expectations. The plunge ruined a flat base the stock had been forming.Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) gapped down nearly 5% after the company's quarterly sales and profit came in below estimates. Lowe's (LOWE) gapped down more than 4% and sank further below the 50-day moving average, triggering a sell signal for the stock. The home improvement chain missed expectations for its April-ended quarter and gave a weak outlook.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) slid 2% in volume tracking at nearly five times its average. Shares are now below the 50-day moving average and below the 289.37 buy point — a disquieting sign just a day before the company announces quarterly earnings. Ulta has been one of the most sturdy retail stocks, in large part because its format is resistant to online competitors. A sell-off in its shares would further weaken a retail sector that is short on winners. Ulta announces results after the close Thursday.RELATED:Tiffany Tanks On Same-Store Sales Shocker, Revenue MissLowe's Guides Low After Missing Q1 Earnings, Sales Views

136,AAP,"Stocks opened to modest gains Wednesday as earnings reports stirred early action and investors awaited a news release from the Federal Reserve.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 opened 0.2% higher.  The Nasdaq added less than 0.1%. Small caps stepped out to an early lead, with Russell 2000 futures opening ahead 0.3%.Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's May 2-3 meeting are due at 2 p.m. ET, and investors will pore carefully over the release for hints of whether and how much the committee might expect to alter its target interest rate at its June meeting. Current futures show 83% of investors betting on a hike of the benchmark rate to the 1%-1.25% range, up from its current 0.75%-1% target.Some low-priced stocks posted early, wild moves on earnings news. The Container Store Group (TCS) rocketed 46% higher on a hefty earnings beat and announced restructuring plans. Aegean Marine Petroleum (ANW) tanked 35%, as an analyst downgrade followed its first-quarter results reported late Tuesday.Financial software brand Intuit (INTU) swept ahead 7%, leading the Nasdaq 100, after reporting a broad fiscal third-quarter win late Tuesday. The gap up move left shares extended above buy points at 127.56 and 128.55 in a flat base, but opened a new buy range beginning at the stock's opening price of 139.92.IBD 50 stock Nvidia (NVDA) climbed 2%, also boosting the Nasdaq 100, lifted by news reports that Japan's Softbank (SFTBY) had amassed a $4 billion stake in the diversifying chipmaker. Nvidia shares are extended above an alternative-stage base. Softbank shares dipped 0.4% in early action. The stock is trading below a 39.13 buy point in a four-month cup-with-handle base.Dycom (DY) dropped 17% after its fiscal third-quarter revenue and earnings easily topped analyst views, but its Q4 earnings and revenue guidance were below analyst targets. The move sent shares below the stock's 10-week moving average as well as its prior buy point of 98.57, both of which are sell signals.Intel (INTC) swung to an early lead among the Dow industrials with a 0.3% gain. At the boom of the index,  Home Depot (HD) dipped 0.7% — apparently feeling some drain from retail peer Lowe's (LOW). Lowe's fell 3% ahead of the open, after missing analysts' Q1 sales and earnings targets. Home Depot topped earnings views last week.Advance Auto Parts (AAP) crumbled 5% early trade, the worst hit among S&P 500 stocks.

"
138,AAP,"Retailers hit a rough patch in March as severe winter weather, an economic speed bump and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port disruptions dragged down results, leading to the month's sales gains falling below views.
"
139,AAP,"Even amid the headwinds, L Brands (LB), Stein Mart (SMRT), Cato Corp. (CATO) and PriceSmart (PSMT) came shining through with same-store sales that sailed past views, according to data out Thursday.
"
140,AAP,"March sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.5% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 1% gain.
"
141,AAP,"The results were weighed down by a big miss from warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST), Perkins says. The company saw March same-store sales slide 2% from a year earlier, short of views for a 0.3% decline.
"
142,AAP,"That was the typical top retail performer's first decline in monthly same-store sales since August 2009, Perkins says.
"
143,AAP,"Fuel And The Freeze
"
144,AAP,"Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, ex gas and the effects of foreign exchange rates, were up a ""much healthier"" 4%, said Perkins. Still, they were below views for a 5.5% gain.
"
145,AAP,"""Costco was a huge drag on the month,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Part of that was attributable to them having lower year-over-year gas prices, and foreign currency translations also weighed on their sales.""
"
146,AAP,"The month's results were a mixed bag.
"
147,AAP,"Harsh winter weather conditions in parts of the U.S. such as the Northeast ""weighed on sales"" in those areas, said Perkins.
"
148,AAP,"Consumers weren't in the mood to buy seasonal goods like patio furniture and bathing suits or apparel when they were ""freezing,"" he said.
"
149,AAP,"But Jacksonville, Fla.-based Stein Mart and Charlotte, N.C.-based Cato, located in the South, where the weather was better, posted double-digit gains in March same-store sales, he adds.
"
150,AAP,"""Weather clearly played a big role overall (on the March results), both positive and negative,"" Perkins said.
"
151,AAP,"Another factor weighing on March sales was a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, he adds. Perkins notes retailers also missed sales opportunities because of delays from late shipments due to the West Coast labor dispute.
"
152,AAP,"""Overall I would not read too much into the March numbers,"" Perkins said. ""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""
"
153,AAP,"April Outlook
"
154,AAP,"This month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.
"
155,AAP,"The month's standouts are L Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret), value-priced apparel seller Cato and regional discount retail operator Stein Mart.
"
156,AAP,"L Brands posted a 9% increase in same-store sales for March, topping views for a 5.8% gain. The company's same-store sales for the month ""were positively impacted"" by the earlier Easter this year by about 3% to 4%, it said in a press release.
"
157,AAP,"Cato saw a 12% rise in the month's sales, sailing past estimates for a 3.8% gain. Cato also got a lift from the early Easter shift, the company said in a press release. But it expects April sales will be ""unfavorably impacted"" by the shift.

158,AAP,"Old Navy Nails Sales
"
159,AAP,"Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) posted a 2% rise in March same-store sales, well ahead of an estimate for a 0.5% gain.

161,AAP,"Stein Mart posted an 11.2% rise in March same-store sales, well ahead of views for a 3% increase.

167,AAP,"'Dismal' Retail Economics
"
168,AAP,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the research firm Retail Economist, calculates March same-store sales rose 0.2% vs. a year earlier.
"
169,AAP,"He called the month's sales performance ""dismal.""
"
170,AAP,"Why? ""At the end of the day, the flat reading doesn't pick up any Easter lift to the numbers, and (the month) was weaker than the January and February performance,"" he told IBD.
"
171,AAP,"He expects April same-store sales to rise 1% vs. a year earlier amid tough comparisons with last year, when April same-store sales rose 6.2%.
"
172,AAP,"But overall, retailers should see better days, Perkins says.
"
173,AAP,"""I don't think you can extrapolate where the consumer stands from the March results and the related speed bumps (during the month),"" said Perkins. ""Consumer confidence is near the cycle high, gas prices remain low, interest rates remain low and the labor market is on solid footing. I think those factors should bode well for better economic growth in the second and third quarters, which should lead to better retail sales.""
"
174,AAP,"Still, he cautions that the vast majority of lower- and midincome consumers are not really seeing rising pay.
"
175,AAP,"""The ability for consumers to spend is still tied to significant wage gains, which haven't materialized,"" he said.
"
176,AAP,"Perkins said the high-end consumer is ""driving the lion's share of spending.""
"
177,AAP,"And they're buying a lot of cars. Perkins says the auto segment is doing better than other retail segments. That bodes well for auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP).
"
178,AAP,"High-end retailers such as Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Kate Spade (KATE) are among the luxury retailers Perkins cites as doing well. He says off-price apparel retail operators such as Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX) are also faring well.
"
179,AAP,"Niemira, looking toward the summer, expects apparel will be one of the stronger retail categories, driven by ""pent-up demand.""

276,AAP,"U.S. diversified stock mutual funds extended their rally in February, picking up steam while tacking on 2.68% on average after gaining 1.83% in January, according to Lipper Inc.That reflected gains by the broad stock market, measured by the S&P 500, which advanced 3.97% last month after notching a 1.90% gain in January. But market leadership rotated back to more defensive sectors, reflecting growing caution among investors.""The more-defensive stocks did well, while cyclical energy and materials did not outperform,"" said Lew Piantedosi, who is lead manager of seven Eaton Vance funds, totaling $3.9 billion in assets. ""It was a complete reversal from the Q4 postelection market rally, which was a cyclicals rally.""Sentiment flipped back in favor of growth-oriented cyclicals after President Trump's address to Congress on the last night of February.But the tilt earlier in February toward cyclicals reflected investors' concern that Trump and the Republican-majority Congress may have a harder time than previously expected in implementing pro-growth policies.Reflecting the optimistic portion of February's market performance, health/biotechnology funds led sectors last month, gaining 6.72%.Among U.S. diversified stock fund categories, S&P 500 index funds led the way with a 3.87% gain.World equity funds lagged U.S. diversifieds, advancing just 1.90%, led by India region funds' 6.08% climb.Taxable bond funds eked out an 0.87% gain on average last month. Emerging markets local currency funds outpaced other taxable categories, rising 1.94%.Piantedosi is guardedly bullish, going forward. ""The bull market is in place until proven otherwise,"" he said. Many investors and market observers have tried to call a market top. But the economy keeps getting better, Piantedosi says. ""Corporate earnings keep getting better, and earnings support the market,"" he added.The wild card that could derail the rally is the political landscape, he warns.As long as the economy stays on track, Piantedosi likes the shift to digital by advertising. ""That benefits Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL),"" he said. ""And Amazon (AMZN) dominates online retail.""Another area he likes is biotech, which is producing a parade of treatments for diseases. ""Celgene (CELG) is a leader within cancer treatments,"" he said. ""It has an unbelievable pipeline. It is growing earnings north of 20% annually and trades at a 17-times forward multiple, just below the market multiple of 18.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. See which biomed/biotech firm is No. 1, and check out its easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.In energy, he likes energy explorer and producer Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and field services provider Halliburton (HAL).He said, ""Anadarko is once again profitably growing production, generating significant cash flow and is attractively valued."" He added, ""Halliburton's exposure is mainly to North American shale, and with oil prices (steady) in the mid-50s, you're starting to see rig counts increase. That increases the need for field services. They put rigs together, service them, replace broken parts and so on.""He added, ""In consumer discretionary, it's hard to find good names. But there's Advance Auto Parts (AAP). They're an auto parts retailer. That sector is less susceptible to be Amazoned. Their business doesn't require a lot of capital expenditure, so it's a good cash flow type of business. And Advance got a new CEO three or four months ago. He's a supply chain expert, which is what Advance needs.""One key reason it is hard for investors to find consumer discretionary that names they like is because so many big-box retailers are getting kicked by online retailers, says James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Asset Management and manager of its $125 million Select Equity (DHAMX). Add to that the risk that many will be forced to cope with higher costs stemming from the border adjustment tax — basically, a value-added tax on imports — proposed by Trump, Abate says.Names in the sector that he does still like include media company CBS (CBS) and specialty food retailer Whole Foods Market (WFM).Sporting an OK 86 Composite Rating from IBD, CBS is trying to clear a consolidation after a run-up that started in the fall.Whole Foods has a very weak Composite Rating of 20 from IBD and is trading at less than half its late 2013 high.The supermarket chain in January reinstalled co-founder John Mackey as sole CEO.Also, the Trump push for infrastructure construction should benefit a number of telecommunications and utility companies, including Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ), Abate says. Comcast has been running up since the election and is near its all-time high. Verizon, range-bound between 57 and 46 since July, is trading near 49, 12% below its 52-week high.Flow-control systems manufacturer Parker-Hannifin (PH) also stands to gain from infrastructure spending. Likewise, Quanta Services (PWR), which provides engineering and construction services. ""They should benefit from increased spending on pipelines and energy transmission projects,"" he said.The market faces risks in the form of geopolitical uncertainty, possible trade wars and rising stock valuations, Abate says. ""There's a lot of downside risk facing this market,"" he said. ""I expect a lot of volatility going forward.""RELATED:Mutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy And Industrial Names They Like For '17

The stock has now formed a handle in its cup base, which means it has a new, lower buy point of 821.75.But Amazon may be a niche player, wrote RBC analyst Scot Ciccarelli in a note. Casual DIY auto parts buyers won't feel comfortable buying specific parts on their own, while commercial customers will want parts delivered in a shorter window than Amazon will be able to offer, Ciccarelli said. But ""heavy DIY customers,"" who know exactly what they want may save money with Amazon.

413,AAP,"While falling oil prices obviously have had a negative impact on oil and gas stocks — eight of the nine lowest rated IBD industry groups are now in that sector — declining prices also have had a ripple effect on other industries: some for the better, others not so much.
"
414,AAP,"Following are four other industries that have seen an immediate impact from lower prices at the wellhead and gasoline pump. Three are enjoying the trend, while one of them is not.
"
415,AAP," Airlines: Considering that fuel is one of the biggest expenses in the airline industry, it's no surprise that falling gasoline prices have been a boon to companies that make their living in the air.
"
416,AAP,"IBD's Transportation-Airline group is trading at record highs and ranks No. 2 among 197 industries tracked. That's up from No. 116 as recently as eight weeks ago.
"
417,AAP,"Stocks that have set multiyear highs in recent days include pretty much every airline you can think of. These include large commercial carriers such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL) as well as discount carriers Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and regional operations like Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA).

418,AAP,"The top rated stocks in the group are Spirit and Southwest, which have IBD Composite Ratings of 99 and 97, respectively.

Any threat to oil and gas producers will likely hurt railroad companies.

428,AAP,"IBD's Transportation-Rail group ranks No. 141 — a big and swift drop from eight weeks ago, when it ranked No. 11. Shares of the group have declined 11% since setting a record high on Nov. 25.

""We remain constructive on the company's long-term growth outlook.""Ciccarelli noted the quarter's results suggest trends ""remain healthy.""He raised his 2015 EPS estimate to $8.92 from $8.75 on same-store sales growth of 6.1%. He also increased his 2016 estimate to $10.25 a share from $10.05.O'Reilly has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a possible 99.

509,AAP,"Auto-parts wholesalers and retailers have been stellar performers during the long economic recovery, delivering steady earnings growth and mostly solid stock appreciation.Two stocks in the group, Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and Monro Muffler Brake (MNRO), offered contrasting responses Thursday to earnings reports.Earnings from Advance Auto Parts, which operates more than 5,200 stores, missed analysts' estimates on earnings and revenue, and the company lowered fiscal 2015 guidance.""Our first quarter results were softer than we expected primarily driven by the change impacts of our integration activities,"" said CFO Mike Norona.The stock opened 3% lower, but quickly reversed and traded higher for the rest of the day. The stock is carving out a flat base. Going back to February, the chart shows several ominous, red-volume spikes that denote institutional selling, but in recent days those have been replaced by blue spikes, signs institutions are getting interested.A buy point would be at 165.10.Monro wasn't quite so lucky with its earnings miss. The stock traded as much as 12% lower in the morning. Although it staged a comeback later in the day, it still left a gap on the daily chart. The stock did, however, find support at its 200-day line. The base it was building is now seriously damaged.In its latest report, Advanced Auto's EPS rose 6% from a year ago. Revenue rose 2%. That was the first time in four quarters that earnings weren't north of 28% and revenue wasn't above 47%. In the next report, analysts are forecasting a 12% EPS increase from a year earlier.The five-year annualized EPS growth rate is 17%.Monro's earnings rose 8%. The previous quarter's earnings were 4%, which marked a deceleration over several quarters.Revenue also rose 8%, the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue increases in single digits.In the next quarter, analysts expect earnings to rise 19%. The five-year annualized EPS growth rate is 9%. Analysts are forecasting 38% growth this year and 18% growth in 2016.The auto-parts industry group is ranked No. 65 out of 197 groups. Several stocks made big moves during the economic recovery.Analysts attributed the strength to the fact that motorists are driving their cars longer and at some point need spare parts.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and AutoZone (AZO) are the group's top performers. Both stocks are near highs and have been riding along their 50-day moving averages.O'Reilly's EPS rose 28% in its most recent report. Analysts forecast an 18% increase in its next report. Earnings growth comes in consistently at 20%, while revenue growth is typically in the high single digits.AutoZone's earnings rose 16% in the most recent report, and analysts are looking for 12% growth in the next report.

When gas prices drop sharply, consumers have more discretionary dollars to spend on car maintenance projects.And though severe weather can keep customers out of car showrooms, the damage it causes on existing vehicles spurs sales of tires and parts down the road.

"
543,AAP,"Lower gas prices should prompt people to drive more and put more stress on their cars, fueling demand for parts and services from O'Reilly and its large auto parts retail peers, including AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP), analysts say.
"
544,AAP,"Last year, O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers got a nice jolt from the extremely cold winter, which increased wear and tear on cars, driving up demand for auto parts.
"
545,AAP,"DIY Does Well
"
546,AAP,"O'Reilly generates about 58% of its sales from do-it-yourself customers, who take on their own repairs, and the remaining 42% from professional service providers, including garages, repair shops and paint and body shops.
"
547,AAP,"At the end of last year it had 4,366 stores in 43 states. It has 26 regional distribution centers.
"
548,AAP,"O'Reilly's stock has been enjoying an impressive run. The company's share price shot up 50% in 2014. It's risen 8% so far this year.
"
549,AAP,"Why the investor enthusiasm?
"
550,AAP,"""The industry had very favorable weather last year, which helped create a lot of demand,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Higginbotham. ""Everyone's revenue grew nicely. Just as that tailwind seemed to fade, gas prices fell. So there was a nice handoff from weather to lower gas prices.""
"
551,AAP,"O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers have been ""consolidating"" the industry and taking share from the mom-and-pop players, he adds, which has increased their negotiating power with a very ""fragmented"" vendor base.
"
552,AAP,"""That has driven big gains in margin and working capital efficiency, which has also (helped) the stock performance."" he said. ""With longer and longer payment terms from their vendors — having more days to pay — players like O'Reilly have been able to fund inventory at almost zero cost, which allows them to take even more share from the mom-and-pops. (That) leads to even better negotiating leverage and so on, a dynamic which (I refer) to as the 'auto parts retail virtuous cycle.'""
"
553,AAP,"O'Reilly's stock popped around 8% on Feb. 5, following a strong fourth-quarter report late the day before.
"
554,AAP,"Earnings climbed 26% to $1.76 a share, ahead of the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 9% to $1.76 billion, also beating forecasts.

The additional $500 million is effective for a three-year period beginning on Feb. 4.

558,AAP,"Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Craig Kennison calls O'Reilly a ""wonderful"" company.
"
559,AAP,"""At the end of the day, commercial repair shops are in the business of fixing cars and the best way to serve them is to have the right part at the right time at the right price when they need it,"" he said. ""It's about parts fulfillment. I think O'Reilly has the right distribution infrastructure to get parts to consumers and repair shops when they need it.
"
560,AAP,"""If you look at the financial metrics, (O'Reilly generates) a tremendous return on capital, it has very strong cash flow and a good (stock) buyback strategy to return capital to shareholders,"" he added.
"
561,AAP,"What differentiates O'Reilly from the other auto parts retailers is that it has the ""strongest history and most consistent execution of a mix of retail and commercial businesses,"" adds Higginbotham.
"
562,AAP,"He says that auto parts retailers that historically have had a retail focus are ""moving more"" into the commercial business.
"
563,AAP,"""O'Reilly has the most dense distribution of all the players,"" he added. ""It has the most distribution centers per store. That allows them to fulfill orders more efficiently, more often, which is more crucial in the commercial business than the retail business.""
"
564,AAP,"The commercial business, Higginbotham adds, is a ""different ball game"" in terms of having to be able to say yes to as many requests as possible. He says that having the supply of products to meet the requests means investing a lot in inventory and distribution.
"
565,AAP,"""O'Reilly is best at doing that,"" he said.
"
566,AAP,"Higginbotham says that several years ago, store growth was the big driver of O'Reilly's strong performance.
"
567,AAP,"More recently, it's been a function of the company's ""superiority"" in terms of execution, which has helped it gain a lot of market share, he adds.
"
568,AAP,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O'Reilly to see a 16% rise in full-year 2015 earnings to $8.55 a share. They expect a 13% gain in 2016 and a 14% increase in 2017 — lower growth than in years past but still strong.
"
569,AAP,"Low Gas Prices Drive Business
"
570,AAP,"Lower gas prices should be a nice tailwind for the industry, says Higginbotham.
"
571,AAP,"""Lower gas prices are an important driver because if gas is cheaper, people tend to drive more and it puts more wear and tear on their cars,"" he said.
"
572,AAP,"They tend to benefit the low-income consumer — the do-it-yourself customer — the most, he adds.
"
573,AAP,"Lower gas prices can have a ""meaningful"" impact on spending on car repairs, adds Kennison.
"
574,AAP,"""In a tough economy people will defer spending on car repairs,"" he said. ""At some point the deferment catches up.
"
575,AAP,"""Lower gas prices give consumers the resources to fix some deferred maintenance items.""

O'Reilly (ORLY), highly rated by IBD, has logged 16 straight quarters of double-digit profit growth.Analysts see it staying in the fast lane as the specialty retailer of aftermarket auto parts continues to rev up its business by luring commercial and do-it-yourself customers with top-flight service, a deep and broad-based inventory and far-flung distribution capabilities.Lower gas prices should prompt people to drive more and put more stress on their cars, fueling demand for parts and services from O'Reilly and its large auto parts retail peers, including AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP), analysts say.Last year, O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers got a nice jolt from the extremely cold winter, which increased wear and tear on cars, driving up demand for auto parts.DIY Does WellO'Reilly generates about 58% of its sales from do-it-yourself customers, who take on their own repairs, and the remaining 42% from professional service providers, including garages, repair shops and paint and body shops.At the end of last year it had 4,366 stores in 43 states. It has 26 regional distribution centers.O'Reilly's stock has been enjoying an impressive run. The company's share price shot up 50% in 2014. It's risen 8% so far this year.Why the investor enthusiasm?""The industry had very favorable weather last year, which helped create a lot of demand,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Higginbotham. ""Everyone's revenue grew nicely. Just as that tailwind seemed to fade, gas prices fell. So there was a nice handoff from weather to lower gas prices.""O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers have been ""consolidating"" the industry and taking share from the mom-and-pop players, he adds, which has increased their negotiating power with a very ""fragmented"" vendor base.""That has driven big gains in margin and working capital efficiency, which has also (helped) the stock performance."" he said. ""With longer and longer payment terms from their vendors — having more days to pay — players like O'Reilly have been able to fund inventory at almost zero cost, which allows them to take even more share from the mom-and-pops. (That) leads to even better negotiating leverage and so on, a dynamic which (I refer) to as the 'auto parts retail virtuous cycle.'""O'Reilly's stock popped around 8% on Feb. 5, following a strong fourth-quarter report late the day before.Earnings climbed 26% to $1.76 a share, ahead of the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 9% to $1.76 billion, also beating forecasts.Same-store sales rose a hefty 6.3% from a year earlier.O'Reilly management did not respond to a phone call requesting a comment for this story.The company announced that it approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under its share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, raising the aggregate authorization to $5 billion. The additional $500 million is effective for a three-year period beginning on Feb. 4.Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Craig Kennison calls O'Reilly a ""wonderful"" company.""At the end of the day, commercial repair shops are in the business of fixing cars and the best way to serve them is to have the right part at the right time at the right price when they need it,"" he said. ""It's about parts fulfillment. I think O'Reilly has the right distribution infrastructure to get parts to consumers and repair shops when they need it.""If you look at the financial metrics, (O'Reilly generates) a tremendous return on capital, it has very strong cash flow and a good (stock) buyback strategy to return capital to shareholders,"" he added.What differentiates O'Reilly from the other auto parts retailers is that it has the ""strongest history and most consistent execution of a mix of retail and commercial businesses,"" adds Higginbotham.He says that auto parts retailers that historically have had a retail focus are ""moving more"" into the commercial business.""O'Reilly has the most dense distribution of all the players,"" he added. ""It has the most distribution centers per store. That allows them to fulfill orders more efficiently, more often, which is more crucial in the commercial business than the retail business.""The commercial business, Higginbotham adds, is a ""different ball game"" in terms of having to be able to say yes to as many requests as possible. He says that having the supply of products to meet the requests means investing a lot in inventory and distribution.""O'Reilly is best at doing that,"" he said.Higginbotham says that several years ago, store growth was the big driver of O'Reilly's strong performance.More recently, it's been a function of the company's ""superiority"" in terms of execution, which has helped it gain a lot of market share, he adds.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O'Reilly to see a 16% rise in full-year 2015 earnings to $8.55 a share. They expect a 13% gain in 2016 and a 14% increase in 2017 — lower growth than in years past but still strong.Low Gas Prices Drive BusinessLower gas prices should be a nice tailwind for the industry, says Higginbotham.""Lower gas prices are an important driver because if gas is cheaper, people tend to drive more and it puts more wear and tear on their cars,"" he said.They tend to benefit the low-income consumer — the do-it-yourself customer — the most, he adds.Lower gas prices can have a ""meaningful"" impact on spending on car repairs, adds Kennison.""In a tough economy people will defer spending on car repairs,"" he said. ""At some point the deferment catches up.""Lower gas prices give consumers the resources to fix some deferred maintenance items.""O'Reilly is part of IBD's Retail-Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group, which also includes Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, Copart (CPRT), Pep Boys (PBY) and a handful of others. O'Reilly gets the highest IBD Composite Rating of those companies, a 98 out of a possible 99, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock price gains.

678,AAP,"The week saw the release of the auto sales report for the month of June. U.S. auto sales jumped in the month, defying the odds of rising interest rates, higher gas prices and large supply of used vehicles. While the first half of the year saw auto sales rise 1.8%, sales in June increased 5% compared with a year ago.

In fact, the auto industry, which relies heavily on a complicated global supply chain and is adapting to a spate of technological changes such as autonomous and electric vehicles (EVs) technology, is likely to be adversely impacted by this trade policy.Other than the June sales report and tariff concerns, the week saw Tesla, Inc.’s (TSLA  -  Free Report) vehicle production reaching a historic level in the second quarter of 2018, making it the most-productive three-month period.

679,AAP,"Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will shift some of its production out of the United States to avoid EU (European Union) tariffs. The automaker’s decision came after Trump’s announcement of imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, imported from the EU. In retaliation, the EU levied tariffs on U.S. goods, including motorcycles.Understandably, this tariff war has raised concerns among automakers. In fact, not only the automakers but the overall auto sector — including auto manufacturers, dealers, and auto parts and transportation companies — will be hit.Other than tariff-induced activities, the week saw Toyota Motor Corporation’s (TM  -  Free Report) luxury brand, Lexus, making the announcement to recall around 121,000 cars to fix fuel leaks that can cause a fire. Also, the week witnessed Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) inking a deal with China’s Internet search company, Baidu Inc. The companies will co-develop artificial intelligence and smart connectivity solutions for cars.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Jun 21, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Harley-Davidson reported its plan to shift the manufacturing of its motorcycles in the United States — which are sold in European Union (EU) — to international facilities. The decision has been taken after the EU hiked import tariffs to 31% for products manufactured in the United States, effective Jun 22, 2018.The hike in import tariffs has been levied by the EU as a counter strike for raising tariffs on steel and aluminum exported from the EU to the United States.Harley-Davidson expects the increased tariffs to raise costs of up to $2,200 per average motorcycle if the company continues to ship motorcycles from the United States to the EU countries. Further, it has no plan to transfer the increased costs to wholesale or retail customers. Per the company, passing on the costs to dealers and retail customers might have a long-term negative impact on its business in the European region.Harley-Davidson will have to bear the rise in costs due to increased tariffs, which will result in incremental costs of roughly $30-$45 million for the rest of 2018. Moreover, as the company has to ramp up production at its international facilities, it has to make investments to upgrade facilities, which are expected to take at least 9-18 months to be fully ready.

The majority of the recalls include cars in the United States. This is a blow to the Japanese auto giant, which has already been grappling with several recall issues.According to Toyota, the fuel injection system, which is composed of diaphragm material, may harden over time, leading to a fuel leakage. The company has assured that the dealers are going to replace the fuel delivery pipe with a new one, which has improved parts, at no cost.Toyota is one of the leading automakers in the world, in terms of sales and production. In the past few years, the company has been recalling vehicles in large numbers. Recalls not only affect the company’s reputation adversely but also result in considerable expenses and lower vehicle resale value. In January 2018, Toyota announced a recall of 601,300 vehicles due to flawed Takata airbags. The recall comprised of Toyota and Lexus models. The latest case of recall includes certain 2006 through 2013 IS350 cars, 2010 through 2014 IS350C, and 2007 through 2011 GS350 and GS450h. All contain 3.5-liter V6 gasoline engines.

During the production halt, the company will deal with problems caused by engine emission tests. Except for Wolfsburg hub, facilities at Zwickau and Emden will also remain closed for a few days.A new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (“WLTP”), which works on real-driving information, has found higher carbon dioxide emission readings in a few vehicles. The new readings have deferred official road certification for those vehicles and thus, sales.These delays have deterred the company to be on track with the production of some of its vehicle models at different hubs. Further, Volkswagen has witnessed a probable dip in sales due to stricter emission tests. Last week, Daimler AG blamed WLTP and trade wars for lowering its income guidance.

681,AAP,"U.S. customers have recently shown a distinct shift in the preference for trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs), shunning the traditional sedans. Automakers have already started to reorient their programs and strategies in response to the new situation, where the demand for conventional compact and midsize cars has declined while increased for SUVs and pickup trucks.The recent decision of General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) to abandon three Cadillac sedans and replacing them with two new ones over the next three and a half years vindicates this trend. In 2012, shares of traditional passenger cars were more than 50% of new-vehicle sales in the United States but, it dropped to less than 37% in 2017.In addition to General Motors’ decision to dump the sedans, the week also saw other important developments. Two auto giants, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) are exploring an alliance on a wide range of activities, including the development of commercial vehicles. In the past week, Winnebago Industries Inc. (WGO  -  Free Report) reported strong earnings results, surpassing both the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the prior-year quarter figure.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Jun 14, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per Associated Press, General Motors is dumping three Cadillac sedans and replacing them with two new ones over the next three and a half years.

The alliance would aid both the companies to compete effectively in the global market, which is increasingly demanding high-tech and efficient lower-emission vehicles.Thomas Sedran, the head of the German automaker Volkswagen’s strategy division, noted that the two companies have “strong and complementary positions in different commercial vehicle segments already.” Moreover, the U.S. auto giant, Ford is a dominant player in the medium-duty truck market in the United States and its F-series pickup has been the best-selling vehicle in the country for decades. On the other hand, Volkswagen, which owns MAN and Scania truck brands in Europe, formed a commercial-vehicle alliance with the Japanese truckmaker, Hino Motors Ltd in early 2018.In order to adapt to the challenging environment, it is important to explore alliances. In fact, several automakers have collaborated on various big projects. This particular alliance discussion is an addition to this trend.

Under this collaboration, the two companies can share non-competitive components and access each other's intellectual property to develop fuel cells for vehicles.For Volkswagen Group, world's largest auto seller, Audi is responsible for developing hydrogen fuel-cell technology. Per its strategy for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), Audi is collaborating with companies to develop this sustainable technology at lucrative costs.The capacity to cover longer distances and a shorter recharge time make hydrogen an attractive alternative energy option for electric mobility, specifically for large and heavy automobiles, due to FCEV's design.

682,AAP,"It was a week that saw major auto companies undertaking initiatives to enhance their position in the pickup segment as well as planning to lower sedan production. In fact, these two strategies are not conflicting at all. As conventional compact and mid-size cars have started to lose favor among customers and demand for SUVs and pickup trucks has increased, automakers have started to reorient their programs and strategies.In the past week, German vehicle behemoth Volkswagen AG reportedly showed interest to augment its position in the midsize pickup segment with a U.S.-made pickup, which is likely to be manufactured in Tennessee. Again, according to the Wall Street Journal, Japanese auto giant Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) has decided to halt the production of Accord sedan for two weeks. The auto maker has taken such a decision as it intends to adjust fat inventories and align its production with the current market situation.Also, the week saw earnings announcement from Westport Fuel Systems Inc.’s (WPRT  -  Free Report) and inking of memoranda of understanding (MoU) by Ford Motor Co.

A truck, which was carrying Tesla Model S vehicles, was recently embroiled in an accident.Two Tesla vehicles were crushed by the upper deck of the truck.

684,AAP,"The past week saw heightened activities from auto companies such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Magna International Inc. in the self-driving vehicles front. While General Motors promised investment for upgrading self-driving vehicles manufacturing, Magna announced a partnership with the ride sharing company Lyft, to finance, build and manufacture self-driving systems.However, this week self-driving activities suffered a setback as a test vehicle from leading ridesharing company, Uber Technologies Inc. struck and killed a 49-year-old woman in Tempe, AZ. Safety issues apart, this sad incident gave a jolt to the self-driving car industry, which is witnessing billions of dollars of investment and has the potential to be a game changer in the transportation space.On the positive side, the week also saw some relaxation in the imposition of tariffs for Canada and Mexico, keeping in mind the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations. President Trump dropped the initial proposal that vehicles manufactured in Canada and Mexico and intended for the U.S. market should contain at least 50% American materials. This has somewhat relieved the auto industry.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Mar 15, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Superior Industries International Inc.’s (SUP  -  Free Report) adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share for fourth-quarter 2017 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. Including after-tax expense and the impact of U.S. tax reform, net loss for the quarter was $4.6 million or 50 cents per share.Revenues were $361.8 million in the reported quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $363.8 million. However, the reported figure was higher than $188.3 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Wheel unit shipments were 5.4 million compared with 3.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The rise was primarily due to the addition of its European operations, partly offset by a decline in the North American market  from the prior-year quarter. Value-added sales, i.e., net sales minus pass-through charges for aluminum, increased to $203.5 million compared with $106.4 million in fourth-quarter 2016.Gross profit rose to $39.7 million from $18 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to the addition of European operations, partly offset by non-recurring effects of purchase accounting adjustments of $1.3 million related to the buyout of UNIWHEELS and ongoing amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition.

The amount will be used to manufacture a new sports utility vehicle (SUV), per Reuters. This decision was taken by the company after a surge in demand for large vehicles was observed.The new five-passenger SUV will be added to the company’s Atlas family.

685,AAP,"The auto industry has been plagued with several problems of late. Lower vehicle sales recorded by many automakers can be attributed to soft demand for vehicles by consumers following a lengthy boom phase. In fact, majority of the automakers witnessed decline in sales in February. Automakers’ new stance of offering lower discounts to buyers, stringent credit conditions and a rise in interest rate kept a lid on consumer demand and eventually resulted in a decline in new vehicles sales.However, the new-found strength in the broader economy, better job results have again provided some edge to the auto companies. Leading rating agency, Moody’s, projects U.S. auto sales to decline less in 2018 than the previous forecast. Automakers are now projected to sell 16.9 million light vehicles in the United States in 2018, up from Moody’s previous forecast of 16.8 million. Overall improvement in the economy partly led to this upward revision.Besides these possible upsides for the auto companies emanating from the broader economy, there was the usual readiness from the auto companies in the electric vehicles front. Earnings announcements also continued in the past week. (Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Mar 8, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Navistar International Corp.’s (NAV  -  Free Report) adjusted loss was 24 cents per share in first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Jan 31, 2018), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 41 cents. In the year-ago period, the company reported the loss of 76 cents per share.Navistar recorded net loss of $73 million compared with the net loss of $62 million in the prior-year quarter.Navistar’s revenues increased 15% year over year to $1.91 billion in the reported quarter. However, revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.94 billion. This year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by a 24% increase in sales volume of the company’s Class 6-8 vehicles in the United States as well as Canada.During the quarter, revenues at Navistar’s Truck segment increased to $1.25 billion, a surge of $224 million from the year-ago figure. This improvement primarily occurred on the back of higher volumes in the company’s Core markets, a rise in military sales and the production of GM-branded units manufactured at Springfield, OH plant. This was partly offset by a fall in the Mexico and export truck volumes. The segment recorded a loss of $7 million during the quarter.

Additionally, the carmaker implored the U.S. Congress to rethink about the expansion of the tax credit for EV.Per management, the U.S. regulators should consider the potential benefits of increased usage of autonomous vehicles while deciding on tax credits. Few of the benefits associated with these vehicles are lower carbon dioxide emission and fuel consumption, among others.At present, once an automaker achieves a sales target of 200,000 EV units in a year, it no longer remains eligible for a consumer tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle. General Motors already sold 160,000 units of full-electric and plug-in vehicles and are anticipated to achieve the limit by the end of this year.Per the December 2017 tax bill, the government did not remove tax credit on EVs and also did not act on the proposal to raise the limit.Launched in October 2016, General Motors Chevrolet Bolt was the first EV, available at a price under $40,000, to run over 200 miles on a single charge. In 2017, General Motors sold total 26,000 units of Bolt, though electric-driven vehicles account a fraction of its overall sales figure.

688,AAP,"Not only electric vehicles (EVs) but electric trucks have also grabbed the attention of the automakers around the world. Due to its emission-free nature and cost-effective maintenance feature, electric trucks are slowly gaining traction in the auto space.German auto major Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) has made a huge investment in this space. Similarly, Tesla Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report)  announced its plan to launch heavy-duty semi truck, with a 500-mile range, for longer distance. Recently, Daimler AG (DDAIF  -  Free Report) announced its plan to launch a fully-electric semi-trailer truck, the production of which will start in 2021. However, the success of electric trucks will hugely depend on the availability of batteries along with its capacity and range.Alongside activities on the electric truck front, the week also saw Tesla making an announcement to downsize its workforce by around 9% to lower costs for becoming sustainably profitable, without compromising on its Model 3 sedan production goals. This downsizing will not impact the ability of the company to achieve the Model 3 production target in the near future.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Jun 7, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a big development, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd.

Per Reuters, this layoff decision is in sync with the carmaker’s strategy to simplify its management structure.The chief executive officer, Elon Musk informed that the job cuts mostly include the salaried staff and this won’t affect the workers in the production assembly lines. In other words, this downsizing will not impact the ability of the company to achieve the Model 3 production target in near future.Albeit rising sales, Tesla remains a loss-making company. The loss is expected due to significant investments made toward developing new vehicles and technologies along with the establishment of a retail network. It is expected that the company may find it difficult to achieve sustained net profits until Model 3 enters full-scale production.

One of the two facilities will manufacture hydrogen fuel stack mass while a new line will be added to an existing facility for producing high-pressure hydrogen tanks. The decision is in line with Toyota’s projection that global sales of FCEV will increase to at least 30,000 units per year after 2020. At present, the figure is 3,000 units per year.In order to increase fuel cell stack production, the facility will be shifted from its existing location to Honsha Plant in Toyota City. Further, the production of high-pressure hydrogen tanks will be handled by its Shimoyama Plant in Miyoshi City. Production at new sites will begin around 2020.In December 2014, the company introduced its mass-produced fuel-cell sedan, Mirai. Due to high manufacturing costs and difficulty in building its components, Mirai was initially manufactured in small lots. Gradually, the annual production and sales increased from around 700 units in 2015 to roughly 2,000 units in 2016.

Strong demand from China and Europe, and untapped potential in the southern hemisphere are behind this positive expectation.Notably, after being severely affected by the emissions scandal in 2015, this German auto giant set an ambitious plan to emerge as the world leader in green transport. By 2025, the company intends to deliver one million VW-brand EVs every year. This strategy, to enter into volume production of EVs, has been taken by the company as its rival Tesla is investing enormous amount for the mass production of the Model 3.An upsurge in EV investment in China, the world’s largest auto market, can be attributed to the efforts adopted by the mainland to tackle air pollution. This has led to the lowering of battery prices and growing appeal of the EV technology. Other German automakers are also investing a huge amount of money for EVs. Apart from China, Europe and the United States, Volkswagen also sees huge opportunities in other areas, including South America. (Read more: Volkswagen to Meet EV Target on Rising Demand)Volkswagen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.4.    Per Reuters, Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY  -  Free Report) is reportedly cutting down its production in North America by about 20%. Waning profitability in the United States has prompted the automaker to make such a move.Notably, considerable growth in vehicle sales in the United States in the past can be attributed to higher discounting and fleet sales. This, however, eroded the profitability of the second-largest Japanese automaker. The declining profitability has prompted the automaker to rethink its strategy and cut down production in North America.Nissan’s sales in the United States declined 6.5% so far in 2018, due to slow demand for its high-volume Altima sedan and popular Rogue crossover sports utility vehicles (SUVs). Huge discounts for Altima, Rogue crossover SUV and other models were responsible for the sharp decline in Nissan’s North American operating profit.Presently, production cuts are in progress at Nissan’s two assembly plants n the United States and three in Mexico. However, production will not be completely stopped, with the cutbacks likely to complete later this year. Now, the company aims at improving profitability in North America while also raising sales in China, which is the biggest auto market in the world.

The company initially targeted to release the vehicle in the later-half of 2018. Further, the right-hand drive Model 3 units for the United Kingdom and other countries are anticipated to launch in the middle of 2019.Tesla has been struggling to manufacture 5,000 Model 3 units as a weekly target by the end of second-quarter 2018. In order to meet the target, the company announced the addition of another working shift for general assembling, body and paint at its hub in Fremont, CA. Earlier, in the first quarter, Tesla manufactured 2,020 Model 3 vehicles per week, lagging from its target of 2,500 units.Additionally, Musk announced that Tesla is holding the production of the low-cost Model 3 sedan version. The $35,000 low-cost version will be available after the company reaches its goal of producing 5k units of premium edition every week.

694,AAP,"Auto companies across the globe continue to focus on electric vehicles (EVs). Government regulations have led to an increased preference for EVs over other combustion-engine vehicles.China witnessed strong demand for EVs among the major automotive markets. Further, the country is providing subsidies for encouraging buyers to opt for more such environment-friendly vehicles. Increased demand in the mainland prompted many automakers in China to manufacture and launch EVs.With an intention to challenge the dominance of domestic players, many foreign automakers are collaborating with China’s national companies to offer EVs.This week saw earnings beats from a few companies, including AutoZone, Inc.

The recent demand for trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs) among the customers forced Ford to take this decision.Per data, compiled by a trade group of automakers, the company’s production at its Mexican facilities declined 31% in April, marking the lowest April production since 2009. Further, exports from Mexico witnessed a decrease, including a slump of 36% in units exported to the United States.The slump in output from Mexican facilities is due to Ford’s strategic shift in its U.S. market. The company has been focusing more on SUVs and trucks, and is disposing of its less-selling sedan models. Out of the sedans manufactured in Mexico, Fiesta subcompact, Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ are already losing popularity in the United States.Ford is frequently adjusting its production, depending on demands in the North American market, in sync with its goal to reduce inventory. Auto manufacturers consider 60 days’ supply to be an ideal-inventory level.

703,AAP,"Somewhat easing the tension of a trade war, China announced that it will erase the limit on foreign ownership of domestic auto ventures. This will assist foreign automakers to own factories in the country. Notably, this restriction has been in place since 1994, which limits foreign carmakers to own not more than 50% share of any local establishment.China will lift foreign ownership limit for the wider car market by 2022. This may open up opportunities for U.S. automakers and enable them to earn higher profits. But disentangling the network of collaborations forged with local Chinese companies may not be easy.The past week also saw General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) announcing layoffs of around 1,500 workers at its plant in Lordstown, OH, per CNBC.

The auto giant took such a decision due to the dramatically slowing demand for compact cars. Notably, the plant only manufactures the Chevy Cruze model and employs around 3,000 workers.In fact, the demand for sedans has declined steeply in recent times. This year, car sales have declined 13.2% while that of SUVs, crossovers and pickups rose 7%. For Chevy Cruze, the sales decline has been steeper. Per Autodata, Chevy Cruze sales plunged 28% in 2018. In 2017, over 184,000 Cruze models were sold in the United States compared with 273,000 vehicles in 2013.The facility will be slowing the assembly lines by eliminating one of the two shifts, starting from mid-June.

The difference includes a margin for error of the product parts. The news was first tracked by Electrek from an email by the company’s CEO to the employees.At the beginning of the month, Tesla reported unit productions for the first quarter of 2018. The company manufactured 2,020 Model 3 vehicles per week in the first quarter, thus lagging the target of manufacturing 2,500 Model 3 units per week. This shortfall in unit production prompted the company to set an internal target of 6,000 units to realize the 5k target.Per the company’s CEO, the recent temporary suspension of Model 3 production is planned to eliminate the bottlenecks that have delayed production. This will help Tesla to reach 3000-4000 Model 3 productions per week in May. Further, a similar suspension is expected at its two factories in California and Nevada to update the units in May.

Per the earnings record, the company beat estimates twice and missed twice in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.2%.In the last three months, shares of Advance Auto Parts have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock moved up 11.3% compared with the growth of 1.4% recorded by the industry during the period.Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advance Auto Parts, Inc. QuoteLet’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Advance Auto Parts is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Advance Auto Parts has an Earnings ESP of +1.41% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98. A positive ESP indicates that an earnings surprise is likely. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Advance Auto Parts carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?The company’s business depends on the seasonality and weather conditions. Extremely hot or cold weather generally leads to increased sales as automotive parts stop working at accelerated rates. For first-quarter 2018, the company expects a rise in demand, driven by winter-related demand in key regions.The company is focusing to expand its footprint by opening new stores, widening its online presence and by strategic acquisitions. Further, it aims to reduce inventory costs while improving the availability of products to meet customer needs. In fourth-quarter 2017, Advance Auto Parts announced a strategic partnership with Interstate Batteries, a leading provider of batteries for professional installers. Under the collaboration, the company’s stores and online website will offer the complete lineup of Interstate Batteries.However, funding new stores, maintaining the old ones and investing to develop the supply chain might lead to increased capital expenditure for the company. For 2018, Advance Auto Parts anticipates capital expenditure to be $250 million compared with roughly $189 million in 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderFew other auto stocks worth considering from the same space, comprising the right combination of elements to come up with earnings beat this time around:AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.42% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial numbers are supposed to be announced on May 22.

706,AAP,"The auto sector staged a comeback in March after sagging sales performance in February. A majority of automakers reported a rise in their March U.S. sales. A robust economy, product launches and fat discounts enabled auto players to witness a year-over-year rise in new vehicle sales. Even concerns over high interest rates and elevated gasoline prices could not deter Americans’ new-found liking for sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks, albeit at the cost of sedans and passenger cars.Per Autodata, auto industry sales rose 2.5% to 1,653,529 while new vehicle sales gained 6% in March. Moreover, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) was 17.5 million in comparison to 16.8 million, a year ago.Also, during the week, just prior to the March sales release, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) reportedly said that it will do away with the age-old monthly sales report in favor of quarterly reporting. The U.S. auto giant is of the opinion that 30 days is too short to absorb short-term volatility, therefore rendering the monthly figures exaggerated. It feels that the quarterly reporting system would better provide the correct picture of the health of the company as well as that of the industry.Also, the electric vehicles (EVs) maker, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) published its production figures for first-quarter 2018, which totaled 34,494 vehicles, up 40% sequentially. This happens to be the most productive quarter in the history of Tesla. Out of the total vehicles produced, 24,728 were Model S and Model X, and 9,766 were Model 3. The Model 3 output increased significantly on a sequential basis. However, the company missed its target of producing 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of first-quarter 2018. Actually, it produced 2020 Model 3 cars over the last seven days. Despite the production target miss, the first-quarter 2018 performance of Tesla looks encouraging.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Mar 29, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per Fox Business, Tesla has announced that it will voluntarily recall 123,000 of its luxury Model S sedans across the globe to fix the issue of faulty steering components.The Palo Alto, CA-based company stated that the recall includes Model S vehicles built before April 2016 and is devoid of any Model X or Model 3 versions. The company explained that it has detected “excessive corrosion” in the power steering bolts of the recalled vehicles. This glitch might result in reduced power steering.The EV maker will repair damages by replacing the specific bolts in the power steering component. The company has also intimated its plans to contact the affected customers directly for scheduling an appointment once the parts are available in their respective regions.However, the recent recall has further added to Tesla’s woes, which is already grappling with several challenges, particularly with respect to the production of Model 3 sedan, the low-cost EV targeting the mass market. (Read more: Vehicles Recall Continues Unabated: Tesla, No Exception)Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).2.    In a pioneering move, General Motors has reportedly taken the decision to abandon its usual practice of reporting sales on a monthly basis in favor of quarterly reporting. The U.S. auto giant is of the opinion that sales releases every month do not provide the true picture of the company’s intricate operations or the health of the auto industry, as it includes short-term fluctuations. However, per management, quarterly sales releases will give a better idea about the same.Abandoning monthly sales reports can be attributed to a number of factors. It has been witnessed that the effect of volatility does not smoothen adequately in the 30-day period. This has sometimes resulted in exaggerated monthly sales figures. According to the automaker, incentive campaigns, abnormal weather or product launches tilt monthly sales figures up or down.However, the company intends to provide investors and others a less volatile, longer-term metric to evaluate its performance. Replacing the monthly cycle with a quarterly one is likely to aid the company in this respect. This is echoed in the statement of Kurt McNeil, General Motors’ U.S. vice president for sales operations, “Thirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market.” McNeil further said, “Reporting sales quarterly better aligns with our business, and the quality of information will make it easier to see how the business is performing.” (Read more: General Motors to Drop Monthly Sales Report, Enticing Others)General Motors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company intends to initiate talks on the commodities’ suitability on its supply chain.Importantly, till this year, cobalt has been one of the top-performing metals. Moreover, cobalt, which is generally used for hardening steel, is an essential component in rechargeable batteries, as it is a good conductor of electricity. High demand for cobalt has made many users rush to secure supplies.

This upside was primarily owing to strong demand for its affordably-priced travel trailers. Pre-tax income increased 68.7% to $158.9 million from $94.2 million in the comparable quarter, last fiscal. This growth in the metric was backed by higher sales and improved gross margin, decreased selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses plus lower amortization expenses.Sales from Motorized RVs improved 22.8% to $566.6 million from $461.5 million in the year-ago quarter. This upside was driven by robust increase in demand for Class A and Class C motorhomes.

This is in sync with the company’s strategy to boost its EV line up and act in accordance with the Chinese EV production and sales regulations.Notably, China has imposed stringent rules for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles that will be available in the market from 2019. Moreover, per the new regulations, foreign automakers, which intend to operate in China, will have to tie up with local partners. On the other hand, foreign auto companies are coming up with a bevy of EV deals and new models in order to grab a greater share of the world’s largest auto market. For this, Toyota has entered into a partnership with China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group.Besides the development of all-electric vehicles in collaboration with local companies, the Japanese auto giant also has plans of introducing an EV model in China in 2010, which would be designed in Japan.In fact, global vehicle makers are coming up with new strategies for the Chinese market.

709,AAP,"Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 21.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 19.2%. Per its earnings record, it beat estimates in only one of the four trailing quarters with an average miss of 4.5%.In the last three months, shares of Advance Auto Parts have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock gained 20.2%, compared with the industry’s 8.9% rally during the period. Advance Auto Parts Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Advance Auto Parts Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Advance Auto Parts Inc Quote Let’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterAdvance Auto Parts has been witnessing a continuous rise in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses, primarily driven by higher investment toward customer-focused strategies and expenses related to store consolidation and support center restructuring. In third-quarter 2017, the company’s adjusted SG&A expenses were $775.5 million or 35.5% of sales, in comparison with $770.6 million or 34.3% in the year-ago period. Also, huge pricing competition with its peers, which include both national and regional automotive retailers, is a concern for Advance Auto Parts.However, the company’s constant effort to keep on expanding its stores has been majorly driving its profits. In fiscal 2017, the company aims to open 75 to 85 new stores, while it opened 78 stores in 2016.For the long term, the company is working toward improvising its comparable store sales and margins. The former figure is anticipated to range between remaining stable and growing 2% year over year in 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Advance Auto Parts is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Advance Auto Parts has an Earnings ESP of -2.63% because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 63 cents and 65 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell, before they’re reported, with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Advance Auto Parts carries a Zacks Rank of 2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its combination with a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction inconclusive. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few auto stocks worth considering from the same space, comprising the right combination of elements to come up with earnings beat this time around:Magna International, Inc.

710,AAP,"Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market. The companies that put emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage, as strong sales are generally converted into growth.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings while assessing the growth of a business. This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability to generate more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base.Stable or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company and offers limited scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without solid top-line growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires robust sales growth.However, sales growth in isolation doesn’t indicate much about a company’s future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits.Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Roanoke, VA, Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) provides automotive replacement parts, accessories, batteries, and maintenance items. The company has expected sales growth rate of 2.3% for the current year and sports a Zacks Rank #1.J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.

711,AAP,"Consumers and businesses helped the U.S. economy expand at a healthy pace for a third straight quarter late last year. Consumer outlays in particular improved on a steady job market and healthier household finances, while the recently-passed tax overhaul policy is expected to give spending another boost this year.Business also perked up, with outlays increasing on equipment. Investments in new housing jumped significantly as well. Hence, it seems judicious to invest in areas where consumers have led the way and businesses have ramped up investments.Economy Doing Just FineThough fourth-quarter economic growth missed estimates, the economy is doing just fine. The nation’s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017 following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.The economy also expanded at a rate of 2.3% for all of 2017 following a discouraging 1.5% increase in 2016. The growth topped the 2.2% average of the last eight-and-a-half-year old recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-09. But, the most encouraging sign is that the economy showed resilience. After all, growth surpassed the coveted 3% mark in the third quarter in spite of the hurricane damages in Texas and Florida.Consumer Spending – A Key CatalystThe economy, nonetheless, was driven by solid consumer spending in the fourth quarter. The main engine of the economy grew at 3.8% over the quarter after a 2.2% gain in the third quarter. Consumer outlays, thus, registered the fastest pace of growth in the fourth quarter in almost two years. Americans have spent on a range of items from new cars and trucks to clothing and health care. Consumers are, largely, benefitting from a low unemployment level and rise in income. Jobless rate remained at an ultra-low level of 4.1% and workers’ pay has increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017. To top it, the National Employment Law Project showed that minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States. This will reach employee wage closer to $15 an hour, which is known as “living wage.”In fact, the massive tax cuts approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress could further stoke consumption this year. Such tax cuts will drive household income and in turn increase the propensity to consume (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Businesses Are Investing MoreCompanies have ramped up spending in the fourth quarter, up 6.8%. A resurgent global economy helped businesses to step up their outlays. Equipment outlays rose 11.4%, while investments in new housing climbed 11.6% after two months of decline. More number of single family houses is being built in response to a long-term housing shortage.Among other bright spots, government spending increased at a clip of 3%. Government outlays were supported by a solid 6% rise in defense outlays and a robust increase in federal as well as state and local spending.Inventories Decline, Trade Gap WidensDrop in inventories and a big trade gap, in the meantime, dented fourth-quarter GDP by 1.8 percentage points. If these factors are excluded, GDP will top 4% growth, something which President Trump is aiming for. However, this fall in inventories doesn’t mean that businesses are pessimistic about future demand. In fact, they failed to adequately forecast demand in the fourth quarter and had to sell out from their stockpiles.The other factor that dragged GDP was trade. But in the fourth quarter, exports were healthy, climbing 6.9%. It’s just that imports were stronger, rising 13.9%. Nevertheless, the economy continues to be in good shape and has expanded for ten straight quarters since the recession.5 Biggest GainersAs consumers continue to increase their spending on big-ticket items, auto and auto parts stand to gain. In fact, durable goods have an extended product life and are not typically worn out within a short span of time. Consumers have also increased their spending on healthcare and garments, thus, investing in stocks from such areas seems prudent.Significantly higher equipment spending and a rise in residential investment call for investing in such a space. We have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid areas that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -  Free Report) provides automotive replacement parts, accessories, batteries, and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars, vans, sport utility vehicles, and light and heavy duty trucks.

712,AAP,"The week saw a number of auto makers coming up with their 2018 outlook. General Motors Company (GM) expects 2017 earnings per share at the upper end of its guided range of $6-$6.5. Further for 2018, it expects the metric almost in line with the tally of 2017. The company expects that its performance in 2018 will be driven by its strengthening presence in the North American and Chinese markets as well as an improvement in the South American market.Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) released preliminary results for 2017 and guidance for 2018. The company announced earnings per share of $1.95 for 2017, a rise of 80 cents from 2016. Also, the company announced 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.78, reflecting an increase of 2 cents from 2016. For 2018, the company expects adjusted EPS in the range of $1.45–$1.70. Rise in commodity prices and adverse effect of exchange rate can be attributed to this unfavorable outlook.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Jan 11, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report) and Mazda Motor Corporation announced that they have selected Huntsville, AL as their joint venture (JV) manufacturing site. Total investment of $1.6 billion will be made with equal funding contribution from both the companies.This recent move will boost the manufacturing capacity of both Toyota and Mazda in the United States. Set to start production in 2021, the new hub will add up to 4,000 jobs.Prior to this, in August, both Toyota and Mazda had announced plans of setting up an auto manufacturing plant in the country with an annual production capacity of 300,000 vehicles.Focusing on the North American market, Toyota will be independently manufacturing Corolla model at the new plant, while Mazda will be producing cross-over models for the same target market (read more: Toyota, Mazda Choose Alabama as JV Auto Manufacturing Site).Currently Toyota has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).2.    Per Reuters, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.

Additionally, it will invest $1 billion in its future plant at Warren, MI, located near Detroit, which in turn, is likely to generate 2,500 jobs at the hub.Notably, a year ago, Fiat Chrysler had announced this probable shifting of its heavy-duty pickup production to the United States, influenced by the U.S. tax and trade policies. Further, the U.S. government’s high chances of exit from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in the near future would compel automakers to pay a duty of 25% for pickup trucks manufactured in Mexico and sold across the United States.Almost 90% of the company’s Ram heavy-duty pickups is built at Mexico’s Saltillo plant and sold in the United States or Canada. Moreover, in 2017, Fiat Chrysler had scaled up its vehicle production by 39% to 639,000 units. This makes the company the third largest manufacturer of vehicles in Mexico, followed by Nissan Motor Co. and General Motors Company, respectively (read more: Fiat Chrysler to Shift Plant, Invest $1B in US Hub).Currently Fiat Chrysler has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Prices of a few metals such as aluminum and steel are adversely affecting the company.Also, only a couple of days ago, Ford announced that it is set to raise its planned investment in electric vehicles (EVs) to $11 billion by 2022.

Further for 2018, it expects the metric to be almost in line with the tally of 2017.Per management, the uptrend achieved in 2017 is likely to continue and further pick up the momentum to fortify in 2018 as well as in 2019.

714,AAP,"AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended May 5, 2018) results on May 22, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In three out of the trailing four quarters, the company reported an earnings beat while announcing an earnings miss in the remaining quarter. The average earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters was 3.8%. AutoZone has long-term growth rate of 13.7%.In the last three months, AutoZone’s shares have underperformed the industry. The company’s shares have lost 9.5% compared with the industry’s increase of 1.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.AutoZone, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AutoZone, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AutoZone, Inc. QuoteIs Positive Surprise Likely?According to our quantitative model, chances of AutoZone beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fiscal third quarter are high. This is because, it has the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for AutoZone is +0.42%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $13.04 and $12.99, respectively.Zacks Rank: AutoZone carries a Zacks Rank #3. This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?AutoZone utilizes cash flow to open new stores every year and repurchase shares. During second-quarter fiscal 2018, AutoZone opened 35 new stores and closed one in the United States. The company also opened three new stores in Mexico and two in Brazil. As of Feb 10, the company had 5,514 stores across 50 states in the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 532 in Mexico; 26 Interamerican Motor Corp. branches and 16 in Brazil. As of that date, the total store count was 6,088. It seemed that this trend continued in third-quarter fiscal 2018. This is likely to have some positive impacts on results.The company has ample liquidity to repurchase shares without compromising financial strength as well as credit ratings. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, AutoZone repurchased 227,000 shares for $174.9 million, reflecting an average price of $769 per share.

715,AAP,"Regular day trading Monday fought back from pre-market declines to finish slightly in the green, as softness in Asian markets look to be providing a gentle headwind on Western markets again this morning. Futures are again in the red, as forecasts for China’s economy expect it to slow in Q4. This is somewhat offset by better-than-expected GDP in Germany: +0.8% from the +0.6% analysts were looking for, on slightly stronger exports and capital investments.The main piece of econ data here at home this morning is the monthly Producer Price Index (PPI), which came in hotter than we were expecting for October: +0.4% versus the +0.1% consensus, with the ex-food & energy read also at 0.4% (+0.2% was expected). The headline also matched September’s 0.4%; year over year we see +2.8% — the best year-over-year PPI read since 2011.These numbers help illustrate the continued slow seep of inflation into the economy, as well as the fact that hurricane effects continue to roll off the data. It’s the Consumer Price Index (CPI), due out later, that will help the Fed solidify its rate increase plans for its December FOMC meeting (or not). The CPI not only gives a good indication of inflation metrics month by month, but also gives insight into consumers’ coping mechanisms with higher (or lower) prices.Q3 Earnings RundownZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) posted a typical positive earnings surprise ahead of today’s opening bell: earnings of $1.84 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $25.03 billion easily surpassed the $24.52 billion we had been looking for. This is at least the fifth straight earnings beat for Home Depot, whose trailing 4-quarter average was +3.8%.Home Depot also upped its full-year guidance from estimates, and expect comps to be up 6.5% year over year. The company said the balance of hurricane affects created a net loss of $51 million in the quarter, but things appear to be looking up for Home Depot for the year as a whole.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) posted a mixed report this morning, meeting the $1.00 per share expected while sales reached $8.76 billion, beneath the $8.88 billion the Zacks consensus anticipated. Hurricanes — including dozens of stores on the devastated island of Puerto Rico — and warmer weather hit the discount retailer in the quarter. Forecasts for fiscal 2018 (January end) are also beneath estimates.Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -  Free Report) shares are rocketing up 18% in today’s pre-market following a big beat on the bottom line: $1.43 per share versus a $1.22 consensus estimate. Sales of $2.18 billion came in slightly under the $2.21 billion expected. This marks the first earnings beat for AAP in the last 4 quarters, and the stock had been down more than 50% year to date before this morning’s bid-up.DICK’S Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) is selling off following its earnings release before the opening bell, even after beating estimates on its top and bottom lines: 30 cents per share outperformed the 26 cents expected, and revenues $1.94 billion surpassed the $1.89 billion in the Zacks consensus. However, reports of pressured margins suggest the company will underperform expectations, perhaps by as much as 20% in 2018. Shares are down 4% ahead of the opening bell.Finally, private investment firm Roark Capital has offered to buy Buffalo Wild Wings  for $150 per share this morning, sending shares surging more than 26% in today’s pre-market. This follows BWLD’s strong Q3 report from a couple weeks ago, when the stock also surged more than 20%; year-to-date, however, the specialty food and drink establishment was down 24%. This morning’s news looks to finally swing Buffalo Wild Wings into the black for calendar 2017.

720,AAP,"Last week saw quite a few auto companies reporting their quarterly numbers. While Magna International Inc. (MGA  -  Free Report), Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report), Westport Fuel Systems Inc. (WPRT  -  Free Report) and Meritor, Inc. (MTOR  -  Free Report) delivered an earnings beat, Superior Industries International Inc. (SUP  -  Free Report) came up with lower-than-expected earnings numbers.Per a Reuters report, General Motors Co. (GM  -  Free Report) this week announced that it will launch less a new range of electric vehicles (EVs) by 2021. This is a clear indication of the auto giant making an attempt to take on Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) which is facing problems with the mass production of its comparatively affordable Model 3.On a different note, this year, prices of used vehicles have not declined as much as expected. Although this is not good news for the customers, it has brought cheer among the automakers and dealers. In fact, low prices of used vehicles compel automakers to offer higher discounts to customers on new vehicles. However, as a result of lower-than-anticipated price decline of used cars, sale of new cars will not be affected much as was anticipated.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Nov 9, 2017)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Magna International reported third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.36, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.

723,AAP,"Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 14, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 4.24%.The company with an unimpressive earnings history has missed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and surpassed on one occasion. The average negative surprise in the trailing 12 months came in at 9.11%.Let’s see, how things shape up prior to the announcement.Advance Auto Parts Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Advance Auto Parts Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Advance Auto Parts Inc Quote Factors to ConsiderAdvance Auto Parts witnessed total adjusted Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses of $797.6 million or 35.2% of sales in second-quarter fiscal 2017 in comparison to the prior-year quarter’s figure of $767.1 billion or 34% of sales. This rise in expenses is primarily due to higher investments in customer-focused strategies and costs pertaining to medical, insurance and support center expenses. Further, for 2017, the company projects capital expenditures of around $250 million.Also, price competition among its national and regional peers and an improved quality of new vehicles leading to reduced need for maintenance and repair of parts are a few other concerns the company is facing.However, its relentless focus on store expansions might drive the company’s profit as more number of stores ensures greater availability of parts to customers, thereby leading to higher sales volume. In fiscal 2017, the company plans to open 60-65 new stores.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings being revised 0.81% downward over the last seven days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Advance Auto Parts is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But this is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP:  Advance Auto Parts has an Earnings ESP of -5.32%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.16 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.22.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Advance Auto Parts carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a stock also needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Price PerformanceLast three months, shares of Advance Auto Parts have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has declined 25.7% as aginst the industry’s 5.4% growth. Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider as per our model, these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter:Meritor Inc. (MTOR  -  Free Report) sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +4.26%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Westport Fuel Systems Inc.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

725,AAP,"Tuesday, November 14, 2017Regular day trading Monday fought back from pre-market declines to finish slightly in the green, as softness in Asian markets look to be providing a gentle headwind on Western markets again this morning. Futures are again in the red, as forecasts for China’s economy expect it to slow in Q4. This is somewhat offset by better-than-expected GDP in Germany: +0.8% from the +0.6% analysts were looking for, on slightly stronger exports and capital investments.The main piece of econ data here at home this morning is the monthly Producer Price Index (PPI), which came in hotter than we were expecting for October: +0.4% versus the +0.1% consensus, with the ex-food & energy read also at 0.4% (+0.2% was expected). The headline also matched September’s 0.4%; year over year we see +2.8% — the best year-over-year PPI read since 2011.These numbers help illustrate the continued slow seep of inflation into the economy, as well as the fact that hurricane effects continue to roll off the data. It’s the Consumer Price Index (CPI), due out later, that will help the Fed solidify its rate increase plans for its December FOMC meeting (or not). The CPI not only gives a good indication of inflation metrics month by month, but also gives insight into consumers’ coping mechanisms with higher (or lower) prices.Q3 Earnings RundownZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) posted a typical positive earnings surprise ahead of today’s opening bell: earnings of $1.84 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $25.03 billion easily surpassed the $24.52 billion we had been looking for. This is at least the fifth straight earnings beat for Home Depot, whose trailing 4-quarter average was +3.8%.Home Depot also upped its full-year guidance from estimates, and expect comps to be up 6.5% year over year. The company said the balance of hurricane affects created a net loss of $51 million in the quarter, but things appear to be looking up for Home Depot for the year as a whole.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) posted a mixed report this morning, meeting the $1.00 per share expected while sales reached $8.76 billion, beneath the $8.88 billion the Zacks consensus anticipated. Hurricanes — including dozens of stores on the devastated island of Puerto Rico — and warmer weather hit the discount retailer in the quarter. Forecasts for fiscal 2018 (January end) are also beneath estimates.Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -  Free Report) shares are rocketing up 18% in today’s pre-market following a big beat on the bottom line: $1.43 per share versus a $1.22 consensus estimate. Sales of $2.18 billion came in slightly under the $2.21 billion expected. This marks the first earnings beat for AAP in the last 4 quarters, and the stock had been down more than 50% year to date before this morning’s bid-up.DICK’S Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) is selling off following its earnings release before the opening bell, even after beating estimates on its top and bottom lines: 30 cents per share outperformed the 26 cents expected, and revenues $1.94 billion surpassed the $1.89 billion in the Zacks consensus. However, reports of pressured margins suggest the company will underperform expectations, perhaps by as much as 20% in 2018. Shares are down 4% ahead of the opening bell.Finally, private investment firm Roark Capital has offered to buy Buffalo Wild Wings  for $150 per share this morning, sending shares surging more than 26% in today’s pre-market. This follows BWLD’s strong Q3 report from a couple weeks ago, when the stock also surged more than 20%; year-to-date, however, the specialty food and drink establishment was down 24%. This morning’s news looks to finally swing Buffalo Wild Wings into the black for calendar 2017.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

(AAP  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the market opens on Aug 15.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 24.5%. In fact, in three of the trailing four quarters, the company recorded earnings miss and on one occasion, it beat the estimate. The average surprise in the trailing 12 months came in at negative 10.8%.Advance Auto Parts has underperformed the industry it belongs to in the last six months. The company’s shares have lost 34.7% over this period compared with 23.9% decline recorded by the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the impending announcement.Advance Auto Parts Inc Price and EPS Surprise Advance Auto Parts Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Advance Auto Parts Inc QuoteFactors to ConsiderAdvance Auto Parts is challenged by declining cash flows. During the 16-week period ended Apr 22, 2017, operating cash flow was $35.1 million, down from $88.4 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow in the period amounted to negative $30.2 million, significantly wider than negative $0.7 million in the prior-year period.Price competition remains a concern for Advance Auto Parts, as it competes with national and regional automotive retailers such as AutoZone, O’Reilly Automotive, Pep Boys and CSK Auto Corporation.Also, the improvement in the quality of new vehicles leads to reduced need for maintenance and repair of parts. This in turn, impedes demand in the automotive maintenance market. In addition, the fact that consumers are opting for new vehicle purchases instead of maintaining old ones, can affect the company products’ demand.Prior to its second-quarter earnings release, Zacks Consensus Estimate is showing a declining trend in the last one month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Advance Auto Parts is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Advance Auto Parts’ Earnings ESP is -0.61%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.64 whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.65. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Advance Auto Parts carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CACI International Inc (CACI  -  Free Report) is expected to release fiscal fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results on Aug 16, 2017. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.83%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Coach, Inc.  is expected to release fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results on Aug 15. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.04%.The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has an Earnings ESP of +3.85%. The company is expected to report second-quarter financial numbers on Aug 17.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

729,AAP,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) delivered strong first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 62 cents per share and revenues of $9.21 billion comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents and $9.03 billion, respectively.Earnings increased 12.3% from the year-ago quarter and were better than the company’s guided range of 59-61 cents. This was primarily driven by 7% (6% in constant currency) growth in revenues that was in line with the high end of management’s guidance of 4-6%.Oracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16.2% of total revenue versus 11.4% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 51.3% (60% in constant currency) to $1.49 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenue increased 8% in constant currency to $7.41 billion. Management noted that 80% of Oracle’s trailing 12-month software and cloud revenue is now recurring. Oracle Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Oracle Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Oracle Corporation QuoteWe believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future. The expanding customer base that includes the likes of AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Liberty Mutual Insurance, Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) and others is a key catalyst.Shares Decline on Soft OutlookShares were down 4.5% in after-hour trading following the results. The decline apparently reflects soft outlook. Earnings are anticipated to be between 64 cents and 68 cents for the quarter, with a positive impact of couple of cents from favorable currency tailwind.The high-end of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, which was pegged at 69 cents.Moreover, cloud growth outlook was unimpressive. Cloud revenues including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow between 39% and 43% (41% and 45% in the U.S. dollars), much lower than 51.3% reported by Oracle in the last quarter and 64.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Oracle’s stock has gained 37.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the 27.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. However, a brake in the cloud momentum can drag down the stock price in fiscal 2018.Cloud Drove Solid Top LineCloud software as a service (SaaS) revenues advanced a significant 61.6% (62% in constant currency) year over year to $1.09 billion. Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) revenues surged 29.2% (28% in constant currency) to $403 million. Cloud deferred revenues surged 53%.On-premise software revenues (64.2% of total revenue versus 67.6% in the year-ago quarter) increased 1.6% (1% at constant currency) to $5.92 billion reflecting continued higher attachment rates of software support and renewal rates.ERP surged 90% organically. Management stated that Fusion HCM soared 109%, which was double the growth rate of Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report). Database as a Service was up 53% from the year-ago quarter. CX also increased double digits organically.On Oct 1, Oracle is set to launch the next-generation database, which will be a totally autonomous system supported by machine learning. The company will be offering public Cloud service level agreements (SLAs) for the Oracle database that guarantee 99.995% systems availability time. This practically signifies less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year.Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (AWS).Per Oracle, PaaS infrastructure, business analytics and data integration revenues were up 28%, 130% and 221%, respectively.Software updates and product support revenues were almost $4.95 billion, up 2% in constant currency. On a combined basis, on-premise support and SaaS revenues were up 17%.Total hardware revenue slipped 5.3% (down 6% at constant currency) year over year to $943 million. Services revenues increased 6.4% (up 5% at constant currency) to $860 million.Operating DetailsSaaS gross margin was 67%, significantly higher than 59% reported in the year-ago quarter. PaaS and IaaS gross margin was 43% down from 58% posted in the year-ago quarter due to continued investments on geographical expansions.Operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 160 bps to 58.9%. The decline can primarily be attributed to lower software license updates and product support, hardware, services, sales & marketing and research & development expenses, which were down 40 bps, 50 bps, 40 bps, 80 bps and 60 bps, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 160 bps from the year-ago quarter to 41.1%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Aug 31, 2017, Oracle had cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $66.89 billion, up $819 million sequentially. Trailing four-quarter operating cash flow was $14.8 billion, while free cash flow was $12.6 billion.Share Repurchase & Dividend ContinuesOracle bought back 10.2 million shares for a total of $500 million in the quarter. In the last 12 months, the company repurchased 46.6 million shares for a total of 2 billion and paid out dividends of $2.8 billion.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, total revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 2%-4% in constant currency (4%-6% in the U.S. dollars). Favorable exchange rate will help revenues by at least 3%.  Oracle expects SaaS gross margin to improve in fiscal 2018 and hit 80% sometime during fiscal 2019. As the company gains scale, management expects PaaS and IaaS gross margins to expand significantly.Currently, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

731,AAP,"The auto sector is currently facing a lot of challenges. The problem of high-levels of inventory is putting pressure on auto stocks.In fact, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) has lowered the outlook for new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2017. This is an indication of the industry heading for a moderate downturn in 2017. A glut in nearly-new used vehicles is expected to undermine sales this year.Added to this, the U.S. government’s plans of exiting North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and introducing a border-tax system have worsened prospects of auto stocks. This would increase the cost of U.S. cars and threaten jobs of thousands of suppliers.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Honda Motor Co., Ltd.

733,AAP,"Last week saw some philanthropic activities by a few big auto companies in the Hurricane Irma-affected areas. Besides, the sector also witnessed heightened activities as Chinese authorities announced its plans of withdrawing manufacture and sales of traditional energy cars at an unspecified date.This readiness is evident all round. Shrugging off the emission scandals, Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) is going all out to establish itself in the electric vehicles market.Electric vehicles race apart, big automakers’ fight against car-sharing services and ride-hailing apps continued in the past week. Also, carmakers continued with their experimentation on self-driving vehicles.Given the assistance from government, technological breakthroughs and increasing acceptance of the powertrain by automakers and customers, the auto market seems to have almost reached a point of inflection.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Sep 7, 2017)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (PAG  -  Free Report) reported that it has acquired an extra 5.5% ownership interest in Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P.

This move is not only an indication of the company throwing a challenge to Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report), the frontrunner in this area, but also its plans of reorienting its strategies in line with the changing dynamics of the auto sector.The German auto major intends to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 to create mass market. The company plans to offer 80 new electric cars across its different groups by 2025, up from its earlier target of 30. In fact, the company intends to roll out the electric version of each of its 300 group models by 2030.Notably, until Volkswagen admitted to cheating on U.S. diesel emissions tests around two years ago, it did not show much interest in electric vehicles and self-driving technology. However, the massive transformation that is taking place in the industry has prompted the company to follow suit (read more: Volkswagen Joins Electric Car Race in a Big Way).Volkswagen currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank #3.3.    Autoliv, Inc. (ALV  -  Free Report) partners with Adient plc — the leading automotive seating supplier in the world — to tackle vehicle seating problems and suit the designs of future cars with autonomous driving facility. Both companies will engage in developing products and solutions to handle challenges pertaining to safety and comfort of self-driving vehicles.With the introduction of such sophisticated models in the market, drivers and passengers will be spending more time on non-driving activities. The interiors of these autonomous cars will thus grab more attention and play a more dominant role on the road.Passengers will look for more internal flexibility in computer-driven vehicles than before. For instance, alternative seating positions to relax, socialize and work. Also, seatbelts, pretentioners and buckles will remain primary components for controlling accidents even in vehicles without manual drivers (read more: Autoliv Allies With Adient for Advanced Seating System).Autoliv currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.4.    Per a Bloomberg report, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) is taking a slew of measures to compete with car-sharing services and ride-hailing apps.General Motors’ driverless car is ready for mass production and its Maven car-sharing business is also expanding, indicating that the automaker is ramping up for the autonomous future.General Motors has showcased the newest version of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolt electric car in San Francisco.

The attempt was to create normal visual language that people can understand.The company believes that developing a way to communicate is essential for self-driving cars since hand waves or head nods cannot be used in this scenario.Through this project, Ford’s attempt was to ensure that self-driving vehicles can safely share the road with humans.Researchers have come to a conclusion that lighting signals are the most helpful means for visual communication for autonomous cars. Similar to light signals used to indicate turning or braking signs, which is widely understood, will help self-driving vehicles to indicate if they are beginning to yield or are about to accelerate from a stop.Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).PerformanceIn the last week, all the stocks moved north.

The company’s shares have lost 34.6% compared with a 21.7% decline registered by the industry.Also, improved quality of new vehicles is a cause for concern for the company. Enhanced quality of new vehicles can result in lower demand for repair and maintenance parts, as customers are likely to buy new vehicles instead of maintaining old ones. This is adversely affecting the sales of Advance Auto Parts.Also, in the in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 15, 2017), Advance Auto Parts reported a 16.8% decline in adjusted earnings to $1.58 per share compared with $1.90 in the prior-year quarter.

Vehicles sold in the mainland increased 5.7% in September, on a year-over-year basis. This is the fourth consecutive month of increase in sales. This upward trend can be attributed to robust economic growth and hefty incentives given to the buyers. However, according to the industry body, vehicles sales growth in China in 2017 might fail to meet the target of 5% set earlier.New energy vehicles (NEV) sales rose 79.1% in September, backed by strong government support and a gradual shift toward electric vehicles from traditional fuel-fossil driven cars.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Oct 5, 2017)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) aims to resolve transportation problems caused due to natural disasters, complex logistics environments and global conflicts.

(TSLA  -  Free Report) has deferred the unveiling of its semi-truck, Tesla Semi, to Nov 16, per an Autoblog report. This is the second time that the automaker has rescheduled the unveiling of the truck. The company’s increased focus on mending production problems linked to Model 3 and raising battery production for hurricane-affected Puerto Rico, can be attributed to this delay.Notably, the Palo Alto, CA-based automaker has fallen short of its third-quarter 2017 production target of the new Model 3 sedan. During the quarter, the company delivered 220 Model 3s and produced 260, missing the production target of 1,500. This indicates that production has not been as smooth as anticipated.

With high levels of inventory, auto majors such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report) have plans of producing fewer vehicles in the second half of the year.Switching consumer preference toward SUV models and competition with Japanese and luxury brands offering more SUV models, have prompted U.S. automakers to re-strategize.

738,AAP,"As another earnings season unfolds, it is time to reshuffle your portfolio but this time only to avoid adding stocks that have lower earnings beat predictability. Dodging these stocks will definitely minimize the risks to your portfolio. In today’s discussion, we are focusing on the Retail-Wholesale sector – one of the 16 Zacks categorized sectors –  in a bid to identify those stocks that do not fulfill our expected earnings beat criteria of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings Season So FarPer Earnings Preview, as of Jul 21, out of the 97 S&P 500 companies that have come up with their quarterly numbers, approximately 78.4% have delivered positive earnings surprises, while 72.2% beat top-line expectations. According to the report, earnings of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far are up 8.4% from the same-period last year, while revenues have increased 5.1%.Total earnings for the index are expected to improve 8.6% from the same period last year on 4.7% higher revenues. The report also indicates that the Retail-Wholesale sector is expected to record top-line growth of 3.9% but is likely to witness earnings decline of 0.2% this season.However, before zeroing in on the stocks, let’s have a look at all that is happening in the sector and how it is placed in the changing economic scenario.Changing Retail DynamicsThe retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. This shift in buying pattern has forced retailers to come up with innovative ways to market their products. Retailers who have responded quickly to it by staying ahead technologically stand in good stead.With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers including big-box ones are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels. They are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities.Sector’s Correlation with the EconomyThe Retail-Wholesale sector has not been an outstanding performer but it still holds some promise, given the favorable economic indicators. However, we understand that the space is not fully immune to global uncertainties, which could limit growth.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in raising buyers’ confidence. Consumer confidence, which ebbed some time back, took an unexpected “U” turn in June.However, the second straight month of slump in retail sales overshadowed steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration. U.S. retail and food services sales in June declined 0.2%, following a revised reading of 0.1% decrease registered in May.How to Identify the Laggards?Surely, not all retail stocks are going to beat or meet expectations.

739,AAP,"Big automakers were busy last week in building an all-electric future. Many automakers are gearing up for electric vehicles (EVs). In order to respond to stringent emissions’ norms and the proposals made by many countries to ban internal combustion engines powered with fossil fuels, many automakers were seen gearing up for electric vehicles. But the new technology has yet to give any hint on how to generate profits — the key to the survival of any business entity.Amid this enthusiasm surrounding EVs, U.S. auto sales figures for the month of September were released. Interestingly, auto sales bounced back in September, following a prolonged year-over-year slide. Robust truck and SUV sales and replacement of cars destroyed by Hurricane Harvey in Texas played a major role this rebound.Per Autodata Corp., U.S. sales increased 6.1% year over year to 1.5 million vehicles. General Motors Co. (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corp. (TM  -  Free Report), Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) and Nissan’s performance improved during the month. However, Hyundai and Fiat Chrysler reported decline in U.S. sales.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per a Wall Street Journal report, Toyota is going to start a new venture with Mazda Motor Corp to develop electric vehicles. This move is in sync with the new strategy adopted by carmakers to increase focus on electrified vehicles.The venture, EV Common Architecture Spirit Co., is the latest alliance between Toyota and Mazda. While Toyota will hold 90% interest in the new venture, Mazda and Denso Corp., Toyota’s biggest supplier, will hold a 5% stake each. The new venture will develop technology for different types of electric vehicles, including passenger cars, mini-vehicles, SUVs and light trucks.Toyota will provide most of the financial requirements and EV knowhow. Mazda, on the other hand, will support with its advanced technologies such as compression ignition engine (read more: Toyota to Form Joint Venture With Mazda for EV Technology).Currently, Toyota sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.2.    In its bid to recover from the emissions cheating scandal, Volkswagen has planned to offer two new models every year, catering to the U.S. market in the foreseeable future, per an Associated Press report. In order to entice new customers, the German automaker also intends to double the length of warranties.Volkswagen is encountering emissions-related problems. The automaker agreed to pay over $20 billion in fines and civil settlements related to the scandal. However, per Autodata Corp, so far this year, Volkswagen brand’s sales in the United States increased 6.4%, while the U.S. market was down 2.7%.This rise in sales in the United States can be attributed to the launch of two new SUVs. Also, the automaker has plans of introducing a new Jetta compact car and a new midsize luxury car for the 2019 model year.Recently, the German auto major announced that it will also be investing more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 to create mass market. The company plans to offer 80 new electric cars across its different groups by 2025, up from its earlier goal of 30 (read more: Volkswagen to Introduce 2 New Models Every Year).Currently, Volkswagen has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).3.    Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) has fallen short of its third-quarter 2017 production goals of the new Model 3 sedan. During the quarter, the company delivered 220 Model 3s and produced 260, missing the production target of 1,500. This indicates that production has not been as smooth as anticipated.However, during the quarter ending Sep 30, Tesla delivered 26,150 vehicles, reflecting a rise of 4.5% year over year and 17.7% sequentially. The rise was due to record deliveries of Model S and Model X during the quarter.In July, the company started producing Model 3, which is half the starting price of Model S. In its second-quarter earnings results, the company had said that it aims at achieving a run rate of 5,000 and 10,000 units per week in 2017 and 2018, respectively.However, because of this initial target miss, customers have already started doubting if the company will manage to achieve its target in the future (read more: Tesla Fails to Meet Production Target of Model 3).Currently, Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).4.    General Motors is taking a big stride toward its goals of an all-electric future, per Reuters. The auto giant has plans of rolling out two new electric vehicles in the next 18 months. Also, it intends to add more than 20 electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in its lineup by 2023. With this, the number one U.S. automaker joins several European and Japanese peers, who have vowed to speed up development of EVs.Also, the automaker plans to increase the number of electric fast-charging stations in the United States in order to take on its EV competitor Tesla. The charging stations built by General Motors would be used by EVs manufactured by other companies. Notably, all the 951 fast-charging stations manufactured by Tesla can only be used by owners of Tesla vehicles (read more: General Motors to Give Thrust to Electric Vehicles).Currently, General Motors carries a Zacks Rank #3.5.    Per Reuters, Ford has set up a team to speed up the development of electric vehicles. Mission of the newly formed team i.e. Team Edison will be to think and take faster decisions related to the technology of electric vehicles.The new corporate team will work with the aim of recognizing and building electric-vehicle partnerships with companies that also include suppliers in few markets.Ford believes that demand for electric vehicles might rise, driven by mandates and quotas issued by governments.Many countries namely China, India, France and the United Kingdom have already proposed their plans to discontinue combustion engine vehicles between 2030 and 2040 (read more: Ford Sets up Team Edison to Develop Electric Vehicles).Currently, Ford carries a Zacks Rank #3.PerformanceIn the last week, steepest increase was registered by General Motors and sharpest decline was witnessed by Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -  Free Report).In fact, in the last six months, the steepest increase and the sharpest decline too were witnessed by General Motors and Advance Auto Parts, respectively.CompanyLast WeekLast 6 MonthsGM7.9%28.2%F2.8%9.1%TSLA4.5%18.9%TM1.1%14.7%HMC1.2%4.7%HOG-0.8%-19.8%AAP-4.6%-33.4%AZO1.4%-15.3%What’s Next in the Auto Space?Stay tuned for the usual news updates in the space.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

740,AAP,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in AAP.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 12 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $7.67 a share a month ago to its current level of $6.25.Also, for the current quarter, Advance Auto Parts has seen 10 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to $1.24 a share from $1.83 over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 13.7% in the past month.Advance Auto Parts Inc Price and Consensus  Advance Auto Parts Inc Price and Consensus | Advance Auto Parts Inc QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - CarMax Inc (KMX  -  Free Report).

741,AAP,"Last week saw usual readiness on the part of several automakers to move toward electric vehicles. Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) announced that it has collaborated with Mahindra Group, an Indian automotive manufacturing company, to work on areas such as mobility programs, electrifications, connected vehicle projects and product development, among other aspects.Even Autoliv, Inc.’s (ALV  -  Free Report) plans of splitting into two separate publicly traded companies — Passive Safety and Electronics — gives an indication that auto companies are seriously mulling over producing electric vehicles (EVs).Amid this, a couple of companies came up with their earnings results. Both AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) and Copart, Inc. (CPRT  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results.In this otherwise normal week, a few automakers were once again embroiled in recall issues. The cases of recalls in China, the largest car market in the world, can prove to be serious for these automakers. At a time when these automakers are investing huge money on electric vehicles, these recalls are further putting strains on their exchequers.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Sep 14, 2017)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Autoliv recently announced that it is mulling over splitting into two separate publicly traded companies. The decision to split is currently under strategic review. The plans of separating its two business segments — Passive Safety and Electronics — sent its share price soaring.However, there is no certainty that the review would fructify into a separation or listing of the businesses. If the separation at all happens, it would take around a year.While one entity would focus on passive safety, which includes equipment such as airbags and seatbelts, the other would concentrate on automotive radars and cameras with driver-assist systems, which are used in autonomous-driving technology (read more: Autoliv Stock Soars on Electronics Segment Split-Off Plan).Currently, Autoliv has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2.    AutoZone reported 6.1% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings per share to $15.18 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Aug 26, 2017). Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.11.

This strategic alliance aims at using the skill and global reach of the former with the latter’s presence in India.In an age of unparalleled changes in the global auto industry, strengths will be exploited mutually to drive profitable growth in India and other emerging markets.For a period of three years, teams from both companies will synergize on areas that include mobility programs, electrifications, connected vehicle projects, product development and many more aspects.Ford believes that this coalition will enable it to deliver the best batch of vehicles and services to customers as well as grow profitably in the world’s fifth largest vehicle market. Further, in conjunction with India’s ambition to convert into electric vehicles, this cooperation will help both parties to tap the growing potential of the utility market and the emerging usage of battery-powered electric vehicles (read more: Ford Partners Mahindra to Power Electric Vehicles in India).4.    The problem of recalls is far from over for global automakers. The last few days saw auto giants General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford and Volkswagen AG facing recalls again.Reportedly, General Motors will be recalling more than 2.5 million vehicles in China. The issue stemmed from concerns over faulty airbags manufactured by Takata. This is indeed a serious blow to the U.S. automaker, which will start withdrawing faulty vehicles from next month. Ford has reportedly come closer to recalling SUV models in the United States. Reports of leakage in exhaust fumes were responsible for this development.Last week, German automaker Volkswagen announced that along with Chinese joint-venture partners, it will recall 4.86 million vehicles in China. Once again, the reason was faulty air bags supplied by Takata.The instances of recalls in China, the largest car market in the world, can be damaging for these automakers. At a time when these automakers are investing open-handedly on electric vehicles, these recalls are doing no good to them (read more: Recalls Plague Automakers: General Motors, Ford in Focus).5.    Copart reported adjusted earnings per share of 35 cents in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31, 2017) and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents.

742,AAP,"In an otherwise somber week, Hurricane Harvey gave a severe jolt to many industries, including auto. In fact, Harvey, which devastated the Houston area, home to more than 500 auto dealerships, will have a grave impact on the auto space that is already grappling with challenges.Notably, Texas is the second-largest auto market in the United States, after California. The Houston metropolitan area is also the leading auto sales market in Texas and the entire Gulf Coast. Several dealerships had to be closed in the aftermath of the hurricane. The storm also damaged numerous trucks and cars parked in the dealership lots. This has prompted some analysts to cut their August vehicles sales estimates.On the other hand, global automakers continue to expand their network in China, thanks to the increasing urgency of manufacturing electric vehicles. The latest addition to this list is Honda Motor Company (HMC  -  Free Report), which has announced its plans of launching two fully electric-vehicles in 2018, of which one will be launched in China and the other in Europe.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Aug 24, 2017)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) has shared details of its investment in Brazil.

743,AAP,"The last seven days have been eventful for auto stocks. The Harvey impact continued, recalls were announced, earnings were released and August U.S. sales figures were revealed.The August data show that troubles are not over for the auto industry. Reportedly, U.S. sales of new cars and trucks fell 2% in August, marking the eighth consecutive month of decline.In August, General Motors Company’s (GM  -  Free Report) vehicle sales rose 7.5% year over year. The growth was driven by strong crossover sales. In the month, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) reported a 2.1% decline in U.S. sales. However, Toyota Motor Corporation’s (TM  -  Free Report) sales went up 6.8% year over year in August 2017, whereas Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) recorded a 2.4% year-over-year decline.Per Wall Street Journal, Hurricane Harvey destroyed around half a million vehicles in Texas. This has opened up opportunities for many automakers to replace damaged cars and pick-up trucks. Also, this is likely to provide huge impetus to the demand for auto parts.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Aug 31, 2017)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    The declining trend in the United States auto sales continued in August as well. This weak performance comes despite an extra selling day in the month.Among the major American and Japanese automakers, General Motors and Toyota recorded year-over-year sales improvement. Ford’s sales declined in the month.2. Ford announced the issuing of two safety recalls and two safety compliances in North America. The recalled vehicles will be Ford F-150 and Mustang vehicles, Ford Explorer, Taurus and Police Interceptor Utility and Sedan vehicles. The models to be recalled for safety compliances are Ford F-150 Crew Cab, F-250 and F-350 Super Duty Crew Cab vehicles and Focus vehicles.Roughly, 935 of 2017 Ford F-150 and Mustang vehicles with ARC passenger air bag inflators will be recalled due to defective deployment of the inflators. This may result in metal fragments striking the vehicle passengers and causing fatal injuries.The second safety recall will be 263 models of 2017 Ford Explorer, Taurus and Police Interceptor Utility and Sedan vehicles with inaccurate steering gear heat shield fasteners. These flawed devices may corrode and expose the gear system in high temperatures, leading to melting of gear electrical connectors. Also, drivers might face an unexpected loss of power steering assist without prior warning, resulting in accidents at high speeds (read more: Ford Announces a Couple of Safety Recalls & Compliances).Currently, Ford has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).3.    Honda announced that it has agreed to a $605 million legal settlement over faulty Takata air bag inflators, which caused numerous deaths and injuries, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The loss settlement covers up to 16.5 million Honda and Acura vehicles.Per the news, the Japanese automaker will have to pay $484 million after receiving $121 million credit, taking into consideration the company’s recall efforts, which included offering rental vehicles to customers who had to wait for repairs. Of the $484 million, Honda will spend around $200 million over four years looking out for the vehicle owners with unrepaired cars and encouraging them to replace the inflators. The remaining amount will be utilized for paying attorney fees and reimbursing owners who had to suffer due to lost wages and had to incur expenses due to hiring rental cars.Notably, several global automakers had reached similar kind of settlements early this year. The settlement amount was more than $650 million. Takata’s air bags are linked to several deaths and injuries across the globe. Early this year, Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Japan, and also agreed to pay $1 billion in penalties (read more: Honda Agrees on $605 Million Takata Air Bag Settlement).Currently, Honda sports a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy). You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.4.    Per Reuters, Harley-Davidson, Inc. is expected to experience a period of continued weak sales, driven by low demand of new Harley motorcycles.Recent researches show that millennials prefer buying less-expensive, used Harley-Davidson models or cheaper versions of other brands rather than going for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Also, the company’s ageing core customer group and low prices of Harley-Davidson’s used-motorcycles are other concerns it currently faces in the United States.Owning a well-known brand at a low-cost budget encourage young Americans to buy used-motorcycles of the brand, Harley-Davidson, while paying their home and student loans. Per analysis, people are still interested in the brand, as they buy used-motorcycles, which definitely do not benefit the company or its shareholders (read more: Will Harley-Davidson Continue to Face Sales Decline?).Currently, Harley-Davidson has a Zacks Rank #1.5.    Navistar International Corporation’s (NAV  -  Free Report) earnings came in at 37 cents per share in third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31, 2017), comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported a loss of 42 cents per share.

747,AAP,"Benchmarks ended mixed on Tuesday despite better than expected retail data and a de-escalation in tensions with North Korea. Weaker than expected earnings from Home Depot weighed on the Dow and pared gains for the blue-chip index. However, the Dow ended in the green following gains from American Express and Apple. The S&P 500 ended in the red overall losses in the market because of the slump in the retail sector. The Nasdaq also ended in the negative territory due to broad based losses for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,998.99, advancing 5.28 points or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 1.23 points to close at 2,464.61. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,333.01, increasing 7.22 points or 0.1%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,799 to 946. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1,671 to 1,016.Retail Sales Notch Up a Seven Month HighSales at U.S. retailers recorded their biggest increase in seven months in July. Retail sales advanced 0.6% last month, the best performance since a gain of 0.9% last December, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales jumped 4.2% in the past twelve months, which is near the five-year average. Excluding auto and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.5% in July. In fact, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales went up 0.6% last month. June’s retails sales were also revised to show a 0.3% gain, in contrast to the previously reported 0.2% decline. May’s retail sales were revised up to show no change instead of the earlier report of a 0.1% dip.The lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Amazon Fells the Traditional Retail SectorWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation KSS and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.The Dow closed higher for the third day on Tuesday. The blue-chip index notched 45 points earlier in the day. These gains were offset by weak earnings from the retail sector. The biggest drag on the Dow was falling shares of Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report). The home-improvement company cut about 30 points from the Dow. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker. (Read More: Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) Beats on Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates August 15, 2017)Telecom, Consumer Discretionary Stocks Drag S&P 500 LowerThe S&P 500 declined on Tuesday as the telecom and consumer-discretionary sectors disappointed.
