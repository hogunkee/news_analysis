37,NI,"First Amendment: At America's founding, it was thought that guaranteeing free speech was a fine idea. Today's Justice Department has a different view, and it's using the force of government to shut down open expression.On the last day of May, Nick Gillespie wrote a post on the Reason Foundation's Hit & Run blog about the sentencing of Ross Ulbricht, founder of Silk Road, ""a revolutionary website that made it easier and safer to buy and sell illegal drugs (along with just about everything else).""Prosectors wanted Ulbricht, who was found guilty of multiple felony charges, to serve ""substantially more than the mandatory minimum"" of 20 years. But the judge, Katherine Forrest, an Obama appointee, went beyond the recommendation and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole.This riled up a few Reason readers who expressed their scorn toward the judge. And they did so anonymously. So the Justice Department got riled up too and did what any reasonable inquisitor would: send Reason a subpoena, demanding that the organization help identify and find those who made the comments that the Justice Department wants to believe are mailed threats.Granted, the six comments that offended Justice went beyond civil discourse. One suggested that ""judges like these ... should be taken out back and shot,"" while another said ""it's judges like these that will be taken out back and shot.""Another liked the idea of shooting ""judges like these,"" but thought the better place would be ""out front, on the steps of the courthouse."" Yet another wanted to employ a wood chipper, since it wouldn't ""waste ammunition.""To call such thoughts intemperate would be an understatement. But to consider them real threats goes beyond sensible thinking.Is the Justice Department so cyberbackward that it can't grasp the nature of comments made on a blog? Web comments tend to be threads brimming with nothing more than big talk and fleeting fury.If the Justice Department insists on continuing its assault on free speech and hounding a legitimate journalism outlet, we suggest a look at how Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a Ronald Reagan nominee, has been treated on the Web.Three years ago, after some hotly debated rulings were handed down, one fellow asked President Obama via Twitter to ""please put Scalia on your kill list ."" Another figured ""we need a constitutional amendment to legally kill Scalia.""It was at that same time that the tolerant left went after Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a Bush appointee, calling him ""one ni**er that should (have) been a slave.""Then there's the infamous line from USA Today columnist and Pacifica Radio talk show host Julianne Malveaux, who in 1994 said she hoped Thomas' wife ""feeds him lots of eggs and butter and he dies early like many black men do, of heart disease"" because ""he is an absolutely reprehensible person.""Or that golden radio moment in 2011 when talk show host Mike Malloy wondered when ""SEAL unit six"" was going to ""drop in on George Bush."" A couple of years later, Malloy said he'd ""provide the butcher knife"" for Senate leader Mitch McConnell to stab fellow Republicans Ted Cruz and Mike Lee in the back.The authors of these thoughts were in all cases exercising their free speech, excessive and disagreeable though it might be.But in no instance do we recall the Justice Department forcing a private organization to help identify the anonymous sources so it could torment them.We cannot remember, nor do we find any evidence, that the Secret Service investigated Malloy for hoping the U.S. military would kill a former president.The First Amendment is not an old bauble kept around for nostalgic reasons. It's a timeless bulwark intended to protect even the vilest of speech. It should never be suspended for politics or infringed on to further an agenda.The Justice Department may not like the things the Silk Road commenters said, but it has a duty to maintain an environment of freedom in which they can say them.

58,NI,"In a bid to proceed with its transition to gas and renewables generation, TransAlta Corporation (TAC  -  Free Report) recently announced a few strategic initiatives.Details of the Transition StrategyUnder the initiative, the company has signed a letter of intent with Tidewater Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd. for building a 120 kilometer natural gas pipeline from Tidewater's Brazeau River Complex to TransAlta's generating units at Sundance and Keephills. The pipeline with an investment worth $150 million will have an initial capacity to supply gas of 130 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) by 2020. It may be expanded to supply up to 340 MMcf/d, which represents approximately 50% of TransAlta's gas requirements at full capacity. Per the terms, TransAlta may invest up to 50% in this pipeline. This natural gas pipeline project is anticipated to aid in the company’s initiative to offer low-cost clean energy.Additionally, TransAlta has expedited the conversion of its Sundance Units 3 to 6 and Keephills Units 1 and 2 from coal-fired generation to gas-fired generation and now expects to complete the procedure in the 2021–2022 timeframe, a year earlier than previously planned.As announced earlier, TransAlta intends to retire Sundance Unit 1 and temporarily mothball the operations of Sundance Unit 2, from Jan 1, 2018 and Units 3 and 5, from Apr 1, 2018. Unit 4 will be temporarily mothballed from Apr 1, 2019. The mothballed plants are anticipated to begin operations starting 2020, when the demand for electricity is expected to rise and market fundamentals are likely to support the excess generation of electricity.Notably, TransAlta believes that, once operational, at least two pipelines supplying natural gas will reduce operational risks. Management expects mothballing these units during 2018– 2019, will allow the remaining units to operate at strong utilization capacity, thereby providing competitive cost structures.  Notably, once these coal fired units are converted to gas, they are anticipated to remain operational through to 2031 to 2039.Our ViewA comprehensive study by the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”) shows that renewables will contribute more than 80% of total electricity generation in the United States by 2050, compared with the present level of 30%. To this end, governments and businesses globally are making concerted efforts to speed up the process of clean energy generation.With rapid expansion of the renewable energy market, this transition initiative adopted by TransAlta appears to be a profitable decision as providing clean energy at low costs will bolster its shares in the booming alternative energy market. Further, as laid down by the Government of Canada, the rules regarding the conversion is expected to extend the life of the company's gas conversion units by five to 10 years that will mainly depend on lower carbon dioxide emissions, subject to finalization.Being the largest producer of wind power in Canada, TransAlta already enjoys a solid position in the nation’s renewable market. With this conversion to gas generating units, surely it will gain more in this market.  Realizing the growth prospects of renewable energy, other Utilities like MDU Resources Group, Inc. (MDU  -  Free Report), NiSource Inc. (NI  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) are undertaking steps to expand further in the clean energy market.Price MovementShares of TransAlta underperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have lost 2.7%, wider than the industry’s decline of 0.3%.Such underperformance can be attributed to the company’s high operating expenses that have hurt performance in previous quarters.Zacks Rank               TransAlta (TAC  -  Free Report) currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (hold).

The company expressed intention to fund capital expenditures, general corporate expenses and repay short-term borrowings. (Read more: NiSource Issues $750M Notes to fund Capital Expansion)Debts Remain a WoeNiSource has been reeling under the burden of its debt levels for quite some time now. Notably, the company has been exposed to certain risks in relation to its current debt level standing. Its debt level position as of Sep 30, 2017 is pegged at $8.7 billion, higher than $6.1 billion at 2016 end. Notably, it has approximately $1.3 billion of available liquidity as of the same time.Additionally, the debt-to-capital level ratio of the company is currently pegged at 63.3%, much higher than the S&P 500 level of 42.7%. In addition, the current ratio of the company is 0.52, considerably lower than the S&P 500 level of 1.35.Our viewEven with significantly high debt levels, the company is currently trying to make the most of its investment strategy of strengthening existing infrastructure and focus on clean energy. Notably, it posted results in line with estimates in third-quarter 2017.It is, however, evident that company is trying to undertake steps that will reduce the significantly high-debt levels and also improve the current liquidity standing. We expect the company to perform better if it is able to reduce its debt burden. Notably, we expect the aforementioned issue of notes to aid the company to refinance a part of its debt. Further, it will help the company to extend its debt maturity period by another three years starting 2019, and keep the borrowed capital invested in the business for a longer time without having to repay it before 2022.Price MovementShares of NiSource outperformed the industry in the last six months. The company’s shares have gained 9.7% compared to the industry’s gain of 7.5%.Such outperformance can be attributed to the company’s 100% regulated business model that is benefiting from ongoing regulatory investments.

66,NI,"Investors interested in Utility - Electric Power stocks are likely familiar with NiSource (NI  -  Free Report) and IdaCorp (IDA  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, NiSource is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while IdaCorp has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that NI has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.NI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.83, while IDA has a forward P/E of 22.39. We also note that NI has a PEG ratio of 3.79. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. IDA currently has a PEG ratio of 5.79.Another notable valuation metric for NI is its P/B ratio of 2.01. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, IDA has a P/B of 2.09.Based on these metrics and many more, NI holds a Value grade of B, while IDA has a Value grade of D.NI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than IDA, so it seems like value investors will conclude that NI is the superior option right now.

69,NI,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Nov 2.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.05%. However, AES Corp. missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 0.44%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn October 9, AES Corp. announced that following the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, its operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands has been significantly affected. Notably, three of the company’s Puerto Rico power plants sustained notable damage. Its Puerto Rico’s 24 megawatt (MW) solar plant and one of the two units of its 524 MW coal-fired plant were severely harmed. Despite the damages, the other unit is still able to generate electricity while the damaged one is being restored.Consequently, the company expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be in the lower half of the $1.00 to $1.10 range in 2017. An adverse impact of 3-5 cents is expected on the 2017 adjusted EPS guidance, primarily stemming from the sustained damages to the aforementioned power plants and other business interruptions. This, in turn, is expected to have a significant effect on third quarter results as well.For the soon-to-be reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is projected to move down 8.3% while the same for revenues is estimated to remain flat on a year-over-year basis.The AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The AES Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that AES Corp is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter.

However, DTE Energy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.81%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the third-quarter earnings call, DTE Energy’s management announced that it expects to witness higher revenues from the company’s subsidiary DTE Gas in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher gas main renewal revenues at base rates. We expect the yet-to-be-reported quarter’s results to reflect this.However, the company’s service territories as a whole faced warmer-than-normal temperature in the fourth quarter, which in turn is expected to weigh down on revenues. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DTE Energy’s fourth-quarter revenues of $1.91 billion reflects a year-over-year decline of 33.7%.On a brighter note, banking on its stronger year-to-date results as of Sep 30, 2017, DTE Energy raised its 2017 bottom-line guidance. Notably, improved performance at the company’s Gas Storage and Pipelines, Power and Industrial segments backed the guidance raise.The consensus estimate for DTE Energy’s earnings of $1.20 per share for the fourth quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 48.2%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that DTE Energy will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: DTE Energy has an Earnings ESP of -0.28%.

Meanwhile, recently-inked business contracts are expected to strengthen downstream sales in the upcoming quarters.Per our estimates, MRC Global’s revenues will grow 16.9% year over year in 2018 while expand 7.8% in 2019.Profitability on Rise: The company is steadily improving profitability, courtesy of robust top-line performances, greater operational efficacy, diligent cost-saving moves and lower corporate tax rates.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved up 2.4% to 87 cents for 2018 and 4.2% to $1.25 for 2019. This reflects positive sentiments in the market. Per our estimates, the company’s earnings will grow 2800% year over year in 2018 and 44.4% in 2019.Beneficial Contracts: MRC Global believes that ongoing business contracts are likely to boost financials in the quarters ahead. For instance, the five-year long maintenance, repair and operations agreement signed with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) (March 2017) is predicted to drive the company's yearly sales by nearly $50 million for the next five years, starting 2018. Notably, contracts secured from PBF Energy Inc. (PBF  -  Free Report) (April 2017) and NiSource, Inc. (NI  -  Free Report) (July 2017) will benefit the company going forward.Shareholders’ Stance: MRC Global provides returns to shareholders in the form of dividend and share buyback offers. In first-quarter 2018, the company paid dividends worth $6 million to shareholders. Under the ongoing $100-million share-repurchase program (scheduled to close on Dec 31, 2018), the company repurchased $30-million common stock at an average price of $17.39 per share in the first quarter and bought another $20-million stock subsequent to the reported quarter.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

72,NI,"Black Hills Corp.‘s (BKH  -  Free Report) natural gas utility subsidiary announced that it has submitted a 35-mile natural gas pipeline construction proposal to the Wyoming Public Service Commission (WPSC) in the month of May 2018.The extended Natural Bridge Pipeline will supply additional volumes of natural gas to provide efficient services to customers in Wyoming. The new 12-inch steel pipeline will be connected with the 750-mile transmission pipeline system which serves the Riverton and Casper areas. Subject to WPSC’s approval, $54 million will be spent for the construction purpose. The pipelines are expected to commence operation from late 2019.Black Hills supplies natural gas and electric to nearly 1.2 million customers in eight states. These pipelines will increase the reliability of services for nearly 57,000 customers of Casper Division in central Wyoming. Along with the existing facilities, the pipeline will be able to cater to the rising demand.The company has regulated as well as non-regulated business and files with utility commissions to recoup the regulated investments made to strengthen existing operations. If the commission approves the construction of the pipelines, the company will make the investments and is likely to file another rate case to recover the expenditures.Incidentally, the company has already filed rate review requests for Arkansas, Colorado and Wyoming in late 2017. The company received approval to hike rates in Colorado and is waiting for the results of the two other cases.Tax Reforms BenefitsBlack Hills benefited from the tax reforms, effective Jan 1, 2018. Like other utility operators, the company wanted to pass the tax reform benefits to its customers through bill reduction. Black Hills received the required approval from the utility commissions to pass on the tax benefits in four states.Recently, Duke Energy Corp (DUK  -  Free Report) announced to pass on $142-million annual tax savings to the electric bills of its Indiana-based customers.Our ViewRegulated utility companies need to invest consistently to upgrade and modernize existing infrastructures. Providing better service to the customers is very essential for these companies. Investment improves reliability of existing infrastructure and helps meet the rising demand.Black Hills also invests to provide uninterrupted utility services. Spending for expansion and maintenance of existing assets are common in utility sector. The company plans to invest nearly $2.3 billion over the next five years. Recently, FirstEnergy Corp’s (FE  -  Free Report) subsidiaries completed the inspection of transmission lines and are likely to invest $1-$1.2 billion annually through 2021 for maintenance purpose. NiSource (NI  -  Free Report) intends to invest in the range of $1.6-$1.8 billion annually in its utility infrastructure programs through 2020.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceBlack Hills carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings of 78 cents per share reflects an improvement of 13% year over year.Moreover, the company's service territories witnessed colder-than-normal temperatures during the quarter.

78,NI,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly results as of Apr 27. Going by the positive trends, the first quarter is poised to record the strongest earnings and revenue growth in seven years. Earnings for the S&P 500 members that have already reported are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10.0% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating EPS estimates and 73.8% surpassing revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview report, overall earnings in the first quarter for all the S&P 500 members are expected to be up 22.6% on 8.4% growth in revenues.Amid the positive earnings outlook for the first quarter, let’s concentrate on the domestic-focused matured Zacks Utility sector. This sector, along with 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, is likely to come up with improved year-over-year earnings. Currently, only the Autos sector is likely to register an earnings decline.The Utility sector’s earnings are expected to increase 13.9% year over year on 1.4% growth in revenues, thanks to stable performance by most of the utilities. The need for heating, stemming from cold weather conditions, and increased demand for electricity aided the utilities. Additionally, tax reforms also helped the utilities in lowering their tax burden substantially.Utilities, apart from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amount of emissions, are also focused on improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity.  However, the rate-sensitive capital-intensive utility stocks are also accommodating the rate hikes. Notably, the Fed rate has now been raised for the sixth time (latest in March 2018) since the first hike in December 2015.Let’s take a look at the Utility stocks, scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 2and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 90% in the last reported quarter.

79,NI,"Electric utility firm Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is set to release its second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Wednesday, Aug 2.In the preceding three-month period, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider reported stronger-than-expected earnings due to robust performance by its wholesale unit.However, coming to earnings surprise history, Southern Company has a good record: its beaten estimates in 3 of the last four quarters.Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Southern Company (The) QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider This QuarterA leading utility holding entity in the U.S., Southern Company dominates the power business across the Southeast. With a strong rate base growth and constructive regulation, we expect the firm to generate steady earnings.Also, with operations in a stable and growing industry, Southern Company has a steady stream of cash flow. The utility’s history of consistent dividend payments indicates its confidence in itself.We further believe that the AGL Resources acquisition will be accretive to Southern Company earnings. However, with customer growth tepid and likely to remain so for some time, sales might be affected. This together with a large base, might make it difficult for Southern Company to manage rates. Higher operating and maintenance expenses is another concern.Moreover, the recent positive news regarding Toshiba’s financial guarantee to help complete the half-finished Vogtle project in Georgia, we remain skeptical regarding Southern Company’s $20 billion twin nuclear plants. The Vogtle project is being bankrolled with more than $8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees.Georgia Power believes that the project has already exceeded the budget by $3 billion and is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2020. This will substantially increase Southern Company’s leverage and deteriorate its credit metrics. Additionally, the increasing capital intensity of its operations may result in reduced returns going forward.Southern Company’s much delayed clean coal power plant project Kemper in Mississippi recently suffered yet another setback with a postponement in the projected in-service date. The extension of the schedule, together with certain technical glitches, would also hike the overall cost of the plant by $186 million.As it is, the economics of the Kemper project is a major cause of concern for the company as the plant is not competitive at the current natural gas prices. Overall, the project has been a major overhang on Southern Company's stock owing to its poor execution, cost overruns and multiple delays.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.43%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 71 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower, at 70 cents.Zacks Rank: However, Southern Company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Share Performance: Southern Company has lost 3.8% of its value during the second quarter versus the 0.03% growth of its industry.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some utilities you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:NiSource Inc.

Notably, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.61%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCMS Energy’s regulated electric power operations in Michigan generate relatively stable earnings and a growing earnings stream.In recent times, the company has been focusing on capacity maximization, reliability improvement and infrastructure upgrade. This in turn is expected to boost its bottom line as is evident from management’s raised guidance for 2017 earnings. Moreover, the absence of discretionary activities after the second half of 2016, such as debt pre-funding and relatively high volume of donations, may drive earnings in thesecond half of 2017.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 51 cents, reflecting a year-over-year surge of 75.9%.Weather conditions remain a key determinant. Michigan saw a wet winter in the fourth quarter. This is expected to result in lower household expenditures on heating, which might reflect in fourth-quarter revenues.CMS Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CMS Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CMS Energy Corporation Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for CMS Energy this quarter.

84,NI,"Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ED  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 4.92%. However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 1.37%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayConsolidated Edison has been investing to enhance its renewable generation assets of late. During second-quarter 2017, the company’s renewable energy production volumes improved a 46.1%, leading to an increase of $36 million in renewable revenues.The company in August announced that its installation plans of solar panels on company roofs and grounds have been approved. Under the initial phase of this strategy, Consolidated Edison expects to generate 3 megawatts of power through the installation that will serve 800 to 1,600 customers, primarily in Brooklyn, Queens and Westchester County.The upcoming third-quarter’s results are expected to benefit from this initiative. Also further updates on progress of the same are expected to come when the company reports its quarterly numbers.Moreover, the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the quarter. This will result in higher household expenditure on cooling and, in turn, will most likely boost revenues for this energy provider.However, the company faces interest rate risk owing to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Management estimates that as of Jun 30, 2017, the company witnessed a 10% increase in interest rates due to its variable rate debt. This will result in an increase in annual interest expense of $3 million. We expect the upcoming result to reflect a portion of this interest expense, which might put pressure on its earnings.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a rise of 0.7% year over year, whereas sales are anticipated to drop 7.8% to $3.14 billion.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not show that Consolidated Edison will beat earnings this quarter.

85,NI,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 14. The company’s Integrated Agency Networks (“IAN”) segment, which constitutes the major portion of total revenues, is anticipated to generate higher revenues in the quarter.Whether this will lead to higher earnings remains to be seen.Top-Line ImprovementInterpublic is poised to grow on the back of its strong digital capabilities, diversified business model and extensive geographic presence. The company is anticipated to achieve targeted levels in the quarter based on diversification across emerging regions along with collaboration and integration across agencies through technological improvement. Moreover, strategic investments and acquisitions to expand in key global markets are likely to translate into higher revenues.The Group’s best-in-industry talent and tools are expected to offer optimal and affordable solutions, thus rendering an edge over its peers. The company’s cost-cutting efforts, continuous margin improvement, stronger balance sheet and better capital structure are anticipated to aid bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, the quarter’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the IAN segment is pegged at $1,874 million compared with $1,866 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Constituency Management Group segment are anticipated to be $401 million compared with reported revenues of $399 million in the prior-year quarter. Revenues from the domestic markets are likely to maintain a flat trajectory at $1,255 million, while that from the international markets are expected to be $1,028 million compared with $1,006 million reported in the year-earlier quarter.Other Key FactorsHowever, the company forms part of the communications industry, which is highly competitive in nature. Agencies and media services compete with other agencies and creative or media services providers to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. These are likely to pose challenges to its prospects.Furthermore, constrained marketing budgets from big clients are anticipated to slow down organic growth and lead to account loss for Interpublic, which may hamper its financial position going forward. This apart, the company’s exposure to foreign currency translation impacts might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Interpublic this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

86,NI,"PG&E Corporation (PCG  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 9, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.15%. Moreover, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 14.71%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. PG&E Corp is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it has the right combination.Zacks ESP: PG&E Corp has an Earnings ESP of +0.48%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PG&E Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with a positive earnings ESP hints at possible earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayPG&E Corp has a solid portfolio of regulated utility assets that provide a stable earnings base and poise the company for long-term growth.During third-quarter earnings call, the company announced that it expects to gain 5 cents in rate base earnings during fourth-quarter 2017 and a total of 20 cents in the full year. However, general rate case revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of incremental tax repair benefits of roughly 25 cents annually. This is likely to impact PG&E Corp’s fourth-quarter earnings.Moreover, the massive California wildfire that occurred last October is expected to weigh on PG&E Corp’s upcoming results. In fact, in December 2017, the company announced suspension of its dividend, citing uncertainty regarding its liability in the deadly California wildfires (per a CNBC report).To this end, almost 100 lawsuits have been filed against PG&E Corp for allegedly sparking wildfires in Northern California throughout October. With the Insurance Commission claiming damage worth $9.4 billion, there remains a fair chance that PG&E Corp might have to bear a part of that cost, if the results from the pending lawsuits go against the company.As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG&E Corp’s fourth-quarter earnings of 69 cents reflects a 48.1% year-over-year plunge.Earlier, PG&E Corp announced that it expects to incur insurance costs and legal expenses of $100 million in 2017, owing to the California wildfires. We may expect further updates related to this expense once the company releases fourth-quarter results.PG&E Corp’s fourth-quarter business was favorably impacted by warmer-than-average temperature which prevailed in most parts of California. This led to increased electricity demand, which in turn is expected to boost the company’s fourth-quarter revenues.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG&E Corp’s revenues is pegged at $4.83 billion, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year increase. Pacific Gas & Electric Co.

Of late, the company has been strongly engaged in reducing its operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, which, in turn, will fund capital investments.In fact, the company has been able to cut down O&M costs by more than 3% for each of the last three years. It cut down costs by an impressive 6.5% last year, much better than the initial expectation. We anticipate similar cost reductions in the company’s upcoming second-quarter results.Furthermore, improvement has been witnessed in CMS Energy’s latest initiative, the Consumers Energy Way. The strategy focuses on bettering customer experience by offering prompt services at low costs. As of the end of the first quarter, it has saved more than $0.5 billion for the company. We expect to get further updates on this project’s improvements, once the second-quarter results release.Weather continues to play an important role in the company’s to-be-reported quarter.

This will result in lower household expenditure on heating, which might adversely impact revenues.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 42 cents, reflecting a decline of 7.22%, on revenues of $1.36 billion, which implies a 1.13 % decrease year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CMS Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

89,NI,"NiSource’s (NI  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, proposed to increase gas rates for natural gas customers in southeastern Massachusetts. If approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, without any changes, residential customers will have to pay an additional $4.95 in every month, up nearly 3.6% from the existing rate.The proposed rate hike of $24.1 million will be adjusted by $9.1 million in the first year, owing to the positive effect from the implementation of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Details of the HikeColumbia Gas of Massachusetts is planning to increase current operating revenues by 3.9%. The proposed $24.1-million increase will enable the company to recoup costs and comply with stringent federal and state regulatory regulations. Also, the unit will be able to redeem capital costs incurred for upgradation of gas infrastructure since 2016.Following an approval, the new rates will be effective from Mar 1, 2019.Necessity of Rate HikesNiSource, a fully-regulated utility company, is dependent on rate hike to continue with any kind of investment. To deliver safe and secure natural gas to customers, it is important to replace ageing pipelines, fix leakages and focus on operating services as well as maintenance of infrastructure, which require regular investments.A regulated utility is required to have hike rates on a regular basis to continue with long-term infrastructure spending. Upgraded infrastructure allows the utilities to provide better service and cater to rising demands.Along with NiSource, few companies from the Utility sector filed rate hike application in 2018.

90,NI,"On Apr 6, we issued an updated research report on MRC Global Inc. (MRC  -  Free Report). The company is a renowned distributor of pipes, valves and fittings (PVF).These products are used across the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry. Over the last month, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock inched up 0.4%, as against the 1.7% loss incurred by the industry. Notably, the company currently flaunts a VGM Score of A.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks (Strong Buy) here.Inside StoryMRC Global’s top-line results have remarkably improved over the past two quarters. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s U.S. sales were up 30% year over year, backed by increased midstream gathering and transmission, well completions, and downstream project deliveries. Canadian revenues improved 29% year over year, driven by solid upstream business and appreciation of the Canadian currency with respect to the U.S. dollar. International sales increased 3% year over year attributed to elevated upstream sector sales and favorable foreign currency-translation impact.Rise in crude oil prices will likely help bolster MRC Global’s revenues in the quarters ahead, on the back of stronger upstream and midstream business performance. The West Texas Intermediate crude prices traded above $60 throughout this March, reflecting a healthy pricing scenario. Moreover, the crude exporters’ decision to trim production till the end of 2018 will likely support the upsurge in the near term.MRC Global has also been strengthening its competency on the back of strategic organic deals. For instance, the five-year long maintenance, repair and operations agreement signed with Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) (March 2017) is likely to boost the company's yearly sales by nearly $50 million for consecutive five years, starting 2018. Notably, the PVF deal secured from PBF Energy Inc. (PBF  -  Free Report) (April 2017), as well as the contract wins from Deutsche Erdoel AG and renewal of the existing deal with NiSource, Inc (NI  -  Free Report) (July 2017) will likely fuel the company's top-line results in the quarters ahead.For 2018, MRC Global anticipates to report revenues of $3.85-$4.25 billion, estimating a gain of 11% over 2017 (at the mid-point). As per our projection, the company’s revenues are expected to be up 11.9% in 2018 and 8% in 2019.The company believes improved revenues, diligent cost-saving moves and reduced corporate tax rates will aid in boosting its profitability in the near term. Per our projection, MRC Global’s earnings are projected to rise 2,266.7% in 2018 and 54.3% in 2019.Despite the aforementioned growth drivers, we predict that the prevalent headwinds might dampen MRC Global’s near-term revenues and profitability.For instance, rising crude oil prices might impact the company’s downstream businesses. Moreover, a stronger U.S. dollar might hurt its profitability across the foreign end-markets. Also, the company faces stiff competition in the industry. Extensive business rivalry increases the bargaining power of customers and thus, exposes the company to risks of market share loss.Furthermore, MRC Global’s profitability is highly sensitive to market price, as well as availability of intermediate inputs. Any sudden supply-demand imbalance or fluctuations in the prices of these materials might escalate the company’s operational expenses, in turn, dragging down its bottom-line performance in the quarters ahead. For instance, MRC Global sells various steel products under its tubular product category. Sudden inflation in the price of iron ore (major steel-making component) might weigh over company’s results going forward.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

93,NI,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the utility’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.52%. Moreover, Public Service Enterprise outperformed the same in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.50%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the first-quarter earnings call, Public Service Enterprise said that in the second quarter its key subsidiary, Power, will be impacted by incremental depreciation expenses related to the early retirement of the Hudson and Mercer coal-fired generating stations on Jun 1.However, the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the to-be-reported quarter. This, in turn, will result in higher household expenditures on heating, which is expected to drive revenues.Additionally, the unemployment rate in Public Service Enterprise’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.Overall, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects year-over-year growth of 0.35%, while revenues are pegged at $2.33 billion depicting an increase of 22.49%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Public Service Enterprise will beat earnings this quarter.

The company recently secured two new contracts from Statoil ASA , one from Deutsche Erdoel AG, as well as extended its pact with NiSource, Inc (NI  -  Free Report).MRC Global is also well poised to strengthen its business on the back of diligent acquisitions and sound restructuring moves. We notice that over the last one year, shares of this stock yielded a return of 22.51%, outperforming 15.67% growth recorded by the Zacks categorized Steel - Pipe and Tube industry.Notably, the attractiveness of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock as a current investment choice is further accentuated by its favorable Value Growth Momentum Style Score ‘A’.

95,NI,"CMS Energy Corporation (CMS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 19.51%. However, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.60%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCMS Energy’s regulated electric power operations in Michigan generate relatively stable earnings. However, during the second quarter, the company’s service territory was affected by storms which in turn dented earnings. The third quarter was also adversely impacted by storm activities and thus the company’s bottom line is expected to remain under pressure. In line with this, the company’s third quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 62 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 12.1%.Weather conditions remain a key determinant for the company’s to-be-reported quarter. CMS Energy’s service territories have witnessed above-average temperatures during the third quarter. This will result in lower household expenditures on heating, which may adversely impact revenues.Nevertheless, the absence of discretionary activities which occurred in the second half of 2016, such as debt pre-funding and relatively high volume of donations, may benefit CMS Energy’s bottom line in the second half of 2017.Moreover, the company continues to reduce its operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, which, in turn, will facilitate capital investments. In fact, the company has been able to cut down O&M costs by more than 3% for each year of the last decade. It has cut down costs by 6.5% last year, much better than the initial expectation. We expect the company’s cost-reduction efforts to get reflected in the third quarter results as well.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively shows that CMS Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as we have mentioned below:Zacks ESP: CMS Energy has an Earnings ESP of -13.82%.

96,NI,"Premier waste management firm Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Feb 8. The company’s Collection segment — accounting for more than 73% of total revenues — is likely to report higher revenues due to improved demand for its products.  Whether this will lead to higher earnings for the quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line ImprovementRepublic Services has significantly expanded its product offerings in the e-commerce platform to address the evolving needs of customers. This low-cost sales channel is likely to aid the company in the quarter. In addition, it has improved the capabilities and functionality of the customer portal and mobile app. These value-driven interactive features are likely to lead to incremental orders and higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The strategic acquisition of ReCommunity Holdings II, Inc., the largest independent recycling-processing firm in the United States, is likely to offer unrivalled competitive advantage in the recycling business that continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of the waste stream. In addition, the acquisition will also facilitate Republic Services to gain control of multiple long-term municipal agreements of ReCommunity with processing fee-based structures. These agreements align perfectly with Republic Services' innovative recycling pricing model and are likely to generate incremental revenues.At the same time, Republic Services is focused on increasing operational efficiency by converting its fleet to compressed natural gas collection vehicles and modifying rear-loading trucks to automated-side loaders, which will reduce costs and improve profitability. The company is realigning its field support functions by combining two organizational layers. It expects these initiatives to contribute approximately $25 million of annual cost savings from 2018. As part of the realignment program, the company has centralized the management structure for recycling operations. The new organizational structure is likely to ensure a clear ownership for the recycling and processing market vertical. Republic Services is also transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model to cover processing costs and generate a healthy ROI (return on investments).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Collection segment revenues is currently pegged at $1,862 million, up from $1,796 million generated in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Landfill segment are expected to be $294 million compared with reported revenues of $280 million in the year-earlier quarter. Revenues from the Transfer and Disposal Services segment are anticipated to be $133 million, up from $116 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Total revenues are likely to be up to $2,499 million from $2,379 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Other Key FactorsHowever, margin pressure remains a bottleneck for the company. Margins are expected to remain constrained in the quarter as Republic Services has more exposure to Collection services and less to Disposal services. Typically, Disposal generates the highest margins and Collection the lowest. The company’s performance is also likely to be hurt by protracted weakness in special waste, industrial volumes and tight municipal budgets. In addition, increased competitive pressure remains a concern for the company.Our proven model conclusively shows that Republic Services is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.31%.

In the last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.22%.Let’s see how things are holding up for the fourth quarter.Factors to ConsiderOne of the objectives of this partnership is to earn attractive return on its rate base. In 2017, Brookfield Infrastructure expanded its rate base through the acquisition of regulated gas transmission business in Brazil, new connection in the U.K. regulated distribution business and addition of 11 projects in Chilean transmission system. We expect the benefits from these developments to get reflected in the company’s upcoming quarterly results.Moreover, improving economic conditions led to higher traffic volumes and tariff increases, which in turn are likely to drive the partnership’s performance in fourth-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Brookfield Infrastructure is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

99,NI,"PG&E Corporation (PCG  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 8.86%. Moreover, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 6.28%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPG&E Corp boasts a solid portfolio of regulated utility assets that offer a stable earnings base and substantial long-term growth potential.During second-quarter earnings call, the company announced that it expects to gain 5 cents in rate base earnings during each quarters of the second half of 2017. On the contrary, general rate case revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of incremental tax repair benefits of roughly 25 cents annually. This is likely to impact PG&E Corp’s third-quarter earnings.Notably, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 94 cents, reflecting a 0.2% year-over-year dip.Earlier, PG&E Corp reduced its 2017 capital expenditure projection range to reflect the shift in some of its gas transmission and distribution work into 2018. We can expect to see an annual decline in the company’s third-quarter capital expense once its quarterly results are released.Moreover, in July, the company’s shareholder derivative settlement was approved by the court. The company thus expects to record a net benefit of $65 million pre-tax in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The company’s third-quarter business was favorably impacted by warmer-than-average temperature which prevailed in most parts of California, after a historic heat wave in June. This led to increased electricity demand, which in turn is expected to improve the third-quarter revenues.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG&E Corp’s revenues is pegged at $4.96 billion, reflecting a 3.1% year-over-year increase.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show that PG&E Corpwill beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

100,NI,"FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bellon Oct 26. Last quarter, this utility company earnings broke even. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayFirstEnergy expects its third quarter earnings in the range of 75 -90 cents per share, while Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 85 cents, reflecting an increase of 11.8% year-over-year.The company’s modernization drive and its “Energizing the Future” plan will help in upgrading and expanding its transmission capabilities.FirstEnergy’s competitive business customers at the end of the second quarter were 850,000, much lower than 1.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The drop can be attributed due to the company’s transition from its Competitive Generation to a fully transition to a regulated company. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FirstEnergy’s revenue is pegged at $3,571 million much lower than $3,828 million in the year-ago period.While the ongoing transition has adversely affected FirstEnergy’s customer count, we expect the company’s constant upgradation and modernization efforts to provide some cushion and maintain load growth for the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that FirstEnergy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -0.82%.Zacks Rank: Though FirstEnergy’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of the ESP, its negative ESP makes a beat unlikely this season.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | FirstEnergy Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderInstead, here are a few players from the industry that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NiSource, Inc (NI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.69%.

101,NI,"NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26. Last quarter, this utility company reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe company commenced 2017 on a solid note by bringing online additional natural gas pipelines during the first few months. Moreover, shares of NextEra Energy have outperformed the industry’s rally in the last three months.NextEra Energy’s, Florida Power & Light Company (“FPL”) segment has been successful in attracting and adding new customers to its portfolio. Notably, FPL has also enjoyed the benefit of favorable economic conditions in its service territories, especially due to increased demand for utility services. Further, its focus on clean energy has drastically lowered emission levelsand led to significant savings for customers.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NextEra Energy’s revenues is pegged at $4,893 million, indicating 4.01% year over year and 12.4% sequential increase. We expect the increase in total revenues to be driven by higher contribution from its FPL segment.However, we expect Hurricane Irma to adversely impact the company’s earnings. NextEra Energy’s earnings are projected to be $1.75 per share reflecting a sequential drop by a penny.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that NextEra is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.74 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: NextEra is a Zacks Rank #3, increasing the possibility of a beat, but the 0.00% ESP makes it unlikely that this will see fruition this season.As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.NextEra Energy, Inc.

102,NI,"We expect Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) to pull off a positive earnings surprise, when it reports third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 2. The Utility has surpassed earnings estimates in the previous two quarters, resulting in an average beat of 5.20%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Exelon is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates and the company has the right mix.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of 87 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents, is +0.48 %. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: Exelon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination a favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Exelon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Exelon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Exelon Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderExelon expects its third-quarter earnings to be in the range between 80 cents and 90 cents per share, which takes into account a full quarter of contributions from the New York ZEC program that started on Apr 1.We believe that the Delmarva new electric and gas rate approval, along with Pepco DC rate case during the quarter will have a positive impact on Exelon’s total revenues in the second half of 2017.As free cash flow generation capacity is helping Exelon to lower its long-term debt, we expect its outstanding debts to drop further in the second half of 2017. The first-half debt level was $30.3 billion, declining nearly $1.2 billion from 2016 end levels.  Other Stocks to Consider Exelon is not the only stock in the Zacks Utility Power industry that is expected to report a positive earnings surprise.

Also, DTE Energy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.45%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the first quarter earnings call, DTE Energy said that it expects earnings to be lower in the third quarter and reiterated its projection during the second quarter earnings call. Currently, the company is of the view that third quarter will witness sequential earnings reduction by as much as $10 million to $20 million, including base rate increases. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at $1.59 per share reflects an annual decline of 18.9%.On the brighter note, the company’s investment strategy aims at improving reliability and customer experience while maintaining affordability. In fact, the 50 megawatt (MW) Pinnebog Wind Park in Huron County, which became operational in the first quarter, is likely to contribute to the revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Again, improved weather conditions in its Electric Utility and Gas Utility segments in the third quarter are likely to boost the company’s top line in the quarter.DTE Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise DTE Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise | DTE Energy Company QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that DTE Energy will beat estimates this quarter.

Moreover, Public Service Enterprise outperformed the same in the trailing four quarters with an average of 7.70%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the second-quarter earnings call, Public Service Enterprise announced that its key subsidiary, PSEG Power’s adjusted earnings is benefiting from the ongoing programs to reduce operating expenses. We expect the company to reflect similar results when it will release its third-quarter earnings..Additionally, the unemployment rate in Public Service Enterprise’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to the utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s quarterly performance.On the flip side,management earlier declared that the energy market has been adversely impacted by lower demand and excess capacity, which in turn has hurt the return of base load resources, as the average price on energy hedges decline. If the trend persists it might hamper Public Service Enterprise’s results.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects year-over-year decline of 5%, while revenues are pegged at $2.54 billion depicting an increase of 3.9%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Public Service Enterprise is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

108,NI,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 37.50%. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 14.78%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Sempra Energy may beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components.Zacks Rank: Sempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Sempra Energy has an Earnings ESP of +0.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.06, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The combination of Sempra Energy’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayAt the onset of the third quarter, Sempra Energy’s Mexican unit IEnova secured a liquid fuels project worth $155 million from the Mexican authority. Per the terms, IEnova will construct a receipt, storage and send-out liquid fuels marine terminal on the Mexican Gulf Coast. This deal will expand business operations for IEnova in Mexico by exploiting the booming energy market in the region.We believe impacts from this project to get reflected in the company’s third-quarter sales growth. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus estimate for Sempra Energy’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.78 billion, displaying a 9.5% annual upside.Moreover, Sempra Energy faces foreign exchange exposure in Mexcio and South America, wherein it does not hedge additional costs. These might weigh on the company’s quarterly earnings. Nevertheless, during second-quarter earnings call, management declared that it expects to gain $30 million of additional hedge income in the second half of the year, which in turn will largely offset its year-to-date foreign exchange losses in Mexico. Surely, this additional hedge income will have a partial favorable impact on the company’s to-be-reported quarterly result.Further, the Aliso Canyon gas leak event lead to an estimated loss of $832 million for the company by the end of the second quarter, higher than the prior-quarter figure. On a bright note, Sempra Energy received approval to reinstate natural gas injections at the Aliso Canyon storage field. However, management has expressed concern in relation to system reliability for resuming these gas injections this summer and in the coming winter given the limitations on targeted gas storage levels.A disciplined cost-management system has been driving Sempra Energy’s earnings. In line with this, for the third quarter, our consensus estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at $1.05, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.7%.Sempra Energy Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sempra Energy Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sempra Energy QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other players in the Utility sector that also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NiSource, Inc.

Per the state law, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission has sanctioned FirstEnergy to carry on with the rebuilding.Energizing the Future Plan and Regulatory ApprovalsFirstEnergy’s modernization drive has been boosting the company’s service reliability and leading to customer retention.

This, in turn, is expected to decrease earnings about 20 cents in the second half of the year, about two thirds of which will be in the third quarter.Apart from this, other non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses are expected to deteriorate third-quarter earnings by 10 cents. Overall, the performance in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to be poor compared with the year-ago quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be reported quarter’s earnings moved down 6.5%.On the brighter note, this New Orleans, LA-based company’s service territories witnessed above-average temperatures during the quarter. This should in fact lead to increased electric sales in these regions, which in turn, is expected to boost the top line.

The balance proceeds could be used to repay short-term borrowings.NiSource’s Capital Expenditure PlanNiSource previously announced plans to make planned utility infrastructure investments of about $1.6-$1.7 billion in 2017 and has identified long-term infrastructure investments worth $30 billion, with over 90% of it allocated to regulated pipes and wires.In addition to the above actions, the company is also taking commendable steps to reduce the greenhouse gas emission to keep up with peers like Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report), NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report) etc. All of these companies are striving to bring down their carbon footprint.According to the projected figures, its coal usage is expected to drop to 42% of its generation mix by 2023, from the current level of 78%. The company will do the same by retrofitting emission control equipment in its existing coal plants, retiring old plants and replacing the coal fired units by renewable sources.Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) continues to execute its seven-year, $845 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. NIPSCO is also working to execute its seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to its electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability.Rising Debt LevelNiSource’s long-term debt was $6,777.4 million for the period ended Jun 30, 2017, compared to $6,058.2 million for the period ended Dec 31, 2016.The rise in long-term debt level is a matter of concern as it can lead to rise in interest expense and can erode the company’s profit margin. This newly issued debt will increase interest expenditure by approximately $30 million.Interestingly, during the second quarter the company was able to successfully refinance about $1 billion of near-term maturity debt with lower-rate debt. This would help in saving a good amount on interest expense in the next few years. NiSource also expects that its strategic investments will allow the company to deliver its targeted earnings and dividend growth of 5-7% through 2020.Price MovementIn the last six months, shares of NiSource have gained 15.3% outperforming the Zacks categorized industry's gain of 5.1%.This outperformance could be attributed to NiSource’s consistent investment to strengthen existing infrastructure and focus on clean energy.Zacks RankNiSource carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

120,NI,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Aug 2, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 6.60%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Entergy is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is +0.83%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.21, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged slightly lower at $1.20. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Entergy currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayDuring the first-quarter earnings call, Entergy had said that it expects continued growth in industrial sales in 2017 driven by new and expansion projects. Consequently, it is expected that industrial sales will witness growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Again, the company's service territories witnessed above-average temperatures during the quarter. This should in fact lead to increased electric sales in these regions, which in turn, is expected to boost the top line.On the flip side, Entergy had earlier said that in the first half of 2017 sales at the existing petroleum refiners are projected to decline year over year due to anticipated customer outages. This, in turn, will negatively impact the company’s second-quarter results.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 61.3%, on revenues of $2.44 billion, implying a year-over-year decrease of 0.8%.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other operators in the electric utility space worth considering, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NiSource, Inc.

121,NI,"American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 financial results on Oct 26, before the market opens. Last quarter, this electric utility witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 8.54%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAmerican Electric is highly dependent on coal for production of electricity. Therefore, President Trump’s emphasis on improving the coal industry and relaxing the stringent environmental regulations in recent times are likely to boost the company’s prospects in the near term..Also, American Electric is expected to benefit from the improving economic conditions in its service territories and its efficient cost-management initiatives.Markedly, Ohio and Texas represents more than one-half of utility revenues of the company. However, the power generation from these states is deregulated, consequently leading to the current lower price environment. This, in turn, is expected to hurt earnings of American Electric Power.Moreover, hurricane Harvey that hit the coasts of Texas at the onset of last month, hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines leading to widespread outages in the state. As American Power’s subsidiary, AEP Texas, engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1 million retail customers therein, we expect the company’s third-quarter bottom line to be affected severely.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflected an annual decline of 3.6% on  revenues of $4.17 billion, reflecting a 10.4% decline year over year.American Electric Power Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American Electric Power Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American Electric Power Company, Inc.

That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Electric has an Earnings ESP of -2.39%, this is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.22 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Electric carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

128,NI,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial results before the market opens on Aug 3.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%. However, CenterPoint underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 2.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCenterPoint witnessed increased customer count and throughput during first-quarter 2017, primarily due to acquisitions of Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM) and the Energy Services business. Going ahead, similar solid performance from Energy Services is expected in second quarter and beyond, buoyed by increased operating income. Also, the AEM acquisition is likely to be modestly accretive this year, even after accounting for integration expenses. We expect to receive further updates on these once the company releases its second-quarter results.The company's service territories witnessed more or less warmer-than-normal temperatures during the second quarter. This will result in higher household expenditure on cooling, which might boost its revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.However, in the second quarter, a handful of tornados and thunderstorms hit Texas. With the state being the primary service region for CenterPoint, it exposed the company’s utility plants to damage and consequent expenditures. Any damage to these plants by these storms might weigh down on the company’s profitability in the second quarter.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings projects an improvement of 15.6%, while the consensus for revenues hints at an improvement of almost 13.75% on a year-over-year basis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CenterPoint is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CenterPoint has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 20 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CenterPoint carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

130,NI,"The Q2 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark. As of Jul 28, 286 S&P 500 members came up with quarterly earnings. Total earnings are up 11.3% from the same period last year on 6.1% higher revenues. 74.5% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 69.2% topped revenue estimates.Nearly 1000 companies – including 130 S&P 500 members – are expected to come up with results this week. Combining the results of the reported index members (286 members till Jul 28) with the remaining 214 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 9.2% on 5.0% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Initially, when the season started, we expected earnings to drop 2.9%. However, as the season gradually unfolds, we expect utility earnings to drop 1.8%.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Four out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

131,NI,"We expect Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 3. Last quarter, this independent utility company reported a positive earnings surprise of 40.00%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?    Our proven model shows that Pinnacle West Capital is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pinnacle West Capital carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Pinnacle West Capital’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderPinnacle West has experienced a modest expansion rate in retail customer growth and is targeting growth rate in the range of 1.5–2.5% in 2017. This is likely to have a positive impact the second quarter as well. This effect is likely to be witnessed in the quarter with improvement in Arizona’s economy and ongoing improvement in U.S. economic conditions.Growth in employment continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. This above-average job growth is likely to reflect positively in the results by increasing demand for utility services.The results of the company are also likely to improve since the first quarter backed by normalized weather conditions that are likely to lead to more customer conservation steps, energy efficiency programs and other distributed renewable generation initiatives throughout its service territory.Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise   Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle West Capital Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderPinnacle West Capital is not the only company in the industry looking up this earnings season.
