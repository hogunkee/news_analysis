0,AMGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced the submission of a biologics license application (“BLA”) to the FDA seeking approval for its monoclonal antibody candidate, fremanezumab, as a preventive treatment for migraine.The BLA submission was supported by positive data from two phase III studies under HALO program, which evaluated the candidate in patients with episodic migraine (""EM"") and chronic migraine (""CM"").Fremanezumab was subcutaneously administered once a month for two months (quarterly dose regimen), either in high (675mg) or low doses (225 mg, monthly dose regimen) in the study on CM patients. The data demonstrated statistically significant reduction in the number of monthly headache days when treated with fremanezumabcompared to a placebo. The study also met its secondary endpoints and showed significant improvement over placebo.Data from the study on EM patients showed that patients who were treated with monthly as well as quarterly dosing regimens of fremanezumab experienced clinically and statistically significant improvements in monthly average number of migraine days and 12 pre-specified analyses.Given the limited treatment options, fremanezumab represents significant commercial potential. According to Teva’s press release, more than a billion people suffer from migraine across the world including 38 million in the United States.We remind investors that the BLA from Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for approval of their CGRP receptor, erenumab, for the prevention of migraine was accepted by the FDA in July. Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) is also planning to file for FDA approval of its investigational migraine drug, galcanezumab, in the second half of the year.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1,AMGN,"Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 22.1% year to date compared with the industry’s 21.4% gain.In the last quarter, Novartis delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3%. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.51% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the second-quarter results, Novartis reiterated its guidance. Net sales are expected to be broadly in line with the 2016 levels after including the impact of continued genericization of Gleevec/Glivec in the United States and Europe.Novartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon and Sandoz (Generics). Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and the recently approved Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis, given the potential in the CAR T therapy space. Meanwhile, the FDA has recently approved a label expansion of Zykadia as the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.New products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals like AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen. Inc’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved the blockbuster status in 2016 and recorded over $1 billion of sales. While Entresto is expected to record $500 million revenues, sales of Cosentyx are projected to reach $2 billion in 2017.Additionally, Novartis’ generic arm, Sandoz, is making efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio. The company plans to launch five biosimilars of major oncology and immunology biologics across key geographies by 2020. The company is, however, facing significant pricing pressures and this is expected to impact the third-quarter results.Also, the loss of exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis’ portfolio is hurting the company’s top line.  The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, the EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016 and in the EU in December 2016, thereby leading to generic competition. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the United States and the EU. Furthermore, the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno-oncology therapies.The negative impact of generic competition is expected to impact sales by $2.5 billion in 2017.The company’s ophthalmologic division, Alcon, continues to face challenges due to lower surgical equipments sales. Stiff competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases continue to act as dampeners.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Novartis will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Novartis is -0.40%.  This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is 1.24 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company’s negative ESP makes its highly unlikely for earnings beat this quarter. As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG Quote Stock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.84% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 24. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2,AMGN,"ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report) announced that it is planning to move its leukemia candidate, IMGN632, into phase I study before the year-end. The company said that the FDA has completed the safety review of its investigational new drug (IND) application for IMGN632, filed in mid-September for treating patients with CD123-positive hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).Notably, IMGN632 uses the company’s indolino-benzodiazepine cancer-killing agents known as IGNs.ImmunoGen’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has soared 194.1% compared with the industry’s increase of 2% during the same time. The IND application for IMGN632 was supported by positive data from preclinical studies, which demonstrated IMGN63’s selective activity against AML cells, while sparing normal bone marrow cells.We remind investors that ImmunoGen had earlier entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC (JAZZ  -  Free Report) in August for the development and commercialization of IMGN632. The collaboration also included another program’s IMGN779 — a CD33-targeting ADC — already in phase I stage for the treatment of AML.Notably, ImmunoGen is focused on developing targeted cancer therapeutics using its proprietary ADC technology. In fact, this innovative technology of the company is also used in Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) marketed product, Kadcyla and in three other development-stage candidates in its pipeline.Additionally, the ADC technology is used in development programs by ImmunoGen’s partners Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Bayer AG, Biotest, CytomX, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Sanofi and Takeda.Per the company’s press release, approximately 21,380 patients are expected to be diagnosed with AML this year in the United States. Among them, around 10,590 patients are anticipated to succumb to the disease. Hence, IMGN632’s potential market opportunity is huge in the country, if successfully developed.ImmunoGen, Inc.

3,AMGN,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) suffered a setback following the FDA’s Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the company´s Biologics License Application (BLA) for MYL-1401H, a proposed biosimilar of Amgen’s Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta.The CRL relates to the pending update of the BLA with certain CMC data from facility requalification activities post recent plant modifications.However, the CRL did not raise any questions on biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity.Mylan is exploring the world of biosimilars, a market that has the potential to grow to $20 billion in 2020. A partnership with Biocon, and additional collaborations has helped Mylan develop a wide portfolio of biosimilar/insulin analog generic products, representing a total brand market value of more than $75 billion in worldwide sales.Earlier, the FDA notified Mylan and partner Biocon that the target action date for a biosimilar version of Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin (trastuzumab) has been extended to Dec 3, 2017. A decision from the FDA was expected by Sep 3 but the review period was extended due to some of the clarificatory information that were needed to be submitted to the agency as part of the process.Last week the FDA approved the generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) 40 mg/mL (thrice weekly).  The news boosted investors’ sentiment and the company’s shares surged on the same. Mylan’s stock has increased 1.1% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 17.4%.Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. The FDA also approved a generic for Copaxone 20 mg/mL once-daily. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. According to QuintilesIMS, sales of Copaxone 20mg/mL dose was approximately $700 million and $3.64 billion for the 40 mg/mL dose for the 12 months period ending July 31, 2017. Hence, the generic approval is expected to provide a significant boost to Mylan.Zacks RankMylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

4,AMGN,"Companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) were in the news with Amgen providing pipeline and regulatory updates while Regeneron and partner Sanofi got some good news with an appeals court ruling in their favor in the PCSK9 inhibitor lawsuit against Amgen.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPhase II Combination Data on Amgen’s Imlygic Published: Positive data on Amgen’s oncolytic viral therapy, Imlygic, when used in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Yervoy were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Results from the mid-stage study showed that the objective response rate (""ORR"") more than doubled when Imlygic was used in combination with Yervoy compared to Yervoy alone in patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV melanoma (39% versus 18%). Moreover, the complete response rate was almost double in the combination arm compared to Yervoy alone (13% versus 7%). Responses were observed in both injected and uninjected lesions, including visceral lesions.Advanced melanoma is highly aggressive and one of the most dangerous types of skin cancer with there being need for multiple treatment approaches over the course of the disease. The data is encouraging and could open up new avenues of revenues for Imlygic if it eventually gains approval for use in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. Sales of Imlygic, approved in October 2015, are yet to pick up.Meanwhile, Amgen said that the FDA has accepted its regulatory application seeking label expansion for the use of Prolia in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. A response from the agency should be out on May 28, 2018. Prolia, which brought in sales of $505 million in the second quarter of 2017, is an important growth driver for Amgen with the company working on improving diagnosis, treatment rates and duration in order to drive access to a greater number of patients (Read more: Amgen Label Expansion Application for Prolia Accepted by FDA).Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Shares of Amgen have gained 27.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 13.9% rally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breather for Amgen with Neulasta Biosimilar Approval Delay: Amgen got a bit of a breather with the FDA issuing a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) for Mylan and Biocon’s biosimilar version of Amgen’s blockbuster drug, Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). While the agency did not raise any queries regarding biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity of MYL-1401H, the CRL relates to the pending update of the regulatory application with certain CMC data from facility requalification activities post recent plant modifications.We note that Mylan and Biocon are not the only companies to get a CRL from the FDA for a biosimilar version of Neulasta. While Novartis’s Sandoz had received a CRL last year, Coherus was issued a CRL this year in June.  Regeneron/Sanofi Score a Win in PCSK9 Inhibitor Litigation: Regeneron and partner Sanofi got a major boost with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ordering a new trial related to Amgen’s claims regarding patents for PCSK9 inhibitors. The court also vacated the permanent injunction in the lawsuit which means Sanofi and Regeneron can continue selling their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, in the United States (Read more: Regeneron and Sanofi Get Favorable Ruling Against Amgen).AbbVie in Immuno-Oncology Deal: AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) has entered into a research, option and license agreement with clinical-stage immuno-oncology company Turnstone Biologics. The deal provides AbbVie with an exclusive option to license up to three of Turnstone's next-generation oncolytic viral immunotherapies.Turnstone’s Ad-MG1-MAGEA3 therapy is in a couple of phase I/II studies for different solid tumor indications alone as well as in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.Promising New Data on Biogen’s Spinraza: New phase III data presented by Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) on Spinraza showed that earlier initiation of treatment with the therapy may improve motor function outcomes in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). Biogen and Ionis’s Spinraza is the first approved medicine for the treatment of SMA. Spinraza is off to a promising start in the United States bringing in sales of $203 million in the second quarter of 2017.Clovis Seeks Label Expansion for PARP Inhibitor: Clovis Oncology (CLVS  -  Free Report) has filed for label expansion of its PARP inhibitor, Rubraca, in the United States. The company is looking to get the drug approved for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The company had presented impressive late-stage data earlier this year in June on Rubraca showing that the treatment significantly improved progression-free survival in all ovarian cancer patient populations evaluated in the ARIEL3 study.Rubraca had gained accelerated FDA approval in December 2016 for use in advanced ovarian cancer patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and who have deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations. A broader label would boost Rubraca’s sales potential (Read more: Clovis Submits sNDA for Ovarian Cancer Drug Rubraca).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up 0.6% over the last five trading sessions.

5,AMGN,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted its regulatory application in the United States seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). The FDA is expected to give its decision on May 28 next year.Prolia is presently marketed in the United States for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture as well as to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.The supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) was submitted in July this year. The sBLA was based on a phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Prolia compared with risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid medications.GIOP is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. This serious condition is presently treated with glucocorticoid treatment, which increases fracture risk within the first three months of beginning treatment. Prolia, if approved for the treatment of GIOP, can cater to an expanded patient population and drive sales higher.Prolia is a key revenue generator for Amgen and is witnessing market share gains in both the United States and international markets. In the first half of 2017, the drug generated sales of $930 million, up 17% year over year.Amgen’s shares have rallied 26.9% this year so far, better than the industry’s growth of 14.1% so far this year.Currently, Amgen holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksSome other top-ranked biotech stocks include Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report), PDL BioPharma, Inc.

6,AMGN,"Israel-based generic drug maker, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report), saw its shares decline 9.4% last week with the company suffering a fresh setback in the form of FDA approval of a generic version of the company’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone (multiple sclerosis). Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for its generic version of the 40 mg (thrice weekly) dosage as well as the once-daily 20 mg formulation of Copaxone. With Mylan being among the first applicants to challenge the 40 mg patent, the company could enjoy 180 days of exclusivity. Mylan has launched both products. Mylan also gained approval for the 40 mg dose in the EU.The FDA approval of generic Copaxone is a major blow for Teva which is currently facing a whole lot of challenges. Teva issued a statement saying that the launch of the 40 mg formulation before the final resolution of pending patent infringement lawsuits with Mylan will be treated as an “at-risk” launch – this means Mylan would have to pay significant damages if the court upholds the patents protecting the drug.Copaxone brought in total sales of $1.99 billion in the first half of 2017. At the end of the second quarter of 2017, Copaxone 40 mg accounted for more than 85% of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States.The entry of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation (Sandoz and Momenta have been on the market for quite a while with Glatopa, a generic version of the 20 mg dose) is expected to cut Teva’s 4Q earnings by at least 25 cents per share. Additional details should be out when the company announces third quarter results on November 2. The entry of generic Copaxone just adds to the existing list of problems being faced by Teva.Generic pricing erosion remains a huge issue for generic companies like Teva. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.Consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs leading to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year. All these headwinds will persist for the U.S. Generics unit into the near future, resulting in lower revenue and profit in this segment in 2018 and potentially 2019.Meanwhile, the company said that it does not expect any earnings contribution from its businesses in Venezuela given the significant devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. Teva also cut its dividend by 75%.Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track.The company has been working on addressing these issues and recently announced the appointment of a new CEO (Read more: Why Did Teva Pharmaceuticals Stock Soar Today?). Teva has also made significant progress in the divestment of non-core businesses. However, the entry of Copaxone 40 mg is a major setback for the company and it could well be a while before Teva is able to get back on track.Teva is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.9% downward over the last 7 days while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised 5.1% downward over the last 7 days. Teva has lost 56% of its value year to date versus the 20.5% decline of its industry.While Teva deals with these challenges, here is a look at five drug companies that sport a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report): Celgene is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. The company has several blockbuster products in its portfolio including Revlimid, Pomalyst, and Otezla. Celgene has a rich and promising pipeline as well with key data readouts lined up for the next two years.Celgene, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has gained 20.3% year to date, outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. The company also has a VGM Score of A. The VGM Score is a useful tool that allows investors to gain an insight into a stock’s strengths and weaknesses.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): Pfizer is focused on the development and commercialization of a wide range of medicines and vaccines as well consumer health care products. During the first half of the year, the company paid $8.9 billion in dividends and share buybacks to its shareholders including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program.Pfizer, which expects 2017 revenues to be affected by about $2.5 billion due to loss of exclusivities (LOEs), is working on bringing new products to market to make up for lost sales. The company has 15 potential blockbusters lined up for the next 5 years with about half of these potentially by 2020. Focus also remains on growing new products like Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Meanwhile, the impact of LOEs should continue declining in the coming years (about $2 billion in 2018 as well as 2019, $1 billion - $2 billion in 2020; $1 billion in 2021, and $0.5 billion or less from 2022 to 2025).Pfizer, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, carries a VGM Score of B.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report): Amgen, one of the most well-known names in the biotech industry, has a presence in the oncology/hematology, inflammation, nephrology, bone health and cardiovascular disease markets. Key products include Enbrel, Neulasta, Aranesp, Prolia, Xgeva, Epogen, Kyprolis, Repatha, and Blincyto among others. Most of these products are either blockbusters or have blockbuster potential. Amgen has a deep pipeline with the company working on bringing new products to market to combat the impact of potential biosimilar competition for mature products in its franchise. The company has been returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.Amgen is also a Zacks Rank #2 stock with a VGM Score of B. The stock has gained 27.1% year to date, outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): Vertex is a key player in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market. The company holds a strong position in this market with two marketed products – Orkambi and Kalydeco. Vertex is working on expanding its CF portfolio and is currently seeking both FDA and EMA approval for a tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out by Feb 28, 2018.Vertex, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 110.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report): Ligand’s business model is based on developing or acquiring royalty revenue generating assets and coupling them with a lean corporate cost structure. The company is focused on the development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets. Ligand’s Captisol formulation technology has allowed it to enter into several licensing deals and generate royalties. The company’s partners include big names like Amgen and Novartis among others. Ligand also has licensing deals based on its OmniAb technology.Ligand’s recent decision to acquire Crystal Bioscience, a leader in avian genetics and the generation of fully-human therapeutic antibodies, is expected to boost the company’s 2018 revenues by at least $5 million and earnings by at least 9 cents per share.Ligand, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 39.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

8,AMGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc, (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi, Inc. (SNY  -  Free Report) received a favorable ruling from the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit relating to Praluent. The court ordered a new trial and vacated the permanent injunction in the dispute concerning Amgen, Inc. ’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) asserted patent claims for antibodies targeting PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). As a result, Sanofi and Regeneron will continue to commercialize Praluent in the United States.We note that Praluent was the first PCSK9 antibody to be approved as adjunct to diet and maximally-tolerated statin therapy. It is used for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who require additional lowering of ""bad"" (LDL) cholesterol in the United States. Amgen’s Repatha was introduced much later in the market.We remind investors that Amgen asserted a number of U.S. patents, which were subsequently narrowed to patent Nos. 8,829,165 (the '165 Patent) and 8,859,741 (the '741 Patent), and sought a permanent injunction to prevent Regeneron and the Sanofi defendants from commercializing Praluent.It was found that the trial court erred on multiple grounds without any substantial evidence regarding written description and enablement. The jury also claimed that the law requires ""a written description of the invention’’ and concluded that Amgen's patents were non-obvious. The lack of evidence helped Regeneron and Sanofi to win a favorable ruling.The date for the new trial has not been decided by the court yet. Both Regeneron and Sanofi do not anticipate any new trial proceedings to start in 2017.The news should relieve Regeneron and Sanofi. Earlier, Amgen was granted a permanent injunction prohibiting Sanofi and Regeneron from selling Praluent during the term of two of Repatha patents. However, Regeneron and Sanofi appealed against the ruling in a higher court. Following the news, shares of Regeneron have moved up. In fact, shares of the company have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has surged 26.2% compared with the industry’s 16% rally during the period.Prospects of PCSK9 inhibitors, a new class of cholesterol-lowering treatments with blockbuster potential, gained instant popularity even before hitting the market, However, sales of Praluent have failed to impress as the drug is facing significant payer utilization management restrictions in the United States and limited market access in Europe, which are resulting in a low volume of prescriptions.Zacks Rank & Key PickRegeneron currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Aduro Biotech (ADRO  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

9,AMGN,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares have gained an impressive 16.7% in the past month, comparing favorably with a gain of 4.5% recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news for the company in the past few weeks.Last week, AbbVie announced the resolution of its ongoing patent dispute with Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), which has delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira to 2023. Per the settlement, AbbVie will grant a non-exclusive license to Amgen, which will allow the latter to sell Amjevita in the United States from Jan 31, 2023 and in most countries in the EU from Oct 16, 2018 and in other markets on different dates.Against the license, Amgen will pay AbbVie pre-specified royalties. This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares though the company is still facing a patent challenge from Boehringer Ingelheim, which gained approval for its biosimilar version of Humira, Cyltezo, in August. Moreover, the agreement gives AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.Secondly, AbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the past couple of months. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history.AbbVie announced positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL last month. The data showed that Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”).  Label expansion for this indication should expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential.AbbVie also announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) for evaluating a combination of its investigational antibody drug conjugate ABBV-399 and Bristol-Myers's immunotherapy Opdivo in c-met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Lastly, AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494) met primary endpoints in a phase III study for the treatment of RA with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results for both the doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib compared to placebo. Upadacitinib also met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for the treatment of adult patients with atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year. Data from both the upadacitinib studies were announced last month.In fact, so far this year, AbbVie’s share price has increased 43.5%, also comparing favorably with a gain of 17.7% for the industry.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

11,AMGN,"Companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Endocyte (ECYT  -  Free Report) were in the news with Amgen signing a deal with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) related to the entry of its biosimilar version of Humira and Endocyte signing an in-licensing deal which could prove to be transformational for the company.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEndocyte Soars on In-Licensing Deal: Endocyte’s shares have shot up a whopping 317% following the company’s announcement that it has got an exclusive worldwide license for PSMA-617 from ABX GmbH. Endocyte said that it will quickly move 177Lu-PSMA-617 into phase III development. 177Lu-PSMA-617 is a radioligand therapeutic (“RLT”) that targets the prostate-specific membrane antigen (“PSMA”) present in about 80% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).   The transformational deal provides Endocyte with the most advanced targeted radioligand therapy in development for prostate cancer, representing a market opportunity of more than $1 billion. The company hopes to start phase III development in the first half of 2018 and complete the program as early as 2020. The terms of the deal include a $12 million upfront payment as well as the issuance of 2 million shares to ABX plus a warrant for the purchase of up to 4 million additional shares of Endocyte common stock. ABX also stands to receive milestone payments of up to $160 million and tiered royalties starting in the mid-teens. Endocyte will bear all future development expenses (Read more: Endocyte Inks Deal For Prostate Cancer Candidate, Shares Up).AbbVie-Amgen Sign Deal Delaying Humira Biosimilar Entry: AbbVie has gained some breathing space by entering into a settlement agreement with Amgen related to biosimilar competition for AbbVie’s multi-billion dollar drug, Humira. Amgen, which gained FDA approval for Amjevita, its biosimilar version of Humira, has acknowledged the validity of AbbVie’s extensive intellectual property portfolio for Humira. According to the deal, the non-exclusive license for Humira will commence on Jan 31, 2023 in the United States and on different dates in other markets including Oct 16, 2018 in most countries in the EU. Amgen will also pay royalties.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares though the company is still facing a patent challenge from Boehringer Ingelheim, which gained approval for its biosimilar version of Humira, Cyltezo, in August.Humira generated sales of $8.8 billion in the first half of 2017 including $5.9 billion in the United States, which remains a key market for the drug. With Humira continuing to perform well, it will remain a major contributor to the top-line in the coming years. Moreover, the agreement gives AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market. Expectations are high that AbbVie and Boehringer Ingelheim will announce a similar settlement agreement and dismiss all patent litigation.  While AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ablynx Up on Positive Phase III Results: Ablynx’s shares shot up 23.3% on positive topline results from a late-stage study on caplacizumab, the company’s anti-von Willebrand factor (vWF) nanobody which is being developed for the treatment of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP). Ablynx is currently seeking approval for caplacizumab in the EU and expects to submit a regulatory application in the United States in the first half of 2018. Caplacizumab has Fast Track designation in the United States for the treatment of aTTP and timely approval would make it the first therapeutic specifically indicated for the treatment of aTTP, an acute, life-threatening autoimmune blood clotting disorder.CytomX in Immuno-Oncology Deal with Amgen: CytomX Therapeutics (CTMX  -  Free Report) has entered into an immune-oncology focused strategic collaboration with Amgen for the development of a CytomX Probody T-cell engaging bispecific against the epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”).While early development will be led by CytomX, Amgen will lead later development and commercialization. The companies will share global late-stage development costs. The deal will see CytomX getting an upfront payment of $40 million and issuing $20 million of common stock to Amgen. CytomX could also earn up to $455 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones for the EGFR program. Global commercial activities will be led by Amgen with CytomX having the option to opt into a profit share in the United States and receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net product sales outside the United States.The agreement also covers up to three additional, undisclosed targets. If Amgen decides to pursue all these targets, CytomX could get up to an additional $950 million in upfront and milestone payments and high single-digit to mid-double digit royalty payments. CytomX will also receive the rights to an undisclosed preclinical T-cell engaging bispecific program from Amgen for which it will make milestone and royalty payments on any resulting products under this arrangement. We expect investors to react favorably to this deal.Regeneron, Sanofi Eczema Drug Gets EU Nod: Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi gained EU approval for their eczema treatment, Dupixent. This makes Dupixent the first targeted biologic to be approved for use in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (“AD”) who are candidates for systemic therapy. Dupixent, approved in the United States earlier this year, has blockbuster potential and is being investigated for other indications as well including asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and nasal polyps.Shares of Regeneron have gained 24.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.4% rally.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained almost 3% over the last five trading sessions.

12,AMGN,"The biotech industry has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year. After declining 27.1% last year, the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has risen 15.3% this year so far, outpacing 12.7% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up almost 26% year to date after sliding 19.1% in 2016. The Zacks Industry Rank is #106 (to 40% of the 250 plus Zacks industries) for Medical-Biomed and Genetics, indicating a bright outlook for the sector going forward.The biotech sector has a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year. Another factor that has contributed to the sector’s surge is that President Trump's expected action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared.These factors should continue to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next as well despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. On the broader macro front, the proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last.With biotech stocks on a tear, here we have picked three of the biggest biotech companies which look well poised for growth and can be added to one’s portfolioAmgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report)Amgen is one of the leading biotechnology companies in the world with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio. Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well. Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline, including biosimilar drugs. Last month, it received FDA approval for Mvasi, its biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Avastin. Mvasi is the first biosimilar approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer. Other recent positive pipeline/regulatory developments at Amgen include EU approval for a pediatric formulation of Mimpara, positive long-term data from Kyprolis ENDEAVOR study, and regulatory filings for label expansion of Prolia and Kyprolis, among others.Supported by the positive developments, Amgen’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. Shares have risen 28%, comparing favorably with the industry’s gain. Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Earnings estimates for 2017 have risen 1.2% while that for 2018 have gone up by 1.3% in the past 90 days.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report)Celgene’s key growth driver, multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, continues to drive revenues at the company. Meanwhile, Celgene’s label expansion efforts for Revlimid bode well for further sales growth of the drug. Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla – are also performing well. A recent positive development at Celgene was the FDA approval for Idhifa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)Celgene also carries a Zacks Rank of 2. Earnings estimates for both 2017 and 2018 have risen by 0.7% in the past 90 days. The stock has gone up by 26.1% this year, outperforming the industry.Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report)Biogen has a strong position in the multiple sclerosis market backed by a wide range of products. Biogen is trying to diversify its pipelineand is looking to strengthen its Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders pipeline. Newly launched Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy is also off to a promising start. Spinraza has witnessed faster-than-expected adoption in the United States and Biogen is ramping up launch efforts  internationally.Recent key positive pipeline/regulatory developments at Biogen include promising long-term dataon Alzheimer disease candidate, aducanumab and EU approval of Imraldi, Biogen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s top-selling blockbuster drug, Humira. Biogen has made several new executive appointments to bring its management team back on track after several key executives departed over the past couple of years including CEO George A. Scangos and CFO Paul Clancy.Biogen, also a #2 Ranked stock, has seen its 2017 earnings estimates rise 4.7% for 2017 and 2.3% for 2017 over the past 90 days. Shares have risen 11.5% this year.Two other biotech companies, though smaller than the above mentioned companies, are worth mentioning.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has seen its share price shoot up 106.6% this year so far with earnings estimates rising 5% for 2017 and 6.8% for 2018. The stock is riding high on the success of its cystic fibrosis (CF) pipeline, particularly its triple combination CF regimens as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) saw the launch of its key pipeline candidates Dupixent for atopic dermatitis and Kevzara for rheumatoid arthritis in the United States this year. Both the drugs are also approved in the EU. Meanwhile, Regeneron’s key growth driver, Eylea, continues to drive revenues on market share gains and the company is expanding the drug's label for additional indications. While Regeneron’s shares have risen 25.9% this year, its earnings estimates have gone up by 16.6% for 2017 and 7.3% for 2018.Both Vertex and Regeneron have been sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for quite some time and may soon join the league of the big biotech stocks.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics.

13,AMGN,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) announced that the first patient has been enroled in the phase I study on pipeline candidate, RAD140.RAD140 is a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) which is being evaluated for the treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The phase I trial is a safety and dose-ranging study in approximately 40 patients suffering from progressive metastatic or locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Postmenopausal women with metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer will receive escalating doses of RAD140 by oral administration over a period of 28 days in part A of the study. The primary safety outcomes include rate of dose-limiting toxicities, adverse events related to treatment and tolerability as measured by dose interruptions or adjustments. In addition, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumor response will also be evaluated.The SARM mechanism of action is differentiated from both selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). Consequently, RAD140 has significant potential to complement future applications of elacestrant (RAD1901) by targeting distinct mechanisms of endocrine resistance.We note that an investigational new drug application submitted to the FDA for RAD140 has been accepted. Radius’ share price has increased 1.4% year to date compared with the industry’s 4.6% gain.In April the FDA approved Tymlos (abaloparatide-SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture — defined as history of osteoporotic fracture — multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other osteoporosis therapies. Although the osteoporosis market in the United States holds great promise as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women suffer osteoporotic fracture each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen Inc's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia. Moreover, the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). The company, however, suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues.Meanwhile, Radius clinical pipeline includes an investigational abaloparatide transdermal patch for potential use in osteoporosis and the investigational drug elacestrant (RAD1901) for potential use in hormone-driven and/or hormone-resistant breast cancer, and vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Aduro Biotech (ADRO  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Aduro Biotech’s loss per share estimates narrowed from $1.46 to $1.29 for 2017 and from $1.41 to $1.26 for 2018 over the last 60 days. The company delivered positive surprises in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.53%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

14,AMGN,"During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump had stressed on tax reforms and promised that bringing down corporate tax would be his top priority as the President of the United States. Keeping his words, Trump proposed changes in tax rates for both individuals and corporates to stimulate economic growth as well as employment growth.Tax ReformsThe plan proposes to lower the current corporate tax rate of 35%, one of the highest in the world, to 15%. This is expected to favorably impact the post-tax earnings of companies. A territorial tax system (tax on only domestic income) has also been proposed for American companies so as to create a level playing field. It also suggests the elimination of special tax breaks for companies. Another major reform proposed is the repatriation of trillions of dollars held as cash reserve overseas by the companies with global operations for one-time tax (reportedly 10%). A similar tax move was made for bringing in overseas cash reserves by the Bush administration in 2004 for one-time tax of 5.25%. A number of companies repatriated an amount exceeding $300 billion.The current tax code allows tax repatriation at 35% rate. However, it gives tax credit for the amount of tax paid in overseas country.Anticipated ImpactThe reforms have been proposed to create new jobs and aid economic growth through expanded investment as more cash will available to companies through tax cuts and repatriation. However, the extent to which these steps will be successful is uncertain. A large portion of the repatriated cash in 2004 was used to fund share buybacks and dividend payments. Though the buybacks fueled a stock rally, there was no actual economic growth.The tax reforms are expected to benefit companies which have operations around the globe. A similar buyback this time is also expected to help the stocks grow.  Large cap pharma companies based in the United Sates with major operations worldwide including J&J, Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Gilead Sciences and others are sitting on huge pile of cash reserves stashed in overseas countries. The repatriation will benefit these large drug/biotech companies more than the tax savings due to rate cutsMoreover, repatriation of cash held overseas will create a surplus in domestic cash reserve, which may fuel merger & acquisition (M&A) in the sector. The industry has seen only two major acquisitions this year, Actelion by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Kite Pharma, Inc.  by Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report), which is expected to close by 2017 end.Let’s discuss the impact of tax reform on the some drug/biotech giants.Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson is a well-known brand all over the world catering to a wide variety of medical needs. The company has paid tax at an effective rate of 16.5%, 19.7% and 20.6% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Therefore, a revision of tax rate to 15% will not bring a huge positive change in post-tax earnings. As of June end, J&J had $12.9 billion in cash reserve, down almost 70% from 2016 year end. The company has used a major chunk of its cash reserves in 2017. Hence, J&J is expected to be least impacted by these reforms.AmgenThe company has a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health and nephrology markets. The effective tax rate for Amgen in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 15.7%, 13% and 7.6%, respectively. Hence, a tax rate cut will have minimal effect. Amgen had nearly $35 billion in overseas cash as of 2016 fiscal end, per a Bloomberg report. The total cash reserve of the company has changed minimally in the first six months of 2017. So, the repatriation reform may initiate a buyback. Moreover, after 10% tax, it will have more than $30 billion in domestic cash reserve, if the total overseas cash is repatriated. This increase in domestic cash can also be used in acquiring new drug technologies like CAR-T therapy.Gilead SciencesGilead recently announced its plan to acquire Kite Pharma for nearly $12 billion, adding the latter’s CAR-T therapy candidate to its pipeline. Gilead is planning to complete the acquisition through a combination of cash and debt. Per a Bloomberg report, Gilead had $29.3 billion of cash reserves in overseas countries at the end of 2016. A repatriation will help the company to pay off the debt quickly. The effective tax rate has been between 16% and 21%, which suggests a minimal impact due to tax rate cut.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

15,AMGN,"On Sep 26, 2017, we issued an updated report on Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report).Ligand’s leading Captisol formulation technology platform has allowed it to enter into partnerships with several leading drug companies like Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), thus in turn providing it with funds in the form of milestone and royalty payments.Ligand receives royalties and milestone payments for several FDA-approved products that use its Captisol technology. Ligand’s major royalty revenues comes from sales of two key partnered assets — Novartis’ Kyprolis and Amgen’s Promacta. other latest product approvals include Spectrum’s Evomela, Lundbeck’s Carnexiv and Melinta Therapeutics’ Baxdela. Apart from these, several candidates are in late-stage development and expected to bring in royalties to the company once commercialized.Regarding the company’s internal pipeline, various candidates are under observation and development for indications like diabetes. One such extremely advanced candidate is LGD-6972, presently undergoing a phase II study for treating type II diabetes. This month, the company reported positive top-line results from the study. It further expects LGD-6972 to bring in future licensing opportunities.Nonetheless, Ligand’s entry into the Medical Devices Segment with acquisition of multiple programs owned by CorMatrix is also encouraging.However, Ligand obtains Captisol from a single supplier, Hovione — a major global supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug product intermediates, located in Portugal. Any interruption in Captisol’s supply would hit the company’s results.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

16,AMGN,"We issued an updated research on Sanofi, Inc. (SNY  -  Free Report) on Sep 26.Sanofi performed quite well in the first half of 2017. Earnings rose4.9% on a reported basis in the first half of 2017 and 2.7% at constant currency rates (CER) on a year-over-year basis.First halfnet sales rose 8.7% on a reported basis and 5.5% at CER.  In January 2017, Sanofi swapped its Merial Animal Health businesses with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business. Reflecting this exchange and full consolidation of Sanofi’s European vaccines operations, sales rose 2% at constant structure and CER. We remind investors that Sanofi terminated its Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) in Europe in December last year.A strong performance by Genzyme’s Specialty Care (Genzyme) and Vaccines units is making up for accelerated decline in the diabetes franchise to support the top line.In fact, at the second quarter conference call, Sanofi raised its previously issued profit outlook backed by a better-than-expected performance in the first half and cost discipline. However, a tough U.S. payer environment hurt sales in theDiabetesunit.Continued strong performance of the Genzyme unit, especially the multiple sclerosis drugs, Aubagio and Lemtrada, and rare disease drugs like Myozyme/Lumizymeand Fabrazyme is a positive. The Vaccines unit is also expected to perform well. Sales (including emerging markets) rose 14.3% at CER in the Genzyme unit and 24.5% at CER in the Vaccines unit in the first half of 2017.Meanwhile, Sanofi is quite optimistic about the sales prospects of its newly launched drug Dupixent for treating atopic dermatitis. The drug, which was launched in the United States in March 2017, generated sales of €26 million in the second quarter, backed by strong demand. Management was pleased with the drug’s uptake. We are optimistic on sales prospects of Dupixent, which could prove to be an important growth driver for the company. Other than Dupixent, other new drugs like Kevzara, launched in the U.S. in June 2017,and Soliqua, a once-daily titratable fixed-ratio combination of Lantus and Lyxumia, launched in the United States in January 2017,should also bring in higher sales in the back half of the year.However, management expects U.S. diabetes franchise sales to decline faster in the second half due to the impact of formulary exclusion at CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group and difficult comparisons from last year. U.S. diabetes sales declined 19.1% in the first half of 2017.Sanofi’s Diabetes franchise is under significant pressure with key product, Lantus, facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and biosimilar competition in several European markets and Japan.In the cardiovascular franchise, it also remains to be seen if sales trends of Sanofi’s anti PCSK9 therapy, Praluent improve in the second half. Uptake of PCSK9 inhibitors like Praluent and Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Repatha have been slower than expected due to significant payer utilization management restrictions in the United States and limited market access in Europe. Praluent’s uptake could remain limited until guidelines supporting broader use of the treatment are issued and phase III cardiovascular outcome study data are out.Also generic competition will continue to hurt sales of many key drugs in Sanofi’s portfolio including its blockbuster drug, Plavix.Despite these challenges, we believe that new drug approvals, a solid pipeline and aggressive savings will pave the way for growth at Sanofi.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

17,AMGN,"Biotech stocks like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT  -  Free Report) were in the news with Amgen providing an update on the impact of Hurricane Maria while Intercept continues to be impacted by Ocaliva safety concerns.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAmgen Maintains 2017 Outlook: Amgen, which provided an update on the impact of Hurricane Maria's impact on the company's manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico, maintained its outlook for 2017. The company said that no product or in-process inventory was lost and the company has enough stock to meet patient demand. At the time of releasing second quarter results, Amgen had guided toward earnings of $12.15-$12.65 per share on total revenues of $22.5-$23.0 billion.Ocaliva Safety Issues Continue to Hit Intercept: Intercept continues to be impacted by the safety issues surrounding its sole marketed product, Ocaliva. The company’s shares, which were initially hit by a “Dear Doctor” letter earlier this month, saw its shares fall almost 25% on a drug safety communication issued by the FDA last week. Both communications laid emphasis on the importance of the use of the recommended dosage on the label as liver injury, liver decompensation, liver failure, and death were reported when Ocaliva was dosed more frequently than recommended. Ocaliva is approved for use in primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”) patients. The company is working with the FDA to ensure the appropriate and safe use of Ocaliva. Ocaliva, approved in May 2016, brought in sales of $30.4 million in the second quarter of 2017.Intercept’s shares are down 43.6% year to date, compared to the industry’s 15.6% rally.Infinity-Bristol-Myers Clinical Trial Collaboration Expanded: Infinity Pharmaceuticals's (INFI  -  Free Report) existing clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb for IPI-549 (a PI3K-gamma inhibitor) plus Opdivo (a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor) has been expanded to include patients with triple negative breast cancer (“TNBC”) who have not been previously exposed to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy.

18,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda as a monotherapy for third-line treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.Keytruda is already approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.The drug’s label has now been expanded to include treatment of heavily pre-treated patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer whose tumors express PD-L1, as determined by an FDA approved test. However, the approval for this tenth new indication for Keytruda comes on an accelerated basis with continued approval dependent on further benefit demonstrated from clinical studies.The FDA approval was based on data from the KEYNOTE-059 study.Keytruda is key top line driver for Merck and it brought in sales of $881 million in second-quarter 2017, up 51% sequentially and 180% year over year.Sales continue to be driven by launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales in the U.S. gained particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. Outside U.S, Keytruda sales were primarily driven by the melanoma indication.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced this year with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the U.S. and two additional indications in Europe. Important approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer in both United States and the EU, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo),), a commonly used chemo regimen, in lung cancer. Further Keytruda data readouts are pending this year.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies.Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

19,AMGN,"The biotech industry witnessed a rebound in 2017 despite facing some odds in the previous year. The industry faced some challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs in 2016.However, we have seen the trend reversing in 2017 with more FDA approvals, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of some legacy products. These positive factors are expected to continue to contribute to the sector’s growth through the rest of this year and maybe the next.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index has gained 25.6% so far this year. This is in sharp contrast to last year’s performance when the index was down 22%.Some major recent events that contributed to the rally were the announcement by Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) to acquire immunotherapy focused company Kite Pharma , and the second was the FDA approval of the first gene therapy in the United States – Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah.Recently, the FDA also approved the first cancer biosimilar – Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin.Though the momentum in the biotech sector is likely to continue, it’s a good idea to avoid a few stocks in the industry which will not prove to be prudent additions to your portfolio.4 Sell-Rated Stocks to AvoidGetting rid of underperforming stocks at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns.

20,AMGN,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) has filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court alleging that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) is resorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra - Pfizer’s biosimilar version of J&J and Merck& Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade. Pfizer’s biosimilar version is available at a Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC), which is 19% lower than J&J’s referenced product.Pfizer’s shares were up 1.6% on Wednesday while J&J’s shares were down 1.5%. However, Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 10.8% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 16.7% for the industry.Pfizer alleged in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that J&J has entered into “biosimilar-exclusion” contracts with U.S. insurers. These contracts encourage insurers not to cover Inflectra, thereby making it non easily-accessible to patients and protecting its referenced product. Pfizer also claimed that anticompetitive contracts were being offered to hospitals, which encouraged discounts on purchase of Remicade on the condition that they do not buy the biosimilar versions. Pfizer claims these unfair practices benefit sales of J&J’s referenced product, which is a key revenue generator for the latter.We remind investors that at the second quarter conference call held in August, Pfizer had said that Inflectra penetration in the United States has been slower than expected as it was experiencing access challenges among national commercial payers.On the other hand, J&J had said at its second quarter conference call held in July that the rate of penetration of Inflectramay be modest. The latest lawsuit suggests that J&J could be responsible for the slow sales of Inflectra.Please note that in April this year, Samsung Bioepis’ biosimilar version of Remicade also received FDA approval.Pfizer had launched Inflectra in the United States in November last year and the biosimilar is also marketed in ex-U.S. markets. Inflectra generated sales of $23 million in the United States and $94 million globally in second quarter.Biosimilars are essentially cheaper versions of expensive biologic drugs but are complex to make unlike traditional generic drugs. While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while, there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the United States for a long time. However, this changed with the passing of The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) as part of the Affordable Care Act that President Obama signed into law in March 2010.Several pharma as well as biotech companies are involved in the development of biosimilars.The first biosimilar to gain approval in the United States was Sandoz’s Zarxio, a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neupogen. Zarxio was launched in the United States in September 2015. Inflectra was the second biosimilar to gain approval.Other approved biosimilars in the country. include Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar to Amgen’s Enbrel (etanercept) and Amgen’s Amjevita, a biosimilar version of Abbvie’s Humira. However, these have not been launched yet due to ongoing litigation.Earlier this month, FDA approved the first cancer biosimilar, Amgen and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin.Biosimilars were expected to reduce health care costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments. However, so far biosimilars have not seen much commercial success and are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States.The fight between these two drug giants is likely to aid efforts to lower drug prices through increased biosimilar availability.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

21,AMGN,"We issued an updated report on Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) on Sep 19.Novartis has a strong portfolio of oncology drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and an improved formulation of Exjade. In February 2016, the company received a boost with the FDA approving Afinitor for advanced, progressive, nonfunctional, neuroendocrine tumors of gastrointestinal or lung origin. The drug has also been approved in the EU for the same indication.The recent approval of Kisqali, for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer is likely to boost the oncology portfolio further. The drug was also approved in Europe. Meanwhile, the FDA also approved a label expansion of Zykadia to include the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.In a major boost, the FDA recently approved its breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse. Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy approved. The approval is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space. The approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL which comprises approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children under 15 years and is the most common childhood cancer in the United States. Meanwhile, Novartis plans to make additional filings for Kymriah in the United Staes and EU this year for Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In April, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Kymriah based on data from the JULIET study.On the other hand, we are pleased with the progress in biosimilars pipeline. The company plans to launch five major oncology and immunology biosimilars between 2017 and 2020. This includes a biosimilar version of Roche Holdings AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab), which was approved by the European Commission in June 2017 (marketed as Rixathon). Recently, the FDA accepted its Biologics License Application for a proposed biosimilar version of Rituxan.In August 2016, Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen, Inc’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Enbrel gained approval in the United States for five indications. Erelzi was also approved by the European Commission in 2017. In May, the European Medicines Agency also accepted the company’s Marketing Authorization Applications for biosimilar versions of Humira (adalimumab) and Remicade (infliximab) for review. Novartis’ stock has rallied 21.9% year to date compared with the industry’s 16.6% gain.Novartis is currently going through a transitional stage. The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016. The company also lost patent protection for the drug in EU in December 2016 leading to generic competition.The loss of patent protection for these top-selling drugs continue to hurt sales. Hence, Novartis expects the next growth phase to begin in 2018 driven by Cosentyx (in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis indications), Entresto, Kisqali and a deep pipeline with candidates like BAF312, AMG 334, RTH258.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another  top-ranked stock in health care sector worth considering is Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Alexion Pharmaceuticals’ earnings per share estimates have moved up from $5.32 to $5.60 for 2017 and from $6.56 to $7.05 for 2018 over the last 60 days. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.12%. The share price of the company has increased 17.4% year to date.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

22,AMGN,"A key development this week was the FDA approval of the first cancer biosimilar - Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin. Other updates include important data presentations from companies like Nabriva Therapeutics (NBRV  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFirst Cancer Biosimilar Gets FDA Nod: The FDA approved Amgen and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). Mvasi can be used for all eligible indications of the reference product. Approval was in line with expectations considering the favorable vote the biosimilar got from an FDA advisory panel recently. The approval is quite a boost for the companies as well as the effort to lower drug prices though so far biosimilars are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States. Mvasi is under review in the EU (Read more: Amgen/Allergan's Avastin Biosimilar Secures FDA Approval).Nabriva up on Positive Antibiotic Data: Nabriva got a major boost with the company posting positive top-line results on oral lefamulin in patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (“CABP”), the leading cause of infectious death in the United States. The LEAP 1 study, the first of two pivotal late-stage studies being conducted with lefamulin, met the FDA’s primary endpoint of non-inferiority compared to moxifloxacin with or without adjunctive linezolid for early clinical response. The European Medicines Agency’s (‘EMA”) criteria were also met. Nabriva is looking to position lefamulin as a first-line empiric monotherapy. The second pivotal study is currently enrolling with topline results expected next year in spring. Positive results would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the second half of 2018. Nabriva has gained 54.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.6% rally (Read more: Nabriva's Lefamulin Positive in Pivotal Study, Stock Surges).No FDA Advisory Panel Meeting for BioMarin Drug: BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN  -  Free Report), known for its strong presence in the market for serious and life-threatening rare disorders, said that the FDA is not looking to hold an advisory panel meeting for the company’s Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for pegvaliase. BioMarin is looking to get pegvaliase approved for the reduction of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. Pegvaliase is currently under priority review with a response from the FDA expected by Feb 28, 2018. However, this could well be pushed out by three months as the agency has asked BioMarin for additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) information (Read more: BioMarin Says FDA Not Planning an AdCom for Pegvaliase BLA).TESARO’s Zejula a Step Closer to EU Nod: Cancer-focused TESARO (TSRO  -  Free Report) got some good news with the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issuing a positive opinion for Zejula (niraparib) as a monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Given the positive opinion, chances of gaining EU approval look high. Approval would make Zejula the first oral, once-daily PARP 1/2 inhibitor in Europe for use in patients regardless of BRCA mutation or biomarker status. Zejula is already approved in the United States (Read more: TESARO Ovarian Cancer Drug Zejula Gets Positive CHMP Opinion).AbbVie/Roche Cancer Drug Positive in Late-Stage Study: AbbVie and partner Roche are looking to expand the label of their cancer therapy, Venclexta/Venclyxto and results from a late-stage study (MURANO) should help in these efforts. Venclexta plus Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) in the MURANO study.  An independent data monitoring committee has recommended the unblinding of the study based on the positive results.

23,AMGN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Amgen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.3. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Amgen’s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 38.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Amgen has a P/S ratio of about 5.9. This is a bit above than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, AMGN is roughly at the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Amgen currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Amgen a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Amgen might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D. This gives AMGN a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen ten up and one down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 1.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched upper by 1.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus  Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus | Amgen Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAmgen is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a solid industry rank (among Top 36% of more than 250 industries) instills investor confidence.On the flipside, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

24,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced new data on chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) drug Xolair at the 26th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress in Geneva, Switzerland from a phase IIIb study, OPTIMA.OPTIMA is a phase IIIb international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, non-comparator study. 314 patients with CSU symptoms despite treatment with H1-antagonists were initially randomized 4:3 to Xolair 150 or 300 mg for 24 weeks in the first dosing period. Thereafter, patients who responded well to the treatment were given a break and then, if symptoms returned were retreated.Per the data, 90% of CSU patients who responded well to initial treatment with Xolair regained symptom control within 12 weeks following a treatment interruption based on Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) criteria (UAS7=<6). Data from the study re-confirmed that almost two thirds of patients treated with Xolair 300 mg for 6 months are well-controlled.We note that Xolair is approved for the treatment of CSU in the EU and the United States (chronic idiopathic urticaria). Xolair is also approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma.Novartis has a collaboration agreement with Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop and co-promote Xolair in the United States.We note that Novartis is a global leader in Immunology & Dermatology with drugs like Cosentyx, Xolair, Zortress and Myfortic and Ilaris. Novartis’ stock has rallied 20.3% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 19.4% gain.Novartis is currently going through a transitional stage. The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016. The company also lost patent protection for the drug in EU in December 2016 leading to generic competition.The loss of patent protection for these top-selling drugs continue to hurt sales. Hence, Novartis expects the next growth phase to begin in 2018 driven by Cosentyx (in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis indications), Entresto, Kisqali and a deep pipeline with candidates like BAF312, AMG 334, RTH258.Moreover, with the recent approval of Kymriah, Novartis is the first company to bring CAR-T cell therapy for cancer treatment. Going forward, we expect that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones to bode well for Novartis.On the other hand, generic division, Sandoz is a leader in biosimilar market with five marketed biosimilars (Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States.).The company plans to launch five major oncology and immunology biosimilars between 2017 and 2020. This includes a biosimilar version of Rituxan (rituximab), which was approved by the European Commission in June 2017 (marketed as Rixathon). In August 2016, Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Enbrel gained approval in the United States for five indications. Erelzi was also approved by the European Commission in 2017.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Aduro Biotech, Inc. (ADRO  -  Free Report) is a better-ranked biomedical company with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Aduro’s loss estimates narrowed 9.6% to $1.32 for 2017 and 20% to $1.24 for 2018 over the last 60 days.

25,AMGN,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA approved their biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab), for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer. The biosimilar will be marketed by the trade name Mvasi.Mvasi is the first cancer biosimilar approved in the United States. It is also the first bevacizumab biosimilar in the country. Notably, Amgen has also submitted regulatory applications for the same in the EU.We remind investors that in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee had unanimously voted to recommend approval of Mvasi.Amgen’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has plunged 29.6% versus the broader industry’s 15.4% rally.The approval was supported by a comprehensive data package that demonstrated similarity of Mvasi with bevacizumab. Data also included results from a phase III comparative efficacy, safety and immunogenicity study, confirming no clinically meaningful difference between Mvasi and the reference product.Amgen and Allergan are also developing biosimilar versions of Roche’s Herceptin (ABP 980 — under review in the United States and the EU) and Rituxan (ABP 798 in phase III).Amgen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s Humira Amjevita, was approved by the FDA in September last year. However, Amjevita has not been launched yet due to an ongoing litigation. Others under development include Amgen’s biosimilar versions of Alexion’s Soliris, Lilly’s Erbitux and Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)/Merck’s Remicade. Interestingly, biosimilar endeavors offer a lucrative opportunity of annual revenues worth $3 billion above for Amgen. The company has also collaborated with Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo for commercialization of nine biosimilars in Japan.With accelerating approvals of biosimilars, a number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies are working on to bringing biosimilars in the market.  Though many biosimilars are marketed in the EU, very few are available in the United States. Last November, Pfizer had launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Remicade. Sandoz also markets Zarxio, the first biosimilar to be approved in the United States. The product is in turn a biosimilar of Amgen’s Neupogen. In July 2016, Merck had launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade in the United States.In August last year, Sandoz had gained an FDA approval for Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen’s Enbrel. However, the product is on hold due to ongoing litigation and is yet to be unveiled in the United States.Amgen Inc. PriceAmgen Inc. Price | Amgen Inc.

26,AMGN,"The biosimilar space remains in the spotlight as a number of regulatory decisions are pending. While generic drugs are follow-on versions of chemically synthesized molecules, biosimilars contain a version of the active substance of an already approved original biological drug.Development of biosimilars is technically challenging than the development of generic drugs as the former requires clinical studies in patients and are engineered to match the reference drug in quality, safety and efficacy. Due to the complex nature of the product, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics.A biosimilar is usually less expensive than the branded drug. Thus the market for the same remains highly lucrative. With the acceleration in approvals of biosimilars, the market has thus attracted a lot of players which is witnessing rapid growth. Here are a few latest developments from this space:Leading the biosimilar space is Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm Sandoz, which is a strong player in the biosimilar market with five marketed biosimilars (Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States.).The company plans to launch five major oncology and immunology biosimilars between 2017 and 2020. This includes a biosimilar version of Rituxan (rituximab), which was approved by the European Commission in June 2017 (marketed as Rixathon).Recently, the FDA accepted its Biologics License Application (BLA) for a proposed biosimilar version of Rituxan. In August 2016, Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Enbrel gained approval in the United States for five indications. Erelzi was also approved by the European Commission in 2017.In May 2017, the European Medicines Agency also accepted the company’s Marketing Authorization Applications for biosimilar versions of Humira (adalimumab) and Remicade (infliximab) for review. Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Generic leader Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) is also exploring the world of biosimilars, a market that has the potential to grow to $20 billion in 2020. The FDA recently notified Mylan and partner Biocon that the target action date for a biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) has been extended to Dec 3, 2017.A decision from the FDA was expected by Sep 3 but the FDA extended the review period due to review of some of the clarificatory information submitted to the agency as part of the application review process. We note that the Biocon partnership includes six biosimilar programs such as biosimilar versions of Herceptin, Neulasta, Humira, Avastin, Enbrel and Neupogen and three insulin analogs (Lantus, Humalog and NovoLog).Mylan has a collaboration agreement with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) to develop, manufacture and commercialize up to six of Momenta’s current biosimilar candidates, including Momenta’s biosimilar candidate, Orencia (abatacept). Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Meanwhile, Amgen and Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) have also submitted a BLA to the FDA for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin in Jul 2017. We note that both the companies are collaborating on four oncology biosimilars, including ABP 980 which is the second to be submitted for FDA approval.Both companies have also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for the candidate earlier in 2017. We note that Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its pipeline, one of which has been approved by the FDA. In March 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to Amgevita, a biosimilar version of Humira in all available indications. The companies have an important event lined up as the FDA is expected to give a decision on the approval of ABP 215, a biosimilar version of Avastin shortly. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Last month, biotech major Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission granted a marketing authorization for Imraldi, a biosimilar version of Humira. This is the third anti-TNF biosimilar from Biogen to receive a marketing authorization in the European Union following the approval of Benepali, a biosimilar of Enbrel and Flixabi (infliximab), a biosimilar version of Remicade. Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In July 2017, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade in the United States which was approved by the FDA in April. The FDA also granted tentative approval for Lusduna Nexvue, the biosimilar version of Lantus, basal insulin in a pre-filled dosing device.

27,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA accepted its generics’ arm Sandoz’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for a proposed biosimilar version of Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab).The application was accepted under the 351 (k) pathway.We note that Rituxan is approved for the treatment of blood cancers including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as immunological diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.We remind investors that Sandoz is a leader in biosimilar market with five marketed biosimilars. The company plans to launch five major oncology and immunology biosimilars between 2017 and 2020. This includes biosimilar rituximab, which was approved by the European Commission in June 2017 (marketed as Rixathon).In August 2016, Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel gained approval in the United States for five indications of the reference drug.  The European Medicines Agency has also accepted the company’s Marketing Authorization Applications for biosimilar versions of Humira (adalimumab) and Remicade (infliximab) for review.We believe that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs will boost the top line, going forward. Sandoz’s performance in the last quarter was disappointing as it grapples pricing pressure.Earlier, the company announced results from a phase III study of 870 patients with stage III BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive melanoma after complete surgical resection treated with the combination of Tafinlar (dabrafenib) + Mekinist (trametinib). The three-year relapse-free survival rate for patients treated with the combination was 58%, compared to 39% with placebo.Novartis is currently going through a transitional stage. The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016. The company also lost patent protection for the drug in EU in December 2016 leading to generic competition. The loss of patent protection for these top-selling drugs continue to hurt sales.Of late, the performance of the Alcon business has been quite disappointing due to lower surgical equipment sales due to competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases. Despite the restructuring initiatives of the company, the segment’s performance remains dismal. In particular, the surgical business is taking longer to turnaround.Novartis’ stock has rallied 17.5% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 15.8% gain.Last week, Novartis announced that its Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Jimenez will step down from his position in 2018. Vasant Narasimhan, M.D., Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, will replace him effective Feb 1, 2018.Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Aduro Biotech, Inc.

28,AMGN,"AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares increased almost 2% after the company announced that its oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), met primary endpoints in a phase III study for treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).In fact, AbbVie’s shares have rallied 38.9%, outperforming the industry’s 15.8% rise so far this year.The phase III SELECT-BEYOND study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study. It is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe RA, who are on a stable dose of conventional synthetic DMARDs and have had shown an inadequate response to the dosage.The study met its primary endpoints with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results for both the doses as compared to placebo. The trial’s primary endpoints were ACR20 responses and low disease activity (LDA).The results showed that 65% of patients, receiving 15 mg and 56% of patients, administered with 30 mg dose once daily of upadacitinib, achieved ACR20 responses after 12 weeks of treatment in comparison to 28% of patients receiving placebo.LDA was achieved by 43% and 42% of patients in the 15 mg and 30 mg dose arms, respectively, compared with 14% of patients receiving placebo. Additionally, the study met its secondary endpoints too.Notably, SELECT-BEYOND is the second out of the six ongoing phase III studies in the SELECT RA clinical trial program, conducted on upadacitinib.Other researches are also underway for upadacitinib for treating Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis.We remind investors that last week, the company announced upadacitinib to having met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for atopic dermatitis. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year for the given indication.We note that AbbVie already has a strong presence in the RA market with its blockbuster drug, Humira. However, several companies are working on developing biosimilar versions of Humira which could induce competition in the market for the company. Also, the RA market is extremely crowded including drugs like Johnson & Johnson’s Simponi and UCB’s Cimzia among others.Significantly, Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) JAK inhibitor, Olumiant, was recently approved in the EU and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz is marketed in the United States for treating RA, which might pose a strong competition for upadacitinib on approval.Also, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has already received approval to market a Humira biosimilar but the drug has not been launched yet due to ongoing litigation. If upadacitinib is approved, it may reduce the potential negative impact of Humira generics on AbbVie’s top line.AbbVie Inc. PriceAbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

29,AMGN,"Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that their pipeline candidate tezepelumab reduced annual asthma exacerbation rate (“AAER”), a measure of deterioration of asthma, in PATHWAY study in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. Tezepelumab, an anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin monoclonal antibody, is being studied in the phase IIb PATHWAY study.The results from the study were also published by the New England Journal of Medicine and will be presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress 2017 in Milan.Amgen’s shares are up 22% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 15.7% in that period.AstraZeneca’s shares have underperformed its industry so far this year. The company rose 11% while the industry gained 12.6% in the period.The PATHWAY study compared three doses of the candidate – 70 mg or 210 mg every four weeks or 280 mg every two weeks – to a placebo. Tezepelumab was administered as an add-on therapy in patients who have experienced asthma exacerbations and uncontrolled asthma despite treatment with asthma controllers like corticosteroids. Data from the study demonstrated that tezepelumab achieved significant reduction in AAER when compared to placebo. In fact, the candidate showed a reduction of 61%, 71% and 66% for 70 mg, 210 mg and 280 mg doses, respectively.Tezepelumab has also achieved significant and clinically meaningful reductions in the exacerbation rate irrespective of baseline blood eosinophil count. It also improved lung function at all doses and in asthma control at the two higher doses.Per the press release, around 315 million people are affected with asthma globally with up to 10% of them having severe asthma, which can become uncontrolled despite receiving high doses of standard of care medicines. These uncontrolled asthma patients then can, in addition, be treated with chronic oral corticosteroids. Tezepelumab can help these patients to control further deterioration of the disease.However, the asthma market is crowded with treatments like GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) Nucala and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) Cinqair available. Moreover, AstraZeneca itself is developing benralizumab for treating asthma.Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus  Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus | Amgen Inc.

30,AMGN,"AstraZeneca Plc (AZN  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from the phase III AMPLIFY study for Duaklir (aclidinium bromide/formoterol 400µg/12µg twice-daily). The candidate is being evaluated for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).The study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically-significant improvement in lung function in patients with moderate to very severe stable COPD compared to each individual component (either aclidinium bromide or formoterol).  AstraZeneca’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 11.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 10.2% in the same time frame.A full evaluation of the AMPLIFY data is ongoing and further results will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting. AstraZeneca expects to submit an new drug application (NDA)  for Duaklir to the FDA during the first half of 2018 based on the AMPLIFY data.In April, the company entered a strategic collaboration with Circassia Pharmaceuticals PLC for the development and commercialization of COPD drugs Tudorza and Duaklir in the United States.In a separate release, AstraZeneca along with partner Amgen Inc.

31,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda has received approval from the European Commission (EC) for the first and second line treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer.Keytruda has been approved as a first-line therapy for patients who cannot receive standard of care chemotherapy containing cisplatin. Keytruda was also approved as a second-line treatment for patients who have been previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapyThe approval was expected in July as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had granted a positive opinion, recommending approval of Keytruda.In the United States, Keytruda received accelerated approval for advanced bladder cancer indication in May this year.The approvals were based on data from the phase II KEYNOTE-052 trial and the phase III KEYNOTE-045 trial. Data from these studies have shown a clinically meaningful and improved overall survival benefit of Keytruda versus chemotherapy in this difficult-to-treat population.Keytruda is presently approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.Keytruda brought in sales of $881 million in second-quarter 2017, up 51% sequentially and 180% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales in the U.S. gained particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. Outside U.S, Keytruda sales were primarily driven by the melanoma indication.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the U.S. and an additional indication in Europe. Important approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo),), a commonly used chemo regimen, in lung cancer.

33,AMGN,"It was a relatively slow week for the biotech sector though key pipeline updates were provided by companies like Cellectis (CLLS  -  Free Report) and Insmed (INSM  -  Free Report). While Insmed skyrocketed on positive data on its lead pipeline candidate, Cellectis was hit by a clinical hold on a couple of phase I studies.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCellectis Hit by FDA Clinical Hold: Cellectis’ shares were hit by a clinical hold placed by the FDA on a couple of early-stage studies being conducted on UCART123. While one study is for acute myeloid leukemia (""AML""), the other is for blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). The hold came into place after the company reported a death in the BPDCN study.Cellectis, which is focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene-edited allogeneic CAR T-cells (UCART), said that it is working with the FDA and investigators for the resumption of the studies with an amended protocol including a lower dosage. Although shares were down 20.3% on the clinical hold, Cellectis has gained 51.4% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.9% rally.Insmed Shoots Up on ALIS Data: Insmed’s shares shot up 119.6% on positive top-line data from a late-stage study (CONVERT) for treatment-refractory nontuberculous mycobacterial (“NTM”) lung disease caused by mycobacterium avium complex (""MAC""). Results showed that the addition of ALIS (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension) to guideline-based therapy (""GBT"") eliminated evidence of NTM lung disease caused by MAC in sputum by the sixth month in 29% of patients, compared to 9% of patients on GBT alone.Based on this data, Insmed intends to seek accelerated approval and priority review of ALIS under subpart H. ALIS has breakthrough therapy designation and fast track status in the United States and is also a qualified infectious disease product (""QIDP"") under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (""GAIN"") Act, which will provide it with an additional five years of exclusivity.ALIS is the lead candidate in Insmed’s pipeline. According to the company, about 75,000 - 105,000 patients will be diagnosed with NTM lung disease in 2018, of which 40,000 - 50,000 will be treated for NTM lung disease caused by MAC.Akcea/Ionis Submit FCS Drug for FDA Approval: Akcea Therapeutics (AKCA  -  Free Report) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) announced the submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for volanesorsen for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (“FCS”), a severe, rare disorder characterized by extremely high levels of triglycerides. The company is looking to launch volanesorsen globally in 2018 provided it gains timely approval. While the efficacy data on volanesorsen is promising, concerns remain about the safety profile of the candidate given injection site reactions and the fall in platelet count.Volanesorsen is currently being evaluated in a late-stage study for familial partial lipodystrophy (""FPL"") with topline data expected in 2019.Ligand Diabetes Drug Fares Well in Mid-Stage Study: Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a mid-stage study on its investigational type II diabetes treatment, LGD-6972, an oral, small molecule, glucagon receptor antagonist (""GRA""). In addition to showing robust, statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions from baseline in hemoglobin A1c after 12 weeks of treatment, LGD-6972 was found to be safe and well tolerated. Although there are several diabetes treatments available in the market, there remains significant need for additional treatments considering diabetes is a growing global epidemic affecting millions across the world.

34,AMGN,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6.4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Amgen Second-Quarter Earnings and Sales TopAmgen reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $3.27 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 by 5.8% and increased 15% from the year-ago period. Better revenues and lower operating costs drove the bottom line. A lower tax rate and share count also pulled up profits.Total revenue rose 2% to $5.81 billion in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.67 billion by 2.5%. An unfavorable impact of foreign exchange hurt sales by 1% in the quarter.While U.S. revenues rose 2% and ex-U.S. sales grew 8%, excluding currency headwinds.Quarter in DetailTotal product revenue rose 2% from the year-ago quarter to $5.57 billion (U.S.: $4.39 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.19 billion) as strong demand for newer products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolis, Repatha and Blincyto somewhat made up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.Revenues of Amgen’s erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), Aranesp, rose 6% from the year-ago quarter to $535 million due to volume growth. However, volumes in the quarter benefited from the favorable timing of tenders in some outside U.S. markets compared to the year-ago quarter.Revenues of the other ESA, Epogen, declined 12% to $292 million due to lower selling price owing to a recently negotiated contract with DaVita Inc.Neulasta revenues declined 5% to $1.09 billion from the year-ago period due to lower unit demand following competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies. Neupogen recorded a 30% decline in sales to $137 million due to biosimilar competition in the U.S. Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of Neupogen, was launched in the U.S. in Sep 2015 and is hurting sales.The company expects Neulasta and Neupogen sales to be hurt by competitive dynamic through the rest of 2017. However, management did specify on the call, that “no new U.S. biosimilar competition” is expected this year. This suggests that Neulasta and Epogen may not start facing any biosimilar competition in the U.S. this year, contrary to previous expectations.Two companies looking to launch generic versions of Neulasta and one company looking to launch generic version of Epogen have received complete response letter from the FDA for their respective applications, which can delay their launch.However, the Neulasta Onpro kit (on-body injector) continues to perform well commanding a market share of about 55% in the U.S. for all Neulasta sales.Enbrel delivered revenues of $1.47 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter due to increased competition, which offset favorable changes in inventory and price.However, in the quarter, the company said that an improvement in the underlying segment performance was witnessed in the second quarter compared to the first. Market volume growth improved in the rheumatology/dermatology segments in the second quarter compared with the first quarter with Enbrel experiencing relatively stable unit share in these markets.Prolia revenues came in at $505 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter due to higher demand. The osteoporosis drug witnessed market share gains in both the U.S. and international markets.Meanwhile, Xgeva delivered revenues of $395 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter mainly due to higher demand. The company expects the multiple myeloma indication to be added to Xgeva’s label in 2018, which will expand the eligible patient population and should boost sales.Sensipar/Mimpara revenues increased 10% to $427 million due to higher price increases.Vectibix revenues came in at $168 million, up 5%, driven by higher demand.Kyprolis recorded sales of $211 million, up 23% year over year driven by higher demand and robust uptake from outside U.S. launches.In the quarter, Amgen submitted regulatory applications in the U.S. and EU to include overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis. The study demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone reduced the risk of death by 21% and improved overall survival by about eight months when compared to Velcade plus dexamethasoneThis overall survival data, if approved, can help drive usage and boost sales of Kyprolis.Amgen also announced final data from the phase III ASPIRE study of Kyprolis in Jul 2017, which showed that a triple combination regimen of Kyprolis plus Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (KRd ) reduced the risk of death by 21% and improved survival by about eight months in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma compared to Revlimid and dexamethasone (Rd).Blincyto sales surged 43% from the year-ago period to $43 million, reflecting higher demand. In Jul 2017, the FDA approved the inclusion of overall survival data from the TOWER study on the label of Blincyto to convert the accelerated approval to a full approval. The addition of the data should help boost sales.Repatha generated revenues of $83 million, higher than $49 million in the first quarter driven by higher demand.Repatha holds 58% share of the PCSK9 segment in the U.S. and Europe with share trends improving sequentially in both the markets in the second quarter. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the new-to-brand share for Repatha was 70% in the second quarter. Management said that the presentation of the outcomes study data had a positive impact on Repatha share trends.Other revenues grew 10% to $236 million driven by higher Ibrance royalty revenues, offset partially by lower Nexavar royalty revenues.Operating Margins IncreaseAdjusted operating margins rose 380 basis points (bps) to 55.2% due to lower operating costs, reflecting continued benefits from transformation and process improvement efforts.R&D expenses declined 3% in the quarter due to lower late-stage pipeline related costs. SG&A spend declined 7% due to the Oct 2016 expiration of Enbrel residual royalty payments, which offset investments to support new product launches.Amgen bought back shares worth $1 billion in the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, Amgen had $2.5 billion remaining under its $5 billion stock repurchase plan.2017 GuidanceWhile Amgen slightly cut the lower end of the previously issued sales outlook, it raised the earnings guidance to account for strong first-half profits.The company expects total revenue in the range of $22.5 billion to $23.0 billion compared with $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion expected previously. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of $12.15 to $12.65 in 2017 compared with $12.00 to $12.60 per share, expected previously.Operating expenses are expected to be higher in the second half.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been three moves higher in the last two months.Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus  Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus | Amgen Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Amgen's stock has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a D. The stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookWhile estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.

35,AMGN,"Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third quarter results surpassed both top-and bottom-line expectations. Meanwhile, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR T therapy gained earlier-than-expected FDA approval. Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) also got a regulatory boost with the FDA expanding the label of the company’s flagship product, Soliris.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBiogen Beats on All Fronts: Although Biogen’s third quarter results were better than expected with the company surpassing both earnings and revenue expectations, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza. Spinraza U.S. sales were $198 million in the third quarter, more or less flat from second quarter sales of $195 million though the company reported a 75% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the United States compared to the end of the second quarter. However, second quarter sales included inventory buildup of $30 million (Read more: Biogen Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).Biogen has gained 11.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 8.2% rally.Gilead CAR T Therapy Yescarta Approved: Gilead’s Yescarta, which became a part of the company’s portfolio following the $11.9 billion Kite Pharma acquisition, gained FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This makes Yescarta the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy to gain approval for use in this patient population.Yescarta is the second gene therapy to gain approval in the United States, the first being Novartis’s Kymriah. Both treatments come with a Boxed Warning regarding the risks of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) and neurologic toxicities.Yescarta’s approval is a major boost for Gilead which is currently facing declining sales from its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise. According to information provided by the company, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) - about 7,500 patients with refractory DLBCL are eligible for CAR T therapy every year. Yescarta represents a new treatment option for these patients who have run out of treatment options and face a poor prognosis. Yescarta will be launched with a list price of $373,000 in the United States and is currently under review in the EU where a response is expected in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Gilead CAR-T Therapy Yescarta Clinches FDA Approval).Gilead also announced phase II results on its investigational treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (""NASH""). The company said that the higher dose (20 mg) of GS-0976, an oral ACC inhibitor, achieved significant reductions in buildup of fat in the liver and a noninvasive marker of fibrosis (TIMP-1) compared to placebo. However, statistical significance was not achieved for other parameters like liver stiffness (by FibroScan and MRE), serum ALT and PIII-NP, a serum marker of fibrogenesis. Meanwhile, differences between the lower dose (5 mg) of GS-0976 and placebo were not statistically significant.Celgene Hit by Crohn’s Disease Study Discontinuation: Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares were down 10.8% on news that the company will be discontinuing studies (phase III REVOLVE study and the extension study (SUSTAIN)) being conducted with its investigational Crohn’s disease drug, GED-0301 (mongersen). The decision was based on a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee in October following an interim futility analysis. No meaningful safety imbalances were observed in the analysis.Celgene also said that it will wait to review the full dataset from the phase II ulcerative colitis study on GED-0301 before deciding the path forward. The company will not be initiating the phase III DEFINE study for Crohn’s disease (Read more: Celgene Down on Discontinued Crohn's Disease Drug Study).AbbVie Announces Immuno-Therapy Focused Deals: AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced a couple of deals this week. While one deal is focused on immuno-neurology, the other is focused on immuno-oncology.The immuno-neurology deal will see AbbVie collaborating with Alector for the use of the latter’s immuno-neurology discovery platform for innovative new therapies for Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.Immuno-neurology, a rapidly evolving scientific area, is focused on harnessing the power of the immune system to attack neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease.While development and commercialization costs as well as profits will be shared equally by the companies, Alector will get an upfront payment of $205 million and a potential, future equity investment of up to $20 million.Meanwhile, the immuno-oncology deal will see AbbVie teaming up with Harpoon Therapeutics for the use of Harpoon's tri-specific T-cell activating construct (TriTAC) platform with AbbVie's research-stage immuno-oncology targets to develop cancer therapeutics (Read more: AbbVie Inks Immuno-Oncology Deal with Harpoon Therapeutics).Label Expansion for Alexion’s Soliris: The FDA granted approval to Alexion for the use of its flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) in adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are AchR antibody-positive. Soliris, already approved in the United States for serious ultra-rare disorders like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), brought in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

36,AMGN,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the third quarter of 2017. The company’s revenue was driven by continued a strong performance of its newest drug Spinraza, for spinal muscular atrophy.Despite better-than-expected results, Biogen’s shares were down almost 3% in pre-market trading. This was probably due to the fact that the sales of its multiple sclerosis franchise were below expectations amid an increasingly competitive market. However, we note that Biogen’s shares have gained 15.8% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 9%.Third-quarter 2017 earnings per share were $6.31, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.70 by 10.7%. Earnings also rallied 22% year over year.Sales came in at $3.08 billion, up 4% from the year-ago period. Sales also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion by 1.6%. The top line, excluding hemophilia revenues, grew 13% year over year. The company spun off its hemophilia business in February this year.Quarter in Detail                           Biogen’s MS revenues were $2.3 billion in the quarter including approximately $65 million in royalties on the sales of Roche’s MS drug Ocrevus.Tecfidera sales increased 3% from the year-ago period to $1.07 billion. However, the drug recorded a 4% sequential drop in revenues. This included the U.S. sales of $836.3 million and ex-U.S. sales of $233.3 million. In the United States, Tecfidera Inventory levels in the third quarter were relatively flat compared with the year-ago levels, which hurt sales in the reported quarter.Third-quarter Tysabri revenues were $469 million (U.S. $266.8 million, ex-U.S. $202.6 million), which decreased 9% year over year and 5% sequentially. We believe Ocrevus’ launch has put pressure on Tysabri’s U.S. sales in the quarter.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the third quarter were $662 million (U.S. $473.3 million, ex-U.S. $188.7 million), down 7% from the year-ago period. Avonex revenues declined 7% from the year-ago period to $538 million. Plegridy contributed $124 million to third-quarter 2017 revenues, down 3% year over year and 7% sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) in August last year, contributed $14 million to revenues in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially.Newly launched Spinraza brought revenues of $271 million (U.S. revenues $197.6 million) in the third quarter, registering growth of 33.5% sequentially as the drug witnesses a strong demand in the United States. The company is working on expanding access to all patients.This quarter, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $101 million compared with $91 million in second-quarter 2017. The company markets Benepali, a biosimilar referencing Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in Europe. Benepali recorded revenues of $99.2 million, registering a growth rate of 11.8% sequentially. Biogen also markets Flixabi, a biosimilar referencing Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Remicade, which recorded revenues of $2.2 million in the reported quarter compared with $1.9 million in the second quarter.Revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 28% from the year-ago period to $406 million in the third quarter.R&D spend decreased 15.6% in the reported quarter to $446.4 million, while SG&A spend declined 6.2% year over year to $433.8 million. Collaboration AgreementThis month, Biogen announced restructuring of collaboration arrangements with Eisai and Neurimmune to improve long-term value of Alzheimer candidate aducanumab, which is presently in a phase III study.Concurrent with the earnings release, Biogen announced a renegotiation of its agreement with Neurimmune by making a one-time payment of $150 million in exchange of a reduction in Neurimmune’s 15% royalty rate on the potential sales of aducanumab. The re-negotiated deal thus increases aducanumab’s profit potential.On Oct 23, Biogen and partner Eisai refined their existing Alzheimer collaboration. Biogen already has an agreement with Eisai to develop the phase III BACE inhibitor, E2609 and the phase II amyloid-beta antibody, BAN240 for Alzheimer’s disease.

37,AMGN,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) posted a loss of $1.58 per share in the second quarter of 2017, wider than the loss of $1.01 per share in the year-ago quarter and wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of $1.35. The year-over-year increase in net loss was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses.Radius’ share price increased 13.3% year to date against the industry’s gain of 1%.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $1.0 million from the first four weeks of launch, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.96 million.Quarter in DetailResearch and development expenses for the reported quarter were $19.6 million, down 27% year over year due to a decrease in regulatory and professional fees associated with abaloparatide-SC regulatory applications, decrase in elacestrant (RAD1901) project costs and a decrease in development costs associated with abaloparatide-TD.General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter jumped to $50.1 million from $17.2 million. The increase was attributed to growth in professional support costs, including the costs associated with increasing headcount for the commercialization of Tymlos. Higher compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount were also responsible for increased costs.Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Radius Health, Inc. QuotePipeline UpdatesOn Apr 28, the FDA approved Radius Health’s lead candidate Tymlos injection for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture – defined as history of osteoporotic fracture – multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.The company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide- abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-transdermal.Meanwhile, Radius Health’ Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Europe is under review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency. The company however suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. Consequently, Radius is working with the CHMP to address these issues and the company expects a response prior to the end of 2017.In May, Radius Health announced positive top-line results from the completed 24-month ACTIVExtend clinical trial on Tymlos, which met all of its primary and secondary endpoints. The company expects to submit a sNDA to the FDA in connection with the ACTIVExtend results by year end.The company reported positive data from its ongoing phase I dose-escalation and expansion study on elacestrant in advanced metastatic breast cancer. The company discussed these data from the ongoing phase I studies with the FDA to determine the next steps for elacestrant breast cancer program, including the design of a phase II trial.Following this discussion, the FDA agreed that a single-arm monotherapy phase II study of under 200 patients is appropriate. The agency also provided additional feedback on the proposed clinical protocol, including confirmation that the primary endpoint will be objective response rate, along with durability of response. The FDA also stated that if the study results demonstrate superiority to the then-available therapies, the single-arm phase II trial could be considered a pivotal study for accelerated approval as long as the company has also commenced a confirmatory study by the time of its new drug application (NDA) submission.In addition, elacestrant is also being evaluated at low doses as an estrogen receptor ligand for the potential relief of the frequency and severity of moderate to severe hot flashes in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. The company expects to report results from its phase IIb clinical study of elacestrant for the potential treatment of postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms in the second half of 2017.Our TakeThe company’s wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter was disappointing as expenses continue to increase with the launch of Tymlos. The company is moving ahead with its plans in contracting with managed care organizations with access to over 133 million covered lives across Commercial and Medicare Part D plans.Although the osteoporosis market in the U.S. has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women in the U.S. experience an osteoporotic fracture each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen Inc's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia. Moreover, the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). The company, however, suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Gilead Sciences.

38,AMGN,"Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $4.02 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.95 by 1.8%. Earnings rose 20% year over year driven by higher revenues and operating profitsRevenues came in at $4.01 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago period, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.95 billion by 1%.While key products like Botox and new products like Vraylar, Namzaric and Viberzi did well in the quarter, sales were once again hurt by sales erosion from Namenda XR and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin. Also, lower sales of key dry eye disease drug, Restasis hurt the top line.Second-quarter revenues, however, gained from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (Jan 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (Apr 2017) acquisitions.Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $1.9 billion in the quarter.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 17.1% to $1.22 billion in the quarter, primarily due to higher promotional spend to support new product launches. R&D expenses increased 14.2% to $393.9 million to support an advancing pipeline.Segment DiscussionThe company reports revenues under three segments – U.S. General Medicine, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics and International.U.S. Specialized Therapeutics’ net revenues increased 15.2% to $1.72 billion driven by strong growth in Botox and the addition of LifeCell’s Alloderm and ZELTIQ’s CoolSculpting businesses. Botox (cosmetic) raked in sales of $210.3 million (up 10.7%). Botox Therapeutic revenues were $346.9 million, up 17.2%. In addition, Juvéderm Collection of fillers rose 7.3% and Ozurdex sales increased 15.8%, which contributed to the upside. Alloderm added $84.6 million while CoolSculpting added $78.9 million to sales in the second quarter.Importantly, Restasis sales declined 9.4% to $336.4 million in the quarter due to unfavorable trade buying patterns. We remind investors that Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) launched its dry eye disease drug, Xiidra last year. There have been investor concerns about Xiidra posing strong competition for Restasis. The company expects stable Restasis revenues this year.U.S. General Medicine net revenue declined 1.5% to $1.43 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands, Women's Health, and the Gastrointestinal franchises. Anti-Infectives sales rose 7.4% to $67.8 million while Central Nervous System sales rose 9.2% to $346.6 million.Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Viberzi, Namzaric and Vraylar did well in the quarter. Linzess’ sales rose 11.5% in the quarter to $167.8 million, driven by strong demand and continued OTC conversion.However, lower Namenda XR sales hurt the performance of the CNS franchise. Namenda XR sales declined 28.7% to $118.7 million in the quarter due to lower demand, lower pricing and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric. The company does not expect a generic version of Namenda XR to be launched until first quarter of 2018, delayed from the prior expectation of fourth quarter of 2017. Also, Allergan does not expect any generic version of Estrace Cream to be launched this year.Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept, recorded sales of $33.4 million compared with $23.6 million in the previous quarter.Asacol/Delzicol sales declined 61.9% to $45.6 million due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in Aug 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol.In the Women’s Health segment, Minastrin 24 revenues declined 86.3% to $11.4 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in Mar 2017.The International segment recorded net revenue of $858.8 million, up 16.2% from the year-ago period, driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics, Botox Therapeutic and the addition of LifeCell and CoolSculpting.2017 Outlook UpThe company raised its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2017.Allergan expects total revenue in the range of $15.85 billion to $16.05 billion compared with $15.8 billion to $16.0 billion previously. Currency headwinds are now not expected to hurt revenues versus a negative impact of approximately $100 million expected previously.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $16.05–$16.45 compared with $15.85–$16.35 previously.Adjusted gross margin is expected between 86.5% and 87%. R&D expenses are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion (maintained). SG&A spend is expected between $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion compared to $4.45 billion and $4.55 billion previously.Our TakeAllergan did fairly well in beating estimates for both earnings and sales in the second quarter. The company also raised its 2017 outlook. Shares were down slightly in pre-market trading. However, so far this year, Allergan’s share price is up 19.2% against the industry’s decline of 1.9%.Allergan is reshaping its portfolio through strategic acquisitions. The drugmaker sold its generics and Anda distribution business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) in Aug and Oct 2016, respectively in order to focus on its branded segment.Allergan also boasts a strong branded pipeline with nine product launches planned for 2017. Allergan is extending its R&D pipeline to adjacent categories like NASH, Parkinson's disease, and gene therapy with many promising phase II/III programs in development.We are also encouraged by Allergan’s focus on building its biosimilars pipeline. Allergan has a collaboration agreement with Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) for the worldwide development and commercialization of three oncology antibody biosimilars, which include biosimilars of Roche’s cancer drugs Herceptin and Avastin.However, generic competition for legacy brands like Namenda IR/XR and Asacol HD as well as new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern.Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

39,AMGN,"Major biotech stocks like Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Alexion, AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results over the last few days. Companies like Gilead and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also provided regulatory updates. Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Gilead’s results were strong with the company’s HIV franchise putting in a strong performance and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise performing better than expected. The company raised its revenue outlook including for the HCV franchise (Read more: Gilead Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenue Estimates, Stock Up). Celgene also topped estimates and raised its earnings guidance for the year (Read more: Celgene Beats Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates, Ups View) as did Alexion (Read more: Alexion Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Ups 2017 View). Vertex (Read more: Vertex Q2 Earnings Top on Solid Cystic Fibrosis Sales) and AbbVie too topped expectations (Read more: AbbVie Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Outlook Intact).Earlier-Than-Expected FDA Approval for Celgene/Agios Cancer Drug: Celgene and partner, Agios (AGIO  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for Idhifa (enasidenib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) with IDH2 mutation as detected by an FDA approved test. The approval came ahead of the FDA action date of Aug 30, 2017.This makes Idhifa the first and only FDA-approved therapy for this patient population, which represents 8 – 19% of AML patients, as per information provided by the companies. More than 21,000 new cases of AML are detected every year in the U.S. with the majority of patients seeing their disease relapse eventually. The prognosis for R/R AML is poor with overall survival for this patient population estimated to be less than six months. Although Idhifa comes with a boxed warning regarding differentiation syndrome, uptake should be strong given the significant unmet medical need.Will it be Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B? Dynavax’s (DVAX  -  Free Report) shares shot up on a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. With the positive vote, expectations are high that the company will finally gain approval for the vaccine which had previously received two complete response letters (one in Nov 2016 and the other in Feb 2013). A decision from the agency is expected on Aug 10. If approved, Dynavax plans to launch the vaccine early next year. Dynavax’s shares are up a whopping 284.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 9.8% rally (Read more: Dynavax Shares Jump 75% after FDA Committee Approval).Vertex Ups CF Outlook on Kalydeco Label Expansion: Vertex’s cystic fibrosis (CF) drug Kalydeco’s label has been expanded in the U.S. and can now be used in the more than 600 CF patients (2 years and older) who have one of five residual function mutations that result in a splicing defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. With this label expansion, Vertex upped its 2017 sales guidance for the drug to $770 million - $800 million (old guidance: $740 - $770 million). Vertex now expects total CF product revenues of $1.87 billion - $2.1 billion (old guidance: $1.84 - $2.07 billion), including Orkambi sales of $1.1 billion - $1.3 billion (unchanged).Regulatory Updates from Amgen and Gilead: Amgen provided quite a few regulatory updates over the last few days. The company said that it has submitted a regulatory application in the U.S. seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). Prolia brought in sales of $930 million in the first half of 2017.Amgen along with partner Allergan also said that they have filed for FDA approval of ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Roche’s Herceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin is approved for the treatment of HER2+ adjuvant breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer in the U.S.Meanwhile, Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, got priority review in the U.S. for the inclusion of FOURIER cardiovascular outcomes study data on the reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. A decision from the agency is expected on Dec 2, 2017. Amgen said that a second application for the expansion of the lipid-lowering indication to include additional patient populations studied was also accepted by the agency.Gilead also had some updates on the regulatory front. The company said that its HCV drug, Epclusa’s label was updated in the U.S. to include use in patients co-infected with HIV. Epclusa, which initially gained approval in Jun 2016, is an all-oral, pan-genotypic, once-daily single tablet regimen. The label expansion provides co-infected patients with a convenient one-pill-a-day regimen that works across all HCV genotypes and is compatible with widely-used antiretroviral regimens. Epclusa sales crossed $2 billion in the first half of 2017.Moreover, Gilead’s latest HCV offering Vosevi gained approval in the EU for the treatment of all genotypes. The marketing authorization for Harvoni in the EU was also extended allowing use in the adolescent population. Vosevi was approved in the U.S. a few weeks back in July.Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 2.5% over the last five trading sessions.

40,AMGN,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 67 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents by 3.1%. Earnings also rose 5% year over year.On the other hand, revenues missed expectations. The pharma heavyweight delivered revenues of $12.90 billion, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.02 billion. Again, revenues declined 2% from the year-ago period due to currency headwinds and divestiture of Hospira infusion systems business. In Feb 2017, Pfizer divested its Hospira infusion systems (HIS) business to ICU Medical.Sales in DetailCurrency movement impacted Pfizer’s second-quarter revenues by 2% ($202 million). Sales growth was flat on an operational basis. Excluding HIS revenues, sales rose 2% on an operational basis.Lower sales of Enbrel and the Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise and loss of exclusivity for some products  offset strong performance of key products like Ibrance (breast cancer), Xtandi (prostate cancer) and Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis).International revenues declined 3% (flat on an operational basis) to $6.55 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues were flat at $6.34 billion.Segment DiscussionFrom the second quarter of 2016, Pfizer reorganized its reporting segments to Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 8% (up 9% operationally) from the year-ago period to $7.67 billion.Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Ibrance and Eliquis globally and growth of Lyrica and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S.While Ibrance revenues rose 66% to $853 million in the quarter, Xeljanz rose 55% to $336 million. Lyrica sales rose 5% to $1.10 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 50% to $605 million.Revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the Sep 2016 Medivation acquisition, also propelled U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $141 million in the quarter compared with $131 million in the first quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in U.S. and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra.Enbrel revenues declined 20% to $617 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis(RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the U.S. and Canada. Viagra sales declined 15% to $255 million due to lower sales in the U.S. and international markets due on reduced demand.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues declined 8% to $1.15 billion. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 16% in the U.S. due to “high initial capture rate” of the eligible adult patient population following its successful 2014 launch. This resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity in the second quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. Unfavorable timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication also hurt U.S. sales.Eucrisa (crisaborole) topical ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema), which was bought as part of the Jun 2016 Anacor acquisition, was launched in the U.S. in first quarter of 2017. The ointment recorded sales of $9 million in the second quarter.While Consumer Healthcare revenues rose 1% to $846 million, Global Oncology revenues surged 44% to $1.59 billion driven by Ibrance. Global Vaccine revenues declined 7% to $1.27 billion. While Internal Medicine rose 10% to $2.41 billion, the Inflammation & Immunology franchise declined 1% to $992 million. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 8% to $562 million.Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 14% (down 12% operationally) to $5.23 billion. Excluding HIS revenues, EH sales declined 7%.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq (generic versions launched in the U.S. in Mar 2017), Vfend, Zyvox, Celebrex, Lyrica; lower revenues from legacy Hospira products and divesture of HIS. However, in the EH business, biosimilars did well in the quarter.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $23 million in the U.S. and $94 million globally, all other biosimilars brought in sales of $27 million (down 18%) from outside the U.S. markets.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses were flat (operationally) in the quarter at $3.39 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses rose 2% to $1.77 billion.2017 Guidance UpdatedWhile Pfizer raised the lower end of its adjusted earnings guidance, it retained the revenue expectations for the year. Revenues are expected in the range of $52 billion to $54 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.54 - $2.60 compared with $2.50–$2.60 expected previously. Higher than previously anticipated royalty income from certain products and lower interest cost led to the increase in the lower end of the profit outlook.At the mid-point, revenues are expected to be slightly above 2016 level, while adjusted EPS is expected to increase 7% (previously 6%).Research and development expenses are still expected in the range of $7.5–$8.0 billion, while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $13.7–$14.7 billion.Key Drugs ApprovalsImportantly, key pipeline candidate Bavencio/avelumab received accelerated FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in Mar 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. The candidate is being studied for different types of cancers including several combination therapies with other immuno-oncology agents.Another pipeline candidate, Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin) was approved in the EU in June as a monotherapy for relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The candidate is under review in the U.S. with a FDA decision expected later this month.Our TakePfizer’s second-quarter results were mixed as it beat earnings estimates but missed the same on sales. Shares declined slightly in pre-market trading as the company continues to struggle with its sales performance. Pfizer’s shares are up 2.1% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 10.7% for the industry.Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition, which are hurting the top line. Products like Viagra, Lyrica and Chantix will lose exclusivity in a couple of years. Nonetheless, we believe that new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance. Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential. Bavencio is being considered a key long-term growth driver for Pfizer.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

42,AMGN,"The second-quarter reporting cycle is in full swing. The quarter, undoubtedly, is off to a strong start.As of Jul 26, 2017, 171 S&P 500 members, accounting for 44.1% of the index’s total market capitalization, reported results, according to Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these 171 index members were up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter on a 3.4% improvement in revenues.

This follows 13.3% earnings growth in the first quarter on 7% increase in revenues, the highest in almost two years.Among the pharma bigwigs, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) released their second-quarter results this week. Both the companies beat earnings and revenue estimates and raised their sales and earnings expectations for the full year. Moreover, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) and Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) reported encouraging second-quarter results on Jul 26, beating estimates on both counts. However, GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter results the same day, beating on earnings but missing on sales.Let’s take a look at two large-cap pharma companies that are set to report second-quarter results on Jul 28.AbbVie Inc.

43,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $3.27 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 by 5.8% and increased 15% from the year-ago period. Better revenues and lower operating costs drove the bottom line. A lower tax rate and share count also pulled up profits.Total revenue rose 2% to $5.81 billion in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.67 billion by 2.5%. An unfavorable impact of foreign exchange hurt sales by 1% in the quarter.While U.S. revenues rose 2% and ex-U.S. sales grew 8%, excluding currency headwinds.Quarter in DetailTotal product revenue rose 2% from the year-ago quarter to $5.57 billion (U.S.: $4.39 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.19 billion) as strong demand for newer products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolisand Blincyto somewhat made up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.Revenues of Amgen’s erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), Aranesp, rose 6% from the year-ago quarter to $535 million due to higher unit demand in the U.S.Revenues of the other ESA, Epogen, declined 12% to $292 million due to lower selling price owing to a recently negotiated contract with DaVita Inc.Neulasta revenues declined 5% to $1.09 billion from the year-ago period due to lower unit demand following competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies. Neupogen recorded a 30% decline in sales to $137 million due to biosimilar competition in the U.S. Zarxio, Sandoz’s (Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm) biosimilar version of Neupogen, was launched in the U.S. in Sep 2015 and is hurting sales.The company expects Neulasta and Neupogen sales to continue to be hurt by competitive dynamic through the rest of 2017. However, management did specify on the call, that “no new U.S. biosimilar competition” is expected this year. This suggests that Neulasta and Epogenmay not start facing any biosimilar competition in the U.S. this year, contrary to previous expectations.However, the Neulasta Onpro kit (on-body injector) continues to perform well commanding a market share of about 55% in the U.S. for all Neulasta sales.Enbrel delivered revenues of $1.47 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter due to increased competition, which offset favorable changes in inventory and price.However, in the quarter, market volume growth improved in the rheumatology/dermatology segments compared with the first quarter with Enbrel experiencing relatively stable unit share in these markets.Prolia revenues came in at $505 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter due to higher demand. The osteoporosis drug witnessed market share gains in both the U.S. and our international markets.Meanwhile, Xgeva delivered revenues of $395 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter mainly due to higher demand.Sensipar/Mimpara revenues increased 10% to $427 million due to higher price increases.Vectibix revenues came in at $168 million, up 5%, driven by higher demand.Kyprolis recorded sales of $211 million, up 23% year over year driven by higher demand.In the quarter, Amgen submitted regulatory applications in the U.S. and EU to include overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis. The study demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Velcade plus dexamethasoneThis overall survival data, if approved, can help drive usage and boost sales of Kyprolis.Amgen also announced final data from the phase III ASPIRE study of Kyprolis this month, which showed that a triple combination regimen of Kyprolis plus Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (KRd ) significantly improved overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma compared to Revlimidand dexamethasone(Rd).Blincyto sales surged 43% from the year-ago period to $43 million, reflecting higher demand. Earlier this month, the FDA approved the inclusion of overall survival data from the TOWER study on the label of Blincyto. The addition of the data should help boost sales.Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha generated revenues of $83 million, higher than $49 million in the first quarter driven by higher demand.Uptake of the drug, which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent.We remind investors that a phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER) on Repatha had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes in the first quarter. The data is key to commercial success of Repatha as it would broaden the use of the drug. Though data from the study looks good, it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data. Amgen filed regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in Jun 2017.Operating Margins IncreaseAdjusted operating margins rose 380 basis points (bps) to 55.2% due to lower operating costs, reflecting continued benefits from transformation and process improvement efforts.R&D expenses declined 3% in the quarter due to lower late-stage pipeline related costs. SG&A spend declined 7% due to the Oct 2016 expiration of Enbrel residual royalty payments, which offset investments to support new product launches.Amgen bought back shares worth $1 billion in the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, Amgen had $2.5 billion remaining under its $5 billion stock repurchase plan.2017 GuidanceWhile Amgen slightly cut the lower end of the previously issued sales outlook, it raised the earnings guidance to account for strong first-half profits.The company expects total revenue in the range of $22.5 billion to $23.0 billion versus $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion expected previously. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of $12.15 to $12.65 in 2017 compared with $12.00 to $12.60 per share, expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in 2017 is pegged at $12.40 per share and $22.62 billion, respectively.Operating expenses are expected to be higher in the second half.Our TakeIt was a rather strong quarter for Amgen as it beat expectations for both earnings and sales and raised its earnings guidance. Shares, however, lost 2.4% in after-market trading probably due to concerns related to the tightened revenue guidance. However, so far this year, Amgen’s shares are up 23.7%, better than the 12.7% increase registered by the industry.Though Amgen’s newer products – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well, their volume growth may not be enough to offset the decline in mature brands like Enbrel due to competitive pressure. However, Amgen’s restructuring plan should make it leaner and more cost efficient. Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline, including biosimilar drugs, given quite a few regulatory and data updates scheduled for the second half.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

44,AMGN,"Key biotech stocks, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results yesterday -- both companies surpassed earnings and sales estimates. There were several other key updates as well from companies like Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO  -  Free Report).  Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAmgen, Biogen Q2 Earnings: Biogen’s results were strong with the company’s most recent offering, Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy - SMA), doing better than expected. Meanwhile, the company’s multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise continued to grow. MS is Biogen’s key area of expertise. Biogen expects the early 2020s to be an inflection point for the company with its key pipeline candidates expected to launch during that period (Read more: Biogen Tops Q2 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).  Amgen also topped estimates and updated its guidance. Recently launched products including Prolia (the second and fourth quarters are typically the strongest for this product), Repatha and Kyprolis recorded strong volume-driven growth. Amgen is working on improving Repatha patient access across the world. Meanwhile, mature products like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen declined with Neupogen being impacted by short-acting biosimilar competition that will continue affecting sales.While Amgen stock has gained 23.7% year to date (YTD), outperforming the 11.5% rally of the industry it belongs to, Biogen has lagged with shares declining 0.2% YTD.Incyte/Lilly RA Drug Faces At Least 18-Month Delay in Resubmission: Incyte and partner Lilly announced that there will be a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for their investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, baricitinib. This means the resubmission will not take place this year. Incyte and Lilly will discuss the path forward with the FDA and evaluate options for resubmission including the possibility of conducting an additional study as required by the FDA.The FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib earlier this year in April. At that time, the agency had told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA, in its current form. The FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.We note that baricitinib was approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant in Feb 2017. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recently agreed that the label should be updated to include a precaution for patients who have risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Incyte’s shares were down 3.4% on the baricitinib update.Nektar Up on Lilly Deal: Nektar (NKTR  -  Free Report) entered into a deal with big pharma company Lilly which will see Nektar receiving $150 million upfront as well as up to $250 million in the form of milestone payments. The deal covers the co-development of an early stage asset, NKTR-358, in Nektar’s pipeline. NKTR-358, which has the potential to treat a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions, works by targeting the IL-2 receptor complex in the body. By activating regulatory T cells, NKTR-358 has the potential to bring the immune system back into balance.Other deal terms include sharing of phase II development costs (Lilly: 75%; Nektar: 25%), an option for Nektar to participate in late-stage development on an indication-by-indication basis and double-digit royalties for Nektar. The deal is a major win for Nektar considering the early-stage nature of the candidate and the hefty upfront fee. Lilly will make a strong partner for the company. Nektar’s shares were up following the deal announcement.  Ironwood Down on Heartburn Drug Data: Ironwood’s (IRWD  -  Free Report) shares were down even though the company reported positive data on IW-3718 from a mid-stage study conducted in patients with uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The study met its primary endpoint but failed to impress investors with the efficacy results falling short of expectations. Ironwood intends to conduct end of phase II meetings with the FDA and move the candidate into phase III studies in the second half of 2018. According to the company, IW-3718 represents immense commercial potential with annual peak sales opportunity of more than $2 billion (Read more: Ironwood Reports Positive Data on Reflux Candidate).CHMP Positive on Regeneron/Sanofi Eczema Drug: Regeneron and Sanofi are a step closer to gaining EU approval for their eczema treatment, Dupixent, with the CHMP adopting a positive opinion for the drug. The companies are seeking approval for use in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are candidates for systemic therapy. A final decision regarding approval should be out in the coming months. Dupixent gained FDA approval earlier this year in March. Dupixent has blockbuster potential and is being investigated for other indications as well.Detailed Data on Gilead HIV Regimen: Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) announced detailed 48-week results from a couple of late-stage studies on a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (a novel investigational INSTI) and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, a dual-NRTI backbone) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve adults. The bictegravir-containing regimen was found to be non-inferior to dolutegravir-containing regimens. Gilead holds a strong position in the HIV market and is working on strengthening its franchise. There is significant demand for a simple, convenient dosing regimen that can sustain virologic suppression with a safety profile that is appropriate for most HIV patients.MDCO’s TANGO-2 Stopped Early on Superior Benefit-Risk: The Medicines Co. got some good news with an independent data safety and monitoring board stopping a late-stage study on its investigational antibiotic, Vabomere (previously referred to as Carbavance) based on an interim analysis. Interim results from the TANGO-2 study showed that Vabomere improved clinical cure rates across all infection types and reduced rate of renal adverse events compared to best available therapy.Vabomere is currently under priority FDA review with a response expected in the third quarter. A marketing application was filed in the EU as well. The Medicines Co. is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnEarnings season for the biotech sector is off to a strong start with big players like Amgen and Biogen reporting better than expected results.

45,AMGN,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the second quarter of 2017.

However, we note that Biogen’s shares have inched up 0.8% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 12.7%.                                                                    Biogen reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $5.04, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.36 by 15.6%.

The drug recorded a 16% sequential surge in revenues. This included the U.S. sales of $875 million and ex-U.S. sales of $235.6 million. In the U.S., Tecfidera revenues benefited from seasonal recovery in both unit volumes and discounts as well as allowances.Second-quarter Tysabri revenues were flat year over year and the same decreased 9% sequentially to $496 million (U.S. $289.4 million, ex-U.S. $206.6 million).Note that Tysabri revenues in the first quarter of 2017 benefited by approximately $45 million in the ex-U.S. markets due to an agreement with the Price and Reimbursement Committee of the Italian National Medicines Agency (AIFA) related to Tysabri sales. This benefit was missing in the second quarter, leading to the sequential decline.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the second quarter were $691 million (U.S. $501.7 million, ex-U.S. $188.9 million), down 5% from the year-ago period. Avonex revenues declined 8% from the year-ago period to $557 million. Plegridy contributed $133 million to second-quarter 2017 revenues, up 8% year over year and 19% sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc.

It was also approved of in Japan and Canada recently.This quarter, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $91 million compared with $66 million in first-quarter 2017. The company markets Benepali, a biosimilar referencing Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in Europe. Benepali recorded revenues of $88.7 million, thus registering a growth rate of 35.8% sequentially. Biogen also markets Flixabi, a biosimilar referencing Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Remicade, which recorded revenues of $1.9 million in the reported quarter compared with $0.6 million in the first quarter.Revenues from Anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 14% from the year-ago period to $397 million in the second quarter.R&D spend soared 68% in the reported quarter to $796 million, while SG&A spend decreased 12% year over year to $430 million. This quarter, the company repurchased 2.9 million shares worth $782 million under its $5.0 billion share repurchase program.2017 OutlookBiogen raised its earnings and revenue outlook for 2017.Biogen now expects earnings in the range of $20.80-$21.40 per share (old guidance: $20.45-$21.25 per share) for 2017.Revenues are now expected in a range of $11.5-$11.8 billion comapred with the earlier guidance of $11.1-$11.4 billion in 2017.

46,AMGN,"Despite the hurdles in Trump’s plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, healthcare is the second best performing sector this year lagging technology. The optimism comes especially from encouraging industry trends and hopes of a favorable policy environment.The Trump administration plans to focus on easing regulatory hurdles rather than lowering drug prices, and expedite new drug approvals. Additionally, the shift in investors’ sentiment to defensive sectors like healthcare, which generally outperform during periods of low-to-moderate growth and rising geopolitical uncertainty, has led to a rally in healthcare stocks (read: Top Ranked Healthcare ETFs for Long Term Investors).As such, popular funds – Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report), Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT  -  Free Report), iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (IYH  -  Free Report) and Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC  -  Free Report) – have gained at least 18% so far this year.

47,AMGN,"The second-quarter reporting cycle seems to have gotten off to a good start, with an abundance of positive surprises, particularly on the revenue front. Meanwhile, earnings and revenue growth also bettered expectations.As of Jul 21, 2017, 97 S&P 500 members, accounting for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization, reported results, according to  Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these 97 index members were up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 5.1% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 78.4% for earnings and 72.2% for revenues.The earnings momentum is expected to continue through the season. Per the report, total earnings for S&P 500 companies in the second quarter are expected to grow 8.6% year over year on 4.7% higher revenues. This follows 13.3% earnings growth in the first quarter on 7% increase in revenues, the highest in almost two years.Among the pharma bigwigs, only Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Swiss company Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) have reported so far. J&J reported mixed second-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales.  This was the third consecutive sales miss for J&J due to a a slowdown in pharmaceutical product sales. However, J&J is optimistic that sales growth will accelerate in the second half of 2017. On the other hand, Novartis’ second-quarter results were encouraging as the company beat both earnings and sales estimates. However, Sandoz’s performance was disappointing due to pricing pressure.Here we have three pharma giants that are set to report second-quarter results on Jul 25. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Lilly, which is scheduled to release earnings before the market opens, had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.08% last quarter. Lilly’s earnings performance has been mixed with earnings missing expectations in two of the last four quarters and  beating in the other two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 2.28%.Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise  Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteFor this quarter, Lilly has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.04 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.New products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz and Jardiance have supported the top line in the past few quarters. We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter of 2017 as well. However, a decline in the sales of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to continue due to the loss of exclusivity. (Read More: Is a Beat in the Cards for Eli Lilly in Q2 Earnings?).Our previous article showed that Lilly was likely to beat on earnings this quarter. However, estimates changed thereafter and we are not certain of a beat this earnings season.Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report)Biogen, a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market,is also scheduled to announce results before the opening bell. Biogen’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far, having delivered back-to-back positive surprises.

48,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25 after the market closes. Amgen delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.0% in the last quarter.Amgen shares are up 22.6% so far this year. This compares favorably with the 10.5% increase registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company reporting positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.31%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAmgen’s growth products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolis, Vectibix, Nplate, Sensipar are likely to perform well. While new patient adoption and repeat injections might drive Prolia sales, Xgeva is likely to benefit from its superior clinical profile versus competition. Parsabiv (etelcalcetide), for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), was approved in the U.S in Feb 2017 and in EU in Nov 2016. The drug is likely bring in some revenues in the second quarter.However, the company has some challenges in store given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products. Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen sales are expected to be hurt by competition in the EU. Note that Neupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the U.S. mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s, Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, biosimilar version of Neupogen, which was launched in the U.S. in Sep 2015. Neupogen is expected to face continued competitive pressure this year from the existing and potential biosimilars.Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition in the U.S. this year, though no biosimilars were launched in the second quarter.Meanwhile, blockbuster drug Enbrel is facing increasing competition in the rheumatology/dermatology segments, which will hurt sales.Volume growth of recently launched products may not be enough to offset the decline in mature brandsThe bottom line will however benefit from the company’s overall cost-cutting efforts and share buyback. The company’s restructuring plan will make it leaner and more cost efficient.Investor focus will remain on the performance of the company’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions.A phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER) on Repatha had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes in the first quarter. The data is key to the commercial success of Repatha as it would broaden the use of the drug. Though data from the study looks good, it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data. Amgen filed regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in Jun 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.32% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.08 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.09. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the Biomed/Genetics sector that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #3.

49,AMGN,"Key highlights this week include impressive data from Vertex’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) cystic fibrosis (CF) pipeline while companies like Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) and Puma (PBYI  -  Free Report) got FDA approval for their hepatitis C virus (HCV) and breast cancer treatments, respectively.  Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesVertex CF Data Impresses: Vertex got a major boost with positive data on three different triple combination regimens in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min). These are the first data to show the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in these patients, who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease. The company is looking to start a pivotal program in the first half of 2018. Vertex’s shares were up significantly in pre-market trading.CRL for Amgen/UCB Osteoporosis Drug: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner UCB got a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for Evenity (romosozumab), their investigational treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. However, the CRL doesn’t come as a surprise considering the emergence of a new safety signal in a late-stage study (ARCH). Although Evenity met both the primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint in the study, the companies said that an imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed.The FDA has asked the companies to include data from the ARCH study in the resubmission as well as data from the BRIDGE study in men with osteoporosis (Read more: Amgen Gets CRL for Osteoporosis Drug Evenity's BLA). Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FDA Nod for Gilead HCV Drug: Gilead has added another drug to its hepatitis C virus (HCV) portfolio with the FDA granting approval to Vosevi, a single-tablet regimen for the re-treatment of adults with chronic HCV. Vosevi provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for their hardest-to-treat patients. However, Vosevi comes with a boxed warning regarding the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HCV/HBV co-infected patients -- this could limit uptake.Gilead’s HCV franchise, which was a major revenue generator, is under considerable strain due to new competition and pricing pressure. The company has underperformed the Zacks-categorized Medical-Biomedical/Genetics industry so far in 2017 with shares gaining 0.1% while the industry is up 8.9%.Puma Up on FDA Approval of Nerlynx: Puma gained FDA approval for its breast cancer treatment, Nerlynx (neratinib), which has blockbuster potential. Nerlynx, the first approved drug in Puma’s portfolio, is indicated for the extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage, HER2+ breast cancer, an aggressive type of tumor. This means that Nerlynx can be taken after an initial treatment so that the risk of the cancer coming back can be reduced further. Nerlynx’s approval was in line with expectations considering a favorable advisory panel vote earlier this year. Puma’s shares were up 8.5% on the news. Year-to-date (YTD), Puma’s shares are up a whopping 204.4%.Sarepta-BioMarin Settle Patent Dispute: Sarepta (SRPT  -  Free Report) and BioMarin settled their patent dispute regarding the use of Sarepta’s Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The companies signed a licensing agreement providing Sarepta with global exclusive rights to BioMarin’s DMD patent estate for Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products. BioMarin has the option to convert the license to a co-exclusive right if it decides to proceed with an exon-skipping therapy for DMD.

Its shares have rallied 14.5% compared with the 7.2% gain recorded by the industry.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.The Quarter in DetailNovartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon (Ophthalmology unit) and Sandoz (Generics).The Innovative Medicines division recorded sales of $8.3 billion, up 1%. Generic competition and pricing pressure impacted sales at the segment, primarily due to the entry of generics for Gleevec in the U.S and Europe. Nevertheless, growth products – Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist and Gilenya boosted sales.Psoriasis Cosentyx sales surged 90% on the back of strong growth in its three approved indications while Entresto too had solid quarter as sales benefited from continued access improvements, expansion of sales force in the U.S and reimbursement in Europe. Oncology franchise grew 9% driven mainly by Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist.Sales at the Sandoz division were $2.5 billion, down 4% as volume growth was offset by price erosion mainly in the U.S. Sales in the U.S. declined 15% due to pricing pressure in retail generics and prior year launch timing. Biopharmaceuticals sales grew 6% to $260 million mainly driven by Zarxio in the U.S.Sales at the Alcon division were $1.5 billion, up 3%. Surgical sales increased 3% driven by growth in cataract consumables and vitreoretinal, intraocular lenses returning to growth globally. Vision Care sales were up 2% fuelled by the continued double-digit growth of Dailies Total1.2017 Outlook ReiteratedNovartis expects net sales to be broadly in line with the 2016 levels after including the impact of continued genericization of Gleevec/Glivec in the U.S. and Europe. Management had earlier estimated the impact of generic competition on sales to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2017.Pipeline UpdateNovartis’ pipeline candidates’ progress has been encouraging. The oncology portfolio continues to gain traction. Breast cancer drug Kisqali received a positive CHMP opinion as a first-line option for HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with any aromatase inhibitor in Europe. The drug is already approved in the U.S. The company also received FDA approval of Rydapt for the treatment of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and three types of systemic mastocytosis. In addition, Zykadia received FDA and EMA approval for first line use in ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) while Tafinlar + Mekinist received FDA approval for treatment of BRAF V600E mutant metastatic NSCLC.CTL019 was unanimously recommended for approval by an FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee in July for the treatment of pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Meanwhile, Cosentyx was granted approval in Europe for a label update to include 52 week data from CLEAR study demonstrating long-term superiority of Cosentyx compared to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara in psoriasis.Sandoz received approval and launched two major biosimilars in the EU- Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel and Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) MabThera to treat blood cancers and immunological diseases. The EMA also accepted proposed biosimilars of adalimumab and infliximab. Sandoz’ generic version of asthma drug Advair Diskus was accepted by FDA.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG QuoteOur TakeNovartis second-quarter results were encouraging as the company beat both earnings and sales estimates. However, Sandoz’s performance was disappointing as it battles pricing pressure.In the first half of 2017, Novartis announced that it is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering. The company will throw more light on its plans for Alcon by the end of 2017.On a positive note, growth drivers like Cosentyx and Entresto, more than offset the impact of generic erosion, mainly due to Glivec. Cosentyx hit blockbuster status in 2016. The recent approval of Kisqali in the U.S. and FDA panel recommendation for CTL019 also bodes well for the company’s portfolio.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

52,AMGN,"Shares of Radius Health ((RDUS  -  Free Report)) dropped more than 7.8% in early morning trading hours Monday after the company announced that Jesper Høiland, a former top-ranking executive at Novo Nordisk ((NVO  -  Free Report)), has been appointed its new president and chief executive officer.  Høiland joins Radius at an integral moment for the company, which recently received approval for its once-daily, injectable osteoporosis treatment, Tymlos.  “We are pleased to welcome Jesper to Radius Health at this important time, and believe that he is uniquely qualified to lead Radius through the successful launch of TYMLOS™, and the advancement of our exciting clinical stage assets including elacestrant,” said Radius Chairman Kurt Graves. Høiland replaces Bob Ward, who served as Radius’ CEO since 2013 and helped lead the company through its IPO in 2014. Not long after its market debut, shares of Radius reached a peak of more than $80 during the summer of 2015, but the stock has struggled to maintain momentum since then. “I am delighted to be joining Radius in the exciting, early stages of the commercialization of TYMLOS™,” said Jesper Høiland, “and I look forward to guiding the continued development of its strong pipeline.” The new appointment comes in the wake of Radius Health rival Amgen’s ((AMGN  -  Free Report)) announcement that its own osteoporosis drug did not receive FDA approval. For now, the list of approved treatments for building bone strength to fight this degenerative condition remains at just two, with Eli Lilly’s ((LLY  -  Free Report)) Forteo remaining the market leader. For Radius investors, today’s appointment will likely lead to some short-term volatility, but a fresh face at the top of the company’s management could be the much-needed ignition source for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

53,AMGN,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner, Biocon Ltd. announced that the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) unanimously recommended approval of its biosimilarversion of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) breast cancer drug Herceptin (trastuzumab).In fact, the FDA’s ODAC voted 16 to 0 in favor of biosimilar candidate, which has been developed to treat HER2-positive breast cancer that is a more aggressive form of the disease.Notably, shares of Mylan inched up about 0.41% following the news release. However, the company has outperformed the Zacks categorized Medical-Generic Drugs industry in the year so far, with the stock gaining 2.8% against the industry’s decline of 0.3%.Meanwhile, the data presented to ODAC included results that showed that the proposed biosimilar trastuzumab is highly similar to Herceptin, in line with the FDA’s assessment provided in the pre-meeting briefing documents. Per ODAC, there is no clinically meaningful difference between Mylan’s biosimilar candidate and Herceptin in terms of safety, purity and potency.Biosimilar trastuzumab is also under review by regulatory authorities in Australia, Canada, Europe and several emerging markets.While this is good news for Mylan, it is a blow for Roche because Herceptin is one of its key drugs. Last week, another biosimilar of Roche was put under review by the ODAC. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner, Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for its candidate, ABP 215, a biosimilar to Roche’s another cancer  drug Avastin, will also be reviewed by ODAC.  Both Herceptin and AVastin are key drugs for Roche and biosimiar versions of these drugs, once approved, will hurt the sales of the drugs. Mylan N.V.

Oncology franchise (excluding Gleevec) grew 11% driven mainly by Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist.Sales at the Sandoz division were $2.6 billion, up 1% as volume growth was offset by price erosion in the Unites States. Sales in the United States declined 13% due to pricing pressure. Biopharmaceuticals sales grew 9% mainly driven by Zarxio in the United States and launches of Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche Holdings, Inc.’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in EU.Sales at the Alcon division were $1.5 billion, up 7%.

56,AMGN,"The third-quarter reporting cycle is in full swing. Corporate earnings have been reassuring so far this quarter and we expect the momentum to continue going ahead.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 members, accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization, have reported results, according to Earnings Preview.Total earnings of these 87 index members were up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% improvement in revenues. The growth in revenues is impressive, ahead of the previous quarter’s growth of 4.4% and significantly higher than the 12-quarter average of 1.1%. The beat ratio was 71.3% for earnings and 70.1% for revenues. More than half of the 87 companies have beaten both EPS and revenue estimates.Per the report, total earnings of the S&P 500 companies in the third quarter are expected to grow 2.6% year over year on 5% higher revenues. Meanwhile, the broader Medical sector (includes drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 2.2% in earnings in Q3.Only two big names in the biotech/pharma sector have reported thus far — Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Swiss-based Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report). J&J’s Q3 results were better than expected and the company raised its sales and profit outlook for this year as well. Novartis also beat estimates for both revenues and earnings this quarter.Let’s take a look at three pharma/biotech companies that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 25.Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report)Amgen, which is scheduled to release earnings after market closes, had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.83% last quarter. Amgen beat expectations in the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.85%.For this quarter, Amgen has an Earnings ESP of -0.41% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This does not conclusively show that Amgenis likely to beat estimates this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.09 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Higher demand for Amgen’s new drugs is expected to offset lower sales of its mature brands. The company’s key drug, Neulasta, is facing competition from newer cancer therapies. The threat of biosimilars also lurks as several companies are looking to launch generic version of the drug. (Read More: What's in the Cards for Amgen this Earnings Season?)GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report)London, U.K. based Glaxo is scheduled to announceresults before the opening bell tomorrow.Glaxo has beaten estimates in three of the last four quarters and met the same in one, resulting in an average positive surprise of 8.34%. In the last reported quarter, Glaxo delivered a positive surprise of 2.94%.The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.28% and a Zacks Rank #3, which indicates that it is poised to deliver a beat this time around.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Glaxo’s HIV products are expected to drive sales for the pharmaceutical segment this quarter. Moreover, the newly launched respiratory drugs are expected to offset declining sales of Seretide, Advair and Avodart. Meanwhile, the slowdown in consumer segment due to market conditions and the impact of divestures is expected to continue. (Read More: Glaxo Q3 Earnings: Will it Deliver a Beat Yet Again?)Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report)The company, which specially focuses on cystic fibrosis (""CF""), will report results tomorrow after market closes. In the last quarter, Vertex delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.43%. The company came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 17.91% in the trailing four quarters. The company has an Earnings ESP of +7.24% and a Zacks Rank #3, indicating a likely positive surprise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 37 cents per share.The approval for two label expansions of CF drug, Kalydeco, in the United States in May and August has broadened the patient population, which can drive sales of the drug. Moreover, the re-imbursement agreements in Ireland and Italy for Orkambi are also a positive.

But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

57,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25 after the market closes. Amgen delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.83% in the last quarter.Amgen shares are up 25.9% so far this year. This compares favorably with the 12.1% increase registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company reporting positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAmgen’s newer products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolis, and Blincyto, should continue to perform well backed by higher demand, thus making up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.Neulasta demand is being hurt due to competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapiesNeupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of Neupogen, which was launched in September 2015.Neulasta and Neupogen sales are expected to be hurt by competitive dynamics in the third and fourth quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Neulasta and Neupogen are $1.10 billion and $133 million, respectively for the third quarter/However, management mentioned on the Q2 call that, “no new U.S. biosimilar competition” is expected this year. This suggests that Neulasta and Epogen may not start facing any biosimilar competition this year, contrary to previous expectations.Three companies - Mylan/Biocon, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), and Coherus - looking to launch generic versions of Neulasta and one company looking to launch generic version of Epogen have received complete response letter from the FDA for their respective applications, which can delay their launch.The bottom line will continue to be driven by the company’s overall cost-cutting efforts and share buyback. The company’s restructuring plan will likely make it leaner and more cost efficient.Investor focus will remain on the performance of the company’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. However, in the second quarter, Repatha revenues improved sequentially driven by higher demand. Management said that the presentation of the outcomes study data (FOURIER) had a positive impact on Repatha share trends. It remains to be seen if the positive trends continue in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.37% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.07 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.08. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. QuoteStocks to Consider Some stocks in the Biomed/Genetics sector that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 26.Also scheduled to release results on Oct 26, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

58,AMGN,"We issued an updated research report on Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) on Sep 26.Allergan boasts dominant growth franchises in several areas and is strengthening its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions. In 2017 so far, through the accretive acquisitions of LifeCell and ZELTIQ, Allergan has expanded its medical aesthetics business into regenerative medicine and body sculpting, respectively.Allergan sold its generics business in Aug 2016 and the Anda distribution business to Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) in Oct 2016. Following the closure of the Teva deal, Allergan can now focus on the branded segment and is using the proceeds to buy back shares, pay down debt and pursue additional deals.Key products like Botox and Linzess and new products such as Viberzi and Vraylar are supporting sales growth at Allergan. In fact, at the second quarter conference call, Allergan raised its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2017, following a strong first-half performance and solid outlook for the rest of the year.Allergan also boasts a strong branded pipeline with meaningful data read-outs in the next few months. The company has more than 65 projects in mid-to-late stage development including six key phase III programs. This year, Allergan is extending its R&D pipeline to adjacent categories like NASH, Parkinson's disease, and gene therapy with many promising phase II/III programs in development. Allergan has nine product launches planned for 2017.Biosimilars also represent significant opportunity. Allergan and Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) have a collaboration agreement for the worldwide development and commercialization of biosimilar versions of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs, Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. The biosimilar version of Avastin, to be marketed by the trade name of Mvasi, received FDA approval this month, making it the first cancer biosimilar to get FDA nod.However, while we remain optimistic about the company’s growth prospects, it is facing generic competition for legacy brands like Namenda and Asacol HD as well as patent challenges for some of the other products in its branded portfolio.Meanwhile, new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. Shire’s dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, poses strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy’s Trulance (plecanatide) was launched in the second quarter for CIC, which could pose competition to Linzess.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

59,AMGN,"We are into the second half of the year. It’s time to analyze how the first half turned out to be for pharma and biotech stocks in terms of FDA decisions. The regulatory body approved 17 novel drugs in the first half of 2018, which is less than the year-ago period figure of 23. However, with several FDA decision lined up for the second half, a higher number of drugs could be approved in the rest of the year.Key FDA approvals in the first half included Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report)/Novartis’s first CGRP antibody Aimovig/erenumab for prevention of migraine, J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor Erleada (apalutamide) for pre-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC), Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ (VRTX  -  Free Report) third medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals’ Palynziq to treat phenylketonuria (PKU).With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming, plus requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts.Let’s take a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of July.FDA Decision on Indivior’s Schizophrenia Injection RBP-7000: On Jul 28, the FDA is expected to give its decision on Indivior Plc’s (INVVY  -  Free Report) RBP-7000, which has been developed for the treatment of schizophrenia. RBP-7000 is a once-monthly injectable risperidone given using the Atrigel delivery system. Indivior is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Progenics Pharmaceuticals’ Azedra Review: Progenics Pharmaceuticals’ (PGNX  -  Free Report) new drug application (NDA), looking to get its pipeline candidate, Azedra approved for the treatment of patients suffering from malignant rare neuroendocrine tumors — pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma — is under review. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Jul 30, after a three-month delay from the previous FDA action date in March. Azedra was added to Progenics’ portfolio with the acquisition of Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals in 2013.Decision on Insys Therapeutics’ Pain Candidate: On Jul 28, the FDA is also expected to give its decision on Insys Therapeutics’. (INSY  -  Free Report) buprenorphine sublingual spray for moderate-to-severe acute pain. It is important to remember that in May an FDA advisory committee voted against its approval. The company had filed a new drug application (""NDA"") in September last year based on positive data from a pivotal study on the candidate. The FDA accepted the NDA for review in December assigning a PDUFA date of Jul 28, 2018.It is quite possible that the unfavorable vote by the committee may influence the FDA’s decision and delay the approval of the drug.Will an FDA Panel Back New Indication for Glaxo’s Nucala?: Toward the end of the  month, an FDA panel is expected to give its opinion on Glaxo’s (GSK  -  Free Report) label expansion filing for eosinophilic asthma drug, Nucala (mepolizumab) for a  new indication -  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). With the latest filing, Glaxo is looking to get Nucala approved as an add-on maintenance treatment of COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype. Nucala is presently approved for treating severe eosinophilic asthma and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (""EGPA""). Glaxo hadfiled a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDAfor label expansion of Nucala to include use in COPD in November last year.Although the FDA takes the recommendations of its panels/advisory committee into account while reviewing applications, it is not bound to follow the same.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

60,AMGN,"The FDA, which approved 22 novel drugs last year, has given its approval to 31 drugs so far in 2017 including five in August. Key approvals this year include Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Some of these drugs have blockbuster potential.A recent landmark approval was that of Novartis’ Kymriah, making it the first gene therapy in the United States. This marks the beginning of a new era for the treatment of cancer and other serious and life-threatening diseases.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of September.Will the FDA Follow the Advisory Panel Vote for Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar?Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) should hear from the FDA soon about the approval status of its biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab). The company and its partner, Biocon Ltd. got a favorable vote (16-0) from the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) in July for the biosimilar. Herceptin is approved for a wide range of indications including HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic and adjuvant settings.Earlier this year, Mylan had entered into a global settlement agreement with Roche’s Genentech, and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. for Herceptin (trastuzumab), under which Mylan got global licenses (excluding Japan, Brazil and Mexico) for its trastuzumab product. Mylan could well be the first to launch a biosimilar version of Herceptin in the United States. Approval would boost investor sentiment for the company which has lost 17.3% year to date versus the 17.9% decline of its industry.FDA Advisory Panels to Discuss Glaxo, Pfizer & PTC Therapeutics DrugsQuite a few FDA advisory panel meetings are scheduled for this month. The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Committee (VRBPAC) will be meeting on Sep 13 to discuss the safety and effectiveness of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) Shingrix. Glaxo is looking to get the non-live, recombinant vaccine approved for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in people who are 50 years old or above. Shingles, a common and potentially serious condition, can cause lasting pain and other complications such as scarring or visual impairment.Then on Sep 19, the FDA’s ODAC will be meeting to discuss the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) submitted by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) for its cancer drug, Sutent. Pfizer is looking to expand Sutent’s label for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancer-containing kidney). The FDA is expected to render a final decision regarding the label expansion in Jan 2018. Sutent brought in sales of $529 million in the first half of 2017.Later this month, on Sep 28, the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee will discuss PTC Therapeutics’ (PTCT  -  Free Report) new drug application (“NDA”) for Translarna (ataluren) for the treatment of patients with dystrophinopathy due to a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. Translarna is already approved outside the United States. The FDA is expected to give a response regarding the approval status of the drug by Oct 24, 2017.Will the FDA Grant Approval to Amgen/Allergan’s Avastin Biosimilar?Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan are also expecting a decision from the FDA for their biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). With the companies getting a favorable vote from an FDA advisory panel (“ODAC”) recently, chances of gaining approval on the FDA action date of Sep 14 look good. Shares of Amgen have gained 22.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 15.9%.Merck, Bristol-Myers Seek Label ExpansionMerck (MRK  -  Free Report) is looking to expand the label of its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for use in the treatment of recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Keytruda is under priority review for this indication with a response expected on Sep 22. Keytruda, which brought in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017, is a key product in Merck’s portfolio and is being evaluated for a wide range of indications. Merck has gained 8.4% year to date versus the 12.3% growth of its industry.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is also looking to expand the label of its PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo. Opdivo is under priority review for use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) after prior treatment with Nexavar (sorafenib). The FDA is expected to give a response on Sep 24, 2017. Opdivo, one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’ portfolio, brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Bristol-Myers has gained 2.5% year to date versus the 12.3% growth of its industry.Will the FDA Approve J&J’s Plivensia?Johnson & Johnson’s investigational rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor, is under FDA review with a response expected on Sep 23. However, early in August, Plivensia failed to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns. J&J is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Considering the safety concerns raised by the panel, it’s quite likely that the agency will ask for additional information before granting approval. Shares of J&J have gained 13.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally.Neos Therapeutics is also awaiting a decision this month for NT-0201, its amphetamine XR liquid suspension product candidate for attention deficit hyperactive disorder (“ADHD”). Approval on Sep 15, 2017 would allow the company to go ahead with its plans to launch the product in Jan 2018.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

61,AMGN,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission has approved the marketing application for a pediatric formulation (granules in capsule for opening) of Mimpara for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT).With this approval, the drug’s label has been expanded to include use in children aged three years and above with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy where standard of care therapy cannot adequately control secondary HPT.We remind investors that in June, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had rendered a positive opinion, recommending marketing approval of Mimpara for the expanded label.Amgen’s shares have rallied 17.8% this year so far, better than the industry’s 12.3% registered increase.The approval was based on data from studies assessing the use of Mimpara in pediatric secondary HPT patients, conducted by Amgen since 2007.Mimpara is already approved and marketed in the EU as an oral therapy for treating secondary HPT in adult patients with ESRD on maintenance dialysis therapy and for mitigating hypercalcemia in adult patients with parathyroid carcinoma. In the United States, the drug is marketed by the trade name Sensipar.Sensipar/Mimpara generated sales of $427 million in the second quarter of 2017, up 10% year over year. The label expansion is expected to boost international sales of the drug.We remind investors that Sensipar is set to face generic competition in March next year. Many companies are seeking to market the drug’s generic versions regarding formulation patent.Secondary hyperparathyroidism is often progressive in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). It affects around 88% of CKD patients on hemodialysis. Meanwhile, very few treatment options are available to treat this condition.Investors must also note that Amgen markets another sHPT medicine, Parsabiv, approved in the United States earlier in February and in the EU, back in November 2016. Parsabiv is approved to treat sHPT in adult patients with CKD on hemodialysis, the first therapy in 12 years to be approved for this condition. The drug has to be administered intravenously thrice a week at the end of a dialysis session.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(ALXN  -  Free Report), Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The stock has skyrocketed 288.7% against the industry’s decline of 1.2% in the same time frame.Per the agreement, Immunogen will take care of the the development of the three ADC programs prior to any potential opt-in by Jazz. Following any opt-in, Jazz will be responsible for any further development as well as for potential regulatory submissions and commercialization.Per the deal, Jazz will make an upfront payment of $75 million to ImmunoGen. Additionally, it will also pay up to $100 million in development funding over seven years to support the three ADC programs. For each program, Jazz may exercise its opt-in right at any time prior to a pivotal study or any time prior to a biologics license application (BLA). For each program for which Jazz elects to opt-in, ImmunoGen would be eligible to receive milestone payments based on certain pre-decided conditionsImmunogen believes that the deal with Jazz will enable it to advance and speed up the development of its early-stage novel ADC assets. The deal also provides Immunogen with sufficient funding to support these programs, and gives the right to co-commercialize one of these assets.On the other hand, Jazz believes that this collaboration will help it to expand its oncology portfolio with the potential addition of multiple innovative antibody drug conjugates.ImmunoGen is focused on the development of targeted cancer therapeutics using its proprietary ADC technology. ImmunoGen's ADC technology is also used in Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) marketed product, Kadcyla, in three other development-stage candidates, in its own pipeline, and in development programs by its partners Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Bayer AG, Biotest, CytomX, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Sanofi and Takeda. ImmunoGen, Inc.

63,AMGN,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced a new analysis from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER) on its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha.This analysis of a large cohort of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease showed that there was a strong progressive relationship between lower achieved levels of LDL-C or “bad” cholesterol and a lower risk of cardiovascular events rates. This analysis suggests that the use of intensive LDL-C therapies such as Repatha in high-risk cardiovascular patients can safely reduce the risk of another cardiovascular event like heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death.This year so far, Amgen’s shares are up 17.5%, better than the 7.2% increase registered by the industry.The results were presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress held in Spain and also published in The Lancet.We remind investors that data presented from FOURIER in March this year had revealed that treatment with Repatha led to a significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes.Uptake of the drug, which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. The FOURIER data holds the key to the commercial success of Repatha as it will broaden the use of the drug. Though data from the study looks good, it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data.Encouragingly, at the second quarter conference call, management said that Repatha holds 58% share of the PCSK9 segment in the U.S. and Europe, with share trends improving sequentially in both the markets in the quarter. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the new-to-brand share for Repatha was 70% in the second quarter. Management said that the presentation of the outcomes study data had a positive impact on Repatha share trends.Amgen filed regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in Jun 2017. Last month, Amgen announced that the FDA has granted priority review foritsregulatory application seeking approval to include FOURIER data on its label. A decision from the agency is expected on Dec 2, 2017.Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

64,AMGN,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that its biosimilar version of AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) top-selling blockbuster drug, Humira has been approved by the European Commission. The biosimilar will be marketed by the trade name of Imraldi.Imraldi (or SB5) will be used for a whole range of indications including rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, active enthesitis-related arthritis, hidradenitis suppurativa and non-infectious uveitis.We remind investors that the biosimilar was granted a positive opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in June this year.Biogen has a joint venture with Samsung BioLogics for biosimilars. Samsung Bioepis, the joint venture between the two companies, already marketsa couple of biosimilars in the EU – Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing J&J/Merck & Co., Inc.’s [(MRK  -  Free Report)] Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Amgen/Pfizer’s Enbrel). This makes Imraldi the third anti-TNF biosimilar from Biogen to receive a marketing authorization in the EU.Benepali is doing quite well, generating sales of $154 million in the first half of 2017 while Flixabi recorded sales of $2.5 million in the same period.We note that earlier this year, Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) gained EU approval for Amgevita, its biosimilar version of Humira.Biogen’s shares have risen 0.6% this year so far while the industry recorded an increase of 7.9%.Biogen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

65,AMGN,"Sanofi, Inc. (SNY  -  Free Report) performed quite well in the first half of 2017 and looks well poised to carry on the momentum in the second half.While earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter, it met the same in the second. Earnings rose 4.9% on a reported basis in the first half of 2017 and 2.7% at constant currency rates (CER) on a year-over-year basis.First halfnet sales rose 8.7% on a reported basis and 5.5% at CER.  In Jan 2017, Sanofi swapped its Merial Animal Health businesses with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business. Reflecting this exchange and full consolidation of Sanofi’s European vaccines operations, sales rose 2% at constant structure and CER. We remind investors that Sanofi terminated its Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture with Merck& Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) in Europe in December last year.A strong performance by Genzyme’s Specialty Care (Genzyme) and Vaccines units is making up for an accelerated decline in the diabetes franchise to support the top line.In fact, at the second quarter conference call, Sanofi raised its previously issued profit outlookbacked by a better-than-expected performance in the first half and cost discipline despite a tough U.S. payer environment hurting sales in theDiabetesunit.Sanofi expects 2017 business earnings to be broadly flat at CER. This outlook compares favorably with the previous expectation of flat to down 3% at CER.So what will work in Sanofi’s favor in the second half?Continued strong performance of the Genzyme unit, especially the multiple sclerosis drugs, Aubagio and Lemtrada and the rare disease drugs like Myozyme/Lumizymeand Fabrazyme is a positive. The Vaccines unit is also expected to perform well. Sales (including emerging markets) rose 14.3% at CER in the Genzyme unit and 24.5% at CER in the Vaccines unit in the first half of 2017.Meanwhile, Sanofi, at the second quarter conference call, sounded quite optimistic about the sales prospects of its newly launched drug Dupixent for treating atopic dermatitis. The drug, which was launched in the U.S.in March 2017, generated sales of €26 million in the second quarter, backed by strong demand.Management waspleased with the drug’s uptake. We are optimistic on sales prospects of Dupixent, which could prove to be an important growth driver for the company. Other than Dupixent, other new drugs like Kevzara, launched in the U.S. in June 2017,and Soliqua, a once-daily titratable fixed-ratio combination of Lantus and Lyxumia, launched in the U.S. in January 2017,should also bring in higher sales in the back half of the year.However, management expects U.S. diabetes franchise sales to decline faster in the second half due to the impact of formulary exclusion at CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group and difficult comparisons from last year.U.S. diabetes sales declined 19.1% in the first half of 2017.Sanofi’s Diabetes franchise is under significant pressure with key product, Lantus, facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and biosimilar competition in several European markets and Japan.In the cardiovascular franchise, it also remains to be seen if sales trends of Sanofi’s anti PCSK9 therapy, Praluent improve in the second half. Uptake of PCSK9 inhibitors like Praluent and Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Repatha have been slower than expected due to significant payer utilization management restrictions in the U.S. and limited market access in Europe. Praluent’s uptake could remain limited until guidelines supporting broader use of the treatment are issued and phase III cardiovascular outcome study data are out.Also generic competition will continue to hurt sales of many key drugs in Sanofi’s portfolio including its blockbuster drug, Plavix.Despite these challenges, we believe that new drug approvals, a solid pipeline and aggressive savings will pave the way for growth in the second half.What Do the Numbers Say?So far this year, Sanofi’s share price has risen 22%, better than a 7.8% increase for the industry.The strong quarterly results and the back-to-back product approvals this year have led to an uptick in estimates as well. Sanofi’s earnings estimates for 2017 went up 2.5% while that for 2018 moved up 1.5% in the past 30 days. Sanofi’s earnings performance has also been pretty impressive, with the company reporting positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.10%.Sanofi carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

66,AMGN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) got a boost with the EU approving its key revenue driver Soliris for an additional indication. Meanwhile, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) was in the news with an investigation being launched into the rising prices of multiple sclerosis (""MS"") drugs. The investigation has been launched by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. Peter Welch with letters being sent to seven companies including Biogen requesting information about their pricing strategies for their MS drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEU Label Expansion for Alexion’s Soliris: Alexion’s flagship  product, Soliris, gained EU approval for the treatment of patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved in the EU for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. Alexion will launch Soliris for this indication initially in Germany and is evaluating additional EU launches.The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris and enables the company to enter the neurology therapeutic area. Soliris is currently under review in the U.S. and Japan (response expected early next year) for the gMG indication. With the EU granting approval, it looks like Soliris will gain approval in the U.S. as well where a decision is expected by Oct 23, 2017. According to information provided by the company, about 60,000 – 80,000 people in the U.S. suffer from myasthenia gravis (MG) – Alexion’s targeted population will be approximately 5%-10% of the total MG patient population. Results from a late-stage study (REGAIN) conducted by the company indicate that about 60% of these refractory gMG patients will respond to treatment with Soliris.Soliris is Alexion’s key growth driver with the drug bringing in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of 2017. The company expects Soliris revenues of $3,075 - $3,125 million in 2017, assuming the identification of a steady number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) across the globe (Also read: Alexion's Soliris' Label Expansion Approved in Europe).Alexion is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

According to the letter, four of these drugs have seen at least double-digit price increases since approval while the price of one drug has increased by almost 1,000%. Moreover, Zinbryta, was introduced at a price of $86,592 per annum in 2016 and the price of Biogen’s other four MS drugs were hiked to match Zinbryta’s price by 2017. Biogen will have to respond to the letter by Aug 31, 2017 (Also read: Biogen & 6 Other Multiple Sclerosis Drug Stocks in Focus: Here's Why).Pipeline Setback for Ultragenyx: Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE  -  Free Report), a company focused on developing treatments for rare and ultra-rare diseases, suffered a pipeline setback with one of its candidates failing in a late-stage study. Aceneuramic acid extended release (Ace-ER) failed to meet the primary as well as key secondary endpoints in a phase III study in patients with GNE myopathy (""GNEM""). Ultragenyx has decided to discontinue the development of Ace-ER.Ultragenyx currently has an investigational treatment under FDA review (vestronidase alpha for MPS 7 with a decision expected by Nov 16, 2017) while it is looking to file for FDA approval of burosumab (for X-linked hypophosphatemia) shortly.   FDA Nod for Ironwood Gout Drug: Ironwood Pharmaceuticals’ (IRWD  -  Free Report) once-daily gout treatment gained FDA approval. Duzallo has been approved for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. This makes Duzallo the first FDA-approved fixed-dose combination treatment available in a single pill for addressing both causes of hyperuricemia in gout - over-production and under-excretion of serum uric acid. Ironwood expects to launch the product in the fourth quarter. Ironwood expects Duzallo to drive sales of its gout franchise which is expected to deliver total annual peak sales of more than $300 million in the U.S. We note that Duzallo’s label includes a boxed warning about acute renal failure (Also read: Ironwood Pharma's Combination Gout Drug Gets FDA Approval).Alkermes Starts Rolling NDA Submission for MDD Drug: Alkermes (ALKS  -  Free Report) has started the rolling submission of a new drug application (NDA) for its investigational major depressive disorder (MDD) drug, ALKS 5461.

67,AMGN,"The second quarter earnings season is drawing to a close with 94.8% of S&P 500 stocks having reported results as of Aug 18, 2017. Thirteen of the 16 Zacks sectors recorded earnings growth with total earnings increasing 10.6% from the year-ago period on revenue growth of 5.6%. While 74.9% beat earnings estimates, 68.4% topped revenue expectations.  The Medical sector is one of the sectors to consistently record earnings growth over the last few quarters. The sector, which recorded earnings growth of 5.7% on revenue growth of 5.8% in Q1, has recorded earnings growth of 6.7% on the back of revenue growth of 4.3% so far in Q2. A look at the beat ratio shows earnings beat of 82.7% and revenue beat of 67.3%.Biotech stocks specifically fared pretty well with most of the key players topping earnings and revenue expectations. Quite a few companies raised their outlook for the year as well. Biotech stocks have had a strong run so far in 2017 with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index soaring 15% year-to-date (YTD). This is in sharp contrast to last year’s performance when the Index was down 19.1%. There were several reasons for the sector’s dismal performance last year foremost being the drug pricing controversy. Although drug pricing remains a headline risk this year as well, investors now seem to be more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are willing to look at the fundamentals of the sector.The FDA has also approved more drugs so far this year than it did in the whole of 2016. Last year, 22 drugs were approved while 28 have gained approval so far in 2017. Some of the drugs approved this year represent blockbuster potential.The second half of 2017 is expected to be catalyst rich for quite a few companies with data expected across a wide range of therapeutics areas. As far as mergers and acquisitions are concerned, we do not expect much activity in this area given the “wait and watch” stance adopted by most companies regarding the drug pricing situation and tax reforms. Another deterrent could be high valuations with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over-priced deals.However, licensing deals should continue especially in orphan and rare disease areas as well as highly sought after therapeutic areas like immune-oncology.Our ChoicesHere is a look at four biotech stocks that delivered positive earnings surprises in the second quarter and are witnessing upward revisions in earnings estimates for 2017. All these companies are either Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): New Haven, CT-based Alexion delivered a “beat and raise” quarter with flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) continuing to perform well. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label and has a key catalyst coming up with a decision from the FDA expected by Oct 23, 2017, regarding the approvability of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). Alexion got a boost this week with Soliris gaining EU approval for this indication making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion, which had a rough 2016 with shares falling 35.9%, looks set to recover lost ground with shares increasing 9.1% so far in 2017, outperforming the 4.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. The efforts of the company’s new management team to turn things around are impressive. Alexion is redefining its R&D strategy with a focus on its key expertise areas. The company will continue to grow its rare diseases business which includes growing Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma. To increase productivity, Alexion will focus its internal research efforts on its complement expertise and its development efforts on its core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. The company has also decided to de-prioritize certain pipeline candidates and is discontinuing its preclinical programs with mRNA therapies as well as other preclinical programs that do not fall within the complement franchise. Alexion, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 5.3% upward over the last 30 days.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report): Tarrytown, NY-based Regeneron's key areas of focus include eye diseases, heart disease, allergic and inflammatory diseases, pain, cancer, infectious diseases and rare diseases. While eye drug, Eylea, the company’s key growth driver continues to perform well, Regeneron has been working on diversifying its portfolio and gained FDA approval for two drugs this year - Dupixent (moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis) and Kevzara (moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis). Both drugs have blockbuster potential.The company also has a strong pipeline and has an eventful second half of the year coming up with key mid-to-late stage pipeline catalysts lined up. Top-line phase III data on Dupixent for asthma are due later this quarter – positive data would allow the company to go ahead with a U.S. filing in the fourth quarter. Dupixent should also gain EU approval for the eczema indication in the third quarter. Regeneron is evaluating Dupixent in the pediatric atopic dermatitis setting. Another important data readout scheduled for the second half of the year is on the company’s PD-1 antibody REGN2810, for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Positive data would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, Eylea is being evaluated in combination with nesvacumab. Top-line data from two phase II studies - one in wet age-related macular degeneration and another in diabetic macular edema - are expected in the fourth quarter of the year.Regeneron has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 15.2% upward over the last 30 days. Regeneron, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 27.9% year to date, substantially outperforming the 4.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report): Foster City, CA-based Gilead is well known for its presence in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV markets. Gilead topped estimates in the second quarter with its HCV business doing better than expected in the U.S. The company said that HCV patient starts in the first six months were better than originally expected. Moreover, the launch of an educational campaign in Oct 2016 to encourage testing of baby boomers has led to an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers, which in turn has led to an increase in diagnosis. The company’s HIV franchise also continues to do well and the company is progressing with its pipeline that includes treatments under evaluation for cancer, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and inflammatory diseases. Gilead raised its outlook for the year. Gilead has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised almost 7% upward over the last 30 days. Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 stock.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report): San Diego, CA-based Ligand’s business model is based on developing or acquiring royalty revenue generating assets and coupling them with a lean corporate cost structure. The company is focused on the development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets. Ligand’s Captisol formulation technology has allowed it to enter into several licensing deals and generate royalties. The company’s partners include big names like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) among others. Ligand also has licensing deals based on its OmniAb technology.Ligand has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised almost 10.4% upward over the last 30 days. Ligand, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 24.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 4.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

68,AMGN,"On Aug 14, 2017, we issued an updated report on Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report).Ligand’s Captisol formulation technology platform has allowed it to enter into partnerships with several leading drug companies like Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), providing it with funds in the form of milestone and royalty payments. Royalties depend on the sales of its two key partnered assets – Novartis’ Kyprolis and Amgen’s Promacta.Ligand receives royalties and milestone payments for several FDA-approved products that uses its Captisol technology. Latest product approvals include Spectrum’s Evomela, Lundbeck’s Carnexiv and Melinta Therapeutics’ Baxdela. Apart from these, several other candidates are in late-stage development and is expected to bring in royalties for the company once commercialized.In July, the company announced that it has entered into another commercial license and supply agreement with Amgen, granting it with rights to use Captisol in the formulation of its anti-CD33 x anti-CD3 (BiTE) bispecific antibody, AMG 330. Under the agreement terms, Ligand is entitled to potential milestone payments, royalties and revenues from the future sales of AMG 330.Regarding the company’s internal pipeline, various candidates are being developed for indications like diabetes. One of the most advanced candidates is LGD-6972, presently undergoing a phase II study for treatment of type II diabetes. Data from this trial is awaited in the second half of 2017 with potential to bring in future licensing opportunities.Nonetheless, Ligand’s entry into the Medical Devices Segment with the acquisition of multiple programs owned by CorMatrix is also encouraging.However, Ligand obtains Captisol from a single supplier, Hovione – a major global supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug product intermediates, located in Portugal. Any interruption in Captisol’s supply would hit the company’s results.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

69,AMGN,"We issued an updated research report on Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) on Aug 14.The leading biotech beat estimates on both earnings & sales in the second quarter, the results of which were announced on Jul 25. While Amgen slightly tightened the sales guidance, it raised the earnings outlook backed by its strong performance in the first half.Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva,Kyprolis,Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well backed by strong demand.Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline including biosimilar drugs. Important pipeline candidates include Aimovig/erenumab (prevention of migraine – under review in the U.S.), CNP520 (BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease – phase III) and omecamtiv mecarbil (heart failure – phase III).Amgen has 10 biosimilars in its pipeline. The company has collaborated with Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) for the worldwide development and commercialization of three oncology antibody biosimilar medicines – Roche’s Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan.However, the company has some challenges in store given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products. Volume growth of new products may not be enough to offset the lost sales due to the decline in mature brands like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.While Neulasta sales are being hurt by competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies, Neupogen sales are going down due to biosimilar competition in the U.S. from Zarxio. Zarxio is Sandoz’s (Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm) biosimilar version of Neupogen, which was launched in the U.S. in Sep 2015The company expects Neulasta and Neupogen sales to continue to be hurt by competitive dynamic through the rest of 2017. Meanwhile, Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition next year.Also the softness in Enbrel’s sales due to stiff competitive pressure is a key cause of concern. Pricing pressure and stiff competition are hurting sales of Enbrel, one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues this year.Meanwhile, uptake of Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent.In the second quarter, however, the company did notice some improving share trends for the drug, following the presentation of the outcomes study (FOURIER) data in March this year. The data showed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes. The company filed regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in Jun 2017 with a FDA decision expected on Dec 2, 2017.Lastly, Amgen has had its share of pipeline setbacks. The latest being the complete response letter (CRL) received from the FDA for Evenity/romosozumab (osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture) in July, following the heart-related safety issue that emerged from the otherwise successful ARCH results. The FDA asked for safety and efficacy data from two pivotal phase III studies - ARCH and BRIDGE - to be included in the original application, which was filed only on the basis of the pivotal FRAME study.  This will lead to a delay in the drug’s approval.Amgen Inc.

72,AMGN,"Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 74 cents per American depositary share, which were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings rose 3.1% on a reported basis and 1.5% at constant currency rates (CER).Second-quarter net sales rose 6.4% on a reported basis and 5.5% at CER to almost $9.52 billion (€8.66 billion). Sales, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.98 billion. Sales benefitted from favorable exchange rate movements of 0.9%. In Jan 2017, the French drug maker swapped its Merial Animal Health businesses with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business. Reflecting this exchange and full consolidation of Sanofi’s European vaccines operations, sales rose 0.6% at constant structure and CER.Sales declined 1% at CER in the U.S. as a strong performance of multiple sclerosis drugs and vaccines could not make up for weak diabetes performance. Sales rose 10.2% in Emerging Markets, 6.8% in Europe and 10.3% in the Rest of the World (Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico) market.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at CER.Segmental PerformancePharmaceuticals sales (including emerging markets) increased 3.2% to €7.65 billion driven by growth in multiple sclerosis and consumer healthcare franchises, which offset a decline in diabetes and generics sales.Sanofi reports through five Global Business Units (GBUs) – Sanofi Genzyme (Specialty Care), Diabetes & Cardiovascular, General Medicines & Emerging Markets, Consumer Healthcare and Sanofi Pasteur (Vaccines).Sanofi Genzyme/Specialty Care GBU sales (including emerging markets) increased 13.5% to €1.71 billion, driven mainly by strong uptake of multiple sclerosis drugs, Aubagio (up 32.7% to €425 million) and Lemtrada (up 13.9% to €124 million).Meanwhile, sales of rare disease drugs like Myozyme/Lumizyme improved 10.4% to €203 million while Fabrazyme sales were €190 million, up 12%. Cerdelga sales came in at €31 million, up 19.2%. However, Cerezyme sales declined this quarter by 2% to €193 million due to difficult year-ago comparisons.Oncology sales rose 4.4% to €383 million driven mainly by higher sales of Jevtana and Thymoglobulin. Jevtana sales were up 12.5% to €100 million while Thymoglobulin recorded sales of €76, up 8.7%. Taxotere sales declined 6.5% to €44 million due to generic competition in Japan. Eloxatin sales were flat at €45 million.Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (REGN  -  Free Report), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Kevzara (sarilumab) was launched in the U.S. in June and approved in Canada in Feb 2017 and in the EU in Jun 2017.  Kevzara recorded sales of €1 million in the second quarter.Meanwhile, Dupixent, launched in March in the U.S. for treating atopic dermatitis, generated sales of €26 million in the second quarter. Management is pleased with the drug’s uptake and  said that in the U.S., the drug has been prescribed by over 5,100 physicians. Dupixent is under review in the EU and received positive recommendation from a European Medicines Agency panel earlier this month. The drugs generated total immunology sales of €27 million in the second quarter.Diabetes and Cardiovascular GBU (including emerging markets) declined 10.7% to €1.77 billion. The Diabetes franchise (including emerging markets) declined 12.2% to €1.65 billion due to lower sales of key drug Lantus.Sales of diabetes drugs in the U.S. declined 23% to €814 million due to a tough U.S. payer environment. Sales of diabetes drugs in Emerging Markets were up 8.4% while in Europe it declined 3%.Lantus sales declined 19.2% to €1.20 billion in the quarter. Lantus sales declined 28.1% in the U.S. due to lower average net price and CVS/United Health formulary exclusion while in Europe sales declined 14% due to biosimilar competition and patient switching to Toujeo.Toujeo generated sales of €210 million, up 9.4% sequentially in the reported quarter.Management warned that U.S. diabetes franchise sales will decline faster in the second half due to exclusion from the CVS and United Health formulary plans and difficult comparisons from last year.Soliqua, a once-daily titratable fixed-ratio combination of Lantus and Lyxumia, launched in the U.S. in Jan 2017, generated sales of €5 million in the second quarter compared with €4 million in the previous quarter.In the cardiovascular franchise, Sanofi’s anti PCSK9 therapy, Praluent garnered worldwide sales of €42 million in the reported quarter, up 23.5% sequentially. Incidentally Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), which reported earlier this week, also reported a sequential increase in sales of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Uptake of these drugs has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions.General Medicines & Emerging Markets GBU sales came in at €3.66 billion, down 1.2%. Sales of Established products were €2.56 billion, down 2.3% as strong performance in emerging markets was offset by generic competition of Plavix in Japan (Plavix lost exclusivity in Japan in 2015) and lower sales in Europe.Sales of Generics declined 8% to €442 million as sales declined in Europe, U.S. as well as Emerging Markets.Consumer Healthcare GBU sales were €1.16 billion, up 42.5%. However, sales were flat excluding acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim’s Consumer Healthcare business, as lower sales in Europe due to an early cough and cold season in the first quarter were partially offset by higher sales in the U.S. (driven by the Pain and Allergy portfolios) and higher sales in Emerging Markets (due to a sales recovery in Russia).Second-quarter consolidated Sanofi Pasteur (Vaccines) sales increased 26.2% to €1.02 billion due to the strong performance of pediatric combinations and Menactra. Vaccines sales reflect the termination of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint-venture with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) in Europe from Dec 2016.Costs RiseSelling general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 6.1% at CER in the quarter, reflecting launch costs of Dupixent, Kevzara and Xyzal. R&D expenses were up 5.1% at CER, reflecting higher pipeline development costs in oncology (isatixumab, PD-1) and sotagliflozin.2017 OutlookSanofi raised its previously issued financial outlook.Sanofi expects 2017 business earnings to be broadly flat at CER. This outlook compares favorably with the previous expectations of flat to down 3% at CER. It anticipates positive currency impact in a range of 1% on business earnings in 2017.Our TakeSanofi’s second-quarter 2017 results were not that great as it reported in-line earnings and missed sales expectations by a slight margin. However, shares rose more than 2% in pre-market trading in response to the raised earnings forecast and the optimism surrounding Dupixent launch.In fact, so far this year, Sanofi’s share price has risen 17.6%, better than a 10.5% increase for the industry.We are encouraged by the strong performance of MS drugs like Aubagio and Lemtrada. We are also optimistic on sales prospects of Dupixent, which could prove to be an important growth driver for the company.However, headwinds include a bleak outlook for the Diabetes franchise, generic competition for many drugs and slower-than-expected uptake of new products like Praluent.Sanofi currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

74,AMGN,"The biotech sector was in focus with regular pipeline updates. The key stories include bigwig Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) getting approval for its HIV drug Biktarvy in Europe and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI  -  Free Report) soaring on positive CHMP recommendation, while Merrimack (MACK  -  Free Report) plunged on the failure of its phase II study in pancreatic cancer.Recap of Important StoriesGilead’s Biktarvy Gets EC Approval: Gilead announced that the European Commission has granted Marketing Authorization to HIV combination therapy Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg; BIC/FTC/TAF). Biktarvy is approved as a once-daily single tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval was supported by positive data from four ongoing phase III studies, namely Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. With this approval, BIC/FTC/TAF becomes Gilead’s third FTC/TAF-based STR approved in the European Union in three years. BIC/FTC/TAF met its primary objective at 48 weeks in all four studies.The regimen was earlier approved by the FDA in February 2018. The approval in Europe will further strengthen the company’s HIV franchise. (Read more: Gilead's Biktarvy Gets EC Nod for HIV- 1 Infection)Merrimack Plunges on Study Failure:  Shares of Merrimack plunged after the company reported disappointing results from the phase II study in front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer. The phase II trial, CARRIE, evaluated the addition of MM-141 to standard-of-care treatment in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer and high serum levels of free Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1).  The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival, while secondary endpoints included objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and overall survival and safety.Merrimack reported that the study did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints in patients, who received MM-141 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and Gemzar, compared with nab-paclitaxel and Gemzar alone. Subsequently, Merrimack has terminated the development of MM-141. With the sale of Onivyde, the company was back to being a development-stage biopharmaceutical company and was banking on its three pipeline candidates to boost its growth prospects. Hence, the failure of the CARRIE study came as a huge disappointment for its investors, given the limited number of candidates in the pipeline. Consequently, the company now plans to focus on the other two candidates in its pipeline, MM-121 and MM-310. (Read more: Merrimack Crashes as Phase II Pancreatic Cancer Study Fails)Amgen's Presents Encouraging Data on Repatha: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from the phase III study, BANTING, which showed that its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, significantly reduced bad cholesterol in patients, with type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, who have already undergone moderate/high-intensity statin therapy. The study evaluated monthly subcutaneous administration of a 420 mg dose of Repatha over a period of 12 weeks in patients with type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, who are on optimized background statin therapy. The results from the study showed that the addition of Repatha to background statin therapy significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C).Data from the BANTING study also revealed that 84.5% of patients in the Repatha arm achieved LDL-C levels of less than 70 mg/dL, which is the recommended level by the American College of Clinical Endocrinologists for patients with type II diabetes compared with 15.4% of patients in placebo arm at week 12.

The MAA is seeking approval of the drug as extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage HER2-positive hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The news boosted investor sentiment as the CHMP had adopted a negative opinion on the MAA in February 2018. The positive opinion from the CHMP indicates an imminent tentative approval. The drug was approved by the FDA in July 2017 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early-stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer, following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy.Incyte Announces Positive Results on Jakafi for GVHD: Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the phase II trial, REACH1, evaluating lead drug Jakafi in combination with corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), met its primary endpoint. The data from the study showed that Jakafi demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% at day 28.Moreover, the number of patients showing a response at any point of time, during the study, was 73%. Propelled by positive data from the REACH 1 study, Incyte now plans to file a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) with the FDA, for the label expansion of Jakafi, for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD, during the third quarter of 2018.

75,AMGN,"Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 therapy, for review. The company is seeking approval of the blockbuster drug as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of patients with resected, high-risk stage III melanoma. A decision is expected by Feb 16, 2019.This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 8.5% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4.9%.The sBLA includes data from pivotal EORTC1325/KEYNOTE-054 study, which demonstrated that Keytruda achieved significant increase in recurrence free survival (“RFS”) after surgery compared to placebo in the patient population. Recurrence free survival was achieved in 75.4% of the patients treated with Keytruda over a year, compared to 61% for placebo. The drug also reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 43% over placebo.Merck has claimed that Keytruda is the first anti-PD1 therapy to achieve RFS benefit in stage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC melanoma patients. The drug has achieved RFS benefit in patients irrespective of BRAF-mutation.We remind investors that the drug is already approved for seven types of cancer indications in several settings including first-line melanoma and recently approved cervical cancer and large-cell lymphoma. Keytruda garnered sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year.Sales of the drug were particularly boosted by the strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. It is the only approved anti-PD-1 therapy as a monotherapy or in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin.Merck is focused on further developing this successful drug in other indications. Keytruda is being evaluated in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies for more than 30 types of cancer. The company has collaborated with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck & Co., Inc.

76,AMGN,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced new data from the phase III study — BANTING — which showed that its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, significantly reduced bad cholesterol in patients with type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia already receiving moderate/high-intensity statin therapy. The data was presented at Annual Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association over the weekend.According to the data from the BANTING study, the addition of Repatha to background statin therapy significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C). Notably, LDL-C was reduced by 53.1% at week 12 from baseline in the patient population.So far this year, Amgen’s shares have gained 6.5%, comparing favorably with the industry’s 5.7% decrease.The BANTING study evaluated monthly subcutaneous administration of a 420 mg dose of Repatha over a period of 12-weeks in patients with type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia who are on optimized background statin therapy.The encouraging data from the study shows that patients with type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, who are already treated with a maximum tolerable dose of statin therapy, can further reduce LDL-C and non-HDL-C by adding Repatha.Data from the BANTING study also revealed that 84.5% of patients in the Repatha arm achieved LDL-C levels of less than 70 mg/dL, which is the recommended level by American College of Clinical Endocrinologists for patients with type II diabetes, compared with 15.4% of patients in placebo arm at week 12. The addition of Repatha too reduced various lipid parameters, including non-HDL-C by 47% compared with 1% for placebo.High non-HDL-C levels can cause cardiovascular events in type II diabetes patients, which in combination with LDL-C increases the risk further.We remind investors that Repatha’s label was expanded in Europe last month to include prevention of heart attack and stroke in adults with established cardiovascular disease. The encouraging data from BANTING study further brightens the prospect of the drug in reducing cardiovascular events in presumably larger patient population.Another PCSK9 inhibitor available in the market is Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (REGN  -  Free Report) Praluent. Currently, both the drugs have recorded lower-than-expected sales due to higher pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions.Amgen Inc. Price  Amgen Inc. Price | Amgen Inc.

77,AMGN,"Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the phase III study, IMpower133, on immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq, met its co-primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at its first interim analysis for the indication of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).The study enrolled 403 people who were randomised equally (1:1) to receive either Tecentriq in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (Arm A), or placebo in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (Arm B, control arm).The results of the study showed that initial (first-line) treatment with the combination of Tecentriq and chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) enabled patients with ES-SCLC live significantly longer compared to chemotherapy alone.  The combination also reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone.IMpower133 met its OS and PFS co-primary endpoints as per the study protocol. At present, Roche has eight ongoing phase III lung cancer studies, which are evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other drugs. Among these, this is the fourth phase III study, evaluating Tecentriq combination study, to come out with data and the fifth one to demonstrate positive results.We note that Tecentriq is already approved in the United States and European Union for patients with previously-treated metastatic NSCLC and for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC), who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy or who have had disease progression during or following platinum-containing therapy.Roche plans to submit the data to the regulatory bodies. Per the company, IMpower133 is the first phase III study with an immunotherapy-based combination to show improvement in OS and PFS in the initial treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) which increases the likelihood of a potential approval.The label expansion of the drug will boost sales.Meanwhile, the FDA has accepted for priority review of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) supplemental Biologics License Application for Opdivo for the indication of SCLC, whose disease has progressed after two or more prior lines of therapy. The FDA’s action date is Aug 16, 2018.Hence, competition will be stiff in the SCLC market for Roche.Roche’s stock has lost 9.3% so far this year, as against the industry's decline of 2.5%. Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin and MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe.  Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

78,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) shares have performed well this year so far in contrast to its industry’s performance. Merck belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which is a 14-stock group comprising some of the largest drugmakers of the world.The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry has underperformed the S&P 500 as well the Zacks Medical Sector. While the stocks in this industry have collectively declined 4.4%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and the Zacks Medical Sector have risen 3.7% and 0.1% year to date, respectively. However, Merck’s shares have risen 8.4% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 4.4%. Also, earnings estimates for 2018 rose 1.2% while that for 2019 rose 4.1% over the past 60 days.What’s Behind the Rally?A significant part of Merck’s outperformance this year was driven by strong performance and positive regulatory updates related to its PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda. In a very short span of time, Keytruda has become Merck’s largest product. It is already approved for use in 10 different settings involving seven different tumor types. This year, it has already gained approval for two new indications. These include third-line treatment of adult as well as pediatric patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. These label expansion approvals should drive sales of Keytruda in the future quarters.The treatment generated sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year. This upside was driven by the global launch of indications, which further boosted demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. In fact, Keytruda is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).At the recently concluded annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, this PD-L1 inhibitor stole the limelight with encouraging data from multiple clinical studies. The data presentation from Merck that garnered the most attention from physicians and investors was from a second interim analysis of a pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE-407 study.Keytruda is also being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Other than that, this year Merck and partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) gained approval in Europe and Japan for its PARP inhibitor Lynparza for advanced ovarian cancer and in the United States in metastatic breast cancer. Merck also announced positive data from several late-stage studies, mainly evaluating Keytruda for further line extensions. Merck also signed a deal with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd to jointly develop and commercialize the latter’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima, both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Keytruda, for several types of cancer. It also agreed to buy Viralytics Limited, an Australian pharmaceutical company that develops oncolytic immunotherapies for a range of cancers,which should strengthen its oncology portfolio.ConclusionMerck, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has its share of challenges in the form of generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure and rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and on products like Isentress (HIV), Zepatier (HCV) and Zostavax (vaccine)Nonetheless, going forward, new products like Keytruda, Lynparza, and Bridion should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line in 2018. Merck’s Animal Health unit is also strong and remains a core growth driver for the company. Meanwhile, Merck will also continue to focus on cost-cutting initiatives, which should drive its bottom line.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

79,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that it has received European Commission’s (EC) approval to include overall survival (OS) data from the TOWER study on the label of its BiTE antibody, Blincyto.Blincyto is approved for treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The TOWER study was conducted to support the conversion of Blincyto's accelerated approval to full approval. The study evaluated the efficacy of Blincyto versus standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy for the treatment of Ph- relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in adults.Results from a late-stage study showed that median overall survival for patients on Blincyto was 7.7 months compared with 4 months for standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy.Blincyto’s label in the United States already includes OS data from the TOWER study following the approval received from the FDA in July last year. In fact, the inclusion of the OS data has been instrumental in driving sales of the drug higher in the past two quarters. Blincyto sales surged 44% from the year-ago period to $49 million in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting a rise in demandThe inclusion of the OS data on the European label of the drug should further boost sales.We remind investors that Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Besponsa was approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in June last year in the EU, increasing competition for Blincyto.Amgen’s shares have gained 5.8% so far this year against a 7.2% decrease registered by the industry. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

80,AMGN,"The biotech sector was in focus with regular pipeline updates. While Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT  -  Free Report) and Solid Biosciences (SLDB  -  Free Report) gained on positive data, Anika Therapeutics, Inc. (ANIK  -  Free Report) and Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. (ZIOP  -  Free Report) declined on dismal results.Recap of Important StoriesSarepta, Solid Biosciences Surge:  The going has been good for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) market. Shares of Sarepta surged significantly after the company reported impressive preliminary results from its phase I/IIa gene therapy trial assessing AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-Dystrophin in individuals with DMD. The biopsies performed at the end of day 90 showed robust micro-dystrophin expression in muscle measured by all methods and observed in all three patients. The patients enrolled also showed a significant decrease in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, with a mean reduction of CK of over 87% at Day 60. (Read more:Sarepta's Stock Soars on Encouraging Gene Therapy Results).Earlier, Solid Biosciences’ shares surged too after the company announced that the FDA has lifted the clinical hold on its phase I/II trial, IGNITE DMD, for its experimental candidate, SGT-001. Notably, SGT-001, Solid Biosciences’ lead candidate, is a microdystrophin gene transfer, which is being evaluated for the treatment of DMD.  The clinical hold was lifted as the FDA acknowledged that Solid Biosciences has satisfactorily addressed all the issues raised. (Read more: Solid Surges as FDA Lifts Clinical Hold on DMD Drug).Alexion Submits BLA for ALXN1210: Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced that the company has submitted the Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for approval of its experimental long-acting C5 complement inhibitor, ALXN1210, for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Since the submission is for a rare disease using a priority review voucher, the BLA is entitled to an eight-month review by the FDA instead of the standard 12-month review. Alexion’s lead drug, Soliris, is already approved for PNH and a tentative approval of ALXN1210 will give a significant boost to the company. ALXN1210 had earlier achieved non-inferiority to Soliris in complement inhibitor treatment-naive patients with PNH based on the co-primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and normalization of LDH levels in a phase III study wherein ALXN1210 was administered intravenously every eight weeks.Alexion carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The 16-02 trial compared Cingal, a combination of cross-linked HA and triamcinolone hexacetonide (TH), with TH alone and cross-linked HA in treating patients with osteoarthritis in the knee. The primary endpoint was a comparison of the pain reduction when treated with Cingal compared with only TH at 26 weeks. However, the results did not show any statistical significance even though Cingal achieved greater pain reduction numerically at every time point in the study. Cingal is Anika’s third-generation visco supplement, along with Orthovisc and Monovisc products, to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee.Ziopharm Oncology Plunges As FDA Places Clinical Hold on CAR T Therapy:  Shares of Ziopharm Oncology declined after the FDA placed a clinical hold on its phase I trial evaluating CD19-specific CAR-T therapies manufactured under point-of-care. The FDA has requested additional information relative to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls in support of the investigational new drug (IND) application for the trial.  The therapy is being evaluated as an investigational treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory, CD19+ leukemias and lymphomas.Amgen Got European Nod For Addition of Data to Blincyto: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted a full marketing authorization for Blincyto (blinatumomab) based on encouraging overall survival (OS) data from the phase III study, TOWER, in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Results showed that Blincyto demonstrated a superior improvement in median OS over standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy. Median OS was 7.7 months for Blincyto versus four months for SOC.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 1.02% over the last five trading sessions.

81,AMGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that it will discontinue the phase III study evaluating its key pipeline candidate, fremanezumab for the treatment of chronic cluster headache. This decision was based on data from a pre-specified futility analysis of the study, which showed that the study is unlikely to meet its primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in the monthly average number of cluster headache attacks over a 12-week period.The ENFORCE Phase III clinical development program comprised the chronic cluster headache study, an episodic cluster headache analysis and a long-term safety study.Notably, evaluation of the patients with chronic cluster headache in the long-term safety study will also be stopped. However, the study on episodic cluster headache will not be affected and carried out as planned.Fremanezumab, an anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (“CGRP”) candidate, is currently under review in the United States and Europe for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults as a quarterly or monthly injection. However in May, the company announced that the FDA has postponed the action date from June to September.Shares of the company slipped 0.8% including after-hours trading on Jun 15. However, the stock has rallied 25.4% so far this year compared with the industry’s increase of 2.2%. Teva is focused on developing fremanezumab beyond migraine for indications like cluster headache and post traumatic headache disorder.We saw Alder Biopharmaceuticals Inc’s (ALDR  -  Free Report) share price rise 6.7% on Friday following the news of Teva’s decision to suspend the cluster headache study. We note that Alder is also developing an anti-CGRP candidate, eptinezumab, for the preventive treatment of migraine. The candidate is being evaluated in pivotal study with a Biologics License Application expected to be filed with the FDA during the first quarter of 2019.Meanwhile, several other companies are developing treatments for treating migraine, a multi-billion dollar segment with high unmet need. In May, the FDA approved Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) anti-CGRP drug, Aimovig, for treating episodic migraine. Other anti-CGRP candidates under development include Eli Lilly’s galcanezumab and Allergan’s atogepant.Galcanezumab is under review in the United States for preventive treatment of migraine.

82,AMGN,"Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from the final analysis of the CLL11 study, evaluating Gazyva-based treatment in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).The phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized three-arm study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of Gazyva in combination with chlorambucil compared to MabThera in combination with chlorambucil or chlorambucil alone, in nearly 800 patients with previously untreated CLL and comorbidities.The final results, after a follow-up of almost five years, showed clinically meaningful improvements with Gazyva plus chlorambucil across multiple endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), when compared head-to-head with Rituxan plus chlorambucil.These long-term data confirm Gazyva’s efficacy to extend the lives of patients suffering from CLL, compared to that of MabThera/Rituxan.Gazyva-based treatment reduced the risk of death by 24% compared to MabThera/Rituxan-based treatment. Gazyva is approved in combination with chlorambucil, for patients with previously untreated CLL.Roche is a leader in the oncology market with a wide portfolio of drugs for breast cancer and CLL among others.Additionally, Roche announced new data on multiple sclerosis (MS) drug, Ocrevus, which will be presented at the 4th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) from Jun 16-19 in Lisbon, Portugal.The data from a new exploratory analysis, from the extended control period of the phase III study, ORATORIO, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) patients, showed that Ocrevus may significantly delay the time to need a wheelchair by seven years, as measured by the length of time until a person reaches Expanded Disability Status Scale seven or greater (EDSS≥7), using 24-week confirmed disability progression (CDP).Patients, treated with Ocrevus, showed a 46% reduction in the risk of progressing to a wheelchair compared to the placebo-treated group. The analysis also showed that the placebo-treated patient population studied in Oratorio had similar disability progression rates to an untreated real-world PPMS population. The extrapolated median time to wheelchair (EDSS≥7) for placebo-treated people in the Oratorio study was 12.1 years.The longer-term efficacy and safety data are consistent with the drug’s favourable benefit-risk profile, for both PPMS and relapsing MS (RMS).In addition, a new global study, FLOODLIGHT Open, is now enrolling patients in the United States. The study uses proprietary FLOODLIGHT mobile technology to collect and monitor anonymized patient data to help gain a better understanding of MS disease progression. The study is an observational, open access study aimed to enroll 10,000 people globally, including people with relapsing and progressive forms of MS, within five years.Roche will be initiating two new phase IIIb studies of Ocrevus in 2018.While the MS market holds immense potential, competition is stiff with the likes of Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report).Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche, as its legacy drugs like Herceptin and MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Roche’s stock has lost 12.7% in the last six months compared with industry’s’ decline of 3.1%.  Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

83,AMGN,"Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion for its oncology drug Avastin (bevacizumab). The FDA approved Avastin in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), followed by Avastin as a single agent, for the treatment of women with advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer following initial surgical resection.The approval is based on data from the phase III GOG-0218 study. The study showed that women who received Avastin in combination with chemotherapy, and continued use of Avastin alone, had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 18.2 months compared to 12 months in women who received chemotherapy alone.Year to date, shares of the company have decreased 16.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.5%. With this approval, Avastin is now approved for 10 distinct uses across six different types of cancer in the United States. Avastin is approved in Europe for the treatment of advanced stages of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer and cervical cancer, and is available in the United States for the treatment of colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, cervical cancer, recurrent, platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, and recurrent glioblastoma. Avastin is one of the leading drugs in Roche’s portfolio. However, sales of Avastin fell 2% in the first quarter of 2018 due to increasing use of cancer immunotherapy medicines in lung cancer.Stiff competition from biosimilars looms large for Avastin. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.

84,AMGN,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) has received FDA’s accelerated approval for label expansion of its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, to include advanced cervical cancer in second-line setting. The company will need to evaluate the drug in confirmatory studies in this indication for gaining continued approval.The eligible patients for the treatment in cervical cancer will be selected based on an FDA-approved test for PD-L1 expression in tumors with combined positive score (“CPS”) ≥1.The approval comes a bit earlier than the expected date of Jun 28. The FDA had granted priority review to this label expansion regulatory application in March.Keytruda is the most successful immuno-oncology drug to date with approval in several cancer indications including the lucrative first-line lung cancer. This is the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in advanced cervical cancer and the first indication for Keytruda in gynecologic cancer as well.This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 10.9% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4.4%.  The latest FDA approval is based on data from a single cohort of a multi-cohort phase II study – KEYNOTE-158 – evaluating the drug in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Data from a subset of patient population expressing PD-L1 with a CPS ≥1 showed that Keytruda achieved an objective response rate of 14.3%. Moreover, 2.6% of the patients achieved a complete response and 11.7% of patients demonstrated partial response.The drug generated no response in cervical cancer patients whose PD-L1 expression in tumors had a CPS <1.Merck is evaluating the drug in a wide range of cancer indications and treatment settings in more than 750 clinical studies.At the recently concluded annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, this PD-L1 inhibitor stole the limelight with encouraging data from multiple clinical studies. The data presentation, which garnered attention from physicians and investors, was from a second interim analysis of a pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE-407 study.Moreover, Merck has collaborated with several pharma companies, including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Incyte, to evaluate Keytruda in combination with other regimens.The drug generated worldwide sales of almost $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2018, up 150% from the year-ago period. With this line extension approval in cervical cancer and potential approvals in other indications under review, the positive momentum of the drug is expected to continue in 2018.Merck & Co., Inc.

86,AMGN,"Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (“CGRP”) candidate, atogepant, met the primary endpoint in the phase II part of the phase IIb/III study. The CGP-MD-01 study was evaluating oral dosages of the candidate for the acute treatment of episodic migraine.Meanwhile, the company has another anti-CGRP candidate, ubrogepant, in its pipeline that demonstrated positive results in two phase III studies, evaluating it for the treatment of single migraine attack. The positive data readouts from the CGP-MD-01 study boosts the company’s anti-CGRP pipeline. The company is currently in discussion with regulatory authorities, following which it will advance atogepant to phase III stage of development.Allergan’s shares have increased 4.5% this year so far against the industry’s rise of 1.2%.The CGP-MD-01 study evaluated 5 doses of atogepant — once daily 10mg, 30mg and 60mg, and twice daily 30mg and 60mg — for the prevention of episodic migraine over 12 weeks. Atogepant achieved a reduction of statistical significance in monthly migraine/probable migraine (“MPM”) headache days from baseline for all doses.Allergan will present additional details at upcoming scientific meetings.Moreover, a potential approval for these candidates will boost the company’s migraine product line, which includes Botox for the treatment of chronic migraine. The oral administration will also help ubrogepant and atogepant gain an advantage over other injectable drugs, if approved.Meanwhile, the migraine space is attracting lot of interest due to its high unmet need. Several companies are developing treatments for this disease. In May, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) received approval for commercializing their anti-CGRP drug, Aimovig, for treating episodic migraine. Other anti-CGRP candidates under development include Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) galcanezumab, Teva Pharmaceutical’s fremanezumab and Alder BioPharmaceuticals’ eptinezumab. Galcanezumab and fremanezumab are under review in the United States.Migarine is a multi-billion dollar market with approximately 36 million people in the United States suffering from it.

87,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval to include the positive overall survival data in multiple myeloma from the late-stage ASPIRE study in Kyprolis label.Final data from the phase III ASPIRE study presented in July last year showed that a triple combination regimen of Kyprolis significantly improved overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.Overall survival data from the study showed that patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma lived 7.9 months longer when treated with Kyprolis plus Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (KRd ) compared to those treated with Revlimid and dexamethasone (Rd) (median OS of 48.3 months for KRd versus median OS of 40.4 months for Rd). The data also showed that KRd reduced the risk of death by 21% compared to Rd.While Kyprolis, a proteasome inhibitor, is already approved for use in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, the overall survival data should help drive usage and boost sales.Amgen’s shares have gained 6.2% so far this year against the 6.8% decrease registered by the industry.A similar application is also under review in the EU. In April, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted a positive opinion recommending inclusion of the OS data from the ASPIRE study in the label of Kyprolis.In early 2018, Amgen gained FDA approval to include overall survival data from the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study on the label of KyprolisWith the approval to include OS results from ASPIRE study, Kyprolis label now includes OS data from two phase III studies which should drive sales of the drug in future quarters.Kyprolis has become a key revenue driver for Amgen. The drug recorded sales of $222 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing growth of 17% year over year, driven by increased demand and a robust uptake from outside U.S. markets.Kyprolis represents significant commercial potential. Sales are likely to be driven by launch in additional countries, expansion into additional indications and a longer duration of treatment.Amgen also has a collaboration with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) to study the combination of Kyprolis and J&J’s Darzalex in multiple clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

88,AMGN,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (“EC”) has approved label expansion of its blockbuster drug, Prolia. The drug is now approved for the treatment of bone loss associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy in adult patients at increased risk of fracture. This is also called glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.This is the third approved indication for Prolia in Europe. The approval is backed by increase in bone mineral density (“BMD”) achieved by the drug in a phase III study.A similar line extension application received approval in the United States last month.Prolia is presently marketed in Europe for the treatment of men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture as well as to increase bone mass in men with prostate cancer receiving hormone ablation.Amgen’s shares have increased 6% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 6.9%. The phase III study evaluated Prolia for improvement in BMD in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment, compared to Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Actonel (risedronate). The study comprises two patient groups – one with patients on sustained glucocorticoid treatment (glucocorticoid-continuing arm) and the second with patients initiating glucocorticoid therapy (glucocorticoid-initiating arm). In both arms, Prolia demonstrated greater improvement in lumbar spine BMD in patients at one year and two years compared to Actonel, the study’s primary endpoint.Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. Per the press release, 30% to 40% of the patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment for the long term have shown vertebral fractures. Although the proportion of eligible patients is small, this line extension is likely to boost sales of the drug further.Prolia is one of the major revenue sources for Amgen and is witnessing growth in market share in both the United States and internationally amid competition from generics of other drugs approved for osteoporosis. In the first quarter of 2018, the drug generated sales of almost half a billion dollars, up 16.5% year over year.The drug faces competition from generics of other branded drugs including Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Evista (alendronate), Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Fosamax (raloxifene) and Novartis’ Zometa (zoledronate).Amgen Inc.

89,AMGN,"There is no approved therapy that can completely cure autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. The development of new treatment technologies is ongoing. Meanwhile, it is difficult to control autoimmune diseases in the majority of patients. The newest class of medications to treat these diseases is janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitors, which are providing patients a better treatment option. This class of therapies has generated significant interest due to their better efficacy compared to tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitor therapies.Autoimmune DiseasesIn patients with autoimmune diseases, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy cells. Scientists are yet to find the reason behind this abnormality. However, the incidence of autoimmune diseases is on the rise. There are multiple types of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (“MS”), inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), etc. Several companies are dedicated to bringing better drugs for the treatment of these diseases. The symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches, swelling, and redness in the affected body parts.The most common and first-line treatment for autoimmune disease is disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), especially methotrexate. Apart from methotrexate, there are several classes of DMARDs including TNF inhibitor therapies approved for these diseases that are performing well. AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel are blockbuster TNF inhibitor drugs among others. However, these treatments have serious safety issues which include increased risk tuberculosis and lymphoma among others.JAK InhibitorsSeveral pharma companies are developing JAK inhibitors, which work by blocking a particular signal of a body’s immune response, cytokines, instead of suppressing the immune system as done by DMARDs. Patients treated with JAK-inhibitors in clinical studies have shown faster and better response to the disease. However, the safety concern still looms large. The segment is attractive for companies as there are only two JAK inhibitors, presently approved for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, especially RA. However, several companies are developing their candidates, which is likely to increase competition going forward.The segment was in news recently as Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant, a JAK inhibitor, received approval in the United States and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced top-line data from a late-stage study evaluating its JAK inhibitor candidate,upadacitinib.4 Pharma/Biotech Companies in FocusGiven the growing interest in JAK inhibitors, let’s take a look at some pharma and biotech companies that are looking to change the way autoimmune diseases are treated.Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz (tofacitinib) is the first approved JAK-inhibitor in the United States for the treatment of RA. It has been available in the market since 2012. The drug is also approved for psoriatic arthritis. It generated sales of $326 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 30.4% year over year. A regulatory application seeking line extension of the drug in ulcerative colitis was approved late last month in the United States. Regulatory applications seeking approval in the above three indications are under review in Europe.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Eli Lilly’s JAK-inhibitor, Olumiant (baricitinib), is the second drug to receive approval for treating RA in the United States. The drug was approved early this month. However, it was launched in certain European countries in 2017. We note that the FDA rejected the company’s new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant in April 2017 citing safety concerns. Lilly develops and commercializes the drug in partnership with Incyte Corporation. The drug generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter, sequentially up 40%. Lilly is currently evaluating the drug in another autoimmune indication, atopic dermatitis (eczema), in a late-stage study.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).AbbVie is another company, which is focused on developing JAK inhibitor based treatments. The company’s JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib, showed promising results in late-stage studies evaluating the candidate in RA patients. It is also being developed for atopic dermatitis in a late-stage study for which it enjoys breakthrough therapy status in the United States. Another late-stage study is evaluating the candidate in Crohn’s disease.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) is developing its JAK inhibitor candidate, filgotinib, in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). Separate late-stage studies are evaluating the candidate in RA, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, several mid-stage studies are evaluating the candidate in multiple autoimmune indications including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus among others. Data from a mid-stageI study evaluating filgotinib in psoriatic arthritis showed significant improvement in patients.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Prospects of JAK Inhibitors With several blockbuster DMARDs nearing patent expiration, this new class of drugs holds potential to replace the existing treatments. This boosts the prospects of the companies that have these drugs/candidates in their pipeline or commercial portfolio.However, JAK inhibitors also have several side effects, which may delay their approval. We note that a lower dose of Lilly’s Olumiant was approved along with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

90,AMGN,"Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Rituxan (rituximab) for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV).Per the company, Rituxan is the first biologic therapy approved by the FDA for PV. We remind investors that the FDA had granted Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Orphan Drug Designation to Rituxan for the treatment of PV.Being an autoimmune blistering disease affecting the skin and mucous membranes, PF affects 30,000 to 40,000 people in the United States. As a result of this approval, Rituxan is now approved to treat four autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and PV.The approval was based on data from the Ritux 3 trial, which compared the Ritux 3 regimen (EU-approved rituximab product plus short-term corticosteroids [CS]) to CS alone as a first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed moderate to severe pemphigus. The results from the study showed that 90% of PV patients treated with the Ritux 3 regimen met the endpoint compared to 28% of PV patients treated with CS alone.We note that Roche’s subsidiary, Genentech and Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report), have a collaboration agreement for Rituxan in the United States while Roche markets MabThera (brand name of Rituxan outside the United States) in the rest of the world, except Japan, where Rituxan is co-marketed by Chugai and Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche, as its legacy drugs like Herceptin and MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars. Sales of MabThera/Rituxan were down 8% in the first quarter of 2018 as sales in Europe (down 44%) were adversely impacted by the market entry of biosimilars.Roche’s stock has lost 9.3% in the last six months compared with industry’s decline of 2.2%. Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

91,AMGN,"Investors in the biotech sector were glued last week to the highly awaited 54th annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), which overshadowed the usual regulatory and other updates from the space. The meeting, held in Chicago (Jun 1-Jun 5) provides companies with a platform to showcase their data to scientists, physicians, the investment community and others. While the focus was mainly on ASCO data, companies like Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) remained in the limelight on pipeline updates.Recap of Important Stories:Biogen/Eisai Report Encouraging Data on Elenbecestat: Biogen along with partner Eisai announced encouraging results on its Alzheimer's candidate, elenbecestat, a BACE inhibitor, from a phase II study (Study 202). The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group 18-month study among patients (n=70) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease, or mild-to-moderate dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease with confirmed amyloid pathology by PET ((positron emission tomography) screening. All the patients were randomized to four treatment arms receiving elenbecestat (5, 15, or 50 mg) or placebo daily. More than half the patients in the elenbecestat 5 mg and 15 mg arms were switched to the 50 mg arm for three months or more. The data showed elenbecestat was generally safe and well tolerated. Results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in amyloid beta(Aβ) levels in the brain measured by amyloid-PET and suggested a delay of clinical symptom decline in exploratory endpoints. Eisai and Biogen are jointly developing elenbecestat since March 2014. Both companies are currently conducting two global phase III studies (MISSION AD1/2) on early Alzheimer’s disease.Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A negative opinion was expected following the oral explanation trend vote. Consequently, Sarepta will request a re-examination of the opinion, which will result in the assignment of a new rapporteur and co-rapporteur. Additionally, Sarepta will request a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) on DMD be called. This in turn will allow neuromuscular specialists to provide expert guidance and insight into, among other things, the validity of the external controls used and the importance of certain functional endpoints. The re-examination will be completed by the end of 2018.And finally a look at some ASCO results: Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) had multiple presentations on its oncology drugs Revlimid, Pomalyst along with other experimental therapies at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. Results from the TRANSCEND study on experimental CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy candidate, lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel; JCAR017), in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were encouraging. (Read more: Celgene Presents Data on CAR T Therapy, Revlimid&Pomalyst).Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi also announced data from two trials evaluating cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma at the ASCO. The data from the study showed that patients treated with cemiplimab experienced robust anti-tumor effects. Cemiplimab-treated patients showed a 47.5% response rate with a median observed time to response of two months as of the data cut-off date.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Kite also announced results from an ongoing phase I study at the ASCO which showed that clinical responses were observed with investigational T cell receptor (TCR) cell therapy targeting human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 in solid tumor cancers caused by HPV.

92,AMGN,"Mylan N.V (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner Biocon announced that the FDA has approved Fulphila, a biosimilar of Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta.The news comes as a significant boost for Mylan, given the potential market for Fulphilia. According to the IQVIA, Neulasta generated U.S. sales of $4.2 billion for the twelve months ending Mar 31, 2018.The biosimilar has been approved to reduce the duration of febrile neutropenia (fever or other signs of infection with a low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells) in patients treated with chemotherapy in certain types of cancer.Notably, this is the first FDA-approved biosimilar of Neulasta. The company plans to launch the biosimilar in the coming weeks.The approval will broaden Mylan’s biosimilars portfolio. The FDA approval was based on a comprehensive package of analytical, nonclinical and clinical data, which confirmed that the biosimilar is highly similar to the branded drug. The data demonstrated that there were no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and Neulasta in terms of safety, purity and potency.Both the companies had earlier won FDA approval for Ogivri, a biosimilar of Herceptin. The biosimilar is also approved for 30 additional countries. Mylan and Biocon are collaborating to develop 11 biologic and insulin products. While Mylan owns the commercialization rights for the product in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union and European Free Trade Association countries, Biocon has co-exclusive commercialization rights with Mylan for the product in the rest of the world. In March 2018, Mylan and Biocon announced that their co-developed biosimilar insulin glargine Semglee has obtained approval from the European Commission (EC) following the positive recommendation by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of European Medicines Agency.We note that Mylan has one of the widest portfolios of generics and biosimilars. The company has a portfolio of 20 bioismilar and insulin analog products.Mylan’s stock has gained 11.5% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 0.6%. Shares are trading up on the news.Mylan’s efforts to develop its biosimilars portfolio is impressive. Mylan also has a partnership with Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA  -  Free Report) for the development of biosimilars.  Both the companies plan to initiate a patient clinical trial of M710 — a proposed biosimilar of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ (REGN  -  Free Report) Eylea — in the first half of 2018. The trial will be a randomized, double-blind, active-control, multicenter study in patients with diabetic macular edema to compare the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of M710 with the reference drug. Eylea, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema.Although volatility in the United States markets is expected to continue in 2018, yet these new approvals should position Mylan better in the year ahead and help it combat the decline in EpiPen sales.Zacks RankMylan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

93,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) is stealing the limelight at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago. After presenting “practice changing” lung cancer data on its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, the drug giant presented encouraging data from studies evaluating the drug in advanced melanoma and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients.Shares of Merck were up 2.4% on Monday in response to the positive news. This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 10.2% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4.5%.Four and five years follow-up data presented from two pivotal advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit.A new analysis of four-year data from the phase III KEYNOTE-006 study showed that 86% of the advanced melanoma patients remained progression free, 20 months after completing two years of treatment with Keytruda.Five-year data from the melanoma cohort of the phase Ib KEYNOTE-001 study demonstrated significant survival benefits in advanced melanoma patients. The five-year OS rate, a secondary endpoint for the study, was 34% in all patients and 41% in previously untreated metastatic melanoma patients.Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1. In the overall population of SCLC patients, overall response rate (ORR – primary endpoint) was 18.7%, while in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1, ORR was 35.7%.Keytruda is being evaluated in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer in another phase III study, KEYNOTE-604.Earlier at ASCO, Merck presented data from two pivotal lung cancer trials — KEYNOTE-042 study evaluating Keytruda monotherapy in newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients and KEYNOTE- 407 study evaluating Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy in difficult-to treat squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both the studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival, further cementing Merck’s position in the lung cancer market, which is the most lucrative oncology sector.Meanwhile, Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC.Keytruda holds a dominant position in lung cancer as it is the only anti-PD-1 approved in first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo). In fact, Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being evaluated in several lung cancer studies across multiple settings and stages of the disease, both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy.Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

94,AMGN,"Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner UCB SA  announced that the FDA has issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the biologics license application (BLA) for Evenity (romosozumab). Amgen is looking to get Evenity approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.The original BLA included data from the pivotal FRAME study.However, the FDA now requires safety and efficacy data from the other two pivotal phase III studies - ARCH and BRIDGE - to be included in the application. The agency has asked for a resubmission of the BLA, which will be considered as an extension of the current review.We remind investors that in May, Amgen had presented data from ARCH fracture study of romosozumab compared to Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Fosamax (alendronate) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Data from the study showed that Evenity/romosozumab led to a statistically significant superior fracture risk reduction than Fosamax (alendronate), which is the current standard of care in osteoporosis. However, a cardiovascular side effect was observed in the study.The company then said that the safety data from the ARCH data will now be considered in the regulatory review as agreed with the FDA. Following the heart-related safety issue that emerged from the otherwise successful ARCH results, Amgen warned that it did not expect Evenity to be approved this year.The CRL, thus, does not come as a surprise.So far this year, Amgen’s shares are up 21.1%, better than the 9.0% increase registered by the Zacks categorized Biomed/Genetics industry.The FRAME study evaluated the effectiveness of Evenity in reducing the risk of new vertebral fractures over 12 months. It also compared the effectiveness of 12 months of Evenity administration, followed by another 12 months of Xgeva to placebo followed by Xgeva administration.The BRIDGE study evaluated Evenity in older men with osteoporosis and a history of fragility fracture or vertebral fracture. The study evaluated the effectiveness of Evenity in increasing bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and its effect on BMD at the femoral neck and total hip.The company is working along with the FDA and is in a process to re-submit the BLA with the requested data.In a separate press release, Amgen announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA and a variation to the marketing application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its myeloma drug, Kyprolis. The submission of the regulatory applications was done to expand the drug’s label to include overall survival (OS) data from phase III ENDEAVOR study.We remind investors that Kyprolis (twice weekly) is already approved for use in combination with dexamethasone or with Celgene Corporations’ (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid (lenalidomide) plus dexamethasone based on the primary analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) data from the ASPIRE study.The submissions include data from the pivotal ENDEAVOR study, which compared Kyprolis and J&J’s Velcade in combination with dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The data demonstrated that Kyprolis reduced the risk of death by 21% compared to Velcade and increased the median OS by 7.6 months (47.6 months vs. 40 months).Kyprolis is the first and only therapy to achieve superior OS in a head-to-head comparison with a current standard of care, Velcade.Last week, Amgen announced OS data from the ASPIRE study. Overall survival data from the study showed that patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma lived 7.9 months longer when treated with Kyprolis plus Revlimid and dexamethasone (KRd) compared to those treated with Revlimid and dexamethasone (Rd) (median OS of 48.3 months for KRd versus median OS of 40.4 months for Rd).).Kyprolis is also being evaluated in a couple of other studies for potential label expansion. Amgen is evaluating a weekly dosing regimen of Kyprolis in a phase III study (ARROW) in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients. Data is expected to be out in 2019.Amgen Inc.

95,AMGN,"Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18.A look at Novartis’ share price movement year to date shows that the stock has outperformed the Zacks classified Large Cap Pharma industry. Its shares have rallied 13.3% compared with the industry’s gain of 11.3%.In the last reported quarter, Novartis delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. The company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.28% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Impact the QuarterNovartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon and Sandoz (Generics).New products like Cosentyx and Entresto should boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals like AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved the blockbuster status in 2016 and recorded over $1 billion of sales.Novartis has broadened its oncology portfolio through acquisitions. FDA’s recent approval of Kisqali, for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer will further boost the company's oncology portfolio.  Meanwhile, the FDA has also recently approved a label expansion of Zykadia as the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.Additionally, Novartis’ generic arm, Sandoz, is making efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio. The company plans to launch four biosimilars of major oncology and immunology biologics across key geographies by 2020. The company is, however, facing significant pricing pressures in the U.S. due to a delay in the launch of Glatopa 40mg. This is expected to impact the second-quarter results.Also, exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis’ portfolio is hurting the company’s top line.  The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the U.S., the EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the U.S. in Feb 2016 and in the EU in Dec 2016, thereby leading to generic competition. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the U.S. and the EU. Furthermore, the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno-oncology therapies.The negative impact of generic competition is expected to impact sales by $2.5 billion in 2017.The company’s ophthalmologic division, Alcon, continues to face challenges due to lower surgical equipments sales. Stiff competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases continue to act as dampeners. We do not expect any improving trends in the division’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Novartis will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Novartis is 0.00%.  This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.16. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG QuoteStock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +16.7% and a Zacks Rank #1.

96,AMGN,"Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner UCB announced the re-submission of the biologics license application (“BLA”) to the FDA for Evenity (romosozumab). Amgen is looking to get Evenity approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture in the United States.Evenity treats osteoporosis by increasing bone mineral density (“BMD”) and also reduces the risk of fracture.Year to date, shares of Amgen have increased 11.6% as against the industry’s decline of 2.2%. We remind investors that the first BLA seeking approval of Evenity for the same indication in the United States was issued a complete response letter (“CRL”) by the FDA in July last year. The CRL was issued due to a cardiovascular side effect observed in the ARCH study. The BLA included data only from FRAME study and the FDA then requested a resubmission of the application with additional data from the ARCH and the BRIDGE studies.As required the second BLA now includes data from the ARCH and BRIDGE studies.In the ARCH study, Evenity showed statistically significant superior fracture risk reduction in postmenopausal women compared to current standard of care for osteoporosis, Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Fosamax.The FDA will review the potential of Evenity in increasing BMD as well as reducing risk of fracture and also cardiovascular safety signal from ARCH study.The marketing applications for Evenity are currently in review in Europe and Japan.Amgen Inc.

97,AMGN,"Investors in Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 20, 2018 $135 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Amgen shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Bottom 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has increased from $3.44 per share to $3.52.Given the way analysts feel about Amgen right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

98,AMGN,"We expect Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17, before market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.49%.J&J’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 2.86%Johnson & Johnson Price and EPS Surprise   Johnson & Johnson Price and EPS Surprise | Johnson & Johnson QuoteThe stock has depreciated 9.6% this year so far, which compares unfavorably with a decline of 1.3% recorded by the industry. Factors to ConsiderJ&J’s sales improved in the first quarter of 2018. This is because the Pharmaceutical segment continued the positive momentum seen in the second half of 2017 and Consumer segment sales improved. The positive sales trend is expected to continue in the second quarter. In fact, J&J is quite confident that its Pharma segment will continue to perform better than the market this year despite the impact of biosimilars on sales of its key arthritis drug Remicade. Sales in the Consumer and Medical Device segments are expected to improve.We believe that new products in all segments, successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions will continue to drive top-line growth. Core products like Stelara, Zytiga, Simponi/Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna are expected to contribute to growth.However, in the past two quarters, revenues from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) products — added after the June 2017 acquisition of Actelion —  declined sequentially due to lower sales of Tracleer outside the United States due to generic competition. It is less likely that PAH revenues will improve in the second quarterBiosimilar competition is expected to hurt sales of Remicade outside the United States. Please note that J&J markets Remicade in partnership with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report).However, J&J does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga, Prezista, Risperdal Consta, or Invega Sustenna in the United States in 2018. However, the full year guidance includes the impact of generics for Procrit and Tracleer as well as Remicade biosimilars.Regarding newly launched Tremfya, J&J said on the first-quarter conference call that the uptake of the product has been strong. The drug recorded sales of $72 million in the first quarter, which is expected to be higher in the to-be reported quarter. We expect J&J to discuss initial sales numbers for Erleada, its newly approved prostate cancerdrug, on the second-quarter conference call.In the Medical Devices segment, sales are expected to rise consistently in the Vision Care and Cardiovascular units. Diabetes Care unit will however continue to remain weakIn the Consumer segment, while beauty and over-the-counter products are expected to do well, domestic baby care product sales will likely remain weak. Recent acquisitions as well as new products are likely to provide some support.However, higher investments behind the new product launches will continue to hurt profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that J&J is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: J&J’s Earnings ESP is +0.37%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.06 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J&J has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of J&J’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other large drug/biotech stocks that also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +1.25% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release results on Jul 26.

99,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted priority review to a supplemental new drug application (sBLA) for its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda.With the latest filing, Merck is looking to get Keytruda approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer in patients, previously treated with systemic therapy (sorafenib).The FDA is expected to give its verdict on Nov 9, 2018.The sBLA was based on positive data from the phase II study KEYNOTE-224. The outcomes demonstrated that treatment with Keytruda monotherapy led to an overall response rate (ORR) of 16.3% in patients with advanced HCC. The data also showed a 1% complete response rate and a 15.4% partial response rate as a result of treatment with Keytruda.This data was recently produced at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Cancers Symposium in San Francisco.Notably, Keytruda is already marketed for several cancer indications including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer. The drug is the first anti-PD-1 therapy to gain an FDA approval and is now already approved for use in 10 different settings involving seven different tumor types. In 2018, it has already secured an FDA nod for two new indications. These include third-line treatment of adult as well as pediatric patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.The drug is also being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 trials including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Keytruda is a key top-line driver for Merck and logged sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by the launch of new indications globally.The company is carrying out the Keytruda development program, which is progressing well with several regulatory decisions for new indications in the United States as well as in Europe expected in 2018. These label expansions, if approved, will widen the patient population base and further drive the sales higher.Shares of Merck have increased 10% year to date versus the industry’s decline of 1.4%. Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

101,AMGN,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) was a star performer in Friday’s trading session, as the stock rallied as much as 23.1% but closed a little lower, rising 19.6% in the day’s trade. The massive gain for the biotech firm came from encouraging Phase 2 clinical study data for Alzheimer’s treatment.The final analysis at 18 months of the 856-patient Phase 2 clinical study of BAN2401 in early Alzheimer’s disease demonstrated statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline and reduction of amyloid beta accumulated in the brain, per the company press release. Amyloid beta or protein fragments are found in the brains of patients suffering from the disease and that some believe cause it.Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia and affects about 50 million people worldwide, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Currently, there is no treatment for the disease or way to stop its progression. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved some medications to treat symptoms related to memory loss, language and other thought processes (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).As such, the result marks an important milestone in the companies' quest to tackle Alzheimer's disease. In fact, analysts welcomed the news as the first trial study for the drug was disappointing. This resulted in a risk-on environment, with many investors pulling in capital to this high growth and high beta sector.Other large-cap biotech stocks also gained with Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) up 3.3%, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) up 2.5% and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) up 1.9%. This suggests that investors are pinning their hopes on these fast growing companies, which could see smooth trading in the coming days.ETF ImpactThe smooth trading in the stock world also sent biotech ETFs space into green on the day. In particular, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) stole the show climbing 3.8% o, followed by more than 3% gains each for First Trust Amex Biotechnology Index (FBT  -  Free Report), Invesco Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome ETF (PBE  -  Free Report) and VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH  -  Free Report).IBBThis fund provides exposure to 192 firms by tracking the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, with Biogen taking the top spot at 9.1%.

The repatriated money led to an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity, share buybacks and dividends. Additionally, the slower growth in mature drugs has also compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones, even at hefty premiums, with promising pipelines.Further, Trump’s most-awaited plan to lower drug prices has added to the strength. If these were not enough, the sector’s non-cyclical nature is an advantage in the current market, which is ruffled by trade war fears between China and United States as well as geopolitical tension.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

102,AMGN,"Several major biotech stocks rallied on Friday after Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) reported positive results from a Phase 2 study of its Ban2401 therapy, which seeks to reduce toxic amyloid proteins associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.Shares of Biogen were up more than 17% through afternoon trading hours Thursday. Japan’s Eisai Co. (ESALY  -  Free Report), a partner in the Ban2401 development, saw gains of nearly 20%. This momentum was enough to lift the rest of the biotech space, evidenced by the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund (IBB  -  Free Report) adding about 3.2%.Biotech giants like Biogen, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), and Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) have all underperformed the broader Nasdaq index over the past year, and the industry likely needed positive news to spark some optimistic trading.Speaking to The Street’s “Real Money” column, Atlantic Equities analyst Steve Chesney said that investors might finally be noticing the value of R&D efforts from these companies.“This is all about believing innovation and when a company like Biogen comes and reports positive clinical results for a disease like Alzehimer's the implied probability for success for the rest of the industry's pipeline moves a little bit higher,” Chesney told The Street.Celgene shares added about 2.3% to touch an intraday and one-month high of $82.34. Meanwhile, Amgen moved about 2% higher, and Gilead gained more than 3.3%.Biogen’s latest test included 856 patients with early Alzheimer’s disease. The company shared positive results from this group over a period of 18 months. Nevertheless, the trial is still only in Phase 2, and the challenges of Phase 3 and its additional regulatory hurdles are still looming.Still, Biogen will hope that it can commercialize Ban2401 in a timely manner. A new product would likely inspire positive analyst sentiment and lift growth prospects for the coming years.Within the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Biogen’s 2018 earnings has dropped from $23.90 per share to $23.85 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 9.4%.Early estimates for 2019 have the company’s earnings pegged at $26.19 per share, which would represent a 9.8% increase from this year’s projected totals.BIIB is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its “Medical – Biomedical and Genetics” industry is sitting in the bottom 38% of the Zacks Industry Rank.Want more market analysis from this author?

103,AMGN,"It’s been a pretty low-key week for the biotech sector, with not too many major updates. Among the key news, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR-T therapy won CHMP positive opinion, while Keryx Biopharmaceuticals (KERX  -  Free Report) plunged on merger news.Recap of Important Stories:Gilead’s CAR-T Therapy Gets Positive CHMP Opinion: Gilead announced that European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (""CHMP"") has issued a positive opinion on the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (""MAA"") for CAR T therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel, as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (""DLBCL"") and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (""PMBCL""), after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Axicabtagene ciloleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy, modifies a patient’s own T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells.The agency had granted PRIME status to axicabtagene ciloleucel in May 2016. A tentative approval is in the cards as the EMA generally takes the CHMP recommendation into account while reviewing any MAA. We note that axicabtagene ciloleucel was approved by the FDA in October 2017 as Yescarta.An approval in Europe will boost the growth prospects of the therapy, given the market potential. Per the information provided by the company, there are estimated 7,700 patients with DLBCL, who are refractory to or have relapsed after two or more lines of the therapy and may be eligible for CAR T therapy in Europe. (Read more: Gilead's CAR T Therapy Gets Positive CHMP Opinion)Amgen Announces Results on Remicade Biosimilar and Migraine Drug: Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced results from a phase III study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of biosimilar candidate ABP 710 to branded drug Remicade. The results confirm ABP 710 was non-inferior compared to Remicade based on its primary endpoint, which was an assessment of ACR20 at week 22.The ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria are used to measure the effectiveness of various arthritis medicines in clinical studies.  An ACR20 score means that a person's RA has improved by 20%. Remicade is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, chronic severe plaque psoriasis, moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. We note that Amgen has a broad portfolio of 10 biosimilars, of which two are approved in the United States and three are approved in the European Union.In addition, Amgen announced encouraging results from two open-label extension (OLE) studies on migraine drug, Aimovig. Results from a one-year study in chronic migraine patients reinforced the established safety and efficacy profile of Aimovig in long-term use. Moreover, a three-year interim analysis from an ongoing five-year study of episodic migraine patients also reinforced the long-term safety and tolerability of Aimovig.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Celgene Reports Positive Data on Luspatercept: Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) and partner Acceleron Pharma (XLRN  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a phase III, multi-center study (MEDALIST) which evaluated the efficacy and safety of luspatercept versus placebo in patients with very low, low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with chronic anemia and refractory to, intolerant of, or ineligible for treatment with an erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA), ring sideroblast-positive and require frequent red blood cells (RBC)  transfusions.The study showed that luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence of at least eight consecutive weeks during the first 24 weeks compared to placebo. The candidate also met the key secondary endpoint of demonstrating a highly statistically significant improvement in RBC transfusion independence of at least 12 consecutive weeks during the first 24 weeks.The study also achieved modified hematologic improvement-erythroid (IWG mHI-E), a meaningful secondary endpoint. Regulatory submissions are planned in the United States and Europe in the first half of 2019.  (Read more: Celgene's Luspatercept Meets Primary Endpoint in the Study)Keryx Plunges on Merger Deal with Akebia: Shares of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. plunged following announcement of a definitive merger agreement with Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (AKBA  -  Free Report). Both companies have agreed to combine in an all-stock merger and form a new, fully integrated company focused on chronic kidney diseases (or CKD) called Akebia Therapeutics.The deal is expected to close by the end of 2018. While Keryx already has an FDA approved drug Auryxia in its kitty, Akebia has a late-stage candidate in its pipeline. However, investors were not much impressed with the merger news and shares of both companies fell. (Read more: Keryx Inks Merger Deal With Akebia, Shares Fall)Cara Therapeutics Rallies On Positive Results: Shares of Cara Therapeutics, Inc. (CARA  -  Free Report) soared after the company announced positive top-line data from the adaptive phase II/III trial of intravenous (IV) CR845 in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries. The IV form of CR845 achieved statistical significance for the study’s primary endpoint of pain relief over the 0 to 24-hour (AUC 0-24) period post-surgery for combined surgeries at the 1.0 mcg/kg dose (p=0.032).In addition, the treatment with the same also resulted in statistically significant reductions in the secondary endpoint of incidence of nausea and vomiting at 24-hours post-surgery for both the 0.5 and 1.0 mcg doses (p=0.006; p<0.0001 respectively). The data demonstrate the overall benefit of CR845 in both providing pain relief across surgery types up to 24 hours post-surgery and reducing post-operative nausea and vomiting, a significant medical need in the post-operative setting. The brand name for the drug is Korsuva.The company had earlier inked a licensing deal with Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. whereby it licensed worldwide rights, to commercialize Korsuva (CR845/difelikefalin) injection for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 1.10% over the last five trading sessions.

104,AMGN,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares have outperformed the large-cap pharma industry in the past three months. The stock has returned 1.5% in that timeframe against the industry’s decline of 1.1%.AbbVie’s outperformance was backed by decent quarterly results, an optimistic outlook for stronger underlying business performance through the rest of the year,positive pipeline news flow and regulatory updates.It is one of the reputed names in the pharmaceutical sector. AbbVie came into existence on Jan 1, 2013, after Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) divested its pharmaceutical divisionHere are six reasons to invest in the stock.Favorable Rank & Earnings Surprise Record: AbbVie has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It has been consistently beating earnings expectations.  Earnings surpassed expectations in each of last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.39%.The company is expected to record earnings and sales growth of 39.3% and 16.8%, respectively, in 2018. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 increased 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, in the past 60 days.Valuation Looks Reasonable: Despite the outperformance, AbbVie’s valuation looks fairly reasonable currently.AbbVie currently has a forward twelve months price-to-earnings ratio (P/E F12M) of 11.25, which is near the lowest level (11.03) in the past year. When compared with the highest level of 17.99 and median level of 13.92 over the past year, there is apparently some upside left.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the industry, as the current as well as median F12M P/E ratio for the industry is 14.02 and 15.63, respectively. Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M) chart  Key Drug Humira Going Strong: AbbVie’s flagship product Humira is approved for several inflammatory indications like rheumatoid arthritis. Humira continues to witness strong demand trends despite launch of drugs with new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars. Currently approved for 13 indications, Humira sales have increased consistently - 11.7% in 2015, 16.1% in 2016 and 14.6% in 2017 - backed by robust demand trends. The product continues to see strong growth in the dermatology and gastroenterology markets. The company expects Humira sales to approach $21 billion in 2020.Though two biosimilar versions of Humira are already approved by the FDA, per settlements with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Samsung Bioepis, biosimilar entry into the United States is set for 2023, thus delaying direct biosimilar competition in the country.Strong Oncology Portfolio: AbbVie work rigorously on expanding and accelerating its presence in oncology. A key drug in its oncology portfolio is Imbruvica, which is currently approved for quite a few indications and has multi-billion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Several studies on Imbruvica are ongoing to evaluate the drug alone or in combination in different patient segments. AbbVie expects Imbruvica peak sales of more than $7 billion and revenues of about $5 billion in 2020. AbbVie has developed Imbruvica in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report).AbbVie is also studying another cancer drug Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. In June, regulatory applications seeking approval for the combination of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL were approved in the United States. Label expansion to include this broader patient population should boost Venclexta’s commercial potential.Meanwhile, the 2016 acquisition of drugmaker, Stemcentrx added a key late-stage candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T, to AbbVie’s portfolio. Rova-T is currently in registrational studies for first and second-line small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A phase I, eight-arm ""basket study"" on Rova-T in neuroendocrine tumors is also ongoing.Promising Pipeline: AbbVie has a deep pipeline consisting of several interesting late-stage candidates. Promising candidates include elagolix (endometriosis), risankizumab (inflammatory diseases), Depatux-M/ABT-414 (glioblastoma multiforme), ABBV-8E12 (early Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), and upadacitinib/ABT-494 (inflammatory diseases).The company expects to move 10 tumor candidates into clinical development in 2018.Several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in the second half of the year including FDA decisions on risankizumab and elagolix regulatory applications.Mavyret Performs Beyond Expectations: AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, Mavyret, gained approval in the United States, EU, Canada and Japan in 2017. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Mavyret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history. Mavyret performed beyond expectations in the first year of launch, recording sales of almost $500 million in 2017. The positive sales trend continues in 2018 with the drug recording sales of $850 million in the first quarter of 2018. With less than a year on the market, Mavyret already commands 45% share in the United States.Conclusion                                                                                  AbbVie faces its share of challenges in the form of slower sales of HCV drugs, potential biosimilar competition to Humira, regular pipeline setbacks and rising competition. However, we believe AbbVie is well positioned to overcome these headwinds.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

105,AMGN,"Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) presented positive results from the third phase III trial on breast cancer drug Kisqali (ribociclib) in advanced or metastatic breast cancer at the 54th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago.The phase III trial, MONALEESA-3, showed Kisqali plus Faslodex significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to Faslodex alone in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer.The median PFS was not reached in the subgroup of patients taking Kisqali plus fulvestrant in the first-line setting. However, 70% were estimated to remain progression-free at median follow-up of 16.5 months.Moreover, results from MONALEESA-7 showed consistent treatment benefit among premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, regardless of prior chemotherapy treatment in the advanced setting.We remind investors that Kisqali was approved by the FDA in Mar 2017 and by the European Commission in August 2017, as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor.Novartis is currently in discussions with the FDA to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA), seeking approval of Kisqali plus Faslodex for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.The company also presented data from two long-term Treatment-free Remission (TFR) studies, ENESTop and ENESTfreedom in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase (CP). The results from the open-label phase II trials, ENESTop and ENESTfreedom, show sustained TFR in patients treated with both front-line and second-line Tasigna (nilotinib) therapy.The 144-week trials evaluate the potential to maintain molecular response (MR) after stopping therapy in eligible adult patients with Ph+ CML-CP. Data showed durability and safety of TFR with Tasigna. Nearly all patients who lost TFR regained major molecular response after restarting therapy.Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and Kisqali, which continue to boost sales. The approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost, given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space. The FDA recently expanded Kymriah's label which should boost sales.Last week, Novartis completed the divestiture of its 36.5% stake in a consumer healthcare joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK  -  Free Report) for $13 billion.The company also announced that its generic arm, Sandoz, obtained a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency for marketing authorization of a proposed biosimilar of AbbVie’s ABBV blockbuster drug Humira. The generic division is seeking approval of the proposed biosimilar for use in all indications of the branded drug including those in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology. A tentative approval will further boost the generic division, which has been struggling with competitive pricing. Last month, Sandoz obtained approval for Zessly, a biosimilar version of Remicade, in Europe. With Zessly’s approval, Sandoz now has six approved biosimilars in its portfolio. Zessly is the third biosimilar that has been approved by the EC in the last 12 months for Sandoz.The CHMP has also recommended approval for Aimovig (erenumab) for the prevention of migraine in adults who have at least four migraine days per month. The drug was recently approved by the FDA. Novartis and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) are co-commercializing the drug in the United States. While Amgen has exclusive commercialization rights to the drug in Japan, Novartis has exclusive rights to commercialize in the rest of the world.Novartis’ shares have declined 7.4% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 1.9%. The approval of new drugs bode well for Novartis as the company is facing the loss of patent protection for some of the key drugs.Zacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

106,AMGN,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) along with its partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the 2 mg dose of Olumiant (baricitinib) for treating moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). The once-daily oral JAK inhibitor is approved as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate for treating adult patients with inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitor therapies.The approval in the United States was not much of a surprise considering that an FDA advisory committee had recommended approval of the lower dose of the drug in April. However, the 4 mg dose of the drug was not approved.Moreover, the drug’s label includes a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis.The companies expect to launch the drug by the end of the second quarter. It will be available at a price 60% lower than the leading TNF inhibitors approved for RA, which includes AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel among others.We remind investors that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter in April 2017 for the new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant, requesting additional information to determine the most appropriate doses.Olumiant is already approved in Europe and Japan and generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. The U.S. approval will further boost the sales of the drug.Lilly’s share price has increased 0.5% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%.The approval was based on data from RA-BEACON study, which evaluated Olumiant in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs versus placebo. Data showed that 49% of the patients treated with Olumiant achieved improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA compared to placebo (27%).The companies will conduct a long-term safety study of Olumiant in RA patients as part of the approval.Following approval in the United States, Incyte is now eligible to receive a milestone payment of $100 million from Lilly, which it expects to record in full in the second quarter of 2018.Olumiant is also being evaluated in a late-stage study for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.Eli Lilly and Company Price  Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

107,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda ruled at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago as the drug giant presented additional data from two pivotal lung cancer studies on the drug.Merck presented additional data from the pivotal KEYNOTE-042 study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous or squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 1 percent or greater  (TPS of ≥1 percent).In April, Merck had said that in such patients, Keytruda led to a significant survival benefit compared with platinum-based chemotherapy. With the latest release, the company said that in patients with TPS of ≥1 percent, median overall survival (OS) was 16.7 months in the Keytruda arm versus 12.1 months in chemotherapy arm. In the PD-L1 TPS ≥50 percent patient population, median OS was 20 months while that in patients with TPS of ≥20 percent was 17.7 months versus 12.2 months and 13 months, respectively for chemotherapy alone.Also, Merck said the risk of progression or death or progression-free survival (PFS) — the secondary endpoint — was 19% in the PD-L1 TPS ≥50 percent population at the time of interim analysis, which was not statistically significant.Notably, Keytruda monotherapy is already marketed for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater (TPS of ≥50 percent) based on data from the KEYNOTE-024 study.If the OS data from KEYNOTE-042 study are approved to be included in Keytruda’s label, the drug can be prescribed to treat an expanded lung cancer patient population, further reinforcing its position in the lung cancer market. Later in the year, Merck will file regulatory application to get the OS data from the study included in the label of Keytruda.Merck also announced data from a second interim analysis of a pivotallung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE- 407 study — which evaluated Keytruda in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel (chemotherapy) for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC. The data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both OS and PFS regardless of PD-L1 expression. The risk of death (OS) was reduced by 36% compared to chemotherapy alone. The median OS was 15.9 months in the Keytruda combination group versus 11.3 months in the chemotherapy arm. The PFS improvement was nearly half for patients in the Keytruda combination group compared with chemotherapy alone. The median PFS was 6.4 months in the Keytruda combination group versus 4.1 months in the chemotherapy arm.A regulatory application to include data from this study was submitted to the FDA in May. At the same time, the company had presented data from the first interim analysis of the KEYNOTE- 407 study. It said that the study met a pre-specified secondary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) in an early cohort of participants. At ASCO, the company said that ORR was 57.9% in the Keytruda arm compared to 38.4% for chemotherapy aloneMetastatic squamous NSCLC is a difficult-to-treat population, which accounts for about 30% of lung cancer cases. If the Keytruda combination is approved to treat this difficult-to-treat population, lung cancer sales of the drug should improve further.This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 7.6% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4.5%.Keytruda is the second largest product in Merck’s portfolio. It is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.The treatment fetched sales of $3.8 billion in 2017, up almost 172% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, which further bolstered demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. In fact, Keytruda is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).Meanwhile, Keytruda is being evaluated in several lung cancer studies across multiple settings and stages of the disease, both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy.At ASCO, Merck also presented data from several combination studies of tyrosinekinase inhibitor, Lenvimaplus Keytruda at ASCO.The studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types — unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) — demonstrated encouraging ORR as well as safety profile of this cancer combination.We remind investors that in March, Merck formed a deal with Japan’s Eisai to co-develop and commercialize Lenvima, both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Keytruda for several types of cancer.At ASCO, Merck also presented interim data from a mid-stage study (KEYNOTE-427) evaluating Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC. The data showed that in the Keytruda arm, the ORR — the primary endpoint — was 38.2%. Meanwhile, in a sub-group of patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1, the ORR was 50%.Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

108,AMGN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) confirmed that FDA has extended the action date of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for fremanezumab. The action date for fremanezumab is now set for September 16, 2018, which was previously set for mid-June. There are no additional data requests from the FDA.Fremanezumab is an investigational therapy currently under review by the FDA as a quarterly or monthly injection for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.  It is also under review in the European Union.Shares of Teva increased 11.6% year to date against the industry’s decline of 6.2%.We remind investors that the FDA accepted for review the company’s BLA for fremanezumab  in December 2017 and  granted fast-track designation to the candidate. However, in January 2018, Teva’s partner Celltrion received a warning letter from FDA for a facility in South Korea, following an inspection of the fill/finish side of the facility, thus delaying the approval of the drug. This facility manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for fremanezumab.Teva, thus, stated in its first quarter 2018 earnings call that it did not expect to receive FDA approval on its BLA for fremanezumab on the mid-June date. The company was in a constructive dialogue with the FDA in close collaboration with partner Celltrion.Recently, we note that Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) have received FDA approval for their pipeline candidate Aimovig (erenumab) for the prevention of migraine. The drug is the first FDA-approved treatment, specifically developed to treat migraine by blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (""CGRP"") receptor.Another Pharma giant Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) has anti-CGRP candidate- galcanezumab, which is under review in the United States. A decision on galcanezumab is expected in the third quarter of the year.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

109,AMGN,"The revival in the ever-volatile biotech sector has not lived up to expectations so far in 2018. The performance of biotech bigwigs has been affected by the slowdown in progress of the key drugs. Competitive pressure has also adversely impacted the top line.While issues like drug pricing and competition will remain headwinds, an ace investor will know that the biotech sector can be a lucrative market for investment. Moreover, it is widely expected that the sector will rebound in the second half of the year.New drug approvals had boosted investor sentiment to a certain extent in the first half. Moreover, the approval of these drugs should boost their respective companies’ top line as a few of them are struggling with a decline in sales of legacy drugs. We believe new drug approvals, label expansion of existing high-profile drugs, pipeline progress, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should positively impact performance.Owing to competitive pressure, quite a few companies have resorted to cost-cutting initiatives, which in turn should propel the bottom line somewhat.Meanwhile, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have picked up pace in the sector as a slowdown in mature products has forced companies to eye lucrative acquisitions to bolster their pipeline. Additionally, the increase in M&A activity is also being propelled by the implementation of the new tax law which has slashed corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.The new tax reform is also luring corporates to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%. We expect many more such deals in the latter half as well.Industry Lags on Shareholder ReturnsEven though the macroeconomic conditions look better than those in 2017, the price performance so far in 2018 has not been that impressive. As mentioned above, the decline in sales of legacy drugs and pipeline setbacks have adversely impacted the price performance of the key biotech players and in turn has pulled down the average for the industry.The Zacks Biomedical and Genetics Industry, which is a 281-stock group within the broader Zacks Medical Sector, has underperformed the S&P 500 and the sector it belongs to on a year-to-date basis.While the stocks in this industry have collectively declined 6.4%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and the Zacks Medical Sector have risen 1.7% and declined 1.1% year to date, respectively. The magnitude of decline in bigger companies has more than offset gains recorded by the small biotechnology companies.Year-to-Date Price Performance Biotech Stocks Trading CheapGiven the underperformance of the industry so far this year, the valuation looks cheap now. Valuation is a tricky business for the biotech companies. It takes several years for a drug to get regulatory approval and so the regular price multiple ratios do not provide a fair picture for biotech companies. More importantly, these companies spend a lot on R&D and hence it is more complex to account for such high expenses on an uncertain future revenue stream.While there is always uncertainty regarding trial results and FDA decisions, one might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price/book ratio. The industry currently has a Price/Book TTM ratio of 3.45, which is toward the highest level in the past year as well as the past five years. When compared with the highest level of 3.57 and median level of 2.18 over the past year, we believe investors can wait for any dip to enter the market.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the Medical market at large, as the current as well as median Price/Book TTM ratio for the Medical sector is 4.34 and 4.12, respectively.                                        Price-to-Book Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Compared to the Zacks S&P 500 Composite too, the space looks inexpensive. The current ratio for the S&P 500 of 3.85 and the median level of 3.74 for the same period are above the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry’s respective ratios.                                        Price-to-Book Trailing Twelve Months (TTM)                                                            In addition to using Price/Book ratio, which is a standard multiple to value any company, price-to-free cash flow is good metric for evaluating smaller biotech companies that do not have any approved drug in their portfolio and are more or less dependent on collaborations for their funding. Given the high levels of R&D, this is a good metric to judge a biotech company.Even using the price-to-free cash flow (adjusted) metric, the space looks inexpensive compared with the Medical market at large, as the current price-to-free cash flow (adjusted) ratio for the Medical market is 11.65 while that for Medical- Biomedical and Genetics industry is 6.5.                                                   Price-to-Free Cash Flow Earnings Outlook Looks NegativeWhile the above ratio analysis shows that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead, one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year’s reported number. But an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates. The trend in earnings estimate revisions has not been favorable either. Pipeline setbacks have led to many companies slashing their outlook.                    Price and Consensus: Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industryLooking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have started to lose confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 4.5% downward since May 31.                                Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Prospects for ImprovementThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.The Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #163, which places it at the bottom 39% of more than 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has deteriorated considerably in the past two weeks.Small Biotechs Promise Long-Term GrowthWhile the near-term outlook is not encouraging, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Biotech industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate reached a trough at the start of the quarter but has revived thereafter to reach the current level of 13.47%. This also compares favorably with 9.98% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite, the highest level in past one year.                                     Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate An important indication of solid long-term prospect of smaller biotech companies is improvement in the free cash flow yield. The image below shows a consistence performance in the group’s free cash flow yield since 2017.                    Free Cash Flow Yield- Zacks Biomedical and Genetics Industry Growing demand for drugs particularly targeted for personalized therapies, increase in the incidence of chronic diseases and technological advancements, evolving treatment regimens, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track in the long term. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that push up costs and a slowdown in innovation should also provide benefits.Bottom LineThe Biomedical and Genetics industry is continuously evolving and largely volatile. In such a scenario, biotech companies are expected to adopt innovative business models, invest in new technologies, increase investments in personalized medicines and seek external partners and collabora¬tors for complementary strengths.The sector is stumble upon challenges posed by the drug pricing issue, pricing/re-imbursement pressure, increasing competition, slowdown in legacy product sales, loss of patent exclusivity of some key drugs and pipeline related setbacks.However, pipeline success in innovative and important therapeutic areas, cost cutting, share buybacks, new product launches, increased M&A activity and appropriate utilization of cash may bring the sector back on track this year.The industry currently has quite a few stocks, which sport either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Here, we list a few such stocks that have also been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions.Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) is one of the leading biotech companies in the world. The consensus EPS estimate for this CA-based company has moved 7.9% higher for the current year over the last 60 days. The Zacks Rank #2 stock has rallied 8.4% so far this year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.                                     Price and Consensus: AMGNANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ANIP  -  Free Report) has been seeing positive revisions in earnings estimates over the last 60 days. Analysts have revised estimates upward by 2.9% for the current year. Further, the Zacks Rank #2 stock has gained 5.4% so far this year.                                     Price and Consensus: ANIPIllumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) has been seeing positive revisions in earnings estimates over the last 90 days. Analysts have revised estimates upward by 5.6% for the current year. Further, the Zacks Rank #2 stock has surged 28.5% this year.                                      Price and Consensus: ILMN Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

110,AMGN,"Merck and Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) gained priority review for yet another supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for its PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda. With the latest application, Merck is looking to get Keytruda approved in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is a difficult-to-treat lung cancer patient population. The FDA granted priority review to this sBLA with a decision scheduled on Oct 30.The sBLA filing was based on data from the KEYNOTE-407 study. At the recently concluded annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, data presentation from this pivotal lung cancer study resulted in Merck emerging as a winner at this annual key cancer event. Data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival regardless of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 is a protein present on the surface of cells.The risk of death (OS) was reduced by 36% compared to chemotherapy alone. The PFS improvement or as we say reduction in the risk of progression or death was nearly half for patients in the Keytruda combination group compared with chemotherapy alone.The data was termed “practice changing” by CNBC – changing the way doctors look at prescribing these drugs to cancer patients. It further cemented Merck’s position in the lung cancer market, which is the most lucrative oncology sector.This year so far, Merck’s shares have risen 7.4% against the industry’s decline of 5.1%.In a short span of time, Keytruda has become Merck’s largest product. It is already approved for use in 10 different settings involving seven different tumor types. This year, it has already gained approval for two new indications. These include third-line treatment of adult as well as pediatric patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. These label expansion approvals should drive sales of Keytruda in the future quarters.The treatment generated sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year. This upside was driven by the global launch for new indications, which further boosted demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. In fact, Keytruda is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).Keytruda is also being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report), Glaxo and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

111,AMGN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Amgen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.0. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Amgen’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 37.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Amgen has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Amgen stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Amgen has a P/S ratio of about 5.7. This is higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Nonetheless, as we can see in the chart below, the current level is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Amgen currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Amgen a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 12.0, which is far better than the industry average of 21.1. Clearly, AMGN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Amgen might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F. This gives AMGN a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher. While the current quarter has not seen any estimate revisions in the past sixty days, the full year estimate has seen two upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus  Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus | Amgen Inc. QuoteThis somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAmgen is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future. However, the company’s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors, as it has a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 36% out of more than 250 industries). In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

112,AMGN,"It has been a pretty ho-hum first-half of 2018 for the biotech sector. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (^NBI) has lost 1.2% so far in 2018.The performance of biotech bigwigs has been affected by the slowdown in growth of key drugs. Competitive pressure will continue to impact sales. Nevertheless, new drug approvals boosted investor sentiment. Key approvals so far this year include Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) HIV regimen, Biktarvy; Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), Amgen’s Aimoviq for the treatment of migraine, and BioMarin’s Palynziq for the treatment of phenylketonuria, among others. The approval of these drugs should boost their respective companies’ top line as a few of them are struggling with decline in sales of legacy drugs.Increase in M&AMergers and acquisitions picked up pace in the sector as the slowdown in mature products has forced companies like Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) to eye lucrative acquisitions to bolster their pipeline. Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR-T space. In February 2018, the company acquired Impact Biomedicines and added a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to its pipeline.Alexion will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics and add a late-stage candidate, WTX101, to its pipeline, which is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. Most recently, Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. and Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. announced a merger agreement under which both the companies will combine in an all-stock merger. We expect many more such deals in the latter half as well.What Lies Ahead?The Medical - Biomed/Genetics sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #153, which places it at the bottom 40% of the 255 plus Zacks industries. Although issues like drug pricing and threat of biosimilars loom large on the healthcare sector in large, we expect a better performance in the second half of 2018. New drug approvals, label expansion of existing high-profile drugs, pipeline progress, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should positively impact performance.Our ChoicesHere we list a few biotech stocks backed by a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and increase in share price, which look fairly placed for a good run in the second half of 2018:Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) is one of the leading biotech companies in the world. Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva, Blincyto, Vectibix, Kyprolis – are performing well.  The recent approval of migraine candidate, Aimovig was a huge boost. The biosimilars portfolio looks solid too with approved products like Amjevita, Mvasi, and a deep pipeline. While Amgen’s key drugs are facing biosimilar competition, we expect the newer drugs to offset the decline. The company has already undertaken a restructuring plan, which should lower costs and aid the bottom line. Amgen’s shares have gained 7% so far this year against a 8.6% decrease registered by the industry.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Athersys, Inc. (ATHX  -  Free Report) is primarily focused on regenerative medicine. The company’s patented and proprietary allogeneic stem cell product, MultiStem cell therapy, is its lead platform product. It is currently in advanced stages of clinical development for treating neurological conditions, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory and immune disorders, certain pulmonary conditions and other conditions in which the current standard of care is limited or inadequate for many patients, particularly in the critical care segment. Stem cell therapy has gained a lot of investor attention of late and companies with such candidates are in the spotlight.Athersys carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have gained 7.1% in the year so far against the industry decline of 8.6%. Celsion Corporation (CLSN  -  Free Report) is another company whose prospects look good.  The company is focused on developing a portfolio of innovative cancer treatments, including directed chemotherapies, immunotherapies and RNA- or DNA-based therapies. Its pipeline progress has been encouraging so far. ThermoDox, the company’s lead program, is a proprietary heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, which is currently in phase III development for the treatment of primary liver cancer.  Other candidates in the pipeline include, GEN-1, a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers.  Celsion has two platform technologies for the development of novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies. Immunotherapy holds a lot of potential as of now and the company’s impressive pipeline progress is a big positive for investors.Celsion carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have returned 15.7% in the year so far against the industry decline of 8.6%. Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc.  (AGLE  -  Free Report) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company, which focuses on innovative human enzyme therapeutics for patients suffering from rare genetic diseases and cancer. The lead experimental therapy, pegzilarginase, is being evaluated for the treatment of Arginase 1 deficiency, as monotherapy in arginine-dependent cancers and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda, for small cell lung cancer. The company is also developing a pipeline of additional product candidates targeting key amino acids and other metabolites, including homocysteine (and the oxidized form homocystine), a target for another rare genetic disease as well as cysteine, and its oxidized form cystine, and methionine, for cancer indications.Aeglea carries a Zacks Rank #2.

113,AMGN,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) and India-based Lupin Limited have entered into a partnership to commercialize a biosimilar of Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Enbrel (etanercept).Per the partnership agreement, Mylan will commercialize Lupin's proposed biosimilar in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Africa and most markets throughout Asia.We note Enbrel is approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. According to IQVIA, brand sales of approximately $11.6 billion for the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2017.Lupin successfully completed its phase III trial, etanercept, in Feb 2018. The company has filed the product with the European Medicines Agency and plans to file the product in other jurisdictions.Assuming approval, the biosimilar will have great market potential given the sales. Per the agreement, Lupin will receive an up-front payment of $15 million. The company is entitled to commercial milestones together with an equal share in net profits of the product.Mylan has one of the widest portfolios of generics and biosimilars and the addition of a biosimilar of Enbrel will further boost the company’s portfolio. Mylan’s biosimilar portfolio got a boost with the recent FDA approval of Fulphila, a biosimilar of Neulasta. The company had earlier won FDA approval of Ogivri, a biosimilar of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin.On the other hand, agreement with Mylan bodes well for Lupin given the former’s significant expertise and global infrastructure. Mylan’s stock has lost 11.5% in the year so far compared with the industry's gain of 0.8%. The stock took a hit earlier in the month after the company announced that the FDA will not approve its Abbreviated New Drug Application for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK  -  Free Report) asthma drug, Advair Diskus, yet again.Mylan had received a major boost with the FDA approval for a generic version of Copaxone 40mg. The company has more than 30 submissions planned in 2018. However, the generic business in the United States continues to experience pricing pressure.  Although volatility in the markets is expected to continue in 2018, yet these new approvals should position Mylan better in the year ahead and help it combat the decline in EpiPen sales which is also facing supply constraint issues.Zacks RankMylan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

114,AMGN,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a late-stage study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ABP 710, its biosimilar version of J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report)/Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Remicade, compared to the reference product for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ABP 710 is an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody.Data from the phase III study showed that ABP 710 was non-inferior compared to Remicade based on its primary endpoint, which was assessment of ACR20 at week 22. The ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria are used to measure the effectiveness of various arthritis medicines in clinical studies.  An ACR20 score means that a person's RA has improved by 20%.The data showed that there was no clinically meaningful difference between ABP 710 and Remicade.Amgen’s shares have gained 5.5% so far this year against a 7.6% decrease registered by the industry.  Amgen has 10 biosimilar products in its portfolio. Out of them, Amgen’s biosimilar version of Abbvie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) RA drug Humira, Amjevita, was approved by the FDA in September 2016 and in the EU in March 2017 for the same indications as Humira. Amjevita is the first biosimilar version of Humira to be approved by the FDA as well as Amgen’s first biosimilar medicine to be approved. Amgen will begin selling Amjevita in most countries in the EU this year and in the United States from January 2023.Amgen has collaborated with Allergan for the worldwide development and commercialization of four oncology antibody biosimilar medicines. Among them, a biosimilar version of Roche’s Avastin— Mvasi — is already approved in United States and EU while a biosimilar version of Herceptin, Kanjinti, is under review in the United States and EU. A biosimilar version of Rituxan — ABP 798 — is in late-stage development.Several of Amgen’s own drugs are facing biosimilar competition. Biosimilars are already having a negative impact on key products like Neupogen and Neulasta in the EU. In the United States, while Neupogen is already facing biosimilar competition, other key drugs like Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition this year. The entry of additional biosimilars in the United States will have a negative impact on the company’s top line.

115,AMGN," (0:25) - Is It Time To Buy Large Cap Stocks?(2:15) - Stock Screener Criteria (4:45) - Tracey's Top Stock Picks(15:00) - Takeaways On Large Cap Stocks: AMGN, CMA, CVX, HPQ, PCARPodcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #98 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.For the last couple of years, the large cap stocks dominated the headlines. The S&P 500, the Dow and the NASDAQ out performed the small cap indexes.But in 2018, the tide has recently turned.The small cap index, the Russell 2000, is easily out performing the large caps which have weakened on trade and tariff worries.But you know what that means. There’s value in some of those large caps now.Where are the buying opportunities?Screening for Large Cap Value StocksTracey did a basic screen to find cheap large cap stocks.She screened for stocks with a market cap above $10 billion and a forward P/E below 15. P/E is not always the best metric for finding value, but in this screen, it will be a good enough basic indicator to get the cheap stocks.She then added on the Zacks Rank, screening only for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) stocks. By having those Ranks, it should mean that earnings estimates are on the rise.It’s one thing to buy a cheap stock, but it’s a whole new ballgame to get a cheap stock that is also growing its earnings.The screen returned 62 stocks, which isn’t too shabby.Tracey narrowed it down to her 5 favorite names.5 Cheap Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now 1.       Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) is one of the mega-cap biotechnology companies. These have been out of favor for a while now. It has a forward P/E of 13.6 and rewards investors’ patience with a 2.9% dividend yield. Analysts are bullish with earnings on the rise for both 2018 and 2019.2.       Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) is a Texas-based regional bank with a market cap of $16 billion. In April, it raised its dividend 13%. It now yields 1.5%. Earnings are expected to pop 42% in 2018 and with a low P/E, it has a PEG ratio of 0.7. That means it is both a value and growth stock. That’s a rare combination.3.       Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) is one of the largest oil companies in the United States with a market cap of $234 billion. Earnings are expected to jump 130% thanks to the increase in the price of oil yet the shares trade with a forward P/E of just 14.4. You also get a juicy dividend, which was not cut during the oil price plunge years.4.       HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is one of the “boring” technology companies as it makes notebooks, desktops and printers. But one look at its fundamentals and you can see why its attractive. Earnings are expected to rise 21% in fiscal 2018 and analyst estimates are on the rise for both F2018 and F2019. It’s also really cheap, with a forward P/E of just 11.5.5.       PACCAR (PCAR  -  Free Report) is a global manufacturer of light, medium and heavy-duty trucks under the brands of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. It has a market cap of $21.9 billion and reported a record quarter in the first quarter. Orders for US & Canada Class 8 trucks were more than double a year ago, prompting PACCAR to raise its full year industry sales range. It’s trading at just 11x and earnings are expected to jump 32% in 2018.Wall Street has been ignoring value stocks for a couple of years.But the tide might be turning in 2018.Suddenly, the cheap large cap stocks are holding their own and, in some cases, even beating the returns of the major indexes.Should you be buying the big caps on this weakness?Find out the answer to this, and more, in this week’s podcast.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

116,AMGN,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics sector have probably already heard of Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Illumina (ILMN  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Amgen and Illumina are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.AMGN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.51, while ILMN has a forward P/E of 56.69. We also note that AMGN has a PEG ratio of 2.29. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ILMN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.94.Another notable valuation metric for AMGN is its P/B ratio of 7.82. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ILMN has a P/B of 13.18.These metrics, and several others, help AMGN earn a Value grade of B, while ILMN has been given a Value grade of D.Both AMGN and ILMN are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that AMGN is the superior value option right now.

117,AMGN,"Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that its generic arm, Sandoz, obtained approval for Zessly, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)’s Remicade, in Europe.Zessly is approved for use in all indications of the branded drug including rheumatoid arthritis, adult Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn's disease, adult ulcerative colitis, pediatric ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis.The approval from the European Commission is based on review of a comprehensive development program, including analytical, preclinical and clinical data, which confirmed Zessly matching Remicade in terms of safety, efficacy and quality.An approval was in the cards as the CHMP had given a positive opinion on the same in March.The approval will strengthen Sandoz’s already strong biosimilar portfolio with five marketed biosimilars (Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States).Rixathon (biosimilar rituximab), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat blood cancers and immunological diseases (also approved in the EU as Riximyo under a duplicate marketing authorization); and Erelzi (biosimilar etanercept), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat multiple inflammatory diseases.  With Zessly’s approval, Sandoz will now have six approved biosimilars in its portfolio. Zessly is the third biosimilar which has been approved by the EC in the last 12 months for Sandoz.The FDA also approved biosimilar Erelzi in 2016. However, the launch is pending in the United States due to an ongoing litigation with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).We note that Sandoz acquired the biosimilar of infliximab from Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2016 for the 28 EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein that form the European Economic Area.Novartis’ shares have declined 2.6% over a year, compared with the industry’s fall of 5.5%. However, Sandoz continues to face pricing pressure and sales are projected to decline in the upcoming quarters.Zacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

118,AMGN,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AMGN due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Amgen First-Quarter Earnings & Sales BeatAmgen reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of $3.47 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.23 by 7.4%. Earnings increased 10% year over year driven by higher product sales, seasonally low expenses in Q1, a lower tax rate and lower share count.Total revenues of $5.55 billion in the quarter marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.46 billion. The top line also registered an increase of 2% year over year.Quarter in DetailTotal product revenues increased 3% from the year-ago quarter to $5.34 billion (U.S.: $4.15 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.20 billion) as increasing demand for newer products like Prolia, Kyprolis, Xgeva, Repatha and Blincyto, was partially offset by lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.Revenues of Amgen’s erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), Aranesp, declined 11% from the prior-year quarter to $454 million due to lower demand, primarily due to increased competitive pressures.Revenues of the other ESA, Epogen, declined 10% to $244 million due to lower selling price owing to a newly negotiated contract with DaVita Inc.Neulasta revenues declined 5% to $1.16 billion from the year-ago period due to lower demand and unfavorable comparisons to last year’s first quarter. Increased competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies is hurting demand for Neulasta. However, the Neulasta Onpro kit (on-body injector) continues to perform well, commanding a market share of about 62% in the United States for all Neulasta sales. Amgen is optimistic that it will see more global utilization of Onpro in 2018.Neupogen recorded a 30% decline in sales to $103 million due to biosimilar competition in the United States.Enbrel delivered revenues of $1.11 billion declined 6% from the year-ago quarter due to lower selling prices and increased competition, which hurt demand. Unfavorable comparisons to last year’s first quarter, which benefited from favorable changes in accounting estimates, also hurt Enbrel sales.Prolia revenues came in at $494 million, up 16% from the year-ago quarter due to higher demand. The osteoporosis drug witnessed continued growth in new patient starts and strong repeat injection rates, which drove year-over-year growth.Xgeva delivered revenues of $445 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter mainly due to higher demand.Sensipar/Mimpara revenues rose 18% to $497 million, mainly riding on higher demand and some inventory build probably due to a shift in reimbursement from U.S. Medicare Part D to Part B at the beginning of 2018.Vectibix revenues came in at $169 million, up 15%, driven by higher demand.Kyprolis recorded sales of $222 million, up 17% year over year, driven by increased demand and a robust uptake from outside U.S. markets. In Europe, the majority of sales came from triplet regimens and Kyprolis continues to take market share from Velcade.Blincyto sales surged 44% from the year-ago period to $49 million, reflecting rise in demandRepatha generated revenues of $123 million compared with $98 million in the previous quarter driven by volume growth. On the call, the company said that access to Repatha for high risk cardiovascular patients has improved over the past few months with the outcomes data included on the Repatha label.Other revenues declined 20.4% to $211 million due to lower milestone payment received than the first quarter of 2017.Parsabiv, launched in several markets including the United States, recorded sales of $41 million in the quarter. On the call, the company said that in the United States, Parsabiv has witnessed a solid uptake in the midsized dialysis providers.Operating Margins DecreaseAdjusted operating margins declined 70 basis points (bps) to 56.9% due to higher operating costs.SG&A spend increased 6% to $1.1 billion on higher investments to support growth products as well as the pre-launch preparations for Aimovig and bio similar products. R&D expenses were almost flat at $739 million compared with the year-ago figure.The adjusted tax rate was 13.7% for the quarter, a 4.8 point decrease from the first quarter of 2017.Amgen repurchased 56.4 million shares worth $10.8 billion in the first quarter and plans to repurchase between $2 billion and $4 billion of stock in the second quarter.2018 GuidanceAmgen raised the lower end of its sales and earnings guidance for 2018. Better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and a revised tax outlook led to the increase in the earnings guidance.The company now expects its revenues in the range of $21.9-$22.8 billion compared with the previous prediction of $21.8-$22.8 billion. Adjusted earnings are now anticipated in the range of $12.80-$13.70 in 2018 compared with the previous projection $12.60-$13.70.The guidance assumes the approval and launch of migraine candidate, Aimovig and Amgevita in 2018. Also, management seems quite confident that Repatha will become an important growth driver for the company with the inclusion of outcomes data on its label. Nonetheless, other than continuing competitive dynamics for Enbrel, possible generic competition to Sensipar and new competition for Neulasta and Aranesp could be the new challenges in 2018 and are accounted for in the 2018 revenue guidance.Operating margin is expected to be between 52% and 54% in 2018. Operating margin is expected to be lower in the remaining quarters of 2018 due to the timing of expenses. Operating expenses, as a percent of products sales, were seasonally low in the first quarter and the ratio is expected to be higher in the remaining quarters of the year and normalize to around 2017 levels.Adjusted tax rate is now estimated at approximately 13.5%-14.5%, lower than the past range of 14-15%, reflecting the impact of the latest tax reform.Hoping to achieve an improved cash position following the new tax law, Amgen plans to invest approximately $750 million this year in capital expenditures.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to five lower.Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus  Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus | Amgen Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, AMGN has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value and growth investors than momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, AMGN has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

119,AMGN,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that its pivotal study – KEYNOTE-407 – evaluating Keytruda-chemotherapy combination in first-line metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) met its dual primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”) and progression free survival (“PFS”). The drug in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated significantly longer OS and PFS versus chemotherapy alone.Merck’s supplemental Biologics License Application (“sBLA”) seeking continued approval of Keytruda combined with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta and platinum chemotherapy for treating metastatic non-squamous NSCLC is under review in the United States. The sBLA was filed based on encouraging data from another phase III study, KEYNOTE-189.The company plans to share data from the KEYNOTE-407 study with FDA and may expand the sBLA to include patients with squamous histology.The company will present detailed data from the KEYNOTE-407 study at the upcoming annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology next month.Shares of Merck were up 0.2% in after-market trading after the news was announced. This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 5.1% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4%.Notably, Keytruda is already approved as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 50% or greater. Keytruda also has accelerated approval to treat first-line patients with metastatic NSCLC in combination with Alimta and chemotherapy.Merck remains focused on developing Keytruda as monotherapy or combination therapy for the treatment of lung cancer with various mutation or histology in first-line setting in a bid to further reinforce its position in that segment. Lung cancer is an attractive market as it is the largest cause of death among all cancer patients.Moreover, Keytruda is the only immune-oncology drug, which is approved for the treatment of lung cancer in the first-line setting. We remind investors that Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) is also developing its immune-oncology drug, Opdivo, in first-line lung cancer. However, Keytruda’s early entry and positive data readouts from several phase III studies in expanded first-line lung cancer patients bode well for the company’s top line.We note that Keytruda is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck & Co., Inc.

120,AMGN,"The Biotech space remained a key area of investors’ focus with label expansion of a few prominent drugs and pipeline updates on a few others. While Amgen obtained the FDA approval for Prolia and Repatha, Exelixis also obtained approval for its lead drug Cabometyx for the first-line treatment of kidney cancer in Europe.Recap of Important StoriesLabel Expansion of Amgen’s Drugs: It is raining approvals at Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report). The FDA approved the label expansion of Prolia for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) in men and women at high risk of fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. Notably, this is the fifth indication for Proloa in men and women at high risk of fracture receiving systemic glucocorticoid therapy. The approval was based on positive data from a phase III study, which showed that patients on glucocorticoid therapy who received Prolia had greater gains in bone mineral density (BMD) compared with those who received active comparator (risedronate).Last week, Amgen obtained approval for a label expansion of Repatha in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) to reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in Europe.  Amgen and partner Novartis also obtained the FDA approval of migraine drug, Aimovig (erenumab).

The approval also triggered a milestone payment of $50 million to Exelixis from Ipsen of which approximately $46 million was recognized as collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2018. The payment will be made by Ipsen within the next 70 days. (Read more: Exelixis' Cabometyx Gets EU Nod for First-Line Kidney Cancer)Regeneron Announces Data on Dupixent: Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that a pivotal phase III trial evaluating Dupixent for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents (ages 12-17) met its primary and key secondary endpoints. The results show that Dupixent as monotherapy significantly improved measures of overall disease severity, skin clearing, itching and certain health-related quality of life measures.The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) also published detailed results from two phase III trials (QUEST and VENTURE) on Dupixent for the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma. The results showed that Dupixent significantly reduced the risk of severe asthma attacks (exacerbations), improved lung function and reduced dependence on oral corticosteroids (OCS).The drug also demonstrated significant improvements in the key primary and secondary endpoints across the overall populations in both QUEST and VENTURE studies. Patients with more severe type 2 inflammatory asthma experienced the greatest benefit. (Read more: Sanofi Eczema Drug Dupixent Succeeds in Adolescents Study)Both the companies also announced that data evaluating cemiplimab as a potential treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from a phase I will be shared at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.Lexicon/Sanofi’s Drug Accepted by FDA: Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (LXRX  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi announced that the FDA has accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for diabetes drug Zynquista (sotagliflozin). Zynquista is an investigational oral dual inhibitor of SGLT-1 and SGLT-2, proteins that influence how the intestines and kidneys absorb and eliminate sugar (glucose), resulting in improved glucose control and additional clinical benefits.The FDA action date is expected to be Mar 22, 2019 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). Earlier in 2018, Sanofi also submitted a regulatory application to the European Medicines Agency.Nabriva Therapeutics Announces Positive Data on Lefamulin: Nabriva Therapeutics plc (NBRV  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from the phase III trial, LEAP (Lefamulin Evaluation Against Pneumonia) 2, on lefamulin. The trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of five days of oral lefamulin compared with seven days of oral moxifloxacin in adult patients with moderate community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).Lefamulin met the FDA primary endpoint of non-inferiority compared with moxifloxacin for early clinical response (ECR) assessed 72-120 hours following initiation of therapy with the intent to treat (ITT) patient population. The company plans to file a New Drug Application with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2018. However, the stock fell as investors were wary of the rate of treatment-emergent adverse events observed in the lefamulin arm.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index lost 0.74% over the last five trading sessions. Among the major biotech stocks, Gilead gained 0.41%.

121,AMGN,"Shares of Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) have declined 4.4% since it reported its first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30. In fact, so far this year, Allergan’s share price has declined 5.3%, compared with the industry’s decline of 6.8%.Allergan’s first-quarter 2018 results were strong as it beat expectations for both earnings and revenues. Earnings rose 11.6% year over year, driven by higher revenues and lower operating costs. Revenues increased 6% on an organic basis excluding the impact of M&A and foreign exchange. Not only this, Allergan raised its earnings and sales guidance range for 2018.Also, this year, Allergan announced successful study results from two late-stage studies on its anti-CGRP acute migraine candidate, ubrogepant and a line extension study on Vraylar in bipolar I depression. Meanwhile, its anti-infective drug, Avycaz gained FDA nod for a third indication in the United States. It gained EU approval for Mvasi, Allergan and partner Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Avastin.Despite such strong quarterly performance and positive regulatory updates, shares of this pharma company continue to decline this year.We believe this is because Allergan is facing loss of exclusivity for several of its key products and it will continue through 2018. This is what concerns analysts. While the first generic versions of Alzheimer’s treatment Namenda XR and Estrace cream were launched in the first quarter, that of blockbuster dry-eye drug, Restasis, Allergan’s second best-selling drug, is expected to be launched in the second quarter.A generic version of Delzicol is also expected to be launched in early second-quarter 2018. Allergan estimates that the products facing loss of exclusivity were worth$3 billion in 2017. Sales of these products are expected to decline significantly in 2018 with the introduction of generics.On the first-quarter conference call, Allergan management addressed this disconnect between its business performance and stock value. Allergan’s CEO Brent Saunders said it is conducting a strategic review of its business, which can unlock shareholder value.Management discussed several strategic options, which included incremental aggressive share buyback, divestiture of certain assets to concentrate more on key therapeutic areas, splitting the company and making smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Allergan has hired multiple financial advisors to help evaluate the different options.Regarding M&A activity, Allergan said that though a large merger is unlikely, it may make product/pipeline acquisitions that could strengthen its key areas of therapeutic focus. However, Saunders also said that splitting the company is not quite likely to be the outcome of the strategic review as it could prove time consuming, complicated and costly.We need to wait and see if management’s optimism surrounding these strategic options gets reflected in its share price, going forward.Allergan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked drug/biotech stock is Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ligand’s earnings per share estimates increased 7.4% for 2018 and 8% for 2019 in the last 30 days. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in all the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 31.79%. The company’s shares have rallied 36.7% year to date.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

122,AMGN,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (“GIOP”) in men and women at high risk of fracture or those who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.This is the fifth approved indication for Prolia. The approval is backed by increase in bone mineral density (“BMD”) achieved by the drug in a phase III study.The drug is presently marketed in the United States for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture as well as to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.Shares of Amgen were up 0.1% in after-market trading following the news. The company’s shares have rallied 1.5% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 9.8%.The phase III study evaluated Prolia for the treatment of GIOP patients in men and women at high risk of fracture or those who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy compared to Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Actonel (risedronate). The study comprises two patient groups – one with patients who have received glucocorticoid treatment for less than three months prior to study enrollment (glucocorticoid-initiating arm) and the second with patients who have received glucocorticoid treatment for at least three months (glucocorticoid-continuing arm). In both the arms, the glucocorticoid treatment was continued for at least six months.Data from the study showed that Prolia increased lumbar spine BMD by 3.8% compared with 0.8% by Actonel in glucocorticoid-initiating arm. Lumbar spine BMD in patients treated with Prolia in glucocorticoid-continuing arm increased 4.4% compared with 2.3% for Actonel.Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. This serious condition is presently treated with glucocorticoid treatment, which increases fracture risk within the first three months of treatment. Prolia can now cater to an expanded patient population and drive sales higher.Prolia is a key revenue generator for Amgen and is witnessing market share gains in both the United States and internationally amid competition from generics of other drugs approved for osteoporosis. In 2017, the drug generated sales of $1.97 billion, up 20% year over year.Prolia faces competition from several drugs, especially from generic versions of Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Evista (alendronate), Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Fosamax (raloxifene) and Novartis’ Zometa (zoledronate).Amgen Inc.

123,AMGN,"Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced full results from the phase III study, HAVEN 3, evaluating haemophilia A drug Hemlibra (emicizumab).The randomized multicenter, open-label, phase III study evaluated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of Hemlibra prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis (episodic/on-demand factor VIII treatment) in patients with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors.  The trial results show that Hemlibra reduced treated bleeds by 96% compared to no prophylaxis in HAVEN 3 study in haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. Moreover, in a subset of patients included in the study, who previously received factor VIII prophylaxis, which is the standard of care, Hemlibra reduced bleeds by 68% compared to their prior therapy.Almost 55.6% of patients treated with Hemlibra every week and 60% of patients treated with Hemlibra every two weeks experienced zero treated bleeds, compared to none of patients treated with no prophylaxis.Additionally, results from another phase III study, HAVEN 4, showed Hemlibra administered every four weeks provides clinically meaningful control of bleeding in people with or without factor VIII inhibitors.We remind investors that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Hemlibra in April 2018 for patients with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors, based on data from the HAVEN 3 study. The drug is already approved by the FDA for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.Hemlibra was also approved by the European Commission in February 2018 for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.Roche’s hematology portfolio includes approved drugs like MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva/Gazyvaro, Tecentriq and Venclexta.We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). Both companies are jointly commercializing the drug in the United States. AbbVie is commercializing the drug outside the United States as well.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Roche’s stock has lost 7.3% in the last six months compared with industry’s gain of 0.5%. Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

125,AMGN,"Migraine is a serious neurological disease, which has significant effects on patients’ daily life. Patients suffer from debilitating pain and physical impairment along with fear of the next attack. It is estimated that patients with frequent migraine attacks may lose more than half of their life to the disease.Last week, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced FDA approval for their drug, Aimovig (erenumab) for the prevention of migraine. Aimovig is the first FDA-approved drug specifically developed for the treatment of migraine by blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (""CGRP"") receptor.The approval was based on positive data from several mid- and late-stage studies.The drug achieved significant reduction in monthly migraine days and use of acute migraine medications compared to placebo, per data from these studies. Moreover, Aimovig showed three times higher probability in reducing migraine days by half compared to placebo in patients with  episodic migraine patients and who failed two to four prior treatments.With the approval of Aimovig, investors’ focus has shifted to CGRP drugs/candidates for the treatment of migraine. Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) respective anti-CGRP candidates, galcanezumab and fremanezumab  are under review in the United States. Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALDR  -  Free Report) is also developing its anti-CGRP candidate, eptinezumab, for treating migraine.Alder, in its first-quarter regulatory filing, stated that there are approximately 36 million people living with this serious neurological disease in the United States alone, including five to six million with episodic and chronic migraine. Migraine is ranked among the top 10 causes of years lived with disability worldwide.However, the traditional preventive therapies have tolerability limitations along with several side-effects. This represents a huge unmet need for new anti-CGRP therapies like Aimovig and other under review candidates. Per a CNBC article and Alder’s regulatory filing, the migraine market will be worth $1 - $2 billion in the next few years.Amgen has priced Aimovig at $575 for a once monthly 70 or 140 mg single-use prefilled SureClick autoinjector or $6,900 annually. The price will certainly pinch patients and thus the acceptance of the drug remains to be seen. However, insurance coverage along with Aimovig copay program may significantly bring down the cost. Moreover, potential approval to galcanezumab and fremanezumab in the coming months will increase competition, which may put downward pressure on pricing.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

While AstraZeneca’s asthma drug Fasenra failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage study evaluating it for an expanded indication — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”); Lilly’s migraine candidate galcanezumab met the same in a late-stage study, evaluating it for another indication — prevention of episodic cluster headache.Novartis’ multiple sclerosis (“MS”) drug Gilenya gained FDA approval for use in adolescents. Its CGRP antibody, Aimovig, also gained FDA approval for prevention of migraine. Zoetis (ZTS  -  Free Report) and Lilly announced acquisition deals.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly’s to Buy Another Small Cancer Biotech: Lilly has agreed to buy an early-phase oncology asset, AK-01, from AurKa Pharma to expand its oncology pipeline.

127,AMGN,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved their pipeline candidate Aimovig (erenumab) for the prevention of migraine.The drug is the first FDA-approved treatment, specifically developed to treat migraine by blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (""CGRP"") receptor. Aimovig will be available in a pre-filled self-administering autoinjector, SureClick, for a once monthly 70 mg dosage. Aimovig is under review in the EU.Amgen’s shares were up 1.3% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Year to date, Amgen’s shares have increased 0.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 9.9%.Aimovig’s approval is backed by positive data from several mid and late stage studies. The drug significantly reduced monthly migraine days and use of acute migraine medications versus placebo in studies. Data from a phase IIIb LIBERTY study in episodic migraine patients who failed two to four prior treatments showed that Aimovig has three times higher probability of reducing migraine days by half compared to placebo.New treatment options, specifically developed to treat migraine, are making their way, suggesting potential demand for Aimovig. Amgen has priced the drug at $575 for a once monthly 70 or 140 mg single-use prefilled SureClick autoinjector or $6,900 annually. We expect the drug to boost Amgen’s top line going forward.We remind investors that Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) also have anti-CGRP candidates, galcanezumab and fremanezumab, respectively, which are under review in the United States.A decision on galcanezumab is expected in the third quarter of the yearA FDA decision on fremanezumab was expected in June. However, earlier this month, Teva informed that it does not expect to get FDA approval for fremanezumab on its PDUFA date in June. This is because Teva’s manufacturing partner for fremanezumab, Celltrion, which makes the API, received a warning letter from the FDA this year that delayed the approval of the drug. However, Teva expects fremanezumab to be approved and launched before the end of this year.Amgen Inc. Price  Amgen Inc. Price | Amgen Inc. QuoteAmgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

128,AMGN,"The Dow snapped a record streak of wins to traverse a turbulent week. Trade-war related concerns continued to weigh on investors with President Trump expressing doubts over the success of upcoming negotiations with China. Additionally, the spike in 10-year Treasury yield also spooked markets, sparking off fresh inflationary concerns. Such fears were also stoked by encouraging retail sales numbers.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.4% on last Friday, marking its seventh straight session of gains. This was the blue-chip index’s longest winning streak since Nov. 8, 2017. Notably, healthcare stocks were down initially following the news that President Trump unveiled his new healthcare plan.However, the broad market recovered later after the announcement was not followed up by stringent measures. Low inflation data and weak dollar also boosted investors’ confidence in equities.The index gained 2.3% over last week. This was the blue-chip index’s largest weekly gain since March. Energy and tech stocks were major drivers of the U.S. stock markets. Oil prices first rallied on last Wednesday in the wake of United States’ decision to exit the Iran nuclear deal. This increase fueled a rally in energy stocks once again.Meanwhile, Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) shares jumped after celebrity investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) announced that it had bought 70 million shares of Apple in the first quarter.

This marked the blue-chip index’s longest winning streak since Sep. 20, 2017. Stocks gained on the first trading day of the week as trade fears subsided. President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that he was considering relaxing stringent sanctions that have been imposed on Chinese tech giant ZTE Corp. last month.The index lost 0.8% on Tuesday after the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note hit a seven-year high. This, in turn, occurred after retail sales increased over two consecutive months, raising inflationary fears. Moreover, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad commented that trade tensions between the United States and China were far from over.The index gained 0.3% on Wednesday reversing previous day’s broad-based decline. In particular, retail stocks gained on strong sales data of April and Macy’s Inc.’s (M  -  Free Report) first-quarter earnings report. Moreover, Russell 2000, the benchmark index for small-cap stocks hits an all-time high. Overall, most stocks closed in the green as investors appeared to ignore concerns regarding rising yield on the U.S. government bonds and geopolitical tensions.The index lost 0.2% on Thursday after President Trump commented that trade talks between the United States and China may not be successful. Trump stated: “Will that be successful? I tend to doubt it,” ahead of the second round of trade talks between the two countries. Meanwhile, a decline in technology shares negated gains made by energy stocks.Components Moving the Index The Home Depot, Inc.

129,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) gained approval from the European Commission (EC) for its regulatory application seeking approval to include data from the cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER, on the European label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha.With the label expansion application, Repatha gets approval to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations by lowering LDL-C or “bad” cholesterol levels in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in Europe. Though Amgen’s shares have declined 0.1% so far this year, it is still better than the 10.2% decrease registered by the industry.The FOURIER outcomes data is already included in the U.S. label of Repatha, following FDA approval in December last year.Data from the phase IIIFOURIER study presented last year revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes on treatment with Repatha compared with the current best therapy alone.Repatha significantly reduced the risk of hard MACE (heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death) by 20% compared to the standard treatment with statin therapy. For individual components, risks of heart attack, stroke and coronary revascularization were reduced by 27%, 21% and 22%, respectively.Uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent. The priority for Amgen right now is to improve patient access to Repatha.The outcomes data (FOURIER) is the key to the commercial success of Repatha as it would broaden the use of the drug. With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label, patient access to Repatha is expected to improve. In fact, in the first quarter of 2018, Repatha generated revenues of $123 million compared with $98 million in the previous quarter driven by volume growth. On the call, management said that access to Repatha for high risk cardiovascular patients has improved over the past few months with the FOURIER outcomes data included on the Repatha label. With the data now also approved to be included in the European label of Repatha, we expect sales to increase further as patient access to the medicine improves.Amgen said it is working with European payers to remove prescribing barriers, improve Repatha’s affordability and expand access to the drug.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked biotech stock is Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

However, Procrit already faces biosimilar competition from drugs like Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Binocrit in Europe.Pfizer’s shares have declined 1.5% so far this year, comparing favorably with a fall of 3% recorded by the industry.The approval was supported by a comprehensive data package that demonstrated a high level of similarity of Retacrit with Epogen and Procrit. In May last year, the FDA’sadvisory committee had recommended approval of RetacritPfizer has entered into collaboration with Switzerland-based Vifor Pharma for the commercialization of Retacrit in certain channels.Retacrit is the third approved biosimilar in Pfizer’s commercial portfolio which includes Inflectra, a biosimilar version of J&J’s Remicade. The company is also developing 11 different biosimilar candidates in several mid-to-late stage studies.As the Trump administration continues to rally against exorbitantly high drug prices, the FDA has been actively approving generics/biosimilar of expensive branded drugs in a bid to bring down prices through competition.

131,AMGN,"Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) pipeline candidate, galcanezumab met its primary as well as secondary endpoint in a late-stage study evaluating it for the prevention of episodic cluster headache.The study (n=106) showed that treatment with galcanezumab(300 mg once-monthly) led to statistically significant differences in the reduction of weekly cluster headache attacks compared to placebo across weeks one to three of the two-month treatment period — the primary endpoint. Meanwhile, at week 3, a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients in the galcanezumab arm achieved at least a 50% reduction in weekly cluster headache attacks (secondary endpoint) compared to placebo. Safety and tolerability were consistent with previous studies evaluating galcanezumab for migraine prevention. Lilly said it will work with regulatory authorities to determine the best path forward for the candidate.However, a separate phase III study (n=237) evaluating galcanezumab in patients with chronic cluster headache did not meet the primary endpoint. According to Lilly’s press release, chronic cluster headache represents 10% to 15% of cluster headache cases. Episodic cluster headache accounts for 85%-90% of the cluster headache market.Galcanezumab is already under review in the United States for migraine prevention with a decision expected in the third quarter of the year.Galcanezumab uses calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody for the prevention of migraine. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Aimvog/erenumab and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) fremanezumab have been developed for chronic/episodic migraine prevention using anti-CGRP mechanism and are also under review in the United States. A FDA decision on fremanezumab was expected in June. However, earlier this month, Teva informed that it does not expect to get FDA approval for fremanezumab on its PDUFA date in June. This is because Teva’s manufacturing partner for fremanezumab, Celltrion, which makes the API, received a warning letter from the FDA this year that delayed the approval of the drug. However, Teva expects fremanezumab to be approved and launched before the end of this year.Meanwhile, the FDA action date for Amgen’s CGRP antibody, Aimovig, for the prevention of migraine, is May 17. Amgen looks confident to gain FDA approval, which will make it the first medicine in the CGRP class to get approval.Year to date, Lilly’s shares have declined 2.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.9%. Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

132,AMGN,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) reported a loss of $1.37 per share in the first quarter of 2018, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.43 but wider than the year-ago period loss of $1.32. Increase in general and administrative expenses led to the wider than anticipated net loss year over year.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $14.5 million surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.8 million.Quarter in DetailTymlos sales of $14.5 million increased 90% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Radius Health received the FDA approval for Tymlos in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. The company began shipments of the drug to wholesalers at the end of May 2017.Tymlos continues to gain traction with approximately 263 million covered lives and 88% coverage in commercial plans. Tymlos market share reached approximately 31% of new anabolic patients starting anabolic therapy (NBRx) and 13% of total U.S. anabolic osteoporosis market (based on Patient Months on Therapy, TRx PMOT) in the first quarter of 2018.Research and development expenses for the reported quarter were $22.9 million, up 17% year over year.General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter increased 26% to $48 million due to increase incompensation, travel related expenses and increase in selling,  general and administrative expenses.Pipeline UpdatesThe company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-transdermal. Radius Health suffered a setback when the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) adopted a negative opinion on the Radius Health’s marketing authorization application for abaloparatide-SC in March 2018. Consequently, in April 2018, Radius Health submitted a request for re-examination of the CHMP’s opinion.Radius Health initiated the phase III study, ATOM (Abaloparatide Treatment for Osteoporosis in Males) on abaloparatide-SC for the treatment of osteoporosis in men, which, if successful, will form the basis of a supplemental NDA seeking to expand the drug’s label.  The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll approximately 225 men with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.  The study will include a primary endpoint of change in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months versus placebo, and specialized high-resolution imaging of bone structure in a subset of the study participants.  Per estimates, male osteoporosis is estimated to account for approximately 10% of the total treated osteoporotic patient population.During the quarter, Radius Health finalized a development pathway for abaloparatide-patch after regulatory alignment with the FDA and entered into a scale-up and commercial supply agreement with 3M Company.Meanwhile, Radius Health will conduct a single, randomized, comparator controlled phase III trial of elacestrant as a third-line monotherapy in approximately 300 patients with ER positive/HER2 negative advanced/metastatic breast cancer as per the feedback from the FDA and EMA.  The results are expected to support applications for global marketing approvals if positive. Patients in the study would be randomized to receive either elacestrant or an investigator’s choice of an approved hormonal agent. The primary endpoint of the study will be progression-free survival. The study is planned to be initiated in the second half of 2018.A phase I study evaluating the safety and maximum tolerated dose of RAD140 in patients with hormone receptor-positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer is currently enrolling. Radius Health expects to provide an update on the RAD140 development program by the end of 2018.Our TakeThe company’s narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter was encouraging as sales of Tymlos are picking up. Radius Health saw a 103% increase in the total number of U.S. physicians prescribing Tymlos in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter. Tymlos’ share of new prescriptions by these physicians increased from 32% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 49% in the first quarter of 2018. The price of the drug was increased by 5.9%, implemented on Feb 22, 2018.Going forward, Radius Health expects Tymlos to capture on average 19-21% of the U.S. anabolic osteoporosis market in 2018, while anabolic market in the United States is expected to increase by 5-7% in volume.Radius Health’ shares have rallied 14.7% in the last six months compared with the industry’s  gain of 7.0%.  Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fracture each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Exelixis’ earnings per share estimates increased from 54 cents to 86 cents for 2018 over the past 30 days.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

133,AMGN,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.55 per share, significantly up from the year-ago figure of 57 cents. The bottom line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28.Shares of the company have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 14.9% versus the industry’s 12.3% decrease. Total revenues in the quarter under review surged 91.9% year over year to $56.2 million. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32 million.Quarterly HighlightsRoyalty revenues were $20.8 million in the reported quarter, down approximately 14.1% year over year. Royalties comprise royalties from the sales of Novartis' (NVS  -  Free Report) Promacta, Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Kyprolis and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals' (SPPI  -  Free Report) Evomela. Under the new accounting standard ASC 606, adopted at the start of this year, first-quarter 2018 royalties should be compared with second-quarter 2017 royalties due to the timing of revenue recognition. Royalties for the second quarter of 2017 were $14.2 million.License fees, milestones and other revenues were $30.9 million compared with $3.9 million in the year-ago quarter, mainly owing to a $20-million upfront payment received upon the licensing of Ligand’s glucagon receptor antagonist (GRA) program and other milestones received.Material sales increased to $4.4 million from $1.1 million in the year-ago quarter riding on the timing of Captisol purchases for clinical and commercial use.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 14.9% to $7.4 million, backed by lower spending on the GRA program partnered in the first quarter 2018. Moreover, general & administrative expenses rose 4.1% year over year to $7.6 million.Pipeline and Other UpdatesLigand out-licensed its GRA program, LGD-6972 (now named RVT-1502), to Roivant Sciences. Per the terms of the agreement, Ligand received a $20-million upfront license fee and is entitled to receive up to additional $528.8 million of milestone payments and tiered royalties ranging from low double digits to the mid-teens with the top tier applying to annual net sales above $3 billion. Roivant is responsible for all costs related to the program.Ligand also announced worldwide license agreements with venBio Partners, Ferring Pharmaceuticals and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals to use the OmniAb platform technologies to discover fully human antibodies.Additionally, Ligand initiated an internally funded program to develop through proof-of-concept contrast agents with reduced renal toxicity for diagnostic imaging procedures. This development program will leverage Ligand’s Captisol technology as well as the intellectual property obtained through its acquisition of Verrow Pharmaceuticals for $2 million in cash plus earn outs.The company made a significant progress with several of its leading partnered assets. Melinta Therapeutics launched newly-approved intravenous Baxdela in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by a designated susceptible bacteria and its partners made regulatory filings in new European Union and Argentina.Sage Therapeutics filed a new drug application for intravenous brexanolone for the treatment of postpartum depression and Retrophin initiated a phase III study with sparsentan for treating focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. 2018 OutlookLigand reaffirmed its previous guidance for 2018 and expects the full-year revenues to be approximately $184 million including royalties of nearly $116 million, material sales of roughly $23 million and license fees and milestones of almost $45 million with the potential for up to an additional $20-million in license fees and milestones. Adjusted earnings are estimated at $4.85 per share for 2018.Zacks Rank Ligand is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

134,AMGN,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 10. Radius Health, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Radius Health, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Radius Health, Inc. Quote Radius Health has a disappointing track record. The company has reported wider-than-expected loss in the trailing four trailing quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 8.93%.In the last reported quarter, increase in general and administrative expenses led to the wider than anticipated net loss year over year.Radius Health’s shares have lost 11.1% over a year as against the industry’s 3.1% gain.   Let’s see how things are shaping up for the quarter under review.Factors at PlayRadius Health develops therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases.The company’s lead drug, Tymlos, was approved in the United States in April 2017. The drug was approved for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as history of osteoporotic fracture and multiple risk factors for fracture. The drug can also be used for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $7.7 million in fourth-quarter 2017.Hence, we expect investors to focus on the uptake of the drug during the upcoming earnings call.Although the osteoporosis market in the United States has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women suffer from osteoporotic fractures each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's LLY  Forteo and Amgen’s AMGN  Prolia.Meanwhile, the company’s Marketing Authorisation Application for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) in Europe for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was under review.  However, the scientific committee of the European Commission, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), gave a negative trend vote on the benefit-risk balance for the marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for abaloparatide-SC in an oral explanation. The CHMP will therefore adopt a negative opinion on the same. The company was planning to get abaloparatide-SC approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture. Radius Health plans to seek a re-examination of the CHMP opinion.In December 2017, the CHMP issued a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and informed the company that it intends to refer the MAA to a scientific advisory group for additional advice. The company has earlier issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. The delay in getting approval in Europe is disappointing given the market potential.Meanwhile, the company presented positive data on elacestrant for breast cancer in December 2017. The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to elacestrant in October 2017.  In February 2018, Radius Health obtained scientific advice from the EMA regarding a potential single-arm monotherapy phase II trial of elacestrant in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Based on feedback from the EMA and the FDA, the company will conduct a single, randomized, controlled phase II trial of elacestrant as a third-line monotherapy in approximately 300 patients with ER positive/HER2 negative advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Hence, we expect the management to throw more light on pipeline progress.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Radius Health is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Radius Health is currently pegged at +2.42%.

Evomela is facing pricing pressure due to generic entry.License fees and service revenues were $2.4 million, down 26.8% from the prior-year quarter.Adjusted research & development expenses were $17.1 million, up 15.7% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted selling, general and administrative spending was up 30.1% to $20.4 million due to higher legal fees related to the termination of its former chief executive officer. The company is focused on the development of its two pipeline candidates, poziotinib and Rolontis.2018 Outlook RaisedThe company increased its revenue guidance for 2018 to the range of $95-$115 million (previously $90-$110 million). The company expects to have enough liquid funds to continue its operations into 2020.Pipeline UpdateSpectrum Pharma is evaluating poziotinib in two separate phase II studies for the treatment of lung cancer and a phase II study for breast cancer. In April 2018, the company published results from an analysis of the first 11 patients from the lung cancer study being conducted with MD Anderson. The candidate achieved an objective response rate of 64% in patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The company is planning to evaluate poziotinib in several solid tumors with exon 20 mutations.In February 2018, the company announced the successful completion of the phase III ADVANCE study on Rolontis. The candidate demonstrated non-inferiority to Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta in improving duration of severe neutropenia in patients with breast cancer.It has completed enrolling patients for an additional phase III study, RECOVER. Data from this study will be included in the biologics license application (“BLA”) along with ADVANCE study data to be filed with the FDA.The company expects to file a BLA for Rolontis in the fourth quarter of 2018.Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

136,AMGN,"The Biotech space remained a key area of investors focus as several bigwigs announced quarterly results. While Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) reported solid results, Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) reported dismal numbers. Among other developments over the week, Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and Sanofi announced plans to lower the price of Praluent, while Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) received a positive opinion for Prolia.Recap of Important Stories:Q1 Progress Report: Companies like Alexion, Gilead and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report), among others reported first-quarter results over the last five trading sessions. While Alexion and Vertex delivered solid results for the quarter, Gilead’s both earnings and sales missed estimates on wider-than-expected decline in HCV franchise.Following the Q1 results, Alexion raised guidance and also reported positive data on its long-acting C5 complement inhibitor — ALXN1210 which showed that patients with PNH can be effectively and safely switched from treatment with Soliris every two weeks to treatment with ALXN1210 every eight weeks.A tentative approval will bode well for Alexion (read more: Alexion's Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1, Guidance Up).Vertex’s first-quarter results were driven by the stellar performance of CF products (read more: Vertex Q1 Earnings Beat on Strong CF Products Sales).Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

Meanwhile, the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application for Prolia for this expanded indication is also under review in the United States with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of May 28, 2018.We note that the drug is already approved in the United States for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.In addition, the CHMP has adopted a positive opinion recommending a label variation for Kyprolis (carfilzomib) to include the final overall survival data from the phase III trial, ASPIRE which demonstrated that the addition of Kyprolis to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) reduced the risk of death by 21% versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd) and extended OS by 7.9 months in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.Regeneron and partner Sanofi to Cut Praluent Price: Regeneron and partner Sanofi announced that both companies will lower the net price of PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab) injection for more affordable patient access from Express Scripts.Consequently, Praluent will become the exclusive PCSK9 inhibitor therapy on the Express Scripts national formulary.  The agreement (effective Jul 1) provides Praluent at lower net price and enables streamlined patient access based on physician attestation.  Meanwhile, the FDA has accepted for priority review the companies’ Biologics License Application for cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“CSCC”) or patients with locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for surgery. The candidate was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation status by the FDA in September 2017.

137,AMGN,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 77 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents by 4.1%. Earnings rose 12% year over year as lower tax rates and share count, due to aggressive share repurchases in the quarter, made up for a weaker sales performance and higher R&D costs.The pharma heavyweight recorded revenues of $12.91 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.09 billion. Revenues however rose 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis due to positive impact of currency changes. Currency movement benefited Pfizer’s first-quarter revenues by 3%. However, on an operational basis, excluding the impact of currency, revenues declined 2% year over year.International revenues rose 8% (up 1% an operational basis) to $6.63 billion. U.S. revenues declined 5% to $6.28 billion.Segment DiscussionPfizer’s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 6% on a reported basis (up 3% an operational basis) from the year-ago period to $7.83 billion.While Ibrance and Eliquis did well in the quarter, IH segment revenues were hurt by lower sales of Enbrel, Lyrica and Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13. Meanwhile, unfavorable customer buying patterns somewhat hurt sales of Ibrance, Xeljanz and certain other products.Ibrance revenues rose 35% to $933 million in the quarter. Xeljanz sales rose 29% to $326 million. Lyrica sales declined 1% to $1.13 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 30% to $765 million. Chantix sales rose 3% to $251 million in the quarter.Revenues from blockbuster prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the September 2016 Medivation acquisition, also contributed to U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $159 million in the quarter compared with $168 million in the previous quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in the United States and lower revenues of Enbrel.Enbrel revenues declined 21% to $506 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis(RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the United States and Canada.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues declined 3% to $1.38 billion as higher international sales made up for the decline in the United States. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 12% in the United States due to lower government purchases than last year for the pediatric indication and continued decline in revenues for the adult indication. However, Prevenar 13 revenues rose 16% in international markets.Revenues from the Consumer Healthcare segment, which Pfizer is considering selling, rose 4% to $905 million. Global Oncology revenues increased 23% to $1.7 billion. Global Vaccine revenues declined 3% to $1.46 billion. Internal Medicine declined 3% to $2.35 billion. The Inflammation & Immunology franchise declined 5% to $869 million. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease rose 2% to $549 million.Pfizer EH segment sales declined 5% (down 9% operationally) to $5.08 billion.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products, primarily Pristiq in the United States and Lyrica in Europe and lower revenues from legacy Hospira products due to product shortages. Viagra sales declined 46% to $187 million due to generic competition that began in December 2017.However, in the EH business, biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter. Biosimilars revenues rose 53% operationally while emerging markets revenues grew 12% operationally.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $55 million in the United States and $145 million globally, other biosimilars brought in sales of $29 million (down 5%) from outside the U.S. markets.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses declined 3% (operationally) in the quarter to $3.29 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses rose 1% to $1.74 billion.In the quarter, Pfizer bought back shares worth $6.1 billion, including $2.1 billion of open-market share repurchases and $4.0 billion in accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March 2018.2018 GuidanceRevenues are expected in the range of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.90 - $3.00. At the mid-point, adjusted EPS is expected to increase 11% while revenues are expected to increase 4%.Research and development expenses are likely to be in the range of $7.4–$7.9 billion while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $14.0–$15.0 billion.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be 17% in 2018, 300 basis points less than 20% in 2017 due to expected advantage from U.S. tax reform.Our TakePfizer’s first-quarter results were mixed as it beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for revenues. Meanwhile, it re-affirmed its previously issued guidance for 2018.Shares of Pfizer fell around 2.2% in pre-market trading on lower-than-expected sales in the quarter. The top-line was hurt by declines in sales of key drugs like Lyrica, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, and Enbrel. Also, loss of exclusivity for some products like Viagra and continued supply shortages in legacy Hospira products hurt revenues.This year so far, Pfizer’s shares have increased 2%, against a decrease of 3.1% for the industry.Pfizer faces top-line headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, pricing pressure and rising competition. However, we believe that new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts, a lower tax rate and share buybacks will help the company achieve its guidance. Pfizer looks well poised to record profit growth in 2018.Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

139,AMGN,"Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) posted strong sales number for the first quarter of 2018 propelled by demand for new drugs amid biosimilar competition for legacy drugs.Sales came in at $14.5 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.8 billion. The Swiss pharma giant reported sales of CHF13.6 billion in the first quarter, up 6% from the year-ago period.The company reports results under two divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.Sales at the Pharmaceuticals division increased 7% driven by strong growth in Ocrevus and Perjeta, which more than offset lower sales of MabThera/Rituxan, Tarceva and Avastin. Diagnostics division sales climbed 5% primarily on the back of strong immunodiagnostic business.Results in DetailHerceptin sales grew 2% due to increasing demand in the United States. Perjeta sales grew 18% following increased demand in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings. Sales also got a boost from the FDA approval of Perjeta for use in combination with Herceptin and chemotherapy for adjuvant (after surgery) treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence in late 2017. Sales of Kadcyla (+6%) were driven by increasing demand in international markets.Strong Ocrevus sales further boosted the top line. The drug, used to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis, continued to gain traction in the United States. The company also launched it in Europe and other countries worldwide during the first quarter.Recently launched drugs, Tecentriq and Alecensa for lung cancer have also had an encouraging start. Immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq, recorded 29% growth in sales. Alcenesa sales were up 81% as it witnessed solid demand in the United States, Europe and in Japan.Performance of the immunology franchise was driven by increased sales of Actemra/RoActemra (13%) and Xolair (7%). Gazyva/Gazyvaro sales were up 27% due to growth in the United States and Europe.Ophthalmology drug Lucentis’ sales were up 6%. The growth was driven by increased demand for 0.5 mg prefilled syringes in wet age-related macular degeneration and continued growth in diabetic retinopathy.However, sales of Avastin fell 2% due to increasing use of cancer immunotherapy medicines in lung cancer. Sales of Rituxan/MabThera were also down 8% due to entry of biosimilars in the market.However, sales of Tarceva declined (32%) due to growing use of other therapeutic options. Sales of Xeloda (2%) continue to be hit by generic competition.Revenues at the Diagnostics division climbed 5% on the back of solid performance of the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions (+4%) unit, which was in turn, propelled by Immunodiagnostics (+5%). Tissue Diagnostics (+7%) and Molecular Diagnostics (+6%) also performed impressively.  Diabetes Care sales increased 5%.2018 Outlook RaisedRoche’s sales expected to grow in low-single digits compared to the earlier guidance of being stable or grow in low-single digits. The company expects core earnings to grow in high-single digits. The company intends to further increase dividend in 2018 in local currency.Pipeline ProgressIn January 2018, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) approved Ocrevus for the treatment of relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. In February 2018, the EMA also granted approval for Hemlibra for people with haemophilia A with inhibitors to factor VIII. In March 2018, the FDA approved Lucentis 0.3 mg prefilled syringe as a new method of administering the medicine to treat all forms of diabetic retinopathy.In April 2018, the FDA granted Hemlibra a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A without inhibitors to factor VIII.During the quarter, Roche acquired Flatiron Health and Ignyta, Inc. While Flatiron Health will enable accelerate development and delivery of breakthrough medicines for oncology patients, Ignyta’s lead molecule entrectinib targets tumors with one of two genetically defined gene rearrangements: ROS1 fusions in NSCLC, and NTRK fusions across a broad range of solid tumors.Our TakeRoche beat estimates in the first quarter of 2018 driven by contribution from newly launched drugs. The label expansion of key drugs, Perjeta, Tecentriq and Alecensa will further drive growth. Ocrevus and Hemlibra have been successfully launched. However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline.Roche’s stock has lost 12.9% in the last 12 months compared with industry’s gain of 8.4%.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars. Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderRoche carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc.

141,AMGN,"The biotech sector witnessed a series of events over the past week. Quite a few companies reported quarterly results over the week alongside announcing pipeline updates. Over the past week while Amgen revised its annual guidance, Biogen reported quarterly numbers wherein sales missed estimates.Recap of Important Stories:Prothena Plunges on Discontinuation of Study: Shares of Prothena Corp. (PRTA  -  Free Report) plunged as the company decided to discontinue the development of its lead pipeline candidate, NEOD001. The candidate, an antibody, was being evaluated for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. A phase IIb study, PRONTO, did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Hence, the company asked the independent data monitoring committee (“DMC”) of the phase III VITAL study to review a futility analysis of the ongoing VITAL study. Thereafter, the DMC recommended discontinuation of the VITAL study for futility.Hence, the company decided to discontinue all studies for the development of NEOD001, including the VITAL study as well as the open label extension studies. The decision came as a major blow to the investors as the company has a very limited number of candidates in its pipeline and NEOD001 was a lead candidate.Prothena carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Incyte/Lilly’s Drug Gets FDA Advisory Committee Nod: Incyte Corp.

The FDA had earlier issued a Complete Response Letter for the same. The drug is approved as Olumiant in Europe.Amgen Revises Annual Guidance: Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) revised 2018 guidance concurrent with its first-quarter results.

Earnings per share is now projected to come between $12.80 and $13.70, compared to the earlier estimate of $12.60 and $13.70.Biogen Misses on Sales:  Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) missed revenue estimates in the first quarter as Spinraza sales were drab.The company’s leading multiple sclerosis franchise also saw sales declining.

142,AMGN,"Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of $3.47 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.23 by 7.4%. The bottom line also increased 10% compared with the year-ago figure.Total revenues of $5.55 billion in the quarter marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.46 billion. The top line also registered an increase of 2% year over year.Shares of Amgen dipped almost 2% on Apr 24 in after-hours trading. However, the stock has declined 1.2% so far this year, comparing favorably with the 10.4% decrease of its industry. Quarter in DetailTotal product revenues increased 3% from the year-ago quarter to $5.34 billion (U.S.: $4.15 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.20 billion), driven by double-digit unit growth across all the company’s new and recently launched products including Repatha, Kyprolis, Prolia and Xgeva.Revenues of Amgen’s erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), Aranesp, declined 11% from the prior-year quarter to $454 million due to lower demand, primarily based on increased competition.Revenues of the other ESA, Epogen, dropped 10% to $244 million on lower selling price due to a newly negotiated contract with DaVita Inc.Neulasta revenues declined 5% to $1.16 billion from the year-ago period as lower demand was offset partially by favorable changes in net selling price and inventory.Increased competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies is hurting demand for Neulasta. However, the Neulasta Onpro kit (on-body injector) continues to perform well, commanding a market share of about 62% in the United States for all Neulasta sales.Notably, Neulasta and Epogen could start facing a biosimilar competition in the United States this year,which might hurt sales further.Neupogen recorded a 30% decline in sales to $103 million due to biosimilar competition in the United States. Zarxio, Sandoz’s {Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm} biosimilar version of Neupogen, was launched in the United States in September 2015 and is affecting sales.Enbrel delivered revenues of $1.11 billion, down 6% from the year-ago quarter on lower selling prices and stiffer competition, which hit demand. Prolia revenues came in at $494 million, up 16% from the year-ago quarter, backed by higher demand. The osteoporosis drug witnessed consistent growth in new patient starts and strong repeat injection rates, which drove year-over-year growth.Meanwhile, Xgeva delivered revenues of $445 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter mainly owing to higher demand.Earlier this year, Amgen gained the FDA approval for an expanded label of Xgeva to include prevention ofskeletal-related events (SREs) inpatients with multiple myeloma. Until now, Xgeva was only accepted for the prevention of SREs in solid tumors in patients with bone metastases. The approval for the expanded patient population has driven sales of Xgeva this quarter. Additionally, this month, Xgeva gained an EU nod as well for the given indication.Sensipar/Mimpara revenues increased 18% to $497 million mainly riding on higher demand.Vectibix revenues came in at $169 million, up 11%, driven by higher demand.Kyprolis recorded sales of $222 million, up 17% year over year, driven by increased demand and a robust uptake from outside U.S. markets.Amgen’s regulatory application in the United States to include the overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis was granted an FDA approval in January 2018. The study demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared with Takeda’s Velcade plus dexamethasone.Blincyto sales surged 44% from the year-ago period to $49 million, reflecting rise in demand.Notably, last month, Amgen announced that the FDA has granted an accelerated approval for a new indication of Blincyto to include treatment of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, generated revenues of $123 million compared with $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.Uptake of the drug, which gained an FDA approval in August 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent.In December 2017, Amgen gained an FDA approval to include a new indication — risk reduction of major cardiovascular events data — on Repatha’s label based on data from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER). With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label,Amgen was hopeful that patient access to Repatha willimprove.Last month, Amgen announced that the CHMP of the EMA has given a positive recommendation to its regulatory application seeking approval to include FOURIER data on the European label of Repatha.Operating MarginsAdjusted operating margins declined 70 basis points (bps) to 56.9% due to higher operating costs.SG&A spend increased 6% to $1 billion on higher investments to support new product launches. R&D expenses slipped 1% to $739 million compared with the year-ago figureAmgen repurchased 56.4 million shares worth $10 billion and plans to buy back an incremental two to four billion of its shares in the second quarter of 2018.2018 Guidance RevisedThe company now expects its revenues in the range of $21.9-$22.8 billion compared with the previous prediction of $21.8-$22.8 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric in the current year stands at $22.70 billion.Adjusted earnings are now anticipated in the range of $12.80-$13.70 in 2018 compared with the previous projection $12.60-$13.70. The consensus mark for the metric in the current year was pegged at $13.28 per share.Adjusted tax rate is now estimated at approximately 13.5%-14.5%, lower than the past range of 14-15%, reflecting the impact of the latest tax reform.Hoping to achieve an improved cash position following the tax law, Amgen plans to invest approximately $750 million this year in capital expenditures.Amgen Inc.

143,AMGN,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25 after market close. BioMarin delivered a negative earnings surprise of 25.0% in the last quarter.BioMarin’s earnings track record has been decent, with the company beating estimates in three of the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 63.71%.BioMarin shares have declined 8% this year so far. This compares favorably with 9.1% decrease registered by the industry during this period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayKey orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, which drove BioMarin’s top line in the past few quarters, are likely to maintain the trend this quarter too. Robust patient growth and penetration should propel the drugs’ sales.Also, Naglazyme and Vimzin revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to inconsistent ordering patterns from some countries. On the fourth quarter 2017 conference call, the company had said that it is cautiously optimistic that sales in Brazil will be steady in 2018 but uneven buying patterns may be observed quarter to quarter.Nevertheless, the drugs continue to witness steady patient growth and we expect the trend to continue this quarter.We expect management to discuss how the pipeline is progressing on the conference call. Brineura, for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease – a form of Batten disease  – was approved in both the United States and EU last year.  Brineura generated sales of around $9 million in 2017. On the Q4 call, the company said that the focus on the initial stages of launch is on disease awareness and early diagnosis The company mentioned that new site readiness can take longer than expected, which suggests slower revenue ramp up.On the Q1 investor call, we also expect management to comment on the launch preparation for pegvaliase. Pegvaliase, developed for treating phenylketonuria (PKU), is under review in the United States with the FDA expected to give its decision in May.Regarding pegvaliase launch, on the Q4 call management had informed that the initial sales ramp-up of pegvaliase would be slow due to education on disease awareness and lower doses per patient in the induction titration phase.  Also, the company mentioned that it expects to price pegvaliase at a modest premium to Kuvan (net annual treatment cost of about $150,000). An update is expected at the upcoming call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -17.99% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 13 cents while the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged lower at 10 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: BioMarin’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Apr 26, has an Earnings ESP of +2.09% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amgen, Inc.

In the last reported quarter, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 5.17%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayVertex’s cystic fibrosis (""CF"") drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — performed consistently in 2017, with sales rising almost 30%. We expect this positive trend to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, the company announced on its last quarter earnings call that first-quarter revenues will be unfavorably impacted by higher gross to net revenue adjustments and buildup of channel inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017.In January 2018, Vertex announced that an extension of the marketing application for Orkambi was approved in Europe. With the approval, Orkambi’s marketing label in EU will now include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation, expanding patient population by about 3,400. The expanded patient population is expected to boost sales of the drug. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orkambi’s sales in the first quarter is $368 million.In 2017, Kalydeco received approval for two line extensions including in patients 2 years and older with certain residual mutations in CFTR gene. The drug generated significant sales last year due to rapid uptake in expanded patient population and we expect the trend to continue. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Kalydeco sales is pegged at $228 millionIn a boost to Vertex’s CF franchise, the FDA approved Vertex’s third CF drug, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, in February 2018. The drug is under review in Europe. However, we expect the new drug to contribute minimally to first-quarter sales. We expect the company to provide update on Symdeko’s commercialization plan and its initial uptake.The company remains focused on development of its triple-combination regimens. During the quarter, Vertex advanced VX-659 and VX-445 for phase III development. Also, two phase III studies were initiated, evaluating VX-659 in combination with tezacaftor and Kalydeco (ivacaftor) in CF patients.Investor focus on the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth of Vertex. The company is also likely to provide full year revenue guidance including Symdeko sales on the call.However, operating expenses are likely to be on the higher side due to initiation of two pivotal studies and launch of Symdeko.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Vertex is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (62 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (57 cents), stands at +8.28%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Vertex has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its results on May 4.

145,AMGN,"The first-quarter 2018 earnings season started on a solid note, showing signs of yet another reporting cycle emerging strong. Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 S&P 500 members — accounting for 17.4% of the index — have already released financial figures as of Apr 20, 2018.Total earnings for these index participants jumped 25% from the year-ago quarter, driven by 10.7% improved revenues. The beat ratio was 82.8% for the bottom line and 67.8% for the top line.Further good news is that the ongoing earnings phase seems to have also begun encouragingly for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among the major large cap players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off the season strongly, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings as well as sales in first-quarter 2018. Another large cap player having reported earnings performance last week is Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), which also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations this quarter.We remind investors that though the Drug/biotech sector faced severe volatility since the last couple of months due to broader market pressure, mainly driven by the U.S.-China trade war, the sector is still likely to improve as the year progresses.We expect a surge in new product sales in sync with rising demand. This apart, a successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals, a consistently sturdy performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially to address rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing populace and an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that should keep the sector well in place.Also, according to the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 6.8% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 9.4% rise in earnings in the period under discussion.Three pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report earnings numbers on Apr 24. Let's see, how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company Quote Lilly is slated to release first-quarter earnings before the market opens. The company delivered a positive surprise of 5.56% last quarter. Moreover, the company’s performance has been impressive in the recent past with its earnings surpassing expectations in all the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4.08%.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Though the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESPof -0.48% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company requires a positive ESP to be confident about a probable surprise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings is pegged at $1.13 per share.Lilly’s strong uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo should compensate the sales decline of its established products, namely Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient. We expect this uptrend to find reflection in the results of the soon-to-be reported quarter. (Read More: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report)Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Biogen Inc. Quote Biogen is also slated to release first-quarterearnings before the market opens. The company’s track record has also been impressive so far. It delivered a positive surprise in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.91%. However, Biogen came up with a negative surprise of 3.31% in fourth-quarter 2017.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Though the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -0.51% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.93 per share. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sales of Biogen’s multiple sclerosis drugs improved. Patient growth across major European markets as well as growth in the strong emerging market drove international Tecfidera sales while inventory build in the quarter benefited U.S. sales. We expect this momentum to continue in the impending results of the soon-to-be reported quarter. (Read More: What's in Store for Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) This Earnings Season?).Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report)Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. Quote Amgen is scheduled to release first-quarter earnings after market close. The company delivered a negative surprise of 4.93% in the previous quarter. Amgen’s earnings performance has been quite robust with the metric beating expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing the same in the remaining one with an average beat of 2.93%.Our proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The combination of Amgen’s Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and a positive Earnings ESP of +3.34% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the upcoming report. The consensus mark for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $3.23 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Amgen’s latest products like Prolia, Kyprolis, Xgeva and Blincyto are likely to perform well backed by higher demand. This upside might make up for the weak sales on stiff competition of mature brands such as, Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen in the to-be-reported quarter.(Read More: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) to Report Q1 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Cards?).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

147,AMGN,"We expect biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after market close. Amgen delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.93% in the last quarter.Amgen shares have declined 0.6% in the past year. Still, this compares favorably with the 8.4% decrease registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been modest, with the company delivering a positive surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 2.93%.Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayThe first-quarter usually generates the lowest product sales for Amgen.Amgen’s newer products like Prolia, Kyprolis, Xgeva and Blincyto are likely to perform well backed by higher demand. This will make up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.In 2017 and early 2018, Amgen gained FDA approval to include overall survival data in the labels for Kyprolis and Blincyto, which may reflect in first-quarter sales of these drugs. In January, Xgeva gained FDA approval for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma. The label extension can boost sales of the drug.Neulasta demand is being hurt by competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapiesNeupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States, mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of NeupogenWe expect Neulasta and Neupogen first-quarter sales to be hurt by competitive dynamics. Neulasta and Epogen are expected to start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year. Also, Sensipar sales are likely to decline sharply the soon-to-be reported quarter as the drug lost patent exclusivity in March 2018.Enbrel sales are expected to be hurt by increased pricing and competitive pressure. Enbrel is one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues.On the fourth-quarter conference call, Amgen said that sales of Enbrel in the first quarter are expected to be the lowest in 2018, representing approximately 20% of full-year sales. Also Repatha sales in the first quarter are expected to be relatively flat sequentially hurt by insurance verifications and patient out-of-pocket costs. Also investors will be keen to know if sales of Repatha have improved with the inclusion of FOURIER outcomes data on its label.Amgen and partner Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug Avastin, Mvasi was approved in EU in January, which should boost first-quarter sales of the drug.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments on the preparations for the potential launch of migraine candidate, Aimovig. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Aimovig biologics license application (BLA) in mid-May.Meanwhile, higher investments to support product launches is likely to result in higher SG&A costs in the to-be reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.34 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.23 per share) is +3.34%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Apr 26, has an Earnings ESP of +2.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.

148,AMGN,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.31%.Biogen’s shares have declined 16.5% this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 8.4% in the same time frame.Biogen’s earnings performance has been decent so far, having delivered a positive surprise in three of the last four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 6.91%.Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Biogen Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcementFactors to ConsiderIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Biogen witnessed higher sales of its multiple sclerosis drugs. Patient growth across major European markets and strong emerging market growth drove international Tecfidera sales while a $20 million inventory build in the quarter benefited U.S. sales. However, on the call, Biogen mentioned that seasonality and absence of inventory build (that benefitted fourth quarter 2017 results) will hurt the performance of its MS franchise in the first quarter.Continued competitive pressure, especially from Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) newly launched MS drug, Ocrevus will hurt the performance of Biogen’s MS franchise, particularly sales of Tysabri. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Tecfidera for the first quarter is pegged at $1.02 billion while that for Tysabri (Global In-Market sales) is $462 million.On the fourth-quarter conference call, Biogen said that since Ocrevus launch, it has witnessed a decrease in the number of patient starts and an increase in discontinuation of Tysabri in the United States. The negative trend may continue this quarter.The combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy are expected to decline with patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta is unlikely to have made any significant contribution to revenues in the quarter. In March, Biogen and partner AbbVie announced their decision to withdraw Zinbryta from the markets, less than two years of its approval, due to growing safety concerns and limited commercial adoption of the drug due to its restrictive label. Both companies decided to discontinue marketing of the drug on grounds of the complex and evolving benefit/risk profile of Zinbryta.  An update is expected on the first-quarter conference call.Biogen’s newly launched drug Spinraza approved for spinal muscular atrophy is likely to see strong demand trends, particularly in international markets. On the fourth-quarter conference call, Biogen management had said that in 2018, a significant portion of Spinraza’s revenue growth is expected to come from outside the United States.Biogen’s biosimilar products - Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) are also generating significant revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.On the fourth-quarter call, the company had also said that operating expenses are expected to be sequentially lower in the first quarter. However, earnings growth is expected to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of the yearEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.51% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $5.90 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $5.93. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Biogen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

149,AMGN,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off pharma earnings season on a strong note beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in the first-quarter 2018. J&J’s performance was driven by continued positive momentum since the second half of 2017 and improvement in Consumer segment sales.How Did J&J Perform in Q1?J&J’s earnings of $2.06 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01. Quarterly revenues were $20 billion, which also beat the consensus mark of $19.48 billion. Buoyed by its strong performance, the company upped its previously issued sales outlook for 2018. (Read More: J&J Tops Q1 Earnings Estimates, Raises Sales Guidance).J&J’s Pharmaceutical segment sales grew 19.4% year over year in the first quarter of 2018 due to strong sales in both domestic and international markets and favorable currency impact. Sales in the U.S. market rose 9.9% in the quarter while international sales grew 33.1%.New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Oncology sales increased 45% during the quarter to $2.3 billion, constituting almost a quarter of the pharmaceutical sales. Core products like Xarelto, Stelara, Zytiga, Simponi/Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna also contributed to growth. Imbruvica sales rose 43.5%. The drug is marketed by J&J in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Edurant sales rose 40.9% while Prezista sales increased 11.2%.However, Concerta sales continue to decline due to generic competition. Sales of Risperdal Consta also fell 5.3%. Sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 12.7% due to higher managed care discounting, while blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) fell 16.9%.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including FDA approvals of prostate cancer drug, Erleada for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and line extension of already marketed prostate cancer drug, Zytiga in combination with prednisone in the first-line setting.These will certainly boost sales in 2018. J&J now expects revenues in the range of $81.0 to $81.8 billion, higher than $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion expected previously.Overall, in 2018, J&J expects the Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve. We expect other companies like Merck, Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Pfizer and Lilly to follow suit.Novartis Reports Encouraging Q1 ResultsNovartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) also reported this week. The Swiss pharma giant beat earnings and revenue estimates driven by strong performance of key drugs, Cosentyx and Entresto. Novartis reported core earnings of $1.28 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 and up from $1.13 recorded in the year-ago quarter. Revenues increased 10% to $12.7 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.3 billion. (Read more: Novartis Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q1)Sales of the Innovative Medicines division grew 6% to $8.4 billion driven by volume growth of Cosentyx and Entresto. However, entry of generics for Gleevec in the United States and Europe impacted sales unfavorably.Cosentyx sales increased to $580 million, up 35% driven strong growth in all indications and expanded access. Entresto’s sales increased 126% to $200 million driven by increased uptake.Oncology franchise (excluding Gleevec) grew 6% driven by Promacta/Revolade, Tafinlar + Mekinist, Jakavi and recent launches. However, sales at the Sandoz division were $2.5 billion, down 4% due to price erosion in the Unites States.However, this year so far, J&J’s shares have lost 8.8% and Novartis’ shares are down 6% against 4.3% decrease witnessed by the industry.Will Other Pharma Bigwigs Report Solid Results Too?PfizerPfizer's top line is expected to be favorably impacted by new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Moreover, line extension of Xeljanz, Sutent and Bosulif received in the fourth quarter of 2017 is also expected to bring in more sales.However, loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for Pristiq in the United States and Lyrica in Europe, and product shortages for legacy Hospira will likely affect sales negatively. Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales should continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition.In 2018, the company’s sales are expected to increase in low single digits from 2017 levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $13.03 billion and 73 cents, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in 2018 currently stands at $54.52 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 3.7%. Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).MerckMerck’s blockbuster drug, Keytruda, along with Lynparza and Bridion Injection is expected to boost revenues in the first quarter. Keytruda sales are gaining momentum through approval and launch of Keytruda in new indications, especially in first-line lung cancer.However, rising competitive and pricing pressure are expected to hurt sales of Zostavax, Zepatier, Januvia and Isentress.Animal health franchise sales are likely to remain strong in the first quarter.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $10.11 billion and 99 cents, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales is $41.81 billion, representing a 4.2% year-over-year increase.Eli Lilly (LLY)Sales of Lilly’s diabetes drugs, Trulicity and Jardiance are expected to grow driven by market share gains. Other new drugs such as Cyramza, Taltz, and Lartruvo are also expected to boost the top line due to continued strong demand. Verzenio is also expected to generate higher sales in the first quarter.However, patent expiry in some countries for Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa, Evista and competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents for Alimta will hurt sales of these drugs.We expect strong uptake of new products to offset decline in sales of established products this quarter too.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $5.52 billion and $1.13, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales stands at $23.43 billion, representing a rise of 2.4% year over year. Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY)Several label expansions of Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster cancer drug, Opdivo, drove the company’s sales last year and is expected do so this year as well. Moreover, cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, also demonstrated strong performance in 2017. We expect this trend to continue this quarter. Label expansion of leukemia drug, Sprycel, approved in November 2017 should bring in more sales for the drug. Moreover, continued strong performance of Yervoy and Orencia will have a favorable impact.However, genericization of Plavix, Avapro/Avalide and Baraclude in the United States due to loss of exclusivity is significantly hurting the company’s top line. The company also faces stiff competition in the immuno-oncology space. The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $5.17 billion and 84 cents, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales is pegged at $21.69 billion, representing a rise of 12.7% year over year. Bristol Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3.ConclusionThe new products of the majority of these companies are doing well and are expected to offset declining sales of legacy drugs due to loss of exclusivity. Moreover, most of these companies boast a deep and promising pipeline. Also, the new tax law boosts the prospects of strategic mergers and acquisitions and in-licensing deals/collaboration with smaller companies, which will strengthen the companies' product portfolio.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

150,AMGN,"Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) member Genentech announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to its hemophilia drug, Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh). The designation was granted to Hemlibra for treatment of people with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors.The designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and provide patients access to these as soon as possible.This designation is based on data from the phase III HAVEN 3 study in people 12 years or older with hemophilia A without inhibitors. In the study, Hemlibra prophylaxis dosed subcutaneously every week or every two weeks showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in treated bleeds compared to no prophylaxis. The study met its primary endpoint as well as key secondary endpoints with Hemlibra significantly reducing bleeding.Roche’s stock has lost 11.6% over a year compared with industry's gain of 8.9%.We note that the FDA approved Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to event or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in November 2017. Hemlibra was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in September 2015.In January 2018, the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) adopted a positive opinion for Hemlibra (emicizumab) for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients suffering from hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors. The CHMP has recommended the drug for use in all age groups. The Marketing Authorisation Application is being reviewed under accelerated assessment.A potential approval will further boost Roche’s hematology portfolio which includes approved drugs like MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva/Gazyvaro, Tecentriq and Venclexta We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). Both companies are jointly commercializing the drug in the United States. AbbVie is commercializing the drug outside the United States.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Roche Holding AG Price Roche Holding AG Price | Roche Holding AG QuoteZacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

151,AMGN,"Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) has announced full results from the phase IIIb study on its anti-CGRP receptor antibody, Aimovig (erenumab), which once again demonstrates a significant reduction in migraine frequency. The company is looking to get Aimovig (140mg) approved for treatment of episodic migraine in patients with a previous experience of two to four preventive treatment failures due to lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects.The phase III LIBERTY study randomized 246 patients with the aforementioned indication to receive Aimovig 140 mg or placebo for 12-weeks. Data from the study demonstrated reduction in episodic migraines by at least half in 30% of Aimovig treated patients with multiple treatment failures compared with 14% of patients treated with placebo.Moreover, over 97% of Aimovig patients completed the double-blind phase of the LIBERTY trial. No adverse events were found that might lead to discontinuation of treatment in the Aimovig group. Outcomes from the study will be presented at the 70th annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Los Angeles.Shares of Amgen increased more than 2% on Apr 17 following the news release. The stock has gained 0.5% so far this year against the industry's 7.1% decline. We remind investors that in January this year, the company announced that Aimovig met its primary endpoint in the LIBARTY study with significantly more patients under Aimovig’s dosage experiencing at least a 50% reduction from baseline in their monthly migraine days as compared to placebo. The study met its secondary endpoint as well.Notably, Amgen is developing Aimovig in collaboration with Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report). The companies are focused on developing and commercializing the treatments for migraine and Alzheimer's disease. If approved, Amgen and Novartis will co-commercialize Aimovig in the United States. However, Amgen retains commercialization rights in Japan while Novartis has rights in Europe, Canada and the Rest of World.Importantly, the candidate is under review in the United States for the same indication with a response expected in May 17, 2018. Notably, the candidate is the first investigational therapy targeting the CGRP pathway to having received a regulatory filing acceptance from the FDA for the given indication.Per the company, around 10 million people in the United States are affected by migraine. Among them, approximately 3.5 million are on a preventive therapy with 80% likely to discontinue the treatment within a year. Thus, approval of the drug will address the hugely unmet need of patients suffering the disease in the country.However, several companies, namely Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) among others are developing migraine treatments targeting CGRP.Amgen Inc.

152,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19.The Swiss pharmaceutical company’s stock has rallied 14.7% in the last 12 months compared with the industry's 10.6% gain.   Novartis has an excellent track record. In the last quarter, Novartis delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.4%. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.42% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the 2017 results, Novartis provided guidance for 2018. Novartis expects net sales in 2018 to grow low to mid-single digit. Novartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon and Sandoz (Generics).  Innovative Medicines is projected to grow in mid-single digit. Revenues from Sandoz is expected to be broadly in line or decline slightly. Alcon sales are estimated to grow in low to mid-single digits.The Innovative Medicines division recorded sales of $8.8 billion in 2017 as it combatted generic and pricing pressure. Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali.  Growth products — Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist and Gilenya continues to drive the top line.Psoriasis Cosentyx achieved multi-blockbuster drug status in 2017 on the back of strong growth in its three approved indications while Entresto’s sales benefited from continued access improvements and expansion of sales force in the United States.  The approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis, given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space.Additionally, Novartis' generic arm, Sandoz, is making efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio. The launches of Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in EU has boosted the company’s portfolio.However, sales from this division is projected to decline due to continued industry wide pricing pressures in the United States.Meanwhile, the loss of exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis' portfolio will continue to hurt the company's top line.  The company's blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, the EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016 and in the EU in December 2016, thereby leading to generic competition. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the United States and the EU. Further, the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno-oncology therapies.The ophthalmology division, Alcon was struggling and consequently, Novartis took a few steps to revive the business. The turnaround has been encouraging and management believes creating a standalone company via a capital markets exit could create additional shareholder value. A decision is expected in the first half of 2019, depending on Alcon’s performance in the future.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Novartis will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Novartis is 0.00%.  This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Novartis AG Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG Quote Stock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.Pfizer Inc.

153,AMGN,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) is partnering with Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co., Ltd. to commercialize a biosimilar to AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) blockbuster arthritis drug Humira (adalimumab). Adalimumab is developed by Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics.Mylan intends to seek approval and commercialize the product in Europe. The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) accepted a marketing authorization application for review for the proposed biosimilar to Humira in May 2017, and the companies expect to receive the EMA’s decision during the second half of 2018. Under the agreement, Mylan will have an exclusive license to commercialize the biosimilar in Europe and will receive an upfront fee from Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin. The company will also be responsible for the sales activity of the product in European countries. On the other hand, Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics will be eligible to receive a subsequent commercialization milestone payment and sales royalties. Over a year, shares of Mylan increased 6.2% compared with the industry’s fall of 27.9%.Humira is a TNF-inhibitor aimed at treating multiple chronic inflammatory conditions. It is approved in Europe for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis.We note that few days ago, Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) and partner Samsung Bioepis announced resolution of an ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie regarding Biogen’s biosimilar version (Imraldi) of AbbVie’s Humira, in the EU. Per the settlement agreement, Biogen/Samsung Bioepis plans to launch Imraldi in Europe on Oct 16, 2018.Also in the United States, Samsung Bioepis entered into a settlement agreement with AbbVie, which would allow the former to bring Humira biosimilar into the U.S. market by Jan 31, 2023.Notably, Imraldi is the second biosimilar version of Humira to be launched in the EU. Another biotechnology company, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), is also expected to launch its biosimilar version of Humira, in the EU come October this year as Amjevita, per a settlement with AbbVie.Notably, Amjevita was approved in the EU last March and approved in the United States in September 2016.In the United States, per settlement with AbbVie, Amjevita is likely to be launched on Jan 31, 2023.Mylan N.V.

154,AMGN,"We expect Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on April 17, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.16%.J&J’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 3.09%The J&J stock has depreciated 6.6% this year so far, which compares unfavorably with a decline of 1.0% recorded by the industry.Factors to ConsiderJ&J’s sales growth accelerated in the second half of 2017, backed by higher sales in the Pharmaceutical segment and improving performance in Medical Devices.In 2018, J&J expects the Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong, while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will likely continue to improve.We believe new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex, and meaningful contribution from Swiss biotech — Actelion — which J&J bought in June last year, will support the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the Pharmaceutical segment in Q1 is $9.5 billion.However, in the fourth quarter of 2017, revenues from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) products — added from the Actelion acquistion —declined sequentially. It is to be seen if PAH revenues improve in Q1.Meanwhile, biosimilar competition is expected to continue to hurt sales of the key arthritis drug — Remicade — outside the United States.However, J&J does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga, Prezista, Risperdal Consta, or Invega Sustenna in the United States this year.Regarding the newly-launched Tremfya, J&J noted at the Q4 conference call that the uptake of the product has been decent. The drug recorded sales of $47 million in Q4 which is expected to be higher in the to-be reported quarter. Meanwhile, we expect J&J to discuss commercialization plans for Erleada, its newly-approved prostate cancer drug, at the Q1 conference call. Also, J&J will discuss the initial sales uptake of Juluca— the first dual treatment for HIV developed in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) —  which received the FDA approval in November last year. Juluca is under review in the EU.In the Medical Devices segment, sales are expected to continue to rise in the Vision Care and Cardiovascular units. Diabetes Care unit will continue to remain weak. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the Medical Devices segment in Q1 is $6.7 billion.In the Consumer segment, global consumer category slowdown across many of the company’s markets will continue to hurt sales. However, recent acquisitions as well as new products will likely provide some support. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the Consumer segment in Q1 is $3.35 billion.Meanwhile, higher investments behind the new product launches will continue to thwart profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that J&J is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($2.03 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($2.01 per share), is +1.16%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J&J has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of J&J’s Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other large drug/biotech stocks that have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Amgen, Inc.

155,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced data from a phase III study which showed that treatment with its PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda monotherapy led to significantly improved overall survival (OS) as a first-line therapy in certain lung cancer patients.The pivotal KEYNOTE-042 study evaluated patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous or squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 1 percent or greater  (TPS of ≥1 percent). In such patients, Keytruda showed a significant survival benefit compared with platinum-based chemotherapyNotably, Keytruda monotherapy is already marketed for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater (TPS of ≥50 percent) based on data from the KEYNOTE-024 study.If the OS data from KEYNOTE-042 study are approved to be included in Keytruda’s label, the drug can be prescribed to treat an expanded lung cancer patient population, further reinforcing its position in the lung cancer market.The study will continue to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) — the secondary endpoint — based on recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”).Later in the year, Merck will present data from the KEYNOTE-042 study medical meeting and will also file regulatory application to get the OS data from the study included in the label of Keytruda.Shares of Merck were up more than 5% on Apr 9 after the news was announced before market open. This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 0.7% in the period against the industry’s decline of 3.6%.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being evaluated in several lung cancer studies across multiple settings and stages of the disease, both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy.Keytruda is the second largest product in the Merck portfolio. It is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.The treatment fetched sales of $3.8 billion in 2017, up almost 172% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, which further bolstered demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. In fact, Keytruda is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with several regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe and Japan. The new approvals expanded the patient population, driving up sales last year. The positive momentum is expected to sustain in 2018 as well.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

156,AMGN,"Every year World Health Day is celebrated on Apr 7. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) has been organizing the event for seven decades. This year, WHO is focusing on making healthcare services accessible to everyone, with the theme “Universal health coverage: everyone, everywhere”.Per WHO’s official website, who.int, half of the world does not have access to essential healthcare services. Moreover, rising healthcare costs are pushing as many as 100 million people into poverty. The organization wants to bring another 1 billion people under healthcare coverage globally by 2023.In a bid to accomplish WHO’s goal, many philanthropic activities are carried out by several trusts and foundations all over the globe. Given the increase in population and incidence of diseases along with growing awareness and healthcare coverage initiatives, the drug sector is expected to grow. Consequently, companies  in the healthcare space are expected to witness higher sales in the years to come.4 Stocks to ConsiderAhead of World Health Day 2018, we suggest four companies, which investors can add to their portfolio.We have chosen four stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), a VGM Score (V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum) of A or B, have witnessed positive current-year earnings estimate revisions over the past 90 days and with a market cap of more than one billion.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our PicksGlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) new products have been performing encouragingly.

157,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced results from a post-hoc analysis from the PARADIGM-HF trial on cardiovascular drug Entresto. The results were published in JAMA Cardiology.The results demonstrated that treatment with Entresto significantly improved seven out of 10 types of physical and social activities at eight months in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) versus previous standard of care.Moreover, the improvement in combined physical and social activity of patients treated with Entresto versus enalapril was equivalent to a difference of nine years of aging.Notably, these improvements were visible from the eight-month visit and were sustained during the study's three year follow up period.Hence, these positive results will further prove that Entresto not only reduces the risk of death but also has a positive impact on the quality of life of heart failure patients.We remind investors that Entresto is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with HFrEF. The drug was approved in Europe and the United States in 2015. Both the European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines and US heart failure guidelines have given a class I recommendation to the drug for the use of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with HFrEF.Currently, Novartis is conducting multiple studies on Entresto as part of the FortiHFy clinical program. This includes two large outcome studies. PARAGON-HF is the first phase III trial of Entresto in patients with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Meanwhile, Novartis continues recruitment in PARADISE-MI, a phase IIIb trial for patients at high risk for heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction, with results expected in 2020.The drug is projected as one of the key growth drivers of Novartis along with Cosentyx. Total Entresto sales came in at $507 million in 2017, up 195%. Entresto’s sales benefited from continued access improvements and expansion of sales force in the United States.  Novartis’ shares have gained 13.8% over a year, compared with the industry’s rally of 9.8%.Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali. The approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space. Strong performance from new drugs like Cosentyx and Entresto should propel growth going forward. The generic division, Sandoz also combatted pricing pressure strongly buoyed by biosimilar launches of Rixathon, biosimilar of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan and Erelzi, biosimilar of Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel.The company recently entered into an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) to divest its 36.5% stake in its consumer healthcare joint venture with the latter for $13.0 billion.

158,AMGN,"Eli Lilly and Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that a late-stage study evaluating its already approved cancer drug, Cyramza for the second-line treatment of liver cancer met the primary as well as secondary endpoint.While the primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) — the percentage of patients who are alive after a certain length of time —  the secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), the amount of time the patients live without their tumors growing larger.The phase III REACH -2 study evaluated the benefit of Cyramza as a single agent in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as liver cancer, who were intolerant to or experienced disease progression after treatment with Bayer (BAYRY  -  Free Report)/Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Nexavar and also had elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). According to Lilly’s press release, approximately half of all advanced HCC patients have a high AFP, a marker of poor prognosis.The results from the REACH – 2 study showed that such patients derived a survival benefit with Cyramza treatment following first-line treatment with Nexavar.Please note that Cyramza is already marketed as a single agent and in combination with another agent as a second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. It is also approved for use in combination with another agent as a second-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer.Lilly plans to file regulatory applications seeking label expansion of Cyramza for the specified subgroup of liver cancer patient population by mid-2018.Many cancer drugs are being approved based on progression free survival without evidence of benefit in survival or quality of life. However, OS data, once available, sometimes shows that the drug does not help people live longer. The fact that Cyramza offered an overall survival benefit in the REACH -2 study probably impressed investors, which led the stock to rise 1.4% on Wednesday. However, this year so far, Lilly’s shares have declined 6.2%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s decrease of 3.1%.Cyramza generated revenues of $758.3 million in 2017, recording a year-over-year increase of 23%. Meanwhile, Cyramza is being evaluated in several studies for additional indicationsPhase III studies of Cyramza in advanced urothelial carcinoma and first-line EGFR mutation positive NSCLC are ongoing. While OS data from urothelial carcinoma study is expected in the first half of the year, PFS data from the EGFR mutation positive NSCLC study is expected to be released in late 2018.In December, Lilly announced top-line data from a phase III study – RAINFALL – evaluating Cyramza as first-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer. The study met its primary endpoint of PFS but failed to improve OS. Lilly decided not to seek regulatory approval in the first-line setting based on the data from this study.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

159,AMGN,"It was a week that saw Edge Therapeutics crashing on news of discontinuation of its phase III study, Amgen’s Blincyto getting FDA’s nod for label expansion, EMA accepting Regeneron & Sanofi’s application for label expansion of Dupixent.Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important StoriesEdge Therapeutics Plummets on Failure of Late-Stage Study: Edge Therapeutics, Inc.  lost almost 92% after the company announced disappointing results from a phase III study, NEWTON 2 on lead pipeline candidate, EG-1962 for the treatment of adults with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). NEWTON 2 study compared the efficacy and safety of EG-1962 (nimodipine microparticles) to standard of care oral nimodipine in adult patients with aSAH. A pre-specified interim analysis performed on data from the day 90 visit of the first 210 subjects randomized and treated in the study demonstrated a low probability of achieving a statistically-significant difference compared to the standard of care in the study’s primary endpoint if the study is fully enrolled. The independent Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”) recommended that the study be stopped based on its conclusion that it has a low probability of meeting its primary endpoint. Consequently, Edge Therapeutics has decided to discontinue the NEWTON 2 study. Moreover, the company will reduce the size of its workforce, in order to preserve cash resources, which were $88.1 million as of Dec 31, 2017 due to the failure of the late-stage study. It was the company’s lead candidate and the failure of the study puts a question on its prospects.

The FDA notified the company that the agency was not able to complete a substantive review due to lack of sufficient evidence of overall efficacy of the candidate for the proposed indication. The FDA has also asked the company to conduct additional well-controlled clinical trials to be able to resubmit the NDA. Moreover, the FDA has also requested the company to conduct a bioavailability study to generate additional bridging data between ALKS 5461 and the reference listed drug, buprenorphine.  However, Alkermes plans to appeal the FDA's decision, requesting a Type A meeting with the FDA, to determine the next course of action and additional information required for the resubmission of the NDA (Read more: Alkermes Sinks as FDA Refuses Depression Drug Review)Amgen Gets Approval for Label Expansion of Drugs: The FDA approved a label expansion of Amgen Inc. ’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) leukemia drug Blincyto for the treatment of adults and children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (“MRD”) greater than or equal to 0.1% under accelerated approval basis. The acclereated approval was based on MRD response rate and hematological relapse-free survival. In addition, the European Commission approved a label expansion of Xvega to include the prevention of skeletal-related events in adults with advanced malignancies involving bone. Xgeva is already approved for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. With the latest approval, the European label of Xgeva will be expanded to include patients with multiple myeloma.

160,AMGN,"Shares of Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (RIGL  -  Free Report) crashed 13.6% after the company announced disappointing top-line data from a mid-stage study on lead candidate, fostamatinib, an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (“SYK”) inhibitor.Rigel’s stock has lost 21.8% in the last six months as against the industry’s gain of 3.2%.  The company was evaluating the candidate in a proof-of-concept phase II study in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), an orphan autoimmune disease of the kidneys.Patients enrolled in the trial were required to have a diagnosis of IgAN verified by biopsy and proteinuria greater than 500 mg/day. Patients were randomized into one of the three groups: placebo, fostamatinib at 100 mg bid or fostamatinib at 150 mg bid for 24 weeks. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy as measured by change in proteinuria and renal function.However, the trial did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint, which was mean change in proteinuria comparing fostamatinib dose groups to placebo controls in all patients studied. The mean change in proteinuria (sPCR) was -177, -577, and -158 mg/g for the placebo, 100 mg bid and 150 mg bid dose groups, respectively.Nevertheless, the initial data showed a greater reduction in proteinuria in fostamatinib-treated patients relative to placebo patients (this finding did not reach statistical significance) in a pre-specified subgroup analysis of patients with greater than 1 gram/day of proteinuria at baseline.  Patients with greater than 1 gram/day of proteinuria have an increased risk of disease.The company also expects to provide further analysis, including histology, data later in the year.   As a result of these data, Rigel will now seek a partner to collaborate for conducting follow-on clinical studies in IgAN  for funding. The concerned partner will be responsible for the subsequent commercialization of fostamatinib in an ex-US territory.Rigel is also evaluating fostamatinib for a number of other indications. While the failure of IgAN study was disappointing for investors, they do have something to look forward to. Rigel’s NDA for fostamatinib in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (“ITP”) is currently under review with an expected action date of Apr 17, 2018. Since the IgAN study failed, Rigel is now pinning hopes on this review. A tentative approval of the study will boost investor sentiment given the market potential. Chronic ITP affects an estimated 65,000 adult patients in the United States. However, it might not be easy for the company to gain market share for this indication given the presence of Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Promacta and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Nplate.Rigel is also evaluating fostamatinib in a phase II study for autoimmune hemolytic anemia.Zacks Rank & Key PickRigel currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

161,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission has approved its regulatory application, which was looking to expand the current indication for Xgeva for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma.Until now, Xgeva was approved for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. With the latest approval, the European label of Xgeva will be expanded to include patients with multiple myeloma.The EU approval was expected as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency had given a positive opinion recommending approval of Xgeva for this expanded patient population in February. In the United States, the FDA had granted approval for the same in January.Though Amgen’s shares have declined 3.8% so far this year, it is still better than the 4.7% decrease registered by the industry. The EU approval was based on safety and efficacy data from the pivotal phase III '482 study, which enrolled 1,718 patients. The head-to-head study, which compared Xgeva to Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Zometa (zoledronic acid), met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of the drugs in delaying the time to first on-study SRE in patients with multiple myeloma.Bone complications in patients with multiple myeloma can be quite damaging. Until now, bisphosphonates were the only treatment option available for bone protection in multiple myeloma patients. However, bisphosphonates may cause renal toxicity and lead to renal impairment. Xgeva, which is not cleared through the kidneys, offers a better treatment option for such patients.Xgeva is a key revenue driver for Amgen and generated revenues of $1.58 billion in 2017, up 3% year over year driven by higher demand. We expect approval for the expanded patient population in EU to help in further boosting sales of the drug.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked biotech stocks include Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

162,AMGN,"Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted accelerated approval for a new indication of leukemia drug, Blincyto. With the FDA approving the latest supplemental biologics license application (sBLA), Blincyto’s label is expanded to include treatment of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”).With this approval, Blincyto becomes the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of MRD in ALL patients. However, continued approval in this indication is subject to clinical benefit data from confirmatory studies.The drug is already approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in the United States and Europe.Amgen’s shares are down 1.9% so far this year compared with the industry’s loss of 4.9% during the period.The approval was based on data from phase II BLAST study, evaluating Blincyto in MRD-positive ALL patients who have achieved complete hematologic remission after receiving three or more cycles of intensive chemotherapy. Data showed that the drug achieved complete MRD response (no detectable MRD) in 81% of the patients. Median hematological relapse-free survival rate for the drug was 22.3 months.We note that MRD refers to detectable cancer cells in patients who have achieved complete remission by conventional treatment methods. Hence, the treatment of MRD will help to achieve better possible clinical outcomes in patients and delaying or stopping relapse of ALL by destroying the remaining detectable traces of leukemia.Blincyto has shown an impressive growth rate of 52% in 2017, with sales reaching $175 million. Sales are expected to improve further this year due to continued demand. However, the impact of expansion of label to include treatment of MRD remains to be seen.We remind investors that Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Besponsa had received approval for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in August 2017 in the United States, increasing competition for Blincyto.Amgen Inc.

163,AMGN,"It was a week that saw Protagonist stock crashing on news of discontinuation of a phase IIb study, Amgen’s Reptha getting a positive CHMP opinion, Verona Pharma stock rallying on positive top-line data from COPD study and the FDA accepting sBLA for Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo.Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important StoriesProtagonist Plummets on Study Results: Shares of Protagonist Therapeutics (PTGX  -  Free Report) plummeted on announcement of the discontinuation of phase IIb study — PROPEL — on its ulcerative colitis (""UC"") candidate, PTG-100. The company decided to discontinue the study as a planned interim analysis of PROPEL study by an independent Data Monitoring Committee determined that the study will not be able to achieve its primary endpoint of clinical remission.The interim analysis was done on data from first 65 patients who had completed the 12-week treatment with PTG-100. The total patient population of the study was 240. The company has notified that it will stop further treatment of patients currently in the study. Protagonist has also postponed its decision to initiate a phase II/III on PTG-100 in patients with chronic pouchitis, as it awaits full review of the interim data from the PROPEL study (Read more: Protagonist Therapeutics Stalls Ulcerative Colitis Study)Amgen’s Repatha Gets Positive CHMP Opinion: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) rendered a positive opinion on the company’s regulatory application seeking approval to include data from the cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER, on the European label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha.The application seeks for a new indication in the Repatha label for adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) to reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels. Concurrently, the CHMP gave a positive opinion for the marketing authorization to Amgen and Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report), ABP 980, a biosimilar of Roche’s oncology drug Herceptin. The biosimilar has been recommended for approval for the treatment of the same three types of cancer — HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, HER2-positive early breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.

The study met its primary endpoint as RPL554 demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements in lung function at all dose levels.Additionally, secondary endpoints were also met and support the potential clinical benefits of RPL554 for the treatment of COPD. The positive results from the study support the progression of RPL554 into later stage development as an inhaled treatment for COPD patients. Verona Pharma doesn’t have any approved product in its portfolio and the successful development and commercialization of the drug will significantly boost results.Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo sbLA Accepted by the FDA: The FDA accepted Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for blockbuster drug Opdivo in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of adults with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. The agency has also granted the application priority review and set an action date of Jul 10, 2018. The combination is already approved for a variety of oncology indications.Seattle Genetics Gets Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Enfortumab: Seattle Genetics, Inc.

The candidate is being studied in a pivotal clinical trial, EV-201 (NCT03219333), as monotherapy in this patient setting and in an early-phase clinical trial in combination with CPI therapy, EV-103 (NCT03288545). Both companies are also evaluating enfortumab vedotin in other solid tumors, including ovarian and non-small cell lung carcinoma.Biohaven Pharma Plunges Despite Positive Trial: Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. ’s (BHVN  -  Free Report) shares plunged significantly despite the company announcing positive top-line results from two phase III trials (BHV3000-301 and BHV3000-302) on migraine candidate rimegepant (formerly known as BHV-3000). Rimegepant is an oral CGRP receptor antagonist which is being evaluated for the acute treatment of migraine. CGRP receptor antagonists represent a novel class of drug candidates for the treatment of migraine.The results were statistically significant and clinically meaningful across multiple outcome measures as the candidate met the co-primary efficacy endpoints of superiority to placebo, at two hours post-dose, on pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome symptom. The company is on schedule to submit an NDA for rimegepant in 2019. However, the investors were not much impressed with the data when compared to rival Allergan’s migraine candidate ubrogepant.Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index lost 4.98% over the last five trading sessions.

164,AMGN,"Merck and Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) along with its Japanese partner Eisai Co., Ltd. announced that the latter’s anti-cancer drug Lenvima has received approval in Japan for an expanded indication. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima has been approved in Japan for the first line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer.The approval was based on positive data from a phase III clinical study (Study 304/REFLECT study) which showed that Lenvima demonstrated statistically significant non-inferiority of overall survival (OS) (13.6 months) compared to Bayer AG’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) Nexavar (12.3 months). The study also showed that Lenvima demonstrated highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements as compared to Nexavar in the secondary endpoints of progression-free survival. Regulatory applications seeking approval of Lenvima for HCC are also in the United States and EU.Following the approval in Japan, Eisai will receive a development milestone payment from Merck.Over the past year, Merck’s shares have declined 14.9% as against the industry’s 2.8% gain. This is the first approval for Lenvima after the two companies struck a global strategic collaboration last month to jointly develop and commercialize the drug both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for several types of cancer.Lenvima, developed by Eisai, is presently approved for the treatment of thyroid cancer as a monotherapy and second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) — a type of kidney cancer — in combination with Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Afinitor (everolimus). Also, late-stage studies are already ongoing to evaluate Lenvima in separate combination studies with Keytruda and Afinitor for RCC. Meanwhile, the Keytruda/Lenvima combination enjoys Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA in RCC.Merck and Eisai plan to jointly develop Lenvima across six cancer types and 11 potential indications. The companies will share global development and marketing costs, as well as gross profits from Lenvima equally. However, Eisai will book Lenvima worldwide product sales both as a monotherapy and in combination.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, exceeding 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with companies like Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck & Co., Inc.

165,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given a positive recommendation to its regulatory application seeking approval to include data from the cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER, on the European label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha.With the label expansion application, Amgen is looking to get Repatha approved to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in Europe.Though Amgen’s shares have declined 1.8% so far this year, it is still better than the 5.7% decrease registered by the industry.The FOURIER outcomes data is already included in the U.S. label of Repatha, following FDA approval in December last year.Data from the phase III FOURIER study presented last year had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes on treatment with Repatha compared with the current best therapy alone.Repatha significantly reduced risk of hard MACE (heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death) by 20% compared to the standard treatment with statin therapy. For individual components, risks of heart attack, stroke and coronary revascularization were reduced by 27%, 21% and 22%, respectively.Uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent. The priority for Amgen right now is to improve patient access to Repatha.The outcomes data (FOURIER) is the key to the commercial success of Repatha as it would broaden the use of the drug. With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label, patient access to Repatha is expected to improve.However, some analysts believe that though data from the study looks good, it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data.In a separate press release, Amgen and partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the CHMP has also given a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for ABP 980, their biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Herceptin. Amgen/Allergan are looking to get ABP 980 approved in the EU for the same cancer indications as the reference product, including HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, HER2-positive early breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.The companies’ application to get biosimilar Herceptin approved in the United States is under review with a decision from the FDA expected in May.Meanwhile, Amgen and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s another cancer drug Avastin, was approved in the United States in September last year and in the EU early this year.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

We note that Remicade is approved to treat Crohn's Disease in adults and children, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis.The positive opinion was based on a comprehensive data package that is expected to confirm the biosimilarity of infliximab to the original drug with analytical, preclinical and clinical data matching across quality, efficacy and safety.Earlier, the phase III confirmatory study in rheumatoid arthritis (REFLECTIONS B537-02) met its primary endpoint, demonstrating equivalent efficacy of proposed Sandoz biosimilar infliximab to the reference medicine as measured by the American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response at week 14.  Novartis’ shares have declined 4.5% over a year, compared with the industry’s fall of 3.7%.Novartis generic arm, Sandoz, is a leader in biosimilars with five marketed products. The marketed biosimilars include — Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States; Rixathon (biosimilar rituximab), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat blood cancers and immunological diseases (also approved in the EU as Riximyo under a duplicate marketing authorization); and Erelzi (biosimilar etanercept), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat multiple inflammatory diseases.  The FDA also approved biosimilar Erelzi in 2016. However, the launch is pending in the United States due to an ongoing litigation with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).EMA is due to review CHMP’s opinion.  We note that Sandoz acquired the biosimilar of infliximab from Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2016 for the 28 EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein that form the EEA. Per the terms, Pfizer retains commercialization and manufacturing rights to infliximab (PF-06438179) in countries outside the EEA.Meanwhile, Sandoz has quite a number of biosimilars in its pipeline. A tentative approval will further boost the company’s generic division. The company has also filed for approval of a biosimilar of adalimumab and pegfilgrastim in the EU.Apart froma strong generic portfolio, Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space.Zacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

167,AMGN,"Shares of Radius Health (RDUS  -  Free Report) fell 4% after the company suffered a setback once again in Europe.Overall, Radius Health’s shares have lost 7% in the last six months as against the industry’s  gain of 3.2%.  The scientific committee of the European Commission, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), rendered a negative trend vote on the benefit-risk balance for the marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for abaloparatide-SC in an oral explanation. The CHMP will therefore adopt a negative opinion on the same. The company was planning to get abaloparatide-SC approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture.Radius Health plans to seek a re-examination of the CHMP opinion.In December 2017, the CHMP issued a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and informed the company that it intends to refer the MAA to a scientific advisory group for additional advice. The company has earlier issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. The delay in getting approval in Europe is disappointing given the market potential.We note that abaloparatide injection was approved by the FDA in April 2017 under the brand name Tymlos for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.Tymlos continues to gain traction with approximately 259 million covered lives and 93% coverage in commercial plans. Tymlos market share reached approximately 32% of new patients starting anabolic therapy (NBRx) and 13% of total prescriptions in the anabolic market.Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly & Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Radius Health’s pipeline includes an abaloparatide patch for potential use in osteoporosis; elacestrant (RAD1901) for the treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer and RAD140, a non-steroidal, selective androgen receptor modulator which is being evaluated for use in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

168,AMGN,"Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the Lucentis 0.3 mg prefilled syringe (“PFS”) as a new method of administering medicine for all forms of diabetic retinopathy.We remind investors that Lucentis 0.3 mg is the first and only FDA-approved medicine to treat all forms of diabetic retinopathy in people with or without diabetic macular edema (“DME”). It was approved for this indication in April 2017.The PFS variation is expected be available by the second quarter of 2018.The diabetic retinopathy market has great potential as it is one of the major cause of blindness among working adults and affects nearly 7.7 million people in the United States.Lucentis 0.5 mg PFS was also approved by the FDA in October 2016 for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (“RVO”) and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV).Roche has a collaboration agreement with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) for Lucentis. While Roche retains the commercial rights in the United States, Novartis has exclusive commercial rights for the rest of the world.Lucentis is the lead drug in Roche’s ophthalmology franchise but faces stiff competition from Regeneron’s (REGN  -  Free Report) Eylea.Over a year, shares of Roche have declined 6.5% against the industry’s growth of 11.5%.  Roche performance in 2017 was strong driven by contribution from newly launched drugs. The label expansion of key drugs, Perjeta, Tecentriq and Alecensa will further drive growth. Ocrevus and Hemlibra have been successfully launched and the drugs are expected to bolster the top-line further.Roche dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs. The recently announced Ignyta acquisition will further strengthen pipeline.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars. Novartis has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin.Zacks RankRoche carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

169,AMGN,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) announced positive results from the phase III study, ACTIVExtend, at ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society's 100th Annual Meeting and Expo in Chicago.The phase III study, ACTIVE (Abaloparatide Comparator Trial In Vertebral Endpoints) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, multicenter, 18-month international study in 2,463 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of abaloparatide-SC 80 mcg to reduce the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.  ACTIVExtend is an extension of the ACTIVE trial. The trial enrolled patients who completed 18 months of abaloparatide-SC or placebo in ACTIVE to receive up to 24 additional months of open-label alendronate.Patients who completed 18 months of Tymlos injection or placebo in the ACTIVE trial were transitioned to receive 24 additional months of open-label alendronate, a bisphosphonate.Bone Mineral Density (“BMD”) was measured at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck from the beginning of ACTIVE to the end of ACTIVExtend. Results showed that BMD response rates increased in both the abaloparatide followed by alendronate group and the placebo followed by alendronate group from ACTIVE baseline through the 43 months of ACTIVExtend. Additionally, greater BMD response rates of more than 0%, 3% and 6% were noted in the abaloparatide followed by alendronate group versus the placebo followed by alendronate group at all three sites combined at 43 months. At each anatomic site, BMD increases of more than 3% and 6% were noted respectively at each visit and at 43 months.60.7% of abaloparatide followed by alendronate patients experienced BMD increases of more than 3 % at all three sites as compared with 24% of patients who received placebo followed by alendronate. The results from the ACTIVExtend Responder Analysis are consistent with the significant BMD response with Tymlos versus placebo observed in ACTIVE trial.We remind investors that in April 2017, the FDA approved Tymlos (abaloparatide -SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture — defined as history of osteoporotic fracture — multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.  Radius Health’s shares have moved up 3.9% in the last six months compared with the industry’s  gain of 6.8%.Tymlos continues to gain traction with approximately 259 million covered lives and 93% coverage in commercial plans. Tymlos market share reached approximately 32% of new patients starting anabolic therapy (NBRx) and 13% of total prescriptions in the anabolic market.Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly & Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.

170,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, has been accepted under priority review by the FDA.With the latest application, Merck is looking to expand the label of Keytruda for the treatment of advanced cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy. With the FDA granting priority review, a decision is expected on Jun 28.This is the first time that the FDA has accepted a filing for an anti-PD-1 therapy in cervical cancer. Meanwhile, this is the fourteenth regulatory submission for Keytruda accepted by the FDA. The sBLA was based in part on data from phase II KEYNOTE-158 study.This year so far, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have declined 1.6% in the period against 1.4% increase for the industry.Keytruda is the second largest product in the Merck portfolio. It is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.The treatment fetched sales of $3.8 billion in 2017, up almost 172% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, which further boosted demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. It is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with several regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe and Japan. The new approvals expanded the patient population, driving up sales last year. The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018 as well.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

171,AMGN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Amgen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.5x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Amgen’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having increased rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares unfavorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 34.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Amgen has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Amgen stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Amgen has a P/S ratio of about 6. This is higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well above the lows for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Amgen currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40%  of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Amgen a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Amgen might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘B’ and a Momentum score of ‘A’. This gives AMGN a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘A’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower, while the full year estimate has seen nine up and three down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 3.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus  Amgen Inc. Price and Consensus | Amgen Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAmgen is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 27% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

172,AMGN,"The Q4 earnings season for the pharma/biotech sector was scattered with a few small biotech companies yet to report. The releases so far provide us with a clear picture of the sector’s performance.Overall, the sector performed reasonably well. Among the biotech/pharma bigwigs, Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) beat earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced mixed results with earnings beating estimates and sales lagging the same. However, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) had a rather weak quarter as it missed expectations for earnings and sales and also issued a lower-than-expected sales guidance for 2018.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017. Ramp up in new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, favorable clinical study results, frequent FDA approvals, strong performance by key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep driving the sector. A faster drug approval process, the proposed removal of outdated regulations that push up costs and a slowdown in innovation should also prove beneficial.The year started off on expectations of a pick-up in M&A activity. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is expected to spur merger activity this year.Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), earlier this year, announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company, Ablynx, and haemophilia-focused biotech firm — Bioverativ.Banking on the positive trend and impressive Q4 performance, it might be the perfect time to cash in on the bountiful prospects in this growing market. Here we have picked three biotech stocks which saw positive estimate revisions post Q4 earnings release and also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings estimate revisions have the greatest impact on stock prices. Stocks with rising estimates have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index year after year. Hence, investors can safely bet on stocks that have been seeing an upward movement in earnings estimates. All the three companies have also seen a steady rally in the share price post Q4 results.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report)The San Diego, CA-based biotechnology company, Ligand, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The stock witnessed positive estimate revision over the last 30 days. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 21. It has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rise 9.8% for 2018 and 21.1% for 2019. The company surpassed earnings and revenue estimates in fourth-quarter 2017 mainly on higher royalty revenues. Additionally, shares of the company have rallied 16.8% post its Q4 earnings release.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report)The Tarrytown, NY-based biopharmaceutical company, Regeneron, witnessed positive estimate revision over the last 60 days. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 8. The Zacks Rank #1 stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings rise 9.7% and 6.4% for 2018 and 2019, respectively. Regeneron’s fourth-quarter results were impressive as both earnings and sales beat estimates on strong sales of the company’s key marketed drug, Eylea. Shares of the company have rallied 7.1% after it released Q4 earnings release.Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report)Based in Dublin, Ireland, Horizon Pharma carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings move 10% up in the last 30 days for 2018 and 14.9% for 2019. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 26. Shares of the company have gained 5% post Q4 earnings announcement. Horizon Pharma also beat earnings and sales estimates in fourth-quarter 2017 backed by strong performance by its Orphan unit. The company’s sales guidance for 2018 is encouraging as well.OutlookWhile 2017 was strong, this year is expected to be a vital one for the biotech sector as these companies continue to invest in pipeline, build global business and drive new product growth.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

173,AMGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced positive results from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial on Praluent during a late-breaker session at the American College of Cardiology's 67th Annual Scientific Session in Orlando, FL.The study was evaluating the long-term clinical benefit of Praluent initiation in patients with post-acute coronary syndrome.The trial met the primary endpoint as results showed  that Praluent significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (“MACE”) in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome (“ACS”) event such as a heart attack.Praluent reduced the overall risk of MACE by 15% (HR=0.85, CI: 0.78-0.93, p=0.0003). The MACE composite endpoint includes patients who experienced a heart attack, ischemic stroke, death from coronary heart disease, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization. The results from a pre-specified analysis also showed that the patients with baseline LDL-C levels at or above 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) experienced a more pronounced effect from Praluent, reducing their risk of MACE by 24% (HR=0.76, CI: 0.65-0.87).Moreover, no new safety signals emerged from the trial, with injection site reactions experienced more commonly in the Praluent group compared to patients on maximally-tolerated statins alone (3.8% Praluent; 2.1% placebo).In June 2017, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that two phase IIIb/IV ODYSSEY-DM trials in patients with diabetes met their primary endpoints. While the uptake of the drug hasn’t been encouraging, we note that the cholesterol management market represents huge commercial potential.We remind investors that Regeneron received a major boost when Praluent became the first PCSK9 inhibitor to be approved (July 2015) in the United States. The drug was also approved in the EU (September 2015). The FDA recently approved the companies' new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for a once-monthly, 300 mg dose of Praluent(alirocumab) Injection for the treatment of adults with high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The approval will expand the drug’s dosing options.Meanwhile, a phase III study evaluating Praluent in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2017. The sBLA for use of Praluent with apheresis was filed with the FDA, which has set a target action date of Aug 24, 2018. In October 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ordered a new trial on the issues of written description and enablement and vacated the permanent injunction in the ongoing PCSK9 litigation.  Regeneron’s stock has lost 22% in the last six months compared with the industry’s 8.2% decline.Regeneron’s fourth-quarter results were impressive as both earnings and sales beat estimates driven by strong Eylea sales. The   potential label expansion of Eylea, Dupixent and Praluent will further boost results.However, although Praluent is the first PCSK9 drug for hypercholesterolemia to get FDA approval, Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Repatha is also approved in the United States, the EU and Japan and poses significant competition.Regeneron and Sanofi announced a reduction in net price for Praluent in alignment with a new value assessment for high-risk patients from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review. The companies will take a precision medicine approach to address the burden of CV disease, focusing efforts on high-risk patients most vulnerable to future CV events, such as those who have suffered a previous coronary event and are unable to reduce their LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) below 100 mg/dL despite maximally-tolerated statin therapy.Zacks Rank & Another Stock to ConsiderRegeneron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Another top-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Ligand’s earnings per share estimates have moved up $3.78 to $4.15 from $4.75 to $5.75 for 2018 and 2019 respectively over the last 30 days. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 24.88%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

174,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced an oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd to jointly develop and commercialize the latter’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima, both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for several types of cancer. For the deal, Merck will pay Eisai an upfront amount of $300 million.Lenvima, developed by Eisai, is presently approved for the treatment of thyroid cancer as a monotherapy and second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) — a type of kidney cancer — in combination with Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Afinitor (everolimus). Meanwhile, Lenvima monotherapy is under review in the United States, EU and Japan for hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of liver cancer. Also, late-stage studies are already ongoing to evaluate Lenvima in separate combination studies with Keytruda and Afinitor for RCC. Meanwhile, the Keytruda/Lenvima combination enjoys Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA in RCC.Merck and Eisai plan to jointly develop Lenvima across six cancer types and 11 potential indications. The companies will share global development and marketing costs, as well as gross profits from Lenvima equally. However, Eisai will book Lenvima worldwide product sales both as a monotherapy and in combination.Other than the upfront payment, Merck will also pay up to $650 million for certain option rights through 2020, as well as $450 million as reimbursements for R&D costs. Other than these, Eisai will be entitled to regulatory/sales milestone payments of up to $4.36 billion.So far this year, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have declined 3.2% in the period compared with a 1.9% decrease for the industry.Keytruda is the second-largest product in the Merck portfolio. It is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.The treatment fetched sales of $3.8 billion in 2017, up almost 172% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, further boosting demand. Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from a strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer, as it is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with several regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe and Japan. The new approvals expanded the patient population, driving up sales last year. The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018 as well.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, exceeding 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.We expect Merck to present data from several key Keytruda studies this year, including a combination study with Incyte’s epacadostat in first-line metastatic melanoma. Also, Keytruda could get an approval for the relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma indication this year with FDA action expected in April.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

176,AMGN,"President Donald Trump’s biggest tax overhaul in decades has raised the appeal of buyback ETFs. This is especially true as a massive $1.4-trillion tax cut and the repatriation policy have prompted companies from almost every sector to boost their multi-billion dollar share buyback program this year.Notably, approximately $2.6 trillion in American corporate profits are sitting in overseas bank accounts, about half of that being in cash. The new tax law encourages these companies to bring this cash back home at much reduced rates (read: How Will Tax Reform Affect Buyback and Dividend ETFs?).U.S. companies have announced $209 billion worth of share buyback since the beginning of this year, according to the latest report from Senate Democrats. A California-based research firm TrimTabs stated that the pace of buybacks had exploded in February to a record $153.7 billion from $59.9 billion in January. Among the largest share repurchases so far, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) has been on the forefront, with its additional $25 billion buyback plan. This was followed by $22.6 billion for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), $15 billion for Pepsico (PEP  -  Free Report), $10 billion for Abbvie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and $10 billion for Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).Given this optimism, 2018 is expected to be the second-busiest year for buybacks since the bull market began in 2009 as U.S. companies are on track to return a record $1 trillion to their shareholders. An analyst at J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) expects companies on the S&P 500 index to buy back as much as $800 billion in shares of their own stock this year, representing a whopping jump of 51% (i.e. $300 billion) from $530 billion repurchased last year.About $100 billion of additional buybacks is the result of the tax savings and stronger earnings while $200 billion will be generated from the repatriation bonanza. Another analyst at Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) projects that buybacks will rise 23% this year to $650 billion (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs & Stocks From Top Industries).As a result, investors should take advantage of the ongoing boom in share buybacks through the following three ETFs:SPDR S&P 500 Buyback ETF (SPYB  -  Free Report)This fund focuses on the 101 top companies in the S&P 500 with the highest buyback ratio in the last 12 months. It follows the S&P 500 Buyback Index, charging investors 35 bps in annual fees. From a sector look, financials and consumer discretionary take the largest share with 28.8% and 23.9% allocation, respectively, while information technology and healthcare round off the next spots. The product has a lower AUM of $15.7 million and trades in a paltry volume of around 3,000 shares a day on average (read: Buyback ETF Hits New 52-Week High). PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW  -  Free Report)    This ETF tracks the NASDAQ US Buyback Achievers Index, which comprises companies that have repurchased 5% or more of their common stock in the trailing 12 months. It holds 131 stocks in its basket and charges a higher annual fee of 63 bps. Here also, financials and consumer discretionary are the top two sectors, with at least 29% share each, closely followed by consumer staples (15.3%). PKW is the popular fund in the buyback space, managing an asset base of nearly $1.4 billion and trading in an average daily volume of 67,000 shares.AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF (TTFS  -  Free Report)This is an actively managed fund that seeks to generate long-term capital appreciation by investing in stocks with liquidity and fundamental characteristics that are historically associated with superior long-term performance. This approach results in a basket of 101 securities with financials and consumer discretionary as the top two sectors accounting for 19% of assets each. This was followed by industrials (18%), information technology (13%) and healthcare (13%). The product has amassed $113.7 million in its asset base while sees low volume of nearly 6,000 shares a day. The fund charges 90 bps in annual fees.iShares U.S. Dividend and Buyback ETF (DIVB  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to a broad basket of 379 U.S. companies that return capital to shareholders by paying dividends or buying back their stock.

177,AMGN,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) reported a loss of $1.59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of $1.48 and the year-ago quarter loss of $1.22. Increase in general and administrative expenses led to the wider than anticipated net loss year over year.Radius Health, Inc. Price and Consensus Radius Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Radius Health, Inc. QuoteThe company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $7.7 million surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.7 million.Quarter in DetailResearch and development expenses for the reported quarter were $22.9 million, down 10.5% year over year due to the reduction in R&D expenses associated with the elacestrant projects and the development of Tymlos.  Radius Health received FDA approval for Tymlos in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture and began shipments to wholesalers at the end of May 2017.Tymlos continues to gain traction with approximately 259 million covered lives and 93% coverage in commercial plans. Tymlos market share reached approximately 32% of new patients starting anabolic therapy (NBRx) and 13% of total prescriptions in the anabolic market.General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter jumped to $50.7 million from $27.5 million primarily due to personnel, promotional, and consulting expenses related to the launch of Tymlos.Pipeline UpdatesThe company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-transdermal. A labeling supplement for Tymlos was submitted to the FDA in the fourth quarter with the positive 43-month data from the ACTIVExtend study, which showed continued significant risk reduction in fractures in patients who were transitioned to receive an additional 24 months of bisphosphonate therapy. In January 2018, Radius Health met with the FDA to discuss the regulatory development path for the abaloparatide patch. The FDA agreed that, depending on the study results, a single, randomized, open label, active-controlled, non-inferiority (to abaloparatide-SC) study of up to 500 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture would be sufficient to gain approval for the abaloparatide patch. The primary endpoint in the study will be change in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months. Radius Health expects to initiate this pivotal trial in mid-2019.Meanwhile, Radius Health’ Marketing Authorisation Application “(MAA”) for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Europe is under review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). The company however suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. In December 2017, the CHMP issued a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and informed the company that it intends to refer the MAA to a scientific advisory group for additional advice. The Company expects an opinion from the CHMP regarding the MAA in the first half of 2018.  Radius Health and the FDA have also agreed on the design of a clinical trial in men with osteoporosis, which, if successful, will form the basis of an sNDA seeking to expand the use of Tymlos to treat men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. The study is expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2018.The company also plans to initiate a clinical trial in men with osteoporosis, which, if successful, will form the basis of an sNDA seeking to expand the label to treat men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. The study is expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, the company presented positive data on elacestrant for breast cancer in December 2017. The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to elacestrant in October 2017. In February 2018, Radius Health obtained scientific advice from the EMA regarding a potential single-arm monotherapy phase II trial of elacestrant in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Based on feedback from the EMA and the FDA, the company will conduct a single, randomized, controlled phase II trial of elacestrant as a third-line monotherapy in approximately 300 patients with ER positive/HER2 negative advanced/metastatic breast cancer.Our TakeThe company’s wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter was due to escalated expenses with the commercialization of Tymlos. The drug continues to gain traction and grab further market share.Radius Health’ shares have gained 0.2% in the last six months compared with the industry’s  gain of 2.7%.Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Moreover, the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). The company also a setback when the CHMP issued a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.Regeneron’s earnings per share estimates have moved up from $17.13 to $18.65 and from $20.38 to $21.56 for 2018 and 2019, respectively, in the last 30 days.

178,AMGN,"The biotech sector has been attracting a lot of investor attention lately. This sector is expected to continue benefiting from increased M&A activities, new drug approvals, better R&D and innovations.Although the sector took a beating last year owing to drug-price controls and Trump’s plans of tackling the ever-surging drug prices getting highlighted in his latest budget, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending should benefit the industry.U.S. Economy BackdropU.S. markets recently suffered a sell-off owing to fears of rising rates. The S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. Strong wage growth and jobs data introduced fears of inflation making a comeback and led investors to bet on aggressive rate hikes.Consumer prices increased 2.1% year over year in January, unchanged from the previous month but above economists’ forecasts of 1.9%. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s tax reform and spending deal might create further pressure on prices. Hence, the Fed is expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation.Jerome Powell’s testimony was seen indicative of the possibility of Fed raising rates more than three times in 2018. “In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price inflation to 2% on a sustained basis,” per a Financial Times article, citing a statement by Powell.As such, when the markets are suffering from the anticipated rate hikes, the non-cyclical nature of biotech stocks might seem appealing to investors. Moreover, encouraging industry trends and positive earnings are poised to benefit the ETFs exposed to the said sector (read: Biotech Crushing the Market: Best ETFs & Stocks YTD).Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to the biotech space and tracks the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index. It has AUM of $4.9 billion and charges a fee of 35 basis points a year. It has 108 holdings and bears less concentration risk as less than 19% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.The fund’s top three holdings are Bioverativ Inc. , Array BioPharma Inc. (ARRY  -  Free Report) and Juno Therapeutics Inc. , with 2.8%, 2.2% and 2.0% allocation, respectively (as of Feb 26, 2018).  The fund has returned 31.2% in a year and 5.6% year to date. XBI has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy), with a High risk outlook.iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to biotech space and tracks the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index. It has AUM of $9.4 billion and charges a fee of 47 basis points a year. It has 196 holdings and bears concentration risk as more than 52% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.The fund’s top three holdings Are Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD  -  Free Report), Amgen Inc (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Celgene Corp (CELG  -  Free Report), with 8.3%, 8.1% and 7.2% allocation, respectively (as of Feb 26, 2018). The fund has returned 11.1% in a year and 0.7% year to date. IBB has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a High risk outlook.Bottom LineIBB is more popular than XBI, as is evident from its higher AUM. However, XBI may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio and a better Zacks rank.At the same time, XBI has significantly outperformed IBB when it comes to performance. XBI has returned almost 5.0% more than IBB so far this year, whereas in a year, it outperformed IBB by more than 20.0%. However, investors should note that XBI is focused on providing exposure to small-cap stocks in the space, while IBB is more inclined toward the large-cap players.  Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

179,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted a positive opinion to update the label of Neulasta to include Neulasta Onpro Kit, an innovative delivery system.The Neulasta Onpro Kit combines a pre-filled syringe with a single dose of Neulasta and a single use on-body injector (OBI) delivery system.Neulasta is used to prevent the chance of infection in patients with non-myeloid cancer who receive anti-cancer therapies.The Neulasta Onpro Kit is an improved administration option for patients as it provides them an opportunity to administer the recommended dose of Neulasta at home, the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving a trip back to the doctor.The kit has been available in the United States since 2015 while commanding a market share of about 60% in the United States for all Neulasta sales.In 2017, Neulasta revenues declined 2% to $4.53 billion from the year-ago period due to lower demand. Increased competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies is hurting demand for Neulasta. While biosimilars are already hurting sales of Neulasta in the EU, it could start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year.Many companies are looking to get approval for biosimilar versions of Neulasta. However, three of these – Biocon/Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) Coherus Biosciences, Inc. (CHRS  -  Free Report) and Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz - have received complete response letters from the FDA for their applications to market a generic version of Neulasta.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

The FDA already approved the company’s Supplemental Biologics License Application for XGEVA to expand the currently approved indication for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors to include patients with multiple myeloma in January 2018.Vertex Initiates Phase III Triple Combination Study for CF: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.

181,AMGN,"After rising 16.3% last year, the Large Cap Pharmaceutical industry has risen 1.9% this year so far. It has however underperformed the 4% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.Though the sector was off to a strong start in 2018, it struggled a little thereafter probably on broader market correction. Also, the mention of high drug prices by President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address hurt investor sentiment. However, the sector is largely expected to rebound as the year progresses.2017 was a good year for pharma and biotech stocks with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much-awaited recovery.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 11.8% in 2017, in sharp contrast to the decline witnessed in 2016, which was a tough year for pharma stocks given the furor over rising drug prices.A key reason for the sector’s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus more on fundamentals instead. Although the drug pricing controversy will remain a headline risk, investors appear more comfortable with the issue. Moreover, a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 restored investor confidence in the sector. The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough for the sector.Coming back to 2018, we believe that new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals, continued strong performance from key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits.Possibilities of more mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are also high now that the tax reform is in place and big players are on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines/technology. There has already been quite a bit of M&A buzz this year about potential deals. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) have already announced two deals each.Meanwhile, with the Large-Cap Pharma industry being among the top 30% of the 256 Zacks-ranked industries, it would make sense to look at some Buy-ranked stocks in the space.Investing in stocks with a large market cap is a much more reliable investment because of the fact that they control a large portion of their given industry. Also companies with a larger market cap have performed well in 2017 and look well poised to earn higher profits in 2018.Here is a look at four large-cap pharma companies that sport a favorable Zacks Rank -- #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).H. Lundbeck A/S (HLUYY  -  Free Report)Denmark-based Lundbeck specializes in psychiatric and neurological disorders. The company’s key areas of focus include depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. According to Lundbeck, about 700 million people across the world suffer from psychiatric and neurological disorders with many receiving inadequate treatment.YTD, Lundbeck has outperformed the Large-Cap Pharmaceutical industry with shares gaining 4.7%. In addition to delivering revenue growth of 12% (in local currencies) in 2017, Lundbeck issued an upbeat outlook for 2018. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 31.2%. Meanwhile, earnings estimates for 2019 are up 8.5% over the past 30 days.AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report)AbbVie beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter. It also raised its earnings expectations for 2018 based on continued strong operational performance. AbbVie’s key drug, Humira has been performing well based on strong demand trends, despite new competition. AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry in the past year, supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies, regulatory nods, including approval for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and two approvals for Imbruvica, and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with biotech major, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).AbbVie’s shares are up an impressive 22.3% this year so far, outperforming the industry.Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 33.9%. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 8.4% and 7% respectively, over the past 30 days.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)New York-based, Pfizer is one of the most well-known names in the pharmaceutical sector not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products.Pfizer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 results as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales and provided an upbeat outlook for 2018. We believe that Pfizer’snew products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost cuts and share buybacks should help the company earn profits in the future quarters. Pfizer’s shares have risen 1.6% this year so far.Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 11.3%. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 6.1% and 4.1%, respectively, over the past 30 days.Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report)The year 2017 was eventful for this Denmark-based pharma giant as it gained regulatory approvals for some key pipeline drugs/candidates including fast-acting insulin aspart - Fiasp, once-daily pre-filled pen - Ozempic and hemophilia B treatment Rebinyn. Meanwhile, strong performance of Victoza is driving top-line growth. We believe these new products and a solid pipeline will pave the way for growth this year for the company.Over the past 30 days, earnings estimates have risen 1.5% and 4.9%, respectively, for 2018 and 2019. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 13.7%.While Pfizer, AbbVie and Novo Nordisk are all Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks, Lundbeck is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

182,AMGN,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 1.  Radius Health’s shares have lost 7.9% over a year compared with the industry’s 0.9 % slip.Radius Health has a disappointing track record. The company has reported wider-than-expected loss in the trailing four trailing quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 8.37%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter. Radius Health, Inc. Price and Consensus  Radius Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Radius Health, Inc. Quote Factors at Play?>Radius Health develops therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases.The company’s lead drug, Tymlos, was approved in the United States in April 2017. The drug was approved for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as history of osteoporotic fracture and multiple risk factors for fracture. The drug can also be used for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $3.5 million in third-quarter 2017.Hence, we expect investors to focus on the uptake of the drug during the upcoming earnings call.Although the osteoporosis market in the United States has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience osteoporotic fractures each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Meanwhile, the company’s Marketing Authorisation Application for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) in Europe for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was under review.  However, in December 2017, Radius Health announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) will issue a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues in its regulatory review of abaloparatide-SC. The CHMP informed the company that it will refer the marketing authorisation application to a scientific advisory group for additional advice as part of its ongoing risk-benefit assessment. Hence, the CHMP expects to give an opinion on the same during the first half of 2018. In July 2017, the CHMP provided a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide-SC for their ongoing regulatory review. The delay in approval in Europe is disappointing given the potential the market holds.Meanwhile, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to pipeline candidate elacestrant, an experimental selective estrogen receptor down-regulator/degrader for the treatment of women with ER+ and HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The elacestrant clinical development program is currently ongoing with two phase I studies in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been heavily pre-treated (median of three prior lines of therapy) and have evaluable disease.  In December 2017, Radius Health provided encouraging data from the phase I 005 clinical study of elacestrant (RAD1901) in patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.Approximately 40 patients were treated at the 400 mg dose in the elacestrant phase I dose escalation and expansion cohorts. Of the enrolled patients, 22 patients met the RECIST measurable disease criteria at baseline and there were six confirmed partial responses in this group. Elacestrant was well tolerated with the most common adverse events being low grade nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting. Consequently, Radius Health plans to initiate a phase II study of elacestrant monotherapy, a potentially pivotal study, for women suffering from advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer early in 2018. Hence, we expect the management to throw light on pipeline progress.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Radius Health is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Radius Health is currently pegged at -1.22%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.50 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of $1.48. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Radius Health has a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is a pharma company that you may consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter.Gemphire Therapeutics (GEMP  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter results on Mar 21.

183,AMGN,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share, significantly up 77% from the year-ago figure of 74 cents. The bottom line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06.Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has soared 51.4% versus the industry’s 2.4% decrease. Total revenues in the quarter surged 32.2% year over year to $50.5 million, mainly on the back of higher royalty revenues. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $47 million.Quarterly HighlightsRoyalty revenues were $28.3 million in the reported quarter, up approximately 45% year over year. Higher royalties on sales of Novartis' (NVS  -  Free Report) Promacta, Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Kyprolis and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals' (SPPI  -  Free Report) Evomela drove this upside. Notably, Ligand licenses its platform technologies such as Captisol or OmniAb to these partners for use in their proprietary programs.Material sales dropped by 15.4% to $7.7 million due to an unfavorable timing of Captisol purchases for clinical and commercial use.License and milestone revenues were $14.4 million, registering a massive surge of 51.6% compared with $9.5 million in the year-ago period. This upside was attributable to a favorable timing of milestones and license fees earned.Research & development (R&D) expenses rose 34.4% to $8.6 million. Moreover, general & administrative expenses increased 13.2% year over year to $7.7 million.2017 ResultsFull-year sales improved 29.4% year over year to $141.1 million. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $137.7 million. Moreover, the top line surpassed the previous guidance of $134-$136 million.Full-year earnings of $3.26 per share compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a gain of $3.04. The company had posted earnings of $2.15 a year ago. The bottom line also surpassed the previous projection of $2.95-$3.Pipeline and Other UpdatesLast month, the company entered into two worldwide OmniAb platform license agreements, one with Ferring Pharmaceuticals and the other, with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals. Pursuant to the deals, both companies will use Ligand’s full OmniAb platform to discover fully human mono and multispecific antibodies. Ligand is entitled to receive annual platform access payments, development and regulatory milestone payments and tiered royalties for each product incorporating an OmniAb antibody.Meanwhile, in October 2017, Ligand signed a contract to acquire Crystal Bioscience. Per this buyout, Crystal Bioscience’s HuMab technology will be part of Ligand’s OmniAb brand and be called OmniChicken. Addition of this OmniChicken platform to Ligand’s OmniAb technology supplements a third species for the fully-humanized antibody discovery.With respect to the company’s internal pipeline, various candidates are under development for indications like diabetes. One of the most advanced candidates is LGD-6972, presently undergoing a phase II trial for treatment of type II diabetes. The company reported positive top-line data from the same in only last September.2018 OutlookLigand expects its 2018 revenues to be approximately $164 million, higher than revenues of $141.1 million in 2017. This year, the company anticipates an additional $20 million of license fees and milestone payments.Adjusted earnings are estimated at $4.22 per share for 2018, much ahead of 2017 earnings of $3.26.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Quote Zacks RankLigand carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

184,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) ended 2017 on a positive note, courtesy of strong performance of psoriasis drug, Cosentyx.Cosentyx achieved multi-blockbuster drug status in 2017 on the back of strong growth in three approved indications — psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. The drug has grabbed market share from rivals — AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel.The drug has been evaluated in more than 10,000 patients in over 60 studies. It has been prescribed to more than 140,000 patients on a global basis across all indications.Novartis recently reported new encouraging data on Cosentyx data from the phase III study, SCALP at the 2018 American Academy of Dermatology (“AAD”) Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA.The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cosentyx in 102 patients with moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis.The eligible patients were equally randomized to either subcutaneous Cosentyx 300 mg or placebo at week 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, then every four weeks for 12 weeks. Patients in the placebo group who did not achieve at least 90% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (“PSSI”) score at week 12 were re-randomized to Cosentyx 300 mg until the completion of the study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved PSSI 90 response rate at week 12.Majority of patients with scalp psoriasis on Cosentyx achieved clear skin (PSSI 90) at week 12 and 24 along with improved quality of life.The study showed that PSSI 90 response rates were achieved by a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving Cosentyx vs. placebo at week 12 (52.9% vs. 2.0%), with further improvements in those taking Cosentyx up to week 24 (58.8%).Per estimates, scalp psoriasis affects 60 million people worldwide.Earlier in the month, the FDA approved a line extension for Cosentyx, in moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis. The FDA approval comes on the back of positive efficacy and safety outcomes from a dedicated phase III study — SCALP — in patients with scalp psoriasis.  Novartis’ shares have gained 16.0% over a year on par with the industry’s gain of 16.5%.The label expansion of the drug is likely to boost sales further.Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the health care space is Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

186,AMGN,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced a 35% hike in its quarterly dividend along with the authorization of a new $10 billion share buyback program by the board. AbbVie stock rose more than 1% on Thursday in response to the news.The dividend was increased from 71 cents per share to 96 cents per share. The cash dividend is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record on Apr 13. The new quarterly dividend amounts to an annual dividend of $3.84 per share, which implies a dividend yield of 3.4%.Please note that this is the second dividend hike for AbbVie in less than six months. In October last year, AbbVie announced an 11% hike in quarterly dividend to 71 cents per share from 64 cents per share.AbbVie hiked its quarterly dividend by 4% in 2015 and 12% each in 2016 and 2017. In fact, since its inception in 2013, AbbVie has hiked its dividend by 140%.On the fourth quarter conference call held last month, management hinted that shareholder returns were likely to go up as the company’s cash position has improved following the recent U.S. tax reforms.In fact, AbbVie has performed exceptionally well in the past year, supported by a series of positive news. The stock has returned 86.9% in the past year, comparing favorably with a gain of 10.6% recorded by the industry.AbbVie met primary endpoints in several pivotal studies – the key phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia; three phase III studies evaluating oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and also a phase IIb study in atopic dermatitis; and four pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Humira, for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.Meanwhile, AbbVie gained regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication of cancer drug, Imbruvica. In fact, Mavyret’s launch has been stronger than expected as informed by the company on its fourth-quarter conference call.AbbVie also settled its patent disputes with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), which delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira in the United States to 2023 and in most countries in the EU to October 2018.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares. Moreover, the agreement gave AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock should continue in 2018. Importantly, Humira has been generating solid sales based on strong demand trends for the drug – a trend expected to continue this year. Imbruvica, AbbVie’s second most important drug, is also doing consistently well and has multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. All these factors bode well for the stock.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

187,AMGN,"Roche Group’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) member Genentech announced that the FDA accepted Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and granted Priority Review for the label expansion of the company’s leukemia drug Rituxan (rituximab). The company is seeking to get Rituxan approved for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by progressive painful blistering of the skin and mucous membranes.Rituxan is already approved for treating blood cancers including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as immunological diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.Priority Review designation from the FDA is generally granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. Over a year, shares of Roche have declined 3% as against the industry’s growth of 10.1%.The sBLA submission was based on data from a Roche-supported randomized trial conducted in France which evaluated Rituxan plus a tapering regimen of low dose oral corticosteroid (“CS”) treatment compared with a standard dose of CS alone as a first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed moderate to severe pemphigus. The study showed that Rituxan provides considerable improvement in pemphigus vulgaris remission rates and successful tapering and/or cessation of CS therapy.However, we remind investors that competition from Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) biosimilars loom large on Rituxan.Roche Holding AG Price Roche Holding AG Price | Roche Holding AG QuoteZacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderRoche carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the health care space is Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

188,AMGN,"On February 14, 2018, we issued an updated report on ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report).ImmunoGen reported fourth-quarter results on Feb 9, 2018. The company posted wider-than-expected loss in the reported quarter with revenues missing estimates. However, with the loss being significantly narrower than the year-ago figure, sales show a massive increase during the period. This top-line improvement was mainly driven by substantially higher license and milestone fees related to divestment of the company’s non-core B-cell assets, IMGN529, in November 2017 to Debiopharm International. On fourth-quarter conference call, focus was mainly on the progress related to the company's pipeline development.Shares of ImmunoGen have significantly outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has soared 300% against the industry’s decline of 0.8%. ImmunoGen has significantly progressed with respect to its lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine. The candidate is under evaluation in a phase III study (FORWARD I) as a single-agent therapy for treating patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, whose tumors express high or medium levels of FR alpha.Notably, combo therapies with mirvetuximab soravtansine for ovarian cancer are being evaluated in the phase Ib/II FORWARD II study. The study consists of cohorts assessing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda. Initial data from the study demonstrated that the candidate has potential to complement all available therapies for the indication. Updated data from the program is expected in the first half of 2018.Notably, mirvetuximab soravtansine enjoys an Orphan Drug status in both the United States and the EU for treatment of ovarian cancer.Apart from mirvetuximab soravtansine, ImmunoGen works upon developing a couple of other candidates including IMGN779 and IMGN632. In December 2017, ImmunoGen released positive findings from the ongoing phase I study, evaluating IMGN779 on patients with relapsed or refractory adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Earlier, this January, the company initiated a phase I program, analyzing IMGN632 to treat hematological malignancies including AML.ImmunoGen has agreements with several big healthcare companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Bayer, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi and Takeda. These contracts in turn allow other companies to use ImmunoGen’s ADC technology and provide it with funds in the form of license and milestone fees, royalties, clinical materials revenues and R&D (research and development) support fees.Zacks RankImmunoGen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

190,AMGN,"Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a line extension for its IL-17A inhibitor drug, Cosentyx, in moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis. The FDA approval comes on the back of positive efficacy and safety outcomes from a dedicated phase III study – SCALP – in patients with scalp psoriasis.We note that the drug was approved for a similar indication in Europe in June 2017. It is already approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (“AS”).Per the press release, scalp psoriasis is one of the difficult to treat forms of psoriasis, which affects about half of the approximately 125 million patients with the disease. The line extension of the drug is an important achievement as treatment of scalp psoriasis with topical agents or phototherapy is challenging due to the presence of hair and other factors.Novartis’ shares have returned 13.7% in the past year, compared to the industry’s gain of 14.1% in the same period. The SCALP study evaluated the subcutaneous administration of Cosentyx (300 mg) for 12 weeks. Data showed significant improvement in patients compared to placebo.Cosentyx’s performance was impressive in 2017. It achieved multi-blockbuster drug status on the back of strong growth in all the approved indications. Sales of the drug increased 82% in 2017 to surpass the $2 billion mark.The drug has shown superiority in clinical studies to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in treating psoriasis. Novartis is also conducting head-to-head clinical trials – EXCEED and SURPASS – to evaluate the superiority of Cosentyx versus AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira in PsA and to a proposed biosimilar of Humira in AS, respectively.The superiority of the drug over Stelara and Enbrel has helped it gain market share. Potential superiority over Humira and its biosimilar along with this line extension in scalp psoriasis will certainly boost the prospect of the drug.Novartis AG Price  Novartis AG Price | Novartis AG QuoteZacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

191,AMGN,"Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SPPI  -  Free Report) announced positive data from a phase III study, ADVANCE, evaluating its lead pipeline candidate, Rolontis, for management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with early-stage breast cancer. The candidate demonstrated non-inferiority to Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta in improving duration of severe neutropenia.Shares of Spectrum Pharma have skyrocketed 314.8% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 2.8%.The company is evaluating Rolontis in two phase III studies – ADVANCE and RECOVER – in early-stage breast cancer patients.The ADVANCE study compared Rolontis to Neulasta for management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in breast cancer patients who received docetaxel and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy every 21 days.With the completion of enrollment in RECOVER study, announced in the press release, Spectrum Pharma is on track to file a biologics license application seeking approval of Rolontis for management of neutropenia in the fourth quarter of 2018.Apart from Rolontis, the company is developing Qapzola for treating non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and poziotinib in non-small cell lung cancer patients and breast cancer.In October 2017, Spectrum announced encouraging preliminary data on poziotinib from phase II NSCLC study in patients who have exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR.However, Spectrum Pharma’s product sales from its six marketed products have been lacklusterin the last six months due to intense competition.

192,AMGN,"Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced positive results from the phase III IMmotion151 study on immunoncology drug Tecentriq in combination with oncology drug Avastin.  (bevacizumab). The drug will serve as a first-line treatment option for advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).IMmotion151, a multicenter, randomized, open-label study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq and Avastin versus sunitinib in people with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) who have not received prior systemic active or experimental therapy.The study met its co-primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in patients whose disease expressed the PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1: expression ≥ 1 percent) protein. Results showed that patients who received Tecentriq plus Avastin had a 26% reduced risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) compared to people treated with Sutent (median PFS [mPFS]: 11.2 vs. 7.7 months; HR=0.74; 95 percent CI 0.57, 0.96; p=0.02). Moreover, a pre-defined analysis of patient-reported outcomes revealed that the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin markedly delayed the time to a worsening of disease symptoms that interfere with day-to-day life compared to Sutent.The study is the second phase III study on the combination regimen. A monoclonal antibody, Tecentriq is approved for various cancers like bladder and urinary tract cancers.The company is evaluating this combination in a broad range of cancers, including advanced RCC.Data for the co-primary endpoint of overall survival in the overall study population (intention-to-treat, ITT) were encouraging, but are still immature.We note that Exelixis’ (EXEL  -  Free Report) Cabometyx is also approved for treating advanced RCC.Roche’s stock has gained 0.1% in the past one year compared with industry's gain of 17.4%.Roche performance in 2017 was strong driven by contribution from newly launched drugs. The label expansion of key drugs, Perjeta, Tecentriq and Alecensa will drive growth further. Ocrevus and Hemlibra have been successfully launched. However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

193,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $2.89 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 by 4.9%. Earnings were flat year over year as lower sales and higher operating costs offset the benefit of a lower tax rate.Including a $6.1 billion charge related to U.S. tax reform, fourth-quarter 2017 loss per share was $5.89 against earnings of $2.59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.Total revenues of $5.80 billion in the quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.86 billion. Revenues declined 3% year over year.Quarter in DetailTotal product revenues declined 2% from the year-ago quarter to $5.57 billion (U.S.: $4.35 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.22 billion) as increasing demand for newer products like Prolia, Kyprolis, Xgeva and Blincyto was not enough to make up for lower sales of some of Amgen’s largest products like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.Revenues of Amgen’s erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), Aranesp, declined 7% from the year-ago quarter to $491 million due to lower demand and unfavorable changes in currency rates.Revenues of the other ESA, Epogen, declined 15% to $270 million due to lower selling price owing to a newly negotiated contract with DaVita Inc.Neulasta revenues were flat at $1.14 billion from the year-ago period as lower demand was offset by changes in accounting estimates.Increased competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies is hurting demand for Neulasta. However, the Neulasta Onpro kit (on-body injector) continues to perform well, commanding a market share of about 60% in the United States for all Neulasta sales.Please note that Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year, which will hurt sales further.Neupogen recorded a 27% decline in sales to $126 million due to biosimilar competition in the United States. Zarxio, Sandoz’s (Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm) biosimilar version of Neupogen, was launched in the United States in September 2015 and is hurting sales.Enbrel delivered revenues of $1.42 billion, down 13% from the year-ago quarter due to lower selling prices and increased competition, which hurt demand. Amgen launched the Enbrel AutoTouch, an autoinjector device in November last year.Prolia revenues came in at $574 million, up 24% from the year-ago quarter due to higher demand. The osteoporosis drug witnessed continued growth in new patient starts and strong repeat injection rates, which drove year-over-year growth.Meanwhile, Xgeva delivered revenues of $391 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter mainly due to higher demand and favorable changes in inventory levels.Earlier this year, Amgen gained FDA approval for an expanded label for Xgeva to include prevention ofskeletal-related events (SREs) inpatients with multiple myeloma. Until now Xgeva was only approved for the prevention of SREs in solid tumors in patients with bone metastases. The approval for the expanded patient population may drive sales of Xgeva in future quarters.Sensipar/Mimpara revenues were flat at $411 million as higher price increases were offset by unfavorable inventory changes.Vectibix revenues came in at $159 million, up 11%, driven by higher demand.Kyprolis recorded sales of $227 million, up 24% year over year driven by higher demand and robust uptake from outside U.S. markets.Amgen’s regulatory application in the United States to include overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis was granted approval by the FDA earlier this month. Also, earlier this week Amgen announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has given a positive opinion recommending addition of ENDEAVOR on Kyprolis label in the EU. The study demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Takeda’s Velcade plus dexamethasone. This overall survival data, if approved, can help drive usage and boost sales of Kyprolis.Blincyto sales surged 59% from the year-ago period to $46 million, reflecting higher demand.Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha generated revenues of $98 million compared with $89 million in the third quarter.Uptake of the drug, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent. The priority for Amgen right now is to improve patient access to Repatha.In December, Amgen gained FDA approval to include a new indication - risk reduction of major cardiovascular events data – on Repatha’s label based on data from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER.This makes Repatha the first PCSK9 inhibitor to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease. With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label, patient access to Repatha is expected to improve.Operating Margins DecreaseAdjusted operating margins declined 460 basis points (bps) to 45.9% due to higher operating costs and $79 million in expenses related to Hurricane Maria recovery efforts.R&D expenses declined 3% in the quarter due to lower late-stage pipeline related costs and lower payments for in-licensing transactions. SG&A spend increased 8% due to higher investments to support new product launches, which partially offset the impact of October 2016 expiration of Enbrel residual royalty payments.This month, Amgen’s board of directors approved a new share buyback plan of $10 billion, bringing the total existing share repurchase authorization to $14.4 billion.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $22.85 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.90 billion. Revenues were within the guidance range of $22.7 billion to $23.0 billion. Sales declined 1% year over year.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $12.58 per share, also missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.69 per share. Earnings were within the guidance range of $12.50 to $12.70. Earnings rose 8% year over year.2018 GuidanceThe company expects total revenues in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.90 billion. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of $12.60 to $13.70 in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $12.65 per share.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%-15%, much lower than 18% in 2017 reflecting the impact of tax reform.On expectation of an improved cash position following the tax reform, Amgen plans to invest approximately $3.5 billion over the next five years in capital expenditures. Approximately 75% of this investment will be made in the United States including setting up a new drug substance manufacturing plant in the country.Our TakeAmgen had a rather poor quarter as it missed expectations for both earnings and sales and also issued a lower-than-expected sales guidance for 2018. Shares lost 1.7% in after-market trading in response. However, in the past year, Amgen’s shares have returned 10.7%, better than the 4.6% increase registered by the industry.Though Amgen’s newer products – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well, their volume growth is not enough to offset the decline in mature brands like Enbrel due to competitive pressure. However, Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline and expects approval and launch of migraine candidate, Aimovig this year. Also, Amgevita, Amgen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Humira is expected to be launched in Europe later this year. Parsabiv, a specialty product for kidney disease, was launched in the United States last month. Also, management seems quite confident that Repatha will become an important growth driver for the company with the inclusion of outcomes data on its label. Nonetheless, other than continuing competitive dynamics for Enbrel, possible generic competition to Sensipar and new competition for Neulasta and Aranesp could be the new challenges in 2018.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

194,AMGN,"Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) reported sales of CHF13.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 5% from the year-ago period.  Roche’s stock has moved up 7.7% in the last twelve months compared with industry’s gain of 24.7%.The company reports results under two divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.Sales in 2017 came in at CHF 53.3 billion, up 5%. Earnings per share came in at CHF 15.34 in 2017, up from CHF 14.53 in 2016.  Sales at the Pharmaceuticals division increased 5% driven by strong growth in Tecentriq, Ocrevus, Alecensa and Perjeta. Diagnostics division sales climbed 5% primarily on the back of strong immunodiagnostic business.Results in DetailHerceptin sales improved 3% due to increasing demand in the United States and Brazil. Perjeta sales grew 19% following increased demand in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings. Sales of Kadcyla (+10%) were driven by increasing demand in the international markets.Meanwhile, sales of Avastin decreased due to increasing use of cancer immunotherapy medicines in lung cancer.Sales of Rituxan/MabThera (1%) were driven by growth in the immunology segments. Growth in Gazyva/Gazyvaro (41%) was strong despite increasing competition in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Recently launched drugs, Tecentriq and Alecensa for lung cancer are off to a strong start. Tecentriq, Ocrevus and Alecensa contributed CHF1.4 billion of new sales.Performance of the immunology franchise was driven by increased sales of Actemra/RoActemra (14%), and strong uptake of Esbriet (13%) and Xolair (16%). Increasing use of Actemra/RoActemra in the subcutaneous formulation drove sales.However, sales of Tarceva declined (18%) due to growing use of other therapeutic options. Sales of Xeloda (10%) continue to be hit by generic competition. Sales of Tamiflu also declined 33%.Revenues at the Diagnostics division climbed 5% on the back of solid performance of the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions (7%) unit, which was in turn, propelled by Immunodiagnostics (13%). Tissue Diagnostics (13%) and Molecular Diagnostics (11%) also performed impressively.However, Diabetes Care sales declined 4% as sales continue to be impacted by challenging market conditions, particularly in North America.2018 OutlookRoche now expect sales to remain stable or grow in low-single digits. The company expects core earnings to grow in high-single digits. The company intends to further increase its dividend in 2017 in local currency.Pipeline ProgressThe company won FDA approvals for two new drugs in 2017 — Ocrevus for the treatment of relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and Hemlibra for haemophlia A with factor VIII inhibitors.The company continues to expand the label for its existing drugs — Perjeta for adjuvant (after surgery) treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence, in combination with Herceptin and chemotherapy as well as full approval of Perjeta for neoadjuvant use.During the fourth quarter, Roche obtained FDA approval of a label expansion of a few drugs —Alecensa for first-line treatment in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), Zelboraf in Erdheim-Chester disease, Gazyva for untreated advanced follicular lymphoma and Avastin for glioblastoma in adult patients whose cancer has progressed after prior treatment.Alecensa was also approved as a monotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC in Europe. In January 2018, EMA approved Ocrevus for the treatment of both the relapsing and the primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and Hemlibra was granted a positive opinion by the CHMP.Meanwhile, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin showed positive study results in lung cancer and kidney cancer.On the diagnostics front, Roche entered into a strategic, long-term partnership with GE Healthcare to jointly develop and co-market digital clinical decision support solutions.Our TakeRoche performance in 2017 was strong driven by contribution from newly launched drugs. The label expansion of key drugs, Perjeta, Tecentriq and Alecensa will further drive growth. Ocrevus and Hemlibra have been successfully launched. However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe.

The announcement comes just a few weeks after Novo Nordisk had announced its interest in acquiring Ablynx in a deal valued at approximately €2.6 billion. Ablynx had rejected Novo Nordisk’s offer with the company’s Board saying that the proposal fundamentally undervalued Ablynx and its growth prospects.A look at Ablynx’s pipeline shows that the company could well be in a position to launch its first product, caplacizumab (anti-vWF; acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - aTTP), this year. Caplacizumab is currently under review in the EU while a regulatory application will be filed in the United States in the first half of 2018. The estimated annual market opportunity for aTTP, a life-threatening blood clotting disease, is expected to be about €1.2 billion. The company also has a broad range of partnerships with the potential to generate more than €10.6 billion in milestones plus royalties. Other pipeline candidates also address significant market opportunities. The company has more than 45 programs in its pipeline and eight Nanobodies in clinical development. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018 (Read more: Sanofi on a Buyout Spree This Month, to Buy Ablynx for $4.8B).Bellicum Down on FDA Clinical Hold: Bellicum Pharmaceuticals’s shares are down almost 30% following the company’s announcement that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on U.S. studies being conducted on BPX-501. The hold was placed after three cases of encephalopathy were deemed as possibly connected to BPX-501. The company said that the cases were complex with certain factors like prior failed transplants, prior history of immunodeficiency, concurrent infection, and administration of rimiducid in combination with other medications.Bellicum is now waiting to receive a formal notice from the FDA as to the steps needed to be taken for the resumption of the studies. The clinical hold will not impact an ongoing registration study in Europe.Seattle Genetics to Boost Pipeline with Cascadian Acquisition: Seattle Genetics announced that it will be acquiring Cascadian Therapeutics for $10 per share in cash, or about $614 million. With this acquisition, slated to close in the first quarter of 2018, Seattle will be adding tucatinib to its pipeline. Tucatinib is an investigational oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) that is highly selective for HER2, a growth factor receptor that is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast, colorectal, ovarian and gastric. The candidate is currently in a pivotal phase II program for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and complements Seattle’s existing pipeline.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index declined 1.5% over the last five trading sessions.

196,AMGN,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that it received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency, recommending addition of an updated overall survival (OS) data from a phase III head-to-head study on the label of its multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis (carfilzomib).The phase III ENDEAVOR study was conducted on 929 patients. Data from the trial demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone (Kd) led to superior overall survival when compared with Takeda Pharmaceutical’s Velcade plus dexamethasone (Vd) in second-line multiple myeloma setting. Findings showed that the combination therapy reduced the risk of death by 21% and increased OS by 7.6 months compared with Vd in the given patients’ population.Importantly, in January 2018, Amgen announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to include OS data from the ENDEAVOR program on Kyprolis’ label. The FDA’s decision comes much earlier than expected, initially expected in April this year.Note that the Kd regimen is already approved in the United States, EU and other countries based on the primary analysis of a progression-free survival in the ENDEAVOR study. This overall survival data, if approved, can help drive the usage of Kyprolis and boost its sales.We remind investors that Kyprolis is also approved in the United States as a single agent for treating patients with multiple myeloma, who have received at least two prior therapies including Velcade and an immunomodulatory agent.Significantly, Amgen collaborated with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) in November 2016 to study the combination of Kyprolis and J&J’s Darzalex in multiple clinical studies for addressing the case of multiple myeloma. Under the terms of the agreement, the first study — a phase III registrational trial, evaluating the combo therapy of Kyprolis/Darzalex and dexamethasone compared with Kyprolis and dexamethasone alone on patients with multiple myeloma, having undergone one, two or three prior lines of therapy — has been initiated.Amgen’s shares have outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has rallied 22.1%, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 8%. Incidentally, Kyprolis, which became part of Amgen’s portfolio following its acquisition of Onyx, registered sales of $608 million in the first nine months of 2017, up 18.9% compared with the year-ago figure. The drug’s label expansion would immensely expand the patient population as well as its commercial potential.Per the company’s press release, multiple myeloma is an aggressive disease, accounting for approximately one percent of all cancers.

198,AMGN,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 62 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents by 10.7%. Earnings also rose 32% year over year driven by higher international sales and lower costs and share count.The pharma heavyweight delivered revenues of $13.70 billion, which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.61 billion. Revenues rose 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis. On an operational basis, revenues were flat year over year.Sales in DetailCurrency movement benefited Pfizer’s fourth-quarter revenues by 1%. In February 2017, Pfizer divested its Hospira infusion systems (HIS) business to ICU Medical. Excluding currency headwinds and HIS revenues in the prior-year quarter, sales rose 2% operationally.Strong performance of newer products like Ibrance (breast cancer), Xtandi (prostate cancer) and Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) somewhat offset lower sales of Enbrel and Viagra, loss of exclusivity for some products and supply shortages in legacy Hospira products.International revenues rose 5% (up 4% an operational basis) to $7.19 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues declined 4% to $6.51 billion.Segment DiscussionPfizer’s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 6% on a reported basis (up 5% an operational basis) from the year-ago period to $8.22 billion. Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Eliquis globally and Xeljanz Lyrica, Ibrance and Chantix/Champix, all primarily in the United States.Ibrance revenues rose 11% to $716 million in the quarter driven by strong U.S. revenues. However, Ibrance sales were softer than the prior quarter as a one-time price adjustment hurt international sales.Xeljanz sales rose 47% to $410 million. Lyrica sales rose 8% to $1.13 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 43% to $710 million. Chantix sales rose 28% to $271 million in the quarter.Revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the September 2016 Medivation acquisition, also contributed to U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $168 million in the quarter compared with $150 million in the third quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in the United States and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra.Enbrel revenues declined 13% to $634 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis(RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the United States and Canada. Total Viagra (IH+EH) sales declined 46% to $209 million due to generic competition that began in December 2017.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues rose 7% to $1.53 billion as higher international sales made up for the decline in the United States. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 7% in the United States due to continued decline in revenues for the eligible adult patient population. However, Prevenar 13 revenues rose 27% in international markets due to favorable timing of government purchases in some emerging markets for the pediatric indication.Consumer Healthcare revenues declined 2% to $950 million. Global Oncology revenues increased 10% to $1.51 billion. Global Vaccine revenues rose 7% to $1.62 billion. Internal Medicine rose 6% to $2.44 billion. The Inflammation & Immunology franchise rose 6% to $1.10 billion. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 2% to $603 million.Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision is expected this year, which could also be to retain the business.Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 7% (down 8% operationally) to $5.48 billion. Excluding HIS revenues, EH sales declined 3%.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products, primarily Pristiq in the United States and Lyrica in Europe, lower revenues from legacy Hospira products due to product shortages and divesture of HIS. However, in the EH business, biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter. Biosimilars revenues rose 72% operationally while emerging markets revenues grew 10% operationally.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $44 million in the United States and $135 million globally, all other biosimilars brought in sales of $30 million (down 7%) from outside the U.S. markets.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses declined 3% (operationally) in the quarter to $4.32 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses also declined 9% to $2.3 billion.2017 ResultsFull-year sales were $52.55 billion, flat year over year on an operational basis. Sales marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $52.50 billion and were in line with the guidance range of $52.4 billion to $53.1 billion.Adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share for the full year exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.60 as well as the guided range of $2.58 - $2.62. Earnings rose 11% year over year.2018 GuidanceRevenues are expected in the range of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $53.72 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.90 - $3.00, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.77 per share.At the mid-point, adjusted EPS is expected to increase 11% while revenues are expected to increase 4%.Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $7.4–$7.9 billion while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $14.0–$15.0 billion.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be 17% in 2018.Our TakePfizer’s fourth-quarter results were above expectations as it beat estimates for both earnings and revenues. Meanwhile, it issued an upbeat guidance for 2018. Also Pfizer said that it plans to invest approximately $5 billion in capital projects in the United States over the next five years on increased access to foreign cash following the U.S. tax reforms.However, after initial gains, shares of Pfizer fell around 1.9% in premarket trading. We believe that lower sales in the United States and a sequentially softer performance of Ibrance in the quarter hurt investor sentiment. In the past year, Pfizer’s shares have increased 24.6%, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 29% for the industry.Despite top-line headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, pricing pressure and rising competition, Pfizer achieved 11% adjusted earnings growth in 2017. New products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts, a lower tax rate and share buybacks helped the company achieve its 2017 guidance. Meanwhile, Pfizer looks well poised to record profit growth in 2018.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

199,AMGN,"Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for its experimental drug oral medicine balovaptan (previously known as RG7314), a vasopressin 1a (V1a) receptor antagonist for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).The designation from the FDA is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs with early evidence of substantial potential clinical benefit to patients, or benefit patients without current treatment options.The designation for balovaptan is primarily based on efficacy findings in the phase II trial, VANILLA (Vasopressin ANtagonist to Improve sociaL communication in Autism) study, in adults with ASD.Meanwhile, a phase II trial balovaptan in children and adolescents with ASD is ongoing and other trials in ASD are also being planned.We note that ASD is approximately four times more prevalent in boys than in girls. As per estimates, 1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls suffer from ASD in the United States. The World Health Organization estimates that the global prevalence of ASD is approximately one in every 160 people and 0.3% of the global burden of disease.Roche has more than a dozen pipeline candidates in the neuroscience portfolio for diseases that include multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, spinal muscular atrophy, Parkinson’s disease and autism.Earlier in the month, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus. The approval boosts Roche’s neuroscience portfolio.  Roche’s stock has rallied 5.1% over a year compared with industry's gain of 30.6%.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe.

200,AMGN,"Meredith Corporation (MDP  -  Free Report) has to its credit a solid history of rewarding shareholders. It has been paying quarterly dividends for the last 71 years. Management has recently approved a quarterly dividend hike of 4.8% to 54.5 cents per share (or $2.18 annually). This marks the company’s 25th successive year of dividend hike. The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 15, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Feb 28. Notably, the hike reflects a yield of nearly 3.3% on the stock’s closing price on Jan 29.Annually, the new dividend represents a hike of 10 cents per share from the prior payout. In January 2017, this Des Moines, IA-based company announced a 5.1% increase in its regular quarterly dividend to 52 cents per share (or $2.08 annually).Dividend hike is frequent among companies with a stable cash position and healthy cash flows. We believe that such hikes not only enhance shareholders’ return but raise the market value of the stock as well. In fact, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it.Impressively, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company maintains a shareholder-friendly policy through its total shareholder return (TSR) strategy. This, in turn, aids management to enhance shareholders’ value via share repurchases, dividends and strategic business investments to drive growth. Since the implementation of this strategy, more than five years ago, the company returned 22% on an average annual basis.Apart from Meredith, companies like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) have raised their respective dividend payouts of late. Boeing raised its quarterly dividend by 20 percent to $1.71 per share payable on Mar 2. AES Corporation has approved a quarterly dividend hike of 8.3% to 13 cents per share that is payable on Feb 15. Amgen hiked its quarterly dividend by 15% to $1.32 per share, payable on Mar 8.Stock PerformanceFollowing the news of dividend hike, shares of Meredith gained 1.3%. In the last three months, the stock has gained 26.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 23.8%. The company is slated to report its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 31, 2018.Management had earlier stated that Meredith’s second-quarter earnings are likely to be in the range of 87-92 cents a share, down from $1.30 reported in the prior-year quarter. Sharp decline in earnings projections for the quarter is primarily due to benefits of 54 cents registered in the year-ago period backed by robust political advertising revenues. Moreover, with the advancement of technology the print media is on a decline.Nevertheless, the company’s strategic initiatives particularly in digital space, brand licensing activities and solid portfolio of television stations reinforce its position as one of the leading media and marketing companies.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

201,AMGN,"Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Advanced Accelerator Applications, obtained FDA approval for its new drug application (NDA) for Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate) for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), including foregut, midgut and hindgut neuroendocrine tumors in adults.We remind investors that last week, Novartis completed a successful tender offer for Advanced Accelerator Applications.Lutathera is a first-in-class drug and the first available FDA approved Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy, a form of treatment comprising a targeting molecule that carries a radioactive component. The approval was based on encouraging phase III study results which demonstrated a 79% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death within the Lutathera plus best standard of care arm (octreotide LAR 30mg every four weeks) compared to 60 mg of octreotide LAR alone (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% CI; 0.13-0.32; p<0.0001).The approval of Luthera expands Novartis` neuroendocrine tumor portfolio.Approval of new drugs boost Novartis’ portfolio which is facing generic competition for its blockbuster drug Gleevec.Last week, Novartis reported encouraging results for the fourth quarter wherein results beat both earnings and sales estimates on strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto. Psoriasis Cosentyx achieved multi-blockbuster drug status in 2017 on the back of strong growth of three approved indications while Entresto’s sales benefited from continued access improvements and expansion of sales force in the United States. Novartis’ stock has rallied 9.0% in the last six months compared with the industry’s 15.7% gain.The generic division, Sandoz also combatted pricing pressure strongly buoyed by launches of Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in EU. The proposed biosimilar version of AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira (adalimumab) has also been accepted for review by the FDA.Meanwhile, the strategic decision on Alcon to retain the business or separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering has been postponed. The company believes that the Alcon division has revived well for now and hence a decision on a possible spin-off will be taken in 2019. The recent approvals of Kymriah and Kisqali will further boost the oncology portfolio and drive growth.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

202,AMGN,"Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) has adopted a positive opinion for Hemlibra (emicizumab) for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients suffering from hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.The CHMP has recommended the drug for use in all age groups.The Marketing Authorisation Application is being reviewed under accelerated assessment.A final decision is expected from the European Commission shortly. The CHMP recommendation is based on the positive results of two pivotal clinical studies for people with haemophilia A with inhibitors, the phase III HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2 studies.We note that the FDA approved Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to event or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in November 2017. Hemlibra was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in people aged 12 years or older with haemophilia A with inhibitors in September 2015.Meanwhile, Hemlibra is being evaluated in a clinical development program that includes two additional phase III studies, HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4. Results from HAVEN 3 showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the number of treated bleeds over time in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) with haemophilia A without inhibitors who received Hemlibra prophylaxis every week or every two weeks, compared with those receiving no prophylaxis. Interim results from HAVEN 4 showed a clinically meaningful control of bleeding in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) with haemophilia A with or without inhibitors who received Hemlibra prophylaxis once every four weeks.A potential approval in Europe will further boost Roche’s hematology portfolio which includes approved drugs like MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva/Gazyvaro, Tecentriq and Venclexta as well as an encouraging pipeline comprising candidates like polatuzumab vedotin/RG7596 and a small-molecule antagonist of MDM2 (idasanutlin/RG7388).We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). Both companies are jointly commercializing in the United States. AbbVie is commercializing the drug outside the United States.Earlier in the month, the European Commission  granted marketing authorization for multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Ocrevus.The drug is approved for active relapsing forms of MS defined by clinical or imaging features as well as for early primary progressive MS in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. Roche’s stock has lost 3.1% over a year compared with industry's gain of 2.9%.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe.

203,AMGN,"We expect biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Feb 1, after the market closes. Amgen delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.83% in the last quarter.Amgen shares are up 26.9% in the past year. This compares favorably with the 11.8% increase registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company delivering positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.25%.Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAmgen’s newer products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolis, Vectibix and Blincyto are expected to deliver the goods backed by higher demand. However, sales of mature brands like Aranesp, Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen are expected to be lower due to competitive pressure.Neulasta demand is being hurt by competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies. Neupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of NeupogenWe expect Neulasta and Neupogen sales to continue to be hurt by competitive dynamics in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Neulasta and Epogen are expected to start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year.Enbrel sales are expected to continue to be hurt by increased pricing and competitive pressures. Enbrel is one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues. The company launched Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch, a new auto injector device for Enbrel in the United States in November, which is likely to provide some support to fourth-quarter sales.Meanwhile, operating expenses are expected to be higher in the fourth quarter than the prior quarter, reflecting the typical pattern of the business as well as costs related to recovery efforts following Hurricane Maria. Amgen expects to record $75 million to $100 million in expenses related to Hurricane Maria recovery efforts in the fourth quarter, which will reduce earnings per share by 8-11 cents.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments about the initial impact of inclusion of cardiovascular outcomes data on the label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. In December 2017, Amgen gained FDA approval to include a new indication - risk reduction of major cardiovascular events data – on Repatha’s label based on data from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER). This makes Repatha the first PCSK9 inhibitor to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease. With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label, Amgen believes that patient access to Repatha should improve. Please note that uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.06 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.04 per share) is +0.55%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the biotech sector that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +3.45% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release results on Feb 8.Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (EBS  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +22.65% and a Zacks Rank #3.

204,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) entered into a licensing agreement with Spark Therapeutics to develop, register and commercialize Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec) in markets outside the United States.We note Luxturna was approved in the United States on Dec 19, 2017 as one-time gene therapy to restore functional vision in children and adult patients with biallelic mutations of the RPE65 (retinal pigment epithelial 65 kDa protein) gene.The market authorization application was filed with the European Medicines Agency on July 31, 2017.Novartis will make an upfront payment as well as pay milestones and royalties to Spark Therapeutics.

205,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) reported encouraging results for fourth-quarter 2017 wherein both earnings and revenues beat estimates driven by strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG Quote Fourth-quarter 2017 core earnings of $1.21 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 and were up from $1.12 recorded in the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 5% to $12.9 billion as volume growth driven by Cosentyx and Entresto was partially offset by the negative impact of generic competition and pricing. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.6 billion. Novartis’ stock has rallied 3.5% in the last six months compared with the industry’s 10.8% gain.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.Quarter in DetailNovartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon (Ophthalmology unit) and Sandoz (Generics).The Innovative Medicines division recorded sales of $8.8 billion, up 4%. Generic competition impacted sales at the segment, primarily due to the entry of generics for Gleevec in the United States and Europe. Pricing too impacted sales. Nevertheless, growth products — Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist and Gilenya boosted sales.Psoriasis Cosentyx achieved multi-blockbuster drug status in 2017 on the back of strong growth in its three approved indications while Entresto’s sales benefited from continued access improvements and expansion of sales force in the United States.  Cosentyx generated sales of $2.1 billion in 2017. Entresto sales came in at $507 million in 2017. Oncology franchise (excluding Gleevec) grew 13%.Sales at the Sandoz division were $2.6 billion, down 4% as volume growth was offset by price erosion in the Unites States. Sales in the United States declined 17% due to pricing pressure. Biopharmaceuticals sales grew 6% mainly driven by Zarxio in the United States and launches of Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche Holdings, Inc.’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in EU.Sales at the Alcon division were $1.6 billion, up 6%. Surgical sales increased 9% driven by broad recovery across most market segments, including strong growth from vitreoretinal products. Vision Care sales were up 2% fueled by the continued double-digit growth of Dailies Total1.Earlier, Novartis announced that it is mulling over strategic options for its lagging eye-care unit Alcon which includes retaining the business, or a separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering.  The company updated its strategic plan and announced that it has the potential to grow sales at or above market while delivering profitability in line with the industry. The company also made significant progress on developing a potential capital markets solution, including financial carve-outs, tax and legal entity structuring, and identifying listing and incorporation locations.  A final decision will be taken depending on Alcon’s sales performance which is not likely to happen before the first half of 2019.Meanwhile, Novartis has moved the Ophthalmic OTC products to the Alcon Division, effective Jan 1, 2018, to allow the Innovative Medicines Division to focus on pharmaceutical pipeline.2017 ResultsSales came in at $49.1 billion, up 2% from 2016 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $48.9 billion. Earnings per share came in at $4.86 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.79 and up from $4.75 per share in 2016.2018 OutlookNovartis expects net sales in 2018 to grow low to mid-single digit. Innovative Medicines is projected to grow in mid-single digit. Revenues from Sandoz is expected to be broadly in line or decline slightly. Alcon sales are estimated to grow in low to mid-single digits.Pipeline UpdateNovartis’ pipeline candidates’ progress has been encouraging.  2017 was a good year for Novartis with 16 major approvals. The oncology portfolio continues to gain traction.  In a significant boost, the FDA approved its breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse.  Kymriah has been launched in the United States.  Novartis is seeking to expand Kymriah’s label.Novartis’ supplemental Biologics License Application for Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are ineligible for or relapse after autologous stem cell transplant has been accepted by the FDA for Priority Review.Breast cancer drug Kisqali was approved in Europe as a first-line option for HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with any aromatase inhibitor. The drug is already approved in the United States. The company also received approval of Rydapt in Europe for the treatment of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia and three types of systemic mastocytosis.Sandoz continues to progress with its biosimilars pipeline. The proposed biosimilar version of AbbVie. Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira (adalimumab) has also been accepted for review by the FDA.  The biosimilar version of Humira is already review in the EU.Tasigna was approved in Europe for the treatment of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) and pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib.Our TakeNovartis fourth-quarter results beat both earnings and sales estimates on strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto. The generic division, Sandoz also combatted pricing pressure strongly buoyed by biosimilar launches of Rixathin and Erelzi. Meanwhile, the strategic decision on Alcon to retain the business or separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering has been postponed. The company believes that the Alcon division has revived well for now and hence a decision on a possible spin-off will be taken in 2019. The recent approvals of Kymriah and Kisqali will further boost the oncology portfolio and drive growth.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

206,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced positive results from the phase IIIb study, LIBERTY, which assessed the efficacy and safety of erenumab (AMG 334) 140mg in patients with episodic migraine who had experienced two to four previous preventive treatment failures, due to lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects.The study met its primary endpoint, with significantly more patients taking erenumab experiencing at least a 50% reduction from baseline in their monthly migraine days as compared to placebo. The trial met all secondary endpoints including reduction of monthly migraine days, lowering in days needing acute (rescue) medication, improvement in scores on the Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID) tool, and 75% and 100% responder rates (number of patients experiencing at least a 75% or 100% reduction in monthly migraine days compared to placebo.) The safety data are consistent with previous studies of erenumab to date, showing a placebo-like safety profile.Novartis will present full data at an upcoming scientific meeting. Novartis' stock has rallied 3.2% in the last six months compared with the industry's 10.% gain.Erenumab, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody is designed to selectively block the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, which plays a critical role in migraine activation. The candidate is being developed by Novartis in collaboration with Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report).The candidate is the first investigational therapy targeting the CGRP pathway to have received Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulatory filing acceptance.Upon approval, Novartis and Amgen will co-commercialize erenumab in the United States. Amgen has exclusive commercialization rights to the drug in Japan and Novartis has exclusive rights to commercialize in the rest of the world.Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space. New products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals like AbbVie, Inc.'s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s Enbrel.Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc.

207,AMGN,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that its fully human monoclonal antibody, Aimovig (erenumab), met all primary and secondary endpoints in a unique phase IIIb study for prevention of patients with episodic migraine, who have failed multiple prior preventive treatments.Notably, Aimovig is the only investigational therapy designed to selectively block the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, which plays a significant role in migraine activation.Aimovig is under review in both the United States and the EU for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. A decision from the FDA is expected on May 17, 2018.Moreover, shares of the company are up 25.8% in a year, comparing favorably with the industry’s an increase of 8.6%. The phase IIIb LIBERTY study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aimovig in a broad spectrum of migraine patients ranging from those without a preventive treatment as well as those, who have tried and failed such therapies.Results from the study demonstrated that at least 50% of patients achieved reduction of monthly migraine, days from the baseline over the last four weeks compared with placebo, the primary endpoint of the study. Data from the trial also showed consistent efficacy, safety and tolerability of Aimovig across a wider spectrum of migraine patients including those with complicated cases.We remind investors that Amgen developed Aimovig in collaboration with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report). The companies have now agreed to combine capabilities to co-commercialize the candidate in the United States. Incidentally, Amgen retains its exclusive commercialization rights in Japan. Novartis, which retains its existing commercialization rights in rest of the world, has exclusive rights to commercialize Aimovig in Canada under the expanded deal.Per the World Health Organization, migraine is one of the most debilitating illnesses. Approximately 10 million Americans’ daily activities are affected by frequency or severity of migraine. Around 3.5 million subjects are undergoing a preventive therapy, of which, 80% discontinues the treatment within a year. Hence, approval of Aimovig will provide the company a much-needed access to a huge patient population in the United States, who are in need of additional curative options to apprehend the disease.However, several companies including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) among others are also developing migraine treatments targeting CGRP.Amgen Inc.

208,AMGN,"We have completed just three weeks in 2018 and the biotech sector is already seeing a significant pickup in merger and acquisition (M&A) deals. The year started off with Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announcing its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines.Soon thereafter, Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) confirmed that it is looking to acquire Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx. Novo Nordisk had initially proposed to acquire Ablynx for €26.75 per share in cash. However, the company came back with a revised offer when Ablynx rejected the first proposal. Novo Nordisk’s latest offer includes an upfront cash payment of €28 per share plus a contingent value right (“CVR”) worth up to €2.50 per share (total equity valuation of approximately €2.6 billion). This offer, too, has been rejected by Ablynx with the company’s Board announcing that the proposal fundamentally undervalues Ablynx and its growth prospects.Last week, Celgene was once again in the news on rumors that it is looking to acquire immuno-oncology focused Juno Therapeutics . Yesterday, the rumors were confirmed with the company saying that it will be acquiring Juno for approximately $9 billion. Another acquisition announcement was made yesterday – French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) said that it will be buying biopharma company Bioverativ for $11.6 billion. While Celgene is looking to strengthen its presence in the cancer space with the Impact and Juno acquisitions, Sanofi is looking to expand its presence in specialty care and strengthen its leadership in rare diseases through the Bioverativ acquisition.More M&A Deals to Follow?With these announcements being made, expectations are pretty high for more such deals in 2018. In fact, last week Acorda Therapeutics’s shares were up on rumors that Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is interested in acquiring the company.Factors like growing biosimilar competition, slowdown in growth of legacy products, major pipeline setbacks, looming patent expiries, pricing challenges and growing competition have forced big players to seek deals and acquisitions to grow their pipelines and boost their revenue stream.With tax reform expected to lead to an increase in cash repatriation, 2018 seems set for more M&A announcements. Companies like Pfizer, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Biogen, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Gilead are expected to be on the lookout for suitable deals this year. At the end of the third quarter of 2017, Gilead (which had acquired Kite for approximately $11.9 billion in 2017) had a cash and equivalents balance of $41.4 billion including $32.4 billion of overseas cash. Amgen’s cash balance was also $41.4 billion as of Sep 30, 2017 with about $38.9 billion being held overseas. Meanwhile, Merck exited the third quarter of 2017 with cash and equivalents worth $23.4 billion of which about 80%-90% is held overseas. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s overseas cash holdings were approximately $9.4 billion at the end of the third quarter. Biogen’s overseas cash balance was approximately $4.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2017. While some of this cash is likely to be used for share buybacks and dividend payments, these companies are also expected to use the funds for acquisition deals.  Most of these companies are on the lookout for assets and technologies that are potentially transformational and/or address unmet needs. Immuno-oncology is currently very much in demand though companies are also focusing on rare disease and orphan disease areas. While valuations look high for cancer-focused companies especially ones involved in immuno-oncology, valuations appear to be more reasonable for specialty pharma companies and companies that are focused on central nervous system diseases and other such areas.Although many of the large-cap players have expressed an interest in pursuing M&A deals, they have also pointed out that the deals should make sense from a financial perspective. High valuations and bidding wars could keep some of the key players on the sidelines.Companies like AveXis, bluebird, BioMarin, Puma Biotechnology, Incyte, and Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) are often considered acquisition targets. Exelixis is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

210,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced data from the phase II KEYNOTE-224 study evaluating the use of its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-a form of liver cancer, who were previously treated with systemic therapy (sorafenib). The data showed that treatment with Keytruda monotherapy led to an overall response rate (ORR) of 16.3%. The data also showed complete response rate of 1% and a partial response rate of 15.4% on treatment with KeytrudaThe data also included six-month overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates. The median PFS in the Keytruda arm was 4.8 months with a six-month PFS rate of 43.1 percent. However, the data showed that the median OS was not reached at the time of analysis and the six-month OS rate was 77.9%.The data was presented presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal (ASCO GI) Cancers Symposium in San Francisco. Notably, Keytruda is already marketed for several cancer indications, including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.Last week, Merck announced that Keytruda, in combination with Lilly’s  (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta (pemetrexed) and acisplatin or carboplatin, met dual primary endpoints in a phase III KEYNOTE-189 study. The combination was evaluated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. The study met both its primary endpoints, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS (co-primary endpoint).We remind investors at the third quarter 2017 call, Merck had mentioned that it is including the overall survival (OS) as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 study, which could defer the readout from the study to 2019. It was then estimated that the study would complete in February 2019 Therefore the one year earlier than expected positive read out of KEYNOTE-189 study was a big boost to the company.Shares of Merck have lost 0.9% in the past one year compared unfavorably with the industry’s 23.9% increase. We remind investors that Keytruda is a key top-line driver for Merck and it brought in $1.5 billion sales in third-quarter 2017, up 18.8% sequentially and 194% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by a launch of new indications globally.Significantly, Keytruda sales in the United States have gained particularly from a strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and two additional diseases in Europe.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. It is under trial for more than 30 types of cancer in above 650 studies including excess of 300 combination studies.Merck is collaborating separately with several companies namely Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report)  Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens. Merck & Company, Inc. Price  Merck & Company, Inc.

211,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 24, 2018. The Swiss pharmaceutical company’s stock has rallied 3.2% in the last six months compared with the  industry's 10.4% gain.Novartis has an excellent track record. In the last quarter, Novartis delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.2%. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.25% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the third-quarter results, Novartis reiterated its annual guidance. Net sales are expected to be in line with the 2016 levels after including the impact of continued genericization of Gleevec/Glivec in the United States and Europe.Novartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon and Sandoz (Generics). Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis, given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space. Sales from this division are expected to grow marginally.New products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals like AbbVie, Inc.'s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen. Inc's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved the blockbuster status in 2016 and recorded over $1 billion of sales. While Entresto is expected to record $500 million revenues, sales of Cosentyx are projected to reach $2 billion in 2017.Additionally, Novartis' generic arm, Sandoz, is making efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio. The company plans to launch five biosimilars of major oncology and immunology biologics across key geographies by 2020. The company is, however, facing significant pricing pressures which might impact the fourth-quarter results. The company now expects sales to decline or broadly in line.Meanwhile, the loss of exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis' portfolio will continue to hurt the company's top line.  The company's blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, the EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016 and in the EU in December 2016, thereby leading to generic competition. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the United States and the EU. Further, the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno-oncology therapies. The negative impact of generic competition is expected to impact sales by $2.5 billion.The performance of the ophthalmology division, Alcon business was weak due to competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases. Consequently, Novartis took a few steps to revive the business. The turnaround has been encouraging and management believes creating a standalone company via a capital markets exit could create additional shareholder value. A decision is expected in the first half of 2019, depending on Alcon’s performance in the future.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Novartis will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Novartis is 0.00%.  This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.16. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .Zacks Rank: Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.90% and a Zacks Rank #1.

The drug was approved in the United States in September.Mvasi is approved in the EU for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. Note that Mvasi is the first bevacizumab biosimilar to be approved in the European Union.The approval was in line with expectations considering the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) had rendered a positive opinion for the approval of Mvasi in November/The approval was supported by a comprehensive data package that demonstrated similarity of Mvasi with bevacizumab.Amgen has collaborated with Allergan for the worldwide development and commercialization of four oncology antibody biosimilar medicines. Other than Mvasi, Amgen/Allergan’s portfolio also includes biosimilar versions of Herceptin (under review in the United States and EU) and Rituxan (in late stage studies)Overall, Amgen has 10 biosimilars in its pipeline including biosimilar versions of Johnson and Johnson/Merck’s Remicade and Alexion’s Soliris.

214,AMGN,"Shares of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SPPI  -  Free Report) have been witnessing an upside. This biotech company has more than doubled in the past six months, surging 134.2% and significantly outperforming the 5.1% rise of the industry during this period.Spectrum is focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing products, primarily in the fields of hematology and oncology. The company markets six products, which are utilized to treat several cancer indications including lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma. However, its primary focus is on the development of pipeline, which includes poziotinib, Qapzola and Rolontis.Pipeline in FocusThe price performance in the last six months can be attributed to its strong pipeline. The company initiated a phase III study on Qapzola, a phase II study on poziotinib and completed enrollment of the phase III pivotal study on Rolontis.Spectrum Pharmaceuticals is developing Qapzola for treating non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, Rolontis for the management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in breast cancer patients and poziotinib in non-small cell lung cancer patients (“NSCLC”) and breast cancer.In October 2017, Spectrum announced encouraging preliminary data on poziotinib from phase II NSCLC study in patients who have exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR. Of these, 73% of the patients treated with poziotinib had objective response. The stock witnessed a rise following the news. Spectrum is evaluating the candidate in a phase II study NSCLC patients with exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR or HER2.Meanwhile, two phase III studies – ADVANCE and RECOVER – are evaluating the company’s most advanced candidate, Rolontis. Both the studies have a similar design and are evaluating Rolontis versus Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta for management of neutropeniain early-stage breast cancer. The RECOVER study is being conducted for strengthening the regulatory package for a biologics license application, which is expected to be filed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Top line data from the ADVANCE study is expected in the first quarter of 2018..However, product sales have been lackluster in the last six months. This keeps investors focused on pipeline development. Meanwhile, Spectrum’s cash and cash equivalents rose about $109 million to $247 million in the third quarter of 2017, which should help the company fund the development of candidates. A positive data readout from the Rolontis study expected this quarter may propel the stock further.Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price  Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

215,AMGN,"Shares of Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) have increased a massive 483.7% in a year’s time, substantially outperforming the industry’s gain of 11.9%. Let’s analyze the factors that led to this massive rally.Nektar’s rapid progress on a robust pipeline in a year accompanied with several study initiations, positive readouts and strategic collaborations has driven its share price consistently.The company’s PEGylation technology also facilitated development of several approved products in the United States and the EU through partnerships with healthcare companies namely AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) Movantik, UCB’s Cimzia and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta, among others.Furthermore, it has a robust pipeline of early and late-stage candidates. Nektar has made a significant progress with its lead candidate Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102), which is currently under accelerated assessment in the EU, for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated within the first half of 2018.Meanwhile, a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) began on Onzeald, late last year. The study compares Onzeald with the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice on patients with advanced breast cancer having brain metastases of late. Positive results from the program are likely to support a regulatory filing in the United States.Apart from Onzeald, Nektar is working on developing other candidates. In September 2017, the company announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of its immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, in combination with Roche’s Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).A phase I/II PIVOT study, evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, is also underway across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications.In November 2017, the company announced positive data from PIVOT study for treating patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancers.Also, Nektar entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio in May 2017.Another candidate, NKTR-181, is being examined in a phase III program for treatment of chronic pain. In July 2017, the company reported positive top-line findings from an oral human abuse potential study, analysing NKTR-181, to assess the opioid abuse potential compared with oxycodone. It is planning to submit a new drug application for the candidate by April 2018.In March 2017, the company initiated a phase I clinical study, evaluating NKTR-358, to treat a wide range of auto-immune diseases and inflammatory disorders.Subsequently, in July 2017, Nektar sealed a co-development deal with Elly Lilly and Company for NKTR-358. Pursuant to this agreement, the company will own responsibility for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. Both the companies will share phase II development costs with Lilly acquiring the lion share (75%) of the total expenses.This year looks extremely favorable for the stock with several updates lined up. The expected approval of Onzeald in the EU for breast cancer and the submission of NDA for NKTR-181 should act as a catalyst to further drive the stock in 2018.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

216,AMGN,"Investing in sound large-cap pharma stocks seems judicious as they are fundamentally lucrative and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows for the investor.The drug sector had a good run in 2017, bouncing back after drug pricing issues dampened its performance in 2016. Importantly, the sector saw a considerable increase in new drug approvals last year. The FDA approved 46 novel drugs last year, more than double of 2016’s tally of 22.The Large Cap Pharma industry witnessed an impressive rally in 2017, up 16.3% against a decline of 5.2% in 2016. The run was propelled by encouraging quarterly results, increased demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion. Strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of legacy products also boosted the sector.These factors are expected to play an instrumental role in 2018 as well, which may take the large-cap drug sector to new highs. The industry is already up 3.9% so far this year.Notably, the Large Cap Pharma industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #100, placing it among the top 39% of the 265 plus Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.The passing of the tax overhaul bill by the Congress is a cherry on the top. The slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% is likely to further boost profit margins.Moreover, the cash repatriation window allowed in the bill will help companies to bring in cash stashed in foreign locations, leaving these companies with extra cash in hand. This may lead to strategic deals like merger and acquisitions this year, which were relatively fewer in 2017.Most drug companies with a large market cap have seen their share price rise in 2018 so far. Here we present four companies, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report), Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), which outperformed the industry last year and have the potential to repeat the same performance in 2018.Johnson & JohnsonThe company's stock was up 21.3% in 2017, which compared favorably with a gain of 16.3% recorded by the industry. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company’s shares were boosted by the approval of two drugs, Tremfya for plaque psoriasis and Juluca for HIV, along with several line extensions to its major drugs including Xarelto, Simponi Aria, Stelara and Imbruvicain 2017.The trend is expected to continue in 2018. J&J has several regulatory applications for label expansion of its key drugs under review. Potential approval to these line extensions will certainly boost the company’s growth prospects. Meanwhile, there are several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones lined up for 2018.Moreover, J&J’s pharma segment’s growth accelerated in third quarter of 2017 after slowing down in the first half due to a number of factors including competition for some key drugs like Remicade and Concerta. The upside is expected to continue in 2018.AbbVieThe stock of the company was up 54.4% in 2017. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In 2017, the company reported a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies, regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine, Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvica and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report).AbbVie also expects several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones in 2018, which is expected to further aid the company. The data readout from the pivotal phase III TRINITY study on Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer will be an important catalyst for the stock. Moreover, a FDA decision is expected on the new drug application (""NDA"") for elagolix for endometriosis, which was granted priority review in October last year.AbbVie’s blockbuster drug, Humira, has been performing well despite competitive pressure. The company expects the drug’s performance to continue, which will boost the topline. Imbruvica is also doing consistently well with multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.Novo-NordiskShares of the company increased 49.7% in 2017. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3.This company was granted approval to expand the label of its diabetes drug, Victoza, to include treatment of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type II diabetes in August 2017. Moreover, a new diabetes drug, Fiasp, received approval in September 2017 for treating adults with diabetes. In December 2017, the FDA approved Ozempic, a semaglutide once-daily pre-filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients. It also received approval for Rebinyn for hemophilia B in the United States and Refixia for the treatment of adolescents and adults with the same indication in Europe.In 2018, the company expects a U.S. launch of Ozempic and an approval for the same in Europe, which will certainly boost the company’s revenues.Moreover, the company serves almost half of the insulin market and a quarter of the diabetes market. The growing diabetes market will certainly boost the topline.ZoetisThe company's shares rose 34.6% in 2017. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The company has a diversified portfolio of livestock and companion animal products. In2017, the company increased its share of the dermatology products for dogs market to 59%. The companion animal business has been performing well, along with the launch of Apoquel and Cytopoint. The company acquired Nexvet Biopharma last year, which boosted its pipeline of solutions for chronic pain management in dogs and cats. The company also expanded the reach of its poultry diagnostics products into major European markets.In 2018, Zoetis topline is expected to benefit from Cytopoint, which was launched in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company expects cattle herd size to increase in 2018, which will drive growth.ConclusionWith a strong product portfolio, consistently successful pipeline developments and anticipated growth in demand for drugs, these companies will likely attract investor attention this year as well.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

217,AMGN,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its regulatory application to include overall survival (OS) data from the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study on the label of its multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis. Please note that the FDA’s decision comes much earlier than expected. It was initially expected in April.Amgen had submitted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA in July last year. The regulatory application in the EU seeking approval to include OS data from ENDEAVOR study was also submitted in the same month.Data presented from the ENDEAVOR study earlier had demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Takeda’s Velcade plus dexamethasone in second-line multiple myeloma setting. The Kyprolis plus dexamethasone arm reduced the risk of death by 21% and increased OS by 7.6 months compared to the combination of Velcade plus dexamethasone.While Kyprolis is already approved for this patient population, the overall survival data should help drive usage and boost sales.Other ongoing studies for Kyprolisinclude a phase III ARROW study, which is evaluating a weekly dosing regimen of Kyprolis in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients and a phase III ASPIRE study evaluating a triple combination regimen of Kyprolis plus Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (KRd) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma compared to Revlimid and dexamethasone (Rd).Amgen has also formed collaboration with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) to study the combination of Kyprolis and J&J’s Darzalex in multiple clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma.Kyprolis generated sales of $207 million in the third quarter of 2017, recording year-over-year growth of 13% driven by higher demand and robust uptake from outside U.S. markets.Shares of Amgen were up more than 1% on Wednesday. In the past year, Amgen’s shares have returned 22.2%  compared with 3.8% increase registered by the industry.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked biotech stock is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

218,AMGN,"Acquisitions once again remained in focus this week with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) rumored to be in talks with Juno  regarding a possible deal.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJuno Soars on Acquisition Rumors: Juno’s shares skyrocketed on reports that Celgene is interested in acquiring the immuno-oncology focused company. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the companies are in talks regarding a possible acquisition deal. If the Juno acquisition rumors turn out to be true, this will be the second acquisition announcement to be made by Celgene this year. Just last week, the company announced its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines, which is developing fedratinib for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.Celgene is under a lot of pressure to strengthen its pipeline and revenue stream - the company had a tough 2017 with issues like pipeline setbacks as well as the weak performance of Otezla weighing on the stock.However, it remains to be seen how much Celgene will be willing to shell out for Juno. Juno’s market cap as of Jan 16, 2018 was $5.2 billion. Juno’s shares have been on an upward trend following the $11.9 billion Gilead-Kite acquisition announcement last year in August. With Juno being focused on the development of innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, the company has long been considered a potential acquisition target. Over the last one year, Juno’s shares are up 139% compared to the 3.3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma. Although Juno suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), the company is now focusing on liso-cel, a next-generation CAR-T cell product that targets CD19. Juno expects to file for FDA approval of liso-cel for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) in the second half of 2018. With the immuno-oncology space remaining quite lucrative, Celgene may have to pay a hefty premium to finalize the deal. Juno and Celgene already have a collaboration deal in place.Concert Down on Patent Challenge Update: Concert Pharmaceuticals (CNCE  -  Free Report) suffered a major blow with its Post Grant Review (“PGR”) petition challenging the validity of U.S. Patent No. 9,662,335 being rejected by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Concert had filed the petition last year in July challenging the validity of the patent that has been assigned to Incyte Pharmaceuticals (INCY  -  Free Report). The concerned patent covers deuterated ruxolitinib analogs while Concert’s CTP-543 is a deuterium-modified version of ruxolitinib. Incyte markets ruxolitinib in the United States under the name Jakafi and has patents covering ruxolitinib that may be unexpired if and when Concert seeks marketing approval for CTP-543.Despite the setback, Concert said that it can always challenge the validity of the patent later in federal court. Moreover, the company said that the decision does not affect its plans to develop CTP-543 for alopecia areata. However, the company is now reassessing its plans for developing CTP-543 for additional indications.CTP-543 is a novel JAK inhibitor currently in phase II development for alopecia areata. The FDA recently granted fast track status to the candidate for this indication (Read more: Concert Pharmaceuticals Plunges on Patent Petition Setback).Vertex’s Orkambi Label Expanded in EU: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) gained EU approval for the use of Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) in children with cystic fibrosis (“CF”) in the 6-11 years age group with two copies of the F508del mutation. About 3,400 children in Europe belong to this category. Approval was in-line with expectations considering the company had got a positive opinion from the European Union Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) for this indication in November 2017 (Read more: Vertex's Cystic Fibrosis Drug Ok'd for Pediatric Use in EU). Vertex is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Humira Biosimilar BLA Accepted by FDA: The FDA has accepted for review a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) submitted by Sandoz for its biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster drug, Humira (adalimumab). Humira is approved for a wide range of indications. At a recent healthcare conference, AbbVie said that global Humira sales crossed $18 billion in 2017 and should approach $21 billion in 2020. The company, which expects the drug to lose exclusivity in international markets in the fourth quarter of 2018, believes that sales erosion will be manageable.  We note that Sandoz is not the first to file for a biosimilar version of Humira. In fact, companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim have already gained approval for their Humira biosimilars. Amgen, which entered into a global settlement and license agreement with AbbVie, expects to launch its Humira biosimilar in Europe in October 2018 and in the United States in January 2023. Meanwhile, AbbVie and Boehringer are engaged in patent litigation in the United States.Eiger Plunges on Pipeline Setback: Eiger suffered a major setback with its investigational treatment, ubenimex, for pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) failing to meet the primary endpoint in a mid-stage study. Based on this disappointing update, the company has decided to discontinue the development of ubenimex for PAH though it will continue to evaluate ubenimex for lymphedema. Ubenimex is in a mid-stage study for this indication with data expected in the second half of the year. The company’s shares were down 49.4% on the news.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up slightly over the last four trading sessions.

While the FDA approved Mvasi -  Amgen and Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Avastin - and Parsabiv for secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), EU approved Amgevita, Amgen’s biosimilar version of Humira,Amgen also gained approval for several line extensions - FDA approval to include a new indication - risk reduction of major cardiovascular events data – on Repatha’s labeland overall survival datafrom the TOWER study on leukemia drug Blincyto’s label; approval for arefined indication for metastatic colorectal cancerdrug Vectibix and EU approval for a pediatric formulation of Mimparafor secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive their sales higher in future quarters.In 2017, Amgen made several data presentations from studies evaluating line extensions on key marketed products, Repatha and Kyprolis- both with blockbuster potential - and other studies on its pipeline candidates, tezepelumab(asthma) and Evenity(osteoporosis)Factors Likely to Support the Stock in 2018With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock is likely to continue.This year, Amgen expects regulatory approval for pipeline candidates, Aimovig/erenumab(prevention of episodic and chronic migraine) and Evenity and label expansion for Prolia and Kyprolis. This month, Amgen already received FDA approval for an expanded patient population for Xgeva - multiple myeloma patients. In the biosimilars portfolio, Amgen expects EU approval for Mvasi and FDA/EU approval for the biosimilar version of Roche’s other cancer drug, Herceptin.Also, Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are performing well, a trend expected to continue next year, which should drive sales. Sales of other newer products like Kyprolis, Repatha and Blincyto are expected to pick up in 2018 as they were approved forlabel expansions last year.Besides this, Amgen’s restructuring plan is making it leaner and more cost efficient,which should lend support to the bottom line.Though Amgen faces some challenges, given the presenceof biosimilar competition, slowdown in sales of mature drugs, mainly its blockbuster drug Enbrel, the positives are expected to outweigh the headwinds.Amgen markets Enbrel in partnership with Pfizer, Inc.

220,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz announced that the FDA accepted its Biologics License Application (BLA) for the proposed biosimilar of AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira.The biosimilar was submitted under the 351 (k) pathway.The drug is already approved for the treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.The data package submitted to the FDA comprises analytical, preclinical and clinical data and is expected to demonstrate that Sandoz proposed biosimilar adalimumab matches the reference biologic in terms of safety, efficacy and quality. It also included a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers and a phase III confirmatory safety and efficacy study in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 4% in the past one year compared with the industry’s 9.1% gain.The biosimilar version of Humira is also under review in the EU. We note Sandoz holds a leading position in the biosimilars space with a portfolio of five marketed biosimilars currently and a deep pipeline.The biosimilar version of rituximab, Rixathon, was approved by the European Commission in June 2017. It is currently under review in the United States.Meanwhile, Sandoz witnessed strong growth outside the United States buoyed by launches of Rixathon and Erelzi, the biosimilars of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in Europe. However, pricing pressure intensified in the United States.  The company expects low single-digit sales decline at Sandoz in the fourth quarter, mainly due to seasonal shipment phasing and continued pricing pressures in the United States.Meanwhile, Novartis is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering. The company believes that the Alcon division has revived well for now even though a separation via capital markets will create value for shareholders. On the other hand, Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space.Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc.

222,AMGN,"With the rise in demand for immuno-oncology drugs and their combinations, Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, is fast becoming the key top-line driver of the pharma giant.Keytruda is marketed for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and bladder cancer.Having crossed the $1-billion mark in sales during the third quarter of 2017, Keytruda became the second largest product in the Merck portfolio. The treatment fetched in sales of $2.51 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 174% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, which further boosts demand. Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from a strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer as the therapy is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting.The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017with regulatory approvals secured for six new indications in the United States, four in Europe and three in Japan. Key approvals for indications included advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and the first approval of a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo) for first-line lung cancer.The new approvals expanded the patient population, driving up sales in the third quarter. This momentum should be maintained in the fourth quarter and in 2018 as well.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in above 600 studies including excess of 400 combination trials. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens. Data from several programs on Keytruda were presented at medical conferences in 2017.We expect Merck to present data from several key Keytruda studies this year including a combination study with Incyte’s epacadostat in first-line metastatic melanoma. Also, Keytruda could get an approval for the relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma indication this year with FDA action expected in April.ConclusionMerck did witness some setbacks regarding Keytruda’s pipeline program in 2017. In October, the company announced a delay in the readout from an important lung cancer study and postponed it to 2019. This was due to the inclusion of overall survival as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 phase III study of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. This in turn raised investor concern as the delay in the readout can give competitors a chance to gain traction in the lung cancer market.Also, three combination studies of Keytruda on multiple myeloma were put on clinical hold, following reports of death in Keytruda groups last July.Also Merck’s top line has been lately hurt by a generic competition from several drugs and pricing pressure. We believe, Keytruda has immense commercial potential and coupled with some other newer drugs, can ease the impact of genericization. Although rivalry in the immuno-oncology market has risen following FDA approval of newer oncology treatments like Pfizer’s Bavencio (avelumab) for Merkel-cell carcinoma (MCC) and bladder cancer indications and AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) for bladder cancer, we believe that Keytruda can give these drugs a tough run for money as there is ample scope for growth in the immuno-oncology space.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

223,AMGN,"The year 2017 has been better than expected for the biotech sector. The NASDAQ Biotechnology index was up 18.7% in 2017. While drug pricing issue, competition and a slowdown in growth of key drugs are expected to remain a hangover in 2018 as well, approval of new drugs and strategic acquisitions by several big wigs in 2017 are likely to boost investors’ sentiments. Thus 2018 needless to say, holds promise for generating stellar returns.The slowdown in mature products compelled bigwigs like Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) to undertake acquisitions to bolster pipelines. Gilead acquired erstwhile Kite Pharma and added Yescarta to its kitty. The company also inked an agreement to acquire Cell Design Labs. Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Recently, Celgene, Inc. (CELG  -  Free Report) inked a deal to acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017, having suffered a few pipeline setbacks and weakness in Otezla sales. Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank.Acquisitions and mergers will keep investors focused in the space in 2018.  In addition, new drug approvals and label expansion of existing drugs will boost the top line of prominent biotech companies.Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) looks poised for growth with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio. Amgen’s new drugs — Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar — are performing well. The company recently won the FDA approval for the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) of Xvega to expand the drug’s label for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3.Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is another biotech which looks poised for growth in 2018. The recent FDA approval of the label expansion of lead drug Cabometyx for the treatment previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma is expected to drive growth. The drug has performed impressively since approval in 2016. Exelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well and the FDA approval of the drug for generalized myasthenia gravis will further boost sales. Among new products, while Strensiq is gaining momentum, the company redefined its strategy for Kanuma.  Alexion carries a Zacks Rank #3.Investors should also keep an eye on key upcoming PDUFA dates. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) is looking to expand label for its newly approved drug Dupixent. The drug is already approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The company is also evaluating the drug for treating asthma in adults (LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study).  sBLA for the same is expected to be filed shortly. Regeneron is working on expanding lead ophthalmology drug Eylea label into additional indications. The FDA has accepted for review the company's sBLA for the label expansion of Eylea Injection. The company is seeking approval a for a 12-week dosing interval of Eylea Injection in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) based on physician's assessment. The action date set by the FDA is Aug 11, 2018. Regeneron carries a Zacks Rank #3.Another big biotech, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) is taking measures to strengthen its already dominant position in the cystic fibrosis market (CF). Vertex has two CF drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — in its portfolio with blockbuster potential.  The company has developed another CF corrector tezacaftor (VX-661) — in combination with ivacaftor.  Regulatory applications are under review in the United States (PDUFA Date: Feb 28, 2018) and the EU.  A potential approval would further bolster demand.  Vertex currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return   Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnConclusion While the threat of biosimilars loom large on key drugs of most companies, we expect investors to remain focussed on this dynamic sector eying new drug approvals and important data read-outs.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

224,AMGN,"AstraZeneca, plc (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (“EC”) has granted approval to its asthma disease candidate, benralizumab. It is approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in adult patients. It will be marketed by the trade name of Fasenra.With this approval, Fasenra is the first respiratory biologic drug to have an 8-week maintenance dosing schedule. The drug will be available in a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection via a prefilled syringe.We remind investors that Fasenra received approval in the same indication in the United States in November last year. It is also under review in JapanAstraZeneca’s shares have gained 25.1% in the past year, comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 18.4% in that period.The EC approved Fasenra based on data from the WINDWARD program, which included three phase III studies – SIROCCO, CALIMA and ZONDA.Data from SIROCCO and CALIMA showed that Fasenra achieved significant reductions in exacerbations and improvements in lung function. Meanwhile, data from ZONDA study showed that Fasenra alone or in combination with standard of care (glucocorticoid) led to statistically-significant and clinically relevant reduction in daily maintenance oral corticosteroid (“OCS”) compared with placebo.Severe asthma patients whose disease is driven by inflammation of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, have until now had only limited treatment options, mostly oral steroids. Fasenra, which distinctively targets and rapidly depletes eosinophils, has shown potential to reduce oral steroid use in such patients.GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK  -  Free Report) Nucala (subcutaneous administration) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' (TEVA  -  Free Report) Cinqair (intravenous infusion) are presently marketed for the same indication but administered once every four weeks.Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of breathlessness and has a significant unmet medical need. This affects 315 million individuals worldwide and up to 10% of patients who have severe asthma, which can become uncontrolled despite receiving high doses of standard of care medicines and require the use of chronic OCS.Benralizumab is also being evaluated for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (""COPD"") in late-stage studies. Other severe asthma candidates in AstraZeneca’s portfolio are tralokinumab and tezepelumab — in partnership with Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report).AstraZeneca’s respiratory portfolio accounted for 23% of total product sales in the first nine months of 2017. The segment saw a decline in sales in the period due to competition and other market conditions. However, addition of another drug in the portfolio will certainly boost performance.Astrazeneca PLC Price Astrazeneca PLC Price | Astrazeneca PLC QuoteAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

228,AMGN,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner UCB announced that the marketing authorization application (“MAA”) seeking approval of Evenity for treating osteoporosis has been accepted by the European Medicine Agency (“EMA”). Amgen is looking to get Evenity approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture in Europe.Shares of the company have increased 13.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s decline of 3.4% in that period.The MAA included data from three pivotal phase III studies – FRAME, ARCH and BRIDGE – in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, postmenopausal women with osteoporosisat high risk for fracture and men who have osteoporosis.Evenity treats osteoporosis by increasing bone formation and reducing bone resorption simultaneously, which increases bone mineral density (“BMD”) and reduces the risk of fracture.In the ARCH study, Evenity showed statistically significant superior fracture risk reduction in postmenopausal women compared to current standard of care for osteoporosis, Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Fosamax.The EMA will review the potential of Evenity in increasing BMR as well as reducing risk of fracture and also cardiovascular safety signal from ARCH study.We remind investors that the biologics license application (“BLA”) seeking approval of Evenity for the same indication in the United States was issued a complete response letter (“CRL”) by the FDA in July 2017. The CRL was issued due to a cardiovascular side effect observed in the ARCH study. The BLA included data only from FRAME study and the FDA has requested a resubmission of the application with additional data from ARCH and BRIDGE study.In a separate press release, Amgen reported that Mechelen, Belgium-based Biocartis Group has signed a development agreement with Amgen for developing the former’s Idylla(TM) CDx biomarker tests for analyzing novel oncology compound, which can be used for the treatment of certain solid tumors.Amgen Inc.

229,AMGN,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that a phase III study evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda as monotherapy for the treatment of high-risk melanoma met the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS).Keytruda is already approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and bladder cancer.Interim data from the KEYNOTE-054 study showed that treatment with Keytruda, as an adjuvant therapy in surgically resected high-risk melanoma patients, led to significantly improved RFS compared to placebo. In other words, Keytruda showed the potential to extend the duration before the disease recurs in high-risk melanoma patients.The study will continue to evaluate other key endpoints, including overall survival. Results from the study will be submitted to regulatory authorities and also be presented at a future medical meeting.Merck is conducting the study in collaboration with The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).Shares of Merck have declined 5.4% in the past year against the industry's surge of 16.9%.Keytruda, the second-largest product in the Merck portfolio, is a key top line driver for Merck. In fact, Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with several key regulatory approvals, which should further drive sales in 2018.Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including over 300 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.In another press release, Merck announced that the FDA has accepted the new drug application (NDA) for its investigational candidate, doravirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.Merck is looking to get doravirine approved as a once-daily single tablet in combination with other antiretroviral agents and also as a once-daily fixed-dose combination regimen containing doravirine, lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (DOR/3TC/TDF). The FDA is expected to give its decision on both the applications on Oct 23, 2018.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

230,AMGN,"2017 turned out to be a notable year for the pharma and biotech industry with the FDA giving its nod to 46 novel drugs as well as several biological license applications (“BLA”) including for path-breaking cancer treatments like Kymriah and Yescarta. This number compares favorably not only to 2016 when just 22 novel drugs were approved, but to earlier years as well. A look at the chart below shows that the highest number of approvals recorded since 1993 was in 1996 when 53 novel drugs were approved.According to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”), a higher number of new applications were submitted in 2017 compared to five year averages. As of Nov 30, 2017, all regulatory applications that were approved in 2017 met their PDUFA goal dates with quite a few approvals coming ahead of the FDA action date. About 88% of these drugs were approved in the first review cycle with 70% being approved under priority review status. As of Nov 30, 2017, the approval action rate was 82%.Many of the drugs approved in 2017 had also gained Breakthrough Therapy designation – while 17 breakthrough therapies were approved last year (as of Nov 30, 2017), since inception, 192 Breakthrough Therapy designations have been granted by the CDER out of a total of 529 requests (as of Nov 30, 2017). A major part of the Breakthrough Therapy requests are for cancer drugs followed by hematology and antiviral.Landmark decisions last year include the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.Other key approvals included Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report)/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Many of these drugs have blockbuster potential.What’s in Store for 2018?The FDA intends to continue working on the recruitment and hiring of new drugs program staff. The agency will also work on the continued implementation of new PDUFA VI and BsUFA II agreements, other aspects of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDARA”) and the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act is expected to encourage more innovation in the sector and, maybe, a surge in new drug approvals.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Some of the key drugs currently under FDA review with decisions expected in the coming months include Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) investigational migraine drug, Aimovig (target action date of May 17, 2018), Dova Pharmaceuticals’s avatrombopag, and GW Pharmaceuticals’s (GWPH  -  Free Report) Epidiolex (cannabidiol or CBD), an investigational treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome. Epidiolex is currently under priority review for these two rare and difficult to treat conditions of childhood-onset epilepsy with a response from the FDA expected on Jun 27, 2018. Dova’s avatrombopag is also under priority review for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease (“CLD”) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure – a response from the regulatory body is expected on May 21, 2018.Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

231,AMGN,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to expand the label of its key drug, Xgeva.Xgeva is currently approved for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in solid tumors in patients with bone metastases. With the latest FDA approval, the label of Xgeva will be expanded to include patients with multiple myeloma.The FDA decision comes earlier than the PDUFA date of Feb 2, 2018. A similar regulatory application is also under review in the EU.In the past year, Amgen’s shares have returned 13.8% in contrast to 1.7% decrease registered by the industry.The FDA approval was based on safety and efficacy from the pivotal phase III '482 study, which enrolled 1,718 patients. The head-to-head study, which compared Xgeva to Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Zometa (zoledronic acid), met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of the drugs in delaying the time to first on-study SRE in patients with multiple myeloma.Bone complications in patients with multiple myeloma can be quite damaging. Until now, bisphosphonates were the only treatment option available for bone protection in multiple myeloma patients. However, bisphosphonates may cause renal toxicity and lead to renal impairment. Xgeva, which is not cleared through the kidneys, offers a better treatment option for such patients.Xgeva is key revenue driver for Amgen and generated revenues of $1.18 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 3% year over year. We expect approval for the expanded patient population to help in further boosting sales of the drug.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked biotech stocks are Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) and Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report), both with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Vertex’s stock has returned 87.9% in the past year while earnings estimates for 2018 have gone up by almost 3% in the past 30 days.Earnings estimates for Exelixis have moved north by 1.4% in the past 30 days while the stock price has increased 79.9% in the past year.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

232,AMGN,"The Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) area is in focus once again with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) saying that it will be dropping its plans to develop treatments for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. According to news sources, Pfizer expects its decision to result in the elimination of 300 positions from the neuroscience discovery and early development programs. We expect additional details to be available at the company’s presentation at the 36th Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference today.Pfizer has had a long association with the Alzheimer’s disease research area. In 2015, the company became a part of the Dementia Discovery Fund, which was formed to speed up the development of new treatments for neurological diseases by bringing together major pharma companies, the UK government and Alzheimer’s Research UK. The Fund is involved in the financing of new, early stage drug development projects.However, Alzheimer’s has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made despite the investment of a lot of funds and resources. In fact, Pfizer itself had faced a major setback way back in 2012 in its development efforts for an Alzheimer’s disease treatment. The company and its partner, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), decided to discontinue the development of bapineuzumab IV following a late-stage failure.Other companies like Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) have also stumbled in their efforts to develop treatments for Alzheimer’s. Lilly decided in November 2016 that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study. The candidate was being evaluated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid, a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.Meanwhile, the evaluation of Merck’s investigational Alzheimer’s disease treatment, verubecestat, was halted in a phase II/III study (EPOCH) in February 2017 based on an interim analysis by an external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) that the study might fail. Another study is ongoing with results expected in February 2019.Biogen also suffered a setback recently when an Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint in the phase II study. The failure to show an early positive result came as a major disappointment for Biogen which is developing the candidate in association with Eisai.Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Axovant Sciences (AXON  -  Free Report) suffered a major setback in September 2017 when its investigational Alzheimer’s disease candidate failed to meet the co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study. The company decided to discontinue development of the 35 mg dose for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Over the last one year, the company’s shares are down 59.7% compared to the 1.7% decline of the industry it belongs to.According to the Alzheimer's Association, in the 10 years from 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer’s in studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval.The Road AheadDespite all these setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments given the high commercial potential in this market. Success in this area means huge returns considering more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Companies that are currently working on Alzheimer’s disease treatments include Biogen, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca, Eisai and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report). Biogen’s aducanumab is one of the most important candidates in the company’s pipeline with the candidate currently in a couple of late-stage studies. Biogen is also working on elenbecestat (E2609), a BACE inhibitor in a phase III program. These candidates are being developed in collaboration with Eisai.  Lilly also has quite a few Alzheimer’s disease candidates in its pipeline including lanabecestat, which is being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca with data readout expected in 2019. Meanwhile, Novartis and Amgen are collaborating for BACE1 inhibitor, CNP520, which has fast track status in the United Status. Roche is also collaborating with AC Immune for the development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments.While companies like Pfizer, Lilly and Merck are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

233,AMGN,"ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report) announced that it has initiated a phase I study to evaluate its anti-CD123 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), IMGN632, for treating patients with hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.Notably, IMGN632 uses the company’s indolino-benzodiazepine cancer-killing agents known as IGNs.This is ImmunoGen’s second IGN ADC to move into clinical development, the first being IMGN779, a CD33-targeting ADC, already evaluated in a phase I study for the treatment of AML.We remind investors that the FDA has completed the safety review of the investigational new drug (IND) application for IMGN632 in October last year, which was filed by the company in mid-September for the aforementioned indications. The IND application was supported by positive data from preclinical studies, which demonstrated IMGN63’s promising activity against AML cells while sparing normal bone marrow cells.ImmunoGen’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has skyrocketed 185.6% compared with the industry’s 8.1% increase during the same time frame.The phase I study will follow a dose regime of IMGN632 once every three weeks. Thereafter, the selected dose will be evaluated in expansion cohorts in patients with the above mentioned hematologic malignancies.We remind investors that ImmunoGen had earlier entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC (JAZZ  -  Free Report) in August for the development and commercialization of IMGN632. The collaboration also includes IMGN779.Notably, ImmunoGen is focused on developing targeted cancer therapeutics using its proprietary ADC technology. In fact, this innovative technology of the company is also used in Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) marketed product, Kadcyla, and in three other development-stage candidates in its pipeline.Additionally, the ADC technology is used in development programs by ImmunoGen's partners Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Bayer AG, Biotest, CytomX, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Sanofi and Takeda.ImmunoGen, Inc.

234,AMGN,"The biosimilar space was in focus in 2017 on key FDA approvals.Biosimilars contain a version of the active substance of an already approved original biological drug. Development of biosimilars is technically more challenging than the development of generic drugs as the former requires clinical studies in patients and are engineered to match the reference drug in quality, safety and efficacy. Due to the complex nature of the product, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics. A biosimilar is usually less expensive than the branded drug. Thus, the market for the same is highly lucrative. With the acceleration in approvals of biosimilars, the market has thus attracted a lot many players which are witnessing rapid growth. Here we go through the progress report for 2017.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade (infliximab), in the United States in July 2017 after approval in April. The FDA also granted tentative approval for Lusduna Nexvue, the biosimilar version of Lantus, basal insulin in a pre-filled dosing device. Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Remicade has been seeing intense competition in the biosimilars space of late. We note that Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) supplies Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Remicade. Pfizer is a strong player in the biosimilars market. In December 2017, Pfizer got FDA approval for another of its Remicade’s biosimilar, Ixifi, as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. The company has a portfolio of three marketed biosimilar medicines outside the United States, including Inflectra, Retacrit (epoetin zeta) and Nivestim (filgrastim) along with a strong pipeline of 13 distinct biosimilar molecules in various stages of development. Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Generic leader Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) is also exploring the biosimilars market — that has the potential to grow to $20 billion by 2020. Early last December, Mylan and partner Biocon Ltd. announced the FDA approval of Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst), a biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab). Ogivri has been approved for all indications included in the label of the reference product, Herceptin, including the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and metastatic stomach cancer. Ogivri is the first FDA-approved biosimilar of Herceptin and the first biosimilar from Mylan and Biocon's joint portfolio. Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) won FDA approval for the biosimilar version of Avastin in September 2017 for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. We note that Mvasi is the first biosimilar approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer. Amgen’s biosimilar version of Humir, Amjevita, is already approved by the FDA and will be launched in the United States on Jan 31, 2023, after the company resolved litigation with the AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) The companies have also submitted a BLA to the FDA for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin in July 2017. We note that the companies are collaborating on four oncology biosimilars, including ABP 980, which is the second to be submitted for FDA approval. The companies also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for the candidate in 2017. We note that Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its pipeline, two of which have been approved by the FDA. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Boehringer Ingelheim’s Cyltezo (adalimumab-adbm), another biosimilar of Humira, was also approved by the FDA in August 2017. Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % ReturnConclusionOwing to the slew of FDA approvals, we expect investors to remain focused on this space in the near future.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

235,AMGN,"The year 2017 has turned out to be pretty impressive for the pharma/biotech stocks. Though the industry was hampered by drug pricing issues in 2016, it bounced back and made a considerable headway in 2017, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals. The regulatory body approved 46 novel drugs last year, easily surpassing 2016’s total tally of 22.Particularly, large-cap players in the industry raked in stellar returns, up 15.8% in the last 12 months. Nonetheless, the same space also posted a 5.2% decline in 2016.Upbeat quarterly results, rise in demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results as well as a continued strong performance of legacy products propelled the large-cap drug sector to scale new highs in 2017. Moreover, these tailwinds are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018.Meanwhile, jubilant Republicans have of late passed the tax overhaul bill for the first time in 30 years. The bill slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Such tax reduction is likely to further boost profit margins of these companies with more cash left in hand. This, in turn can also be used for striking strategic deals this year, which were relatively fewer in 2017.Notably, the Large Cap Pharma sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #104, placing it among the top 39% of the 265 plus Zacks industries. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.Banking on such positive trends, investing in sound large-cap pharma stocks this year seems judicious. We have therefore identified three Large Cap stocks based on a favorable combination of a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a strong VGM Score of A or B. These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows.Back-tested results show that only stocks with an impressive VGM Style Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank of 1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Below are the selected three companies, poised to continue their winning streak this year:AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report)This Illinois-based biopharmaceutical company is a lucrative option. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B. Shares of the company have soared 57.9% in a year’s time. Moreover, the stock’s earnings and sales are further estimated to increase 18.2% and 11.8%, respectively, in 2018. These positive trends were supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained key regulatory approvals and settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock is expected to continue this year.Novo-Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report)We also recommend Novo Nordisk, the Denmark-based global healthcare company and a leader in the worldwide diabetes market.  Shares of the company have surged 51.2% in a year's time. Moreover, the stock’s earnings and sales are further estimated to increase 5.3% and 1.5%, respectively, in 2018.Currently the stock, with VGM Score of B, carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Novo-Nordisk has been in news for the past few months based on the encouraging progress of its diabetes pipeline. In December 2017, Novo Nordisk announced that the FDA has approved its semaglutide once-daily pre-filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients. It will be marketed by the trade name of Ozempic.The company expects to launch Ozempic in the United States in the beginning of 2018. Meanwhile, in September, the FDA had approved Fiasp (fast-acting insulin aspart) for treating adults with diabetes.In August, the FDA had approved label expansion of the company’s diabetes drug, Victoza, now approved to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type II diabetes.The company’s label expansion efforts and the corresponding approvals bode well for its growth.Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report)Investors can count on Switzerland-based Roche Holding with a VGM Score of B. The company is a Zacks #2 Ranked player with its shares having gained 10.1% in the last 12 months. Roche dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. The company also has a dominant position in lung cancer market.The company is looking for a label expansion of drugs namely, Actemra, which was approved for the treatment of giant cell arteritis last May. This is the sixth FDA approval for Actemra since the medicine was launched in 2010.Moreover, the recent FDA approval of Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A is encouraging. Also, the potential acquisition of Ignyta — announced a couple of weeks earlier — is likely to strengthen Roche ’s pipeline as the integration will add a mid-stage cancer candidate entrectinib to its portfolio.Continuous label expansions of key drugs, regular approvals and a robust pipeline are expected to drive the stock in 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

236,AMGN,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares are expected to be northbound in 2018, carrying on the momentum achieved last year. The stock was up 54.4% in 2017, comparing favorably with a gain of 16.3% recorded by the industry.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last year’s share price surge was supported by a series of positive news. AbbVie met primary endpoints in several pivotal studies – the key phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia; three phase III studies evaluating oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and also a phase IIb study in atopic dermatitis; and four pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Humira, for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.Meanwhile, AbbVie gained regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for cancer drug Imbruvica in 2018.AbbVie also settled its patent disputes with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), which delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira in the United States to 2023 and in most countries in the EU to October 2018.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares. Moreover, the agreement gave AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.Factors Likely to Support the Rally in 2018With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock should continue in 2018. An important catalyst for the stock will be data from a pivotal phase III (TRINITY) study on Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the first half of the year. An important regulatory milestone will be the FDA decision on elagolixin the second quarter. Please note that the new drug application (NDA) for elagolix for endometriosis was granted priority review by the FDA in October last year.Importantly Humira has been generating strong sales. Despite new competition, AbbVie raised its long-term target for Humira sales in October based on strong demand trends for the drug. Imbruvica, AbbVie’s second most important drug, is also doing consistently well and has multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. All these factors bode well for the stock.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

237,AMGN,"2017 has been a banner year for the U.S. stock market and the trend is likely to continue next year. The tax reform will act as a major driving factor for stocks coupled with strong corporate earnings and accelerating economic growth in many parts of the world.As Christmas tree symbolizes good tidings, let’s build a similar tree for stock-loving investors that could rake in big gains in 2018.Starting with the base – the most valuable portion of the tree – the technology sector seems  to be a perfect fit here as it is placed in the top 6% among the 16 broad Zacks sectors. Within the Industry classification, Semiconductor – General is expected to outperform. Being a cyclical sector, it tends to move higher with market rallies. New areas such as autonomous cars, cloud computing, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence continued to fuel exceptional growth.Intel INTC having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) seems an excellent pick. The stock saw solid earnings estimate revision of 19 cents for the next year over the past 90 days and falls in the Industry having a Zacks Rank in the top 1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The stocks that can form the leaves of the tree are Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) from the basic materials sector and Acco Brand Corporation ACCO from industrial products sector. Both the sectors are expected to benefit from Trump’s pro-growth policies, especially big spending in infrastructure and thus carry a sector Rank in the top 13%.Westlake Chemical has a Zacks Rank #1 and is part of an industry with a Rank in the top 10%. It has seen solid earnings estimate revision of $1.32 for the next year over the past 90 days with an expected growth rate of 21.67%. On the other hand, Acco Brand saw positive earnings estimate of 4 cents for the next year over the past 90 days, with an expected earnings estimate of 6.98%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Industry Rank in the top 1%.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)For the top layer, we have selected the energy sector, which is expected to be the largest contributor to 2018 S&P 500 earnings with 33.3% growth. HollyFrontier Corporation HFC seems an intriguing pick in this sector having a Rank in the top 25%. The stock saw solid earnings estimate revision of 79 cents for the next year over the past 90 days with an expected earnings growth rate of 20.87%. It has a Zacks Rank #1 with an Industry Rank in the top 20%.At the very top is the star stock of 2017 with a Zacks Rank #1. XOMA Corporation XOMA has soared nearly 692% this year so far with room for more upside next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved up from a loss of $1.31 to a loss of 42 cents. Rising earnings estimates indicate analysts’ optimistic view on earnings, indicating higher chances of outperformance. Additionally, the stock boasts a solid Industry Rank in the top 45%.Now that we are done with the tree’s structure, it’s time to decorate it with bells, candies, lights and chocolates. For these, we can concentrate on areas expected to benefit most from the tax reform.Bells and candies could be the companies that are poised to benefit from tax policies to bring offshore cash home at reduced tax. The top five U.S. hoarders are from the tech sector - Apple AAPL, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) - that hold 88% of their money overseas, according to Moody’s. Drug makers like Amgen Inc. AMGN, Gilead Sciences GILD, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) also stash huge cash offshore and are likely to gain from tax repatriation policy. All these stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Banking stocks could be the fairy lights on the tree that will light up on the dual tailwinds of rising rates and tax cuts. According to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, tax cuts will add 16% to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18% in 2019 while AB Bernstein sees earnings per share jumping 12-20% at large banks and 15-25% at mid-caps banks in 2018. While there are several choices, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and Industry Rank in the top 34%. The company is expected to generate double-digit earnings growth next year.Small cap stocks that pay the highest effective tax rate could be the sweet treats, as these will be the biggest beneficiaries of the corporate tax cut. According to Thompson Reuters data, companies in the Russell 2000 pay a median effective tax rate of 31.9%, while larger multinationals in the S&P 500 pay 28% and 30 mega-cap stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average pay 23.8%. Additionally, these tend to outperform in a rising rate environment. Given this, a spread of top-ranked stocks with 2018 double-digit earnings growth potential include Upland Software, Inc. (UPLD  -  Free Report), Farmers & Merchants Bancorp Inc. (FMAO  -  Free Report), Geopark Ltd GPRK and PetMed Express Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). All these stocks doubled this year.And voila, the tree is up! May it bring in bountiful returns for investors with the jingle of Santa’s bells.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

238,AMGN,"Shares of Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) have skyrocketed almost 368% this year so far, substantially outperforming the industry’s increase of 8.2%. Let’s analyze the factors that led to this massive rally.Nektar’s rapid progress on a robust pipeline this year including several study initiations with positive readouts and strategic collaborations has driven its share price consistently.The company’s PEGylation technology has facilitated development of its several approved products in the United States and the EU through partnerships with healthcare companies namely, AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) Movantik, UCB's Cimzia and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta among others.Notably, a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) began on the company’s lead candidate, Onzeald, late last year. The trial compares Onzeald with the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice in patients with advanced breast cancer having brain metastases shortly. Positive results from the program could support a regulatory filing in the United States.Apart from Onzeald, Nektar is working on developing other candidates. In September, the company announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).A phase I/II trial, evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, is also underway. The candidate is being examined across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications.In November, the company announced positive data from the study for treating patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancers.Significantly in May, the company entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Another candidate, NKTR-181, is being examined in a phase III program for treatment of chronic pain. In July, the company reported positive top-line findings from an oral human abuse potential study, analysing NKTR-181, to assess the opioid abuse potential compared with oxycodone. The company is planning to submit a new drug application for the candidate by April 2018.Meanwhile, in March, the company initiated a phase I clinical study, evaluating NKTR-358, to treat a wide range of auto-immune diseases and inflammatory disorders.Subsequently, in July, Nektar sealed a co-development deal with Elly Lilly and Company for NKTR-358. Pursuant to this agreement, the company will own responsibility for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. Both the companies will share phase II development costs with Lilly acquiring the lion share (75%) of the total expenses.Successful development and commercialization of undertrial candidates will boost the company’s top line, considering the lucrative markets they are targeting.Nektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

239,AMGN,"Jubilant Republicans delivered a tax bill to President Trump before Christmas, as promised. The Republican tax plan got the final approval by the House that gave Corporate America a massive permanent tax break. This in turn will encourage corporations to invest more in the United States, resulting in a rise in wages, jobs and a stronger economy.While miners, energy, retailers, tech, banks and pharma are expected to enjoy the biggest gains from the tax package, health insurers and hospitals are poised to lose. Needless to say, moneyed Americans like Trump will also make the most of the tax overhaul.House Gives Final Approval to Tax BillThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, sending a $1.5-trillion tax bill to the President for signature. The House was compelled to vote again, after it was discovered that the bill they had earlier passed violated some of the necessary rules for Senate Republicans to pass it with simple majority. The House, nevertheless, passed the tax reform bill by 224-201 majority, while the Republican-led Senate had earlier passed it by a vote of 51 to 48.Republicans successfully countered opposition from Democrats to pass the bill that will slash corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented next year, instead of being delayed until 2019.Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. Immediate offset of spending on short lived capital equipment is expected to further save U.S. companies around $32.5 billion in 2018, as per Congress’s joint committee on taxation.Winners & Losers From the Republican Tax BillAmong the largest beneficiaries of the tax bill include mining, accommodation and food services that can make use of the allowance for short lived equipment. Levies for repatriating overseas profits will boost major automakers like General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor, according to UBS. Meanwhile, the reduction in effective rate will be a shot in the arm for energy players as they pay the second-highest tax rate at 37%, per Bloomberg Intelligence.For retailers, the bill will be beneficial on multiple fronts. A tax relief among the wealthy and middle-class will increase discretionary income that may boost demand for consumer goods, while big consumer product makers such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and Pepsico have large cash holdings offshore that can be used for innovation and deal making, noted Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Shea.One-time low tax rate on foreign profits will also help multinationals including large tech majors to bring funds held overseas back to the United States. Bringing back massive overseas cash pile will help tech companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths like Apple Inc. AAPL, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Oracle hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.Banks also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to 20% (read more: Wall Street Hits Record Highs on Tax-Cut Optimism: 5 Gainers).American biopharma companies, in the meanwhile, make up one-third of the top 30 U.S. firms with the most cash abroad. A slashed tax rate for repatriated offshore cash, thus, will benefit big drug makers like Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) ($39 billion offshore), Gilead Sciences ($32 billion), Pfizer (about $22 billion) and Merck & Co. (about $20 billion), according to a recent Credit Suisse report.The report further added that lowering of corporate tax rates will b enefit certain drug makers that pay high effective tax rate and have lower foreign income. The main companies among them are Bioverative (36% effective tax rate), United Therapeutics (37%) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (33%).However, the bill is a mixed bag for health care. Repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate won’t help health insurers and hospitals. The provision required every American to have health insurance coverage or less pay a fine. Ending of such a provision will reduce the number of people who buy insurance coverage. And for hospitals, a lesser number of insured people mean fewer paying customers.But, for individual UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report), a drop in the effective tax rate will boost profits by as much as 15%, according Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners. The health insurer had payed about 32.5% income tax in the third quarter.Wind Up: Big Victory for TrumpThere is no doubt that passing of the bill is a great victory for Trump, both politically and personally. He had pledged to provide such business-friendly policies since his election years.  Such promises have also helped the broader equity markets gain traction and the major bourses hit a series of record highs this year. Further, these measures are likely to help the markets sustain the current bull run heading into 2018.In addition, a legislative win is beneficial for Trump and his family. Remember, the tax bill trims the ultra-rich individual tax bracket from 39.6% to 37%, while the “pass-through” provision will provide a major windfall to wealthy investors like Trump.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

240,AMGN,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) will provide a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues in its regulatory review of abaloparatide-SC.The CHMP informed the company that it will refer the marketing authorisation application (MAA) to a scientific advisory group for additional advice as part of its ongoing risk-benefit assessment.Hence, the CHMP expects to issue an opinion on the same during the first half of 2018.In July 2017, the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide-SC for their ongoing regulatory review.The delay in approval in Europe is disappointing given the potential market. Radius Health’s share price has decreased 21.8% in the year so far compared with the industry’s gain of 7.4%.We note that Tymlos (abaloparatide) was approved by the FDA in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly & Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen Inc's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Moreover, the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor).Meanwhile, Radius Health is also developing abaloparatide-TD for as a short wear-time transdermal patch. In December 2015, the company initiated a human replicative clinical evaluation to compare the optimized abaloparatide-TD patch with its subcutaneous formulation. The company posted positive results from the trial in September 2016.The company is currently focused on completing the manufacturing, scale up, and other required activities needed to initiate a pivotal study to evaluate bioequivalence to abaloparatide-SC. The transdermal patch program has the potential to allow physicians who treat osteoporosis, but rarely use injectable drugs, to expand their practices to include the use of anabolic therapy.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Corcept Therapeutics Inc.

Notably, all these changes are effective immediately.Shares of Spectrum Pharma have skyrocketed 185% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.2%. Markedly, Turgeon and Riga have a combined experience of nearly 50 years in the pharmaceutical industry. While Turgeon has 30 years pharma experience including 22 years as vice president of sales at Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Riga has carried out a number of executive roles at Amgen, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and privately held Dendreon for over 15 years.The lackluster product sales have kept investors focused on pipeline development.

242,AMGN,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced disappointing results from a pivotal phase III KEYNOTE-061 study, evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma.Notably, Keytruda is already approved in the United States as a monotherapy for third-line treatment of advanced gastric or GEJ. Additionally, it is approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.Shares of Merck has lost 4.9% this year so far compared unfavorably with the industry’s 16.5% increase.The phase III study failed to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). Notably, the progression free survival (PFS) showed no statistical significance in the PD-L1 positive patient population.However, the company said that it will continue to evaluate Keytruda in two other phase III studies, both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with GEJ.We remind investors that Keytruda is a key top-line driver for Merck and it brought in $1.5 billion sales in third-quarter 2017, up 18.8% sequentially and 194% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by a launch of new indications globally.Significantly, Keytruda sales in the United States have gained particularly from a strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. The drug’s sales were primarily driven by melanoma outside the United States.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced this year with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and two additional diseases in Europe.Important approvals include nods for advanced bladder cancer in both the United States and the EU, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and the first sanction for a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo), a commonly used chemo regimen in lung cancer.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. It is under trial for more than 30 types of cancer in above 650 studies including excess of 300 combination studies.Merck is collaborating separately with several companies namely Amgen, Inc.

243,AMGN,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for its janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, Xeljanz (tofacitinib), for two doses — 5 mg twice daily and 11 mg once-daily extended-release (XR) formulation.With this latest approval, Xeljanz can now be administered for treating adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), who had an inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, respectively.Notably, Xeljanz (5 mg twice daily) is approved in the United States as a second-line treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), who have had an inadequate response to or cannot tolerate methotrexate (MTX). The drug was approved in Europe and China in March for RA. Significantly, this is the first and only JAK inhibitor approved in the United States for both moderate to severe RA and an active PsA.Shares of Pfizer have gained 12.3% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 16.5%.A supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Xeljanz was filed with the FDA in May this year for the aforementioned indication. The approval was based on encouraging data from two phase III OPAL (Oral Psoriatic Arthritis TriaL) studies — Broaden and Beyond — on Xeljanz.Both OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Xeljanz on adult patients with PsA. The programs achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of a statistically significant improvement with twice-daily Xeljanz 5 mg compared with placebo at three months as per measurement by American College of Rheumatology 20 response and the change from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score.Overall safety results from these studies were found to be consistent with those observed in the broader rheumatology development program for Xeljanz.We remind investors that the company is also looking to get the drug’s label expanded to include treatment of adult patients suffering from moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis. A response from the FDA is expected in March next year.Additionally, Pfizer is conducting a phase IIIb/IV head-to-head study comparing Xeljanz with AbbVie's (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira. In February, the company announced top-line results from the assessment. Outcomes from the trial demonstrated non-inferiority of combo therapy comprising Xeljanz plus MTX compared with the other combo agents Humira plus MTX, thus meeting the primary endpoint.We are encouraged by Pfizer’s label expansion efforts. Xeljanz’s U.S. sales surged 44% year over year to $935 million in the first nine months of 2017. The drug’s label expansion should boost further the sales.Blockbuster drugs approved to treat PsA and RA include Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) Remicade and Amgen, Inc.'s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel that Pfizer markets outside the United States and Canada.In another Pfizer press release, the company announced that it has started a phase III study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of its once-daily janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, PF-04965842, for treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. This initiation surfaces as the first trial in the JAK1 Atopic Dermatitis Efficacy and safety global development program.Pfizer, Inc. Price Pfizer, Inc. Price | Pfizer, Inc.

We remind investors that the FDA granted accelerated approval to Venclexta in April 2016 for the treatment of CLL with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA approved test, who have received at least one prior therapy.The MURANO study is being conducted with the aim of converting the current accelerated approval of Venclexta to a full approval.Meanwhile, Venclexta has been granted four breakthrough therapy designations by the FDA in combination with Rituxan for people with relapsed or refractory CLL, as a monotherapy for relapsed or refractory CLL with 17p deletion in combination with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) for untreated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and in combination with low-dose cytarabine for patients with untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.Roche’s hematology portfolio has approved drugs including MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva/Gazyvaro, Tecentriq and Venclexta as well as an encouraging pipeline comprising candidates like polatuzumab vedotin/RG7596 and a small-molecule antagonist of MDM2 (idasanutlin/RG7388).The company also obtained FDA approval for Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh) for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.  So far this year, shares of the company have moved up 9.2% compared with the industry’s gain of 20%.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are already facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

245,AMGN,"Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced positive results from a phase III study, IMmotion 151 on immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq.The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq and Avastin versus Sutent in renal cell carcinoma patients.The study met its co-primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and demonstrated that the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin provided a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction of disease worsening or death (PFS) in patients with PD-L1 protein compared with Sutent for first-line treatment of patients suffering from advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.Top-line results from the co-primary endpoint of overall survival are not mature.IMmotion151 is the second successive positive phase III study of Tecentriq that includes an Avastin combination component as an initial treatment. The study followed the positive phase III non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) IMpower150 study that revealed that Tecentriq and Avastin plus chemotherapy had a PFS advantage over Avastin plus chemotherapy.We note that Tecentriq is already approved in the European Union, United States for previously treated metastatic NSCLC and metastatic urothelial cancer. So far this year, shares of the company have moved up 12.3% compared with the industry’s gain of 20.4%.In addition, Roche announced positive results from the randomised phase II GO29365 study that compared polatuzumab vedotin in combination with bendamustine plus MabThera/Rituxan (BR) against BR alone in patients suffering from relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant.The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that the addition of polatuzumab vedotin to BR increased complete response rates from 15-40% (p=0.012) at the end of treatment, as measured by positron emission tomography and assessed by an independent review committee.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are already facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis AG NVS has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe.

246,AMGN,"At the beginning of 2017, expectations were pretty high that the pharma and biotech sector would finally see lots of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). However, that did not happen. While a few high-value deals were announced, the focus was mostly on small bolt-on acquisitions and licensing deals and agreements.According to Mergermarket’s Global Pharma, Medical & Biotech trend report for Q317, M&A in the global pharma, medical and biotechnology sector was in the range of $207.6 billion spanning 1,040 deals so far this year, declining 9.9% from the year-ago period. The dip was mostly attributable to the pharma and medical sectors.Key deals announced this year include the Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report)-Kite and the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)-Actelion acquisitions, which boosted the value of M&A transactions in the biotech sector. Biotech stocks continue to command hefty premiums where M&A is concerned.The key question now facing the sector is - will M&A activity remain sluggish in 2018 or will there be a surge in M&A deals?  With tax reform in the works, M&A activity is expected to increase in the upcoming quarters. Tax reform and cash repatriation are expected to lead to a boost in this area with biotech remaining a highly sought-after sector. Companies with innovative technologies and pipelines remain in demand with disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), immuno-oncology, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases seeing quite a bit of activity. Treatments for orphan diseases and gene editing technology are also in demand.There are several large drugmakers that are on the lookout for deals – while some of these companies are looking to replace sales of blockbuster products that are facing loss of patent exclusivity, others are looking to build their pipelines both through acquisitions as well as licensing agreements.Expectations are high that big players like Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), Pfizer, Merck and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) will announce M&A deals in 2018. Companies like J&J and Gilead are also expected to be on the lookout for additional acquisition targets. A major deterrent, however, could be high valuations and bidding wars which could keep some of the key players on the sidelines.   In this backdrop, here is a look at three biotech stocks that could find themselves on the radar of companies on the lookout for acquisition targets in 2018.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report): Wilmington, DE-based Incyte is a company that is often considered an attractive acquisition target thanks to its flagship product, Jakafi, and a promising pipeline. Jakafi – a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor – looks well-positioned for growth. Jakafi revenues are expected in the range of $1,125-$1,135 million in 2017. Incyte is also working on expanding Jakafi’s label into additional indications including steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD” – data expected in the first half of 2018) and essential thrombocythemia (“ET”), a rare blood cancer that can lead to life-threatening complications.The company has several catalysts lined up for 2018 including the potential approval of baricitinib (resubmission of the new drug application for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis expected by January 2018) as well as the advancement of its immuno-oncology pipeline.The company’s immuno-oncology pipeline includes IDO1 inhibitors (epacadostat), PI3K-delta inhibitors (INCB50465), and JAK inhibitors (itacitinib, INCB52793) among others. Epacadostat, which is in late-stage development for melanoma with data due in the first half of 2018, has immense commercial potential. Epacadostat is being evaluated for several other types of cancer as well.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. : Biopharmaceutical company, Juno’s shares have been on an upward trend following the Gilead-Kite acquisition announcement earlier this year. With Juno being focused on the development of innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, the company is considered a potential acquisition target. Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma.Although the company suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), Juno is now focusing on JCAR017, a next-generation CAR-T cell product that targets CD19. JCAR017 is currently in a registrational study for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (""NHL""). The company expects to file for approval in the second half of 2018.  Juno’s shares are up 211.1% year to date, compared to the 2.7% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report): bluebird is another clinical-stage company working on developing gene therapies for serious genetic diseases and T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. The company’s pipeline includes Lenti-D, currently in a phase II/III study, for the treatment of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, and LentiGlobin, currently in five studies for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease. The company’s lead oncology programs, bb2121 and bb21217, are anti-BCMA CAR T programs which are being developed in collaboration with Celgene.While Incyte, Juno and bluebird are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

248,AMGN,"Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) member, Genentech announced that the FDA has converted accelerated approval for Avastin (received in May 2009) for previously treated glioblastoma, most aggressive form of brain cancer, to full approval.The full approval was based on data from the phase III EORTC 26101study in which Avastin-based treatment increased the time to disease progression or death compared to chemotherapy alone. The study, however, did not meet the primary endpoint as there was no significant increase in overall survival with Avastin-based treatment.However, it showed that patients were able to completely stop intake of corticosteroids while on treatment in the Avastin arm compared to the control arm. The evidence from the study, which showed that Avastin treatment delayed disease progression and reduced the need for corticosteroids, led to the conversion of the provisional approval to a full one.Apart from the recent approval, the drug is already approved in the United States  for various indications that include- first- or second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, advanced nonsquamous non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic kidney cancer and advanced cervical cancer and recurrent ovarian cancer.So far this year, shares of the company have increased 8.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 15%.However, the drug has been facing competition and has been witnessing declining sales. In September 2017, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA approved their biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.

249,AMGN,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and partner Janssen, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) pharmaceuticals subsidiary, announced that a combination study evaluating their key cancer drug Imbruvica in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, met the primary endpoint.Interim data from the phase III iNNOVATE study showed that a combination of Imbruvica and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan led to improved progression-free survival (PFS) in treatment-naive and previously-treated patients with WM compared to Rituxan alone. Based on the early positive results, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended an unblinded study. AbbVie and J&J plan to discuss the positive interim data with regulatory authoritiesImbruvica is already approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of WM. In fact, including WM, Imbruvica is presently approved for six distinct patient populations including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).Imbruvica was added to AbbVie’s pipeline with the May 2015 acquisition of Pharmacyclics. It has become a key revenue driver for AbbVie. In 2017, AbbVie expects to record Imbruvica global revenues of more than $2.4 billion with sales in the United States expected to cross $2 billion. In the first nine months of 2017, Imbruvica had recorded sales of $1.87 billion, representing growth of 41.2% year over year.  In fact, AbbVie expects Imbruvica peak sales of more than $7 billion and revenues of about $5 billion in 2020At present, the CLL segment is the largest revenue contributor to Imbruvica's growth while expansion into non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and other indications will be major growth drivers in the future.Imbruvica has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand its label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Imbruvica is in phase III studies for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a “pipeline in a molecule” with the treatment featuring in several company-sponsored studies.AbbVie’s shares have gained 52.3% so far this year, comparing favorably with a gain of only 15% recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine, Mavyret; received FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvicaand settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen, Inc.

250,AMGN,"This week, companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (RVNC  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) were in the news. While Amgen got FDA approval for the inclusion of cardiovascular outcomes data for its PCSK9 inhibitor, AbbVie and Revance provided data on their pipeline candidates.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRevance Soars on RT002 Data: Revance’s shares shot up 33.7% on positive top-line data from late-stage studies evaluating the company’s next-generation neuromodulator RT002. RT002 met the primary as well as all secondary endpoints in the studies that were conducted for the reduction of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines (the frown lines or wrinkles between the brows).A long-term safety study is currently ongoing with the study scheduled to complete in the second half of 2018. The successful completion of this study would allow Revance to file for FDA approval in the first half of 2019 and potentially launch the product in 2020. The company believes that FDA approval would make RT002 the first neuromodulator with a long-acting duration of six months as currently marketed neuromodulators have shown duration of three to four months in treating glabellar lines. RT002’s approval could well change the neuromodulator treatment landscape as it would be needed only twice a year.According to information provided by the company, the treatment of glabellar lines is the most popular aesthetic procedure for an injectable neuromodulator with almost a third of the $3.6 billion in global neuromodulator sales in 2016 coming from this area. Currently approved treatments include Botox and Dysport.Amgen’s PCSK9 Inhibitor Label Approved for Cardiovascular Outcomes Data: Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, got a bit of a boost with the FDA granting approval to the company’s request to add cardiovascular outcomes data to the drug’s label. This makes Repatha the first PCSK9 inhibitor to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease. Repatha was also approved for use as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies like statins, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).The updated label will provide physicians with a new treatment option to prevent cardiovascular events by dramatically lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha, especially in the case of patients who are already on maximally-tolerated statin therapy and need to lower their LDL cholesterol level further.The cardiovascular outcomes data should help drive Repatha sales which are yet to take off as expected with factors like strict utilization management criteria and processes employed by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) impacting sales. However, Amgen has been working with payers to improve access for appropriate patients and Repatha remains a growth brand for the company (Read more: Amgen's PCSK9 Inhibitor Gets FDA Nod for Stroke Prevention). Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Positive Data on AbbVie’s Risankizumab and Imbruvica: AbbVie’s risankizumab met the primary endpoint in the fourth pivotal phase III study conducted for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. After 16 weeks of treatment, almost half (47%) of risankizumab patients achieved complete skin clearance (PASI 100) compared to 1% of patients on placebo. Risankizumab is being developed in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim (Read more: AbbVie Psoriasis Candidate Succeeds in 4th Phase III Study).AbbVie also presented data on a combination of its BTK inhibitor, Imbruvica, and Rituxan for the treatment of both newly and previously-treated patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (“WM”). The primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) was achieved in the late-stage study. Imbruvica is approved for different indications including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, previously treated mantle cell lymphoma and WM as well as chronic graft-versus-host-disease. AbbVie expects Imbruvica revenues of $5 billion in 2020.Priority Review for Clovis sNDA: Clovis Oncology’s (CLVS  -  Free Report) supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of its PARP inhibitor, Rubraca (rucaparib), has been granted priority review status by the FDA. The company is looking to get Rubraca approved for use as maintenance treatment for women with recurrent ovarian cancer who are platinum sensitive, and in complete or partial response to platinum chemotherapy, with no requirement for diagnostic testing. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out on Apr 6, 2018.Clovis’s shares are up 29.9% year to date, compared to the 1.3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Galectin Down on NASH Data: Galectin Therapeutics Inc.’s shares fell 30.7% on data from a phase IIb study on GR-MD-02. Although the candidate showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a sub-group of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) cirrhosis patients, it failed to achieve statistical significance in the total group of patients.  Positive 48-Week Data on Ultragenyx Drug: Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (RARE  -  Free Report) and partner Kyowa Kirin announced positive 48-week data from a late-stage study of burosumab (KRN23) in adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia (“XLH”). The companies said that further improvement in disease symptoms and fracture healing were observed through 48 weeks of treatment with burosumab. Burosumab is currently under priority review for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with XLH with a response from the FDA expected on Apr 17, 2018.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined slightly (0.5%) over the last five trading sessions.

251,AMGN,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that a fourth pivotal phase III study evaluating its investigational IL-23 inhibitor, risankizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints.Top line data from the IMMhance study showed that a significant portion of patients treated with risankizumab achieved high levels of skin clearance. Nearly half (47%) of the patients treated with risankizumab achieved complete skin clearance versus placebo (1%) after 16 weeks of treatment.On continuous treatment with risankizumab, at week 28, 87% of the risankizumab patients maintained this response for one year. This data shows that patients can achieve better disease improvement over time on continuous treatment with risankizumab rather than withdrawing from the therapy after an initial response. Results from this study will support regulatory filings for the candidate.The 16-week results from this study were presented at the 8th International Congress of Psoriasis from Gene to Clinic meeting in London.AbbVie had in-licensed risankizumab from Boehringer Ingelheim in 2016. AbbVie is responsible for the future development and commercialization of the candidate.We remind investors that in October, AbbVie had announced that three pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and AbbVie’s Humira, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints. Top-line data presented from the studies showed that risankizumab achieved significantly greater response of clear or almost clear skin versus Stelara and Humira or placebo after 16 weeks of treatment.Risankizumab is also being evaluated in phase II studies for other immunological disorders like Crohn’s disease and psoriatic arthritis.AbbVie’s shares have gained 52% so far this year, comparing favorably with a gain of only 16.5 % recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months.

For individual components, risks of heart attack, stroke and coronary revascularization were nominally reduced by 27%, 21% and 22%, respectively, with Repatha.However, Repatha did not show any improvement in cardiovascular death risk, which had raised investor concerns then.Notably, Repatha gained an FDA approval in August 2015, for the treatment of patients, incapable of managing their LDL cholesterol at acceptable levels. It is approved in over 50 countries, including the United States, Japan, Canada and overall, 28 member countries of the European Union for the given indication.However, uptake of the drug has not been very encouraging so far due to higher pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent.The FOURIER data holds the key to the commercial success of Repatha as it will broaden the use of the drug. With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label, patient access to the drug should improve.Amgen filed regulatory applications in both the United States and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in June 2017. In July, the FDA had granted priority review forthe regulatory application.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

254,AMGN,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares have gained 32.1% so far in the second half of the year, comparing favorably with a gain of only 3.8 % recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained key regulatory approvals and settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen.Resolution of Amgen LawsuitAbbVie announced the resolution of a patent dispute with Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) in September, which has delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira in the United States to 2023 and in most countries in the EU to October 2018.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares though the company is still facing a patent challenge from Boehringer Ingelheim, which gained approval for its biosimilar version of Humira, Cyltezo, in August. Moreover, the agreement gives AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.Key Regulatory ApprovalsAbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the third quarter of 2017. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history.In August, AbbVie gained approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvica. The drug was approved for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), a serious and potentially life-threatening condition with high unmet medical need. cGVHD is the first indication of Imbruvica outside of cancer. Also, Imbruvica is the first treatment specifically approved for cGVHD.Positive Data from StudiesAbbVie announced positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL last month. The data showed that Venclexta plus Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”).  Label expansion for this indication should expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential.AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494) met primary endpoints in a phase III study for the treatment of RA with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results for both the doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib compared to placebo. Upadacitinib also met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for the treatment of adult patients with atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year. Data from both the upadacitinib studies were announced in September.In October, AbbVie announced that three pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Humira, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints.ConclusionWith several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run in the stock should continue next year. Importantly Humira has been generating strong sales. Despite new competition, AbbVie raised its long-term target for Humira sales in October based on strong demand trends for the drug. Imbruvica, AbbVie’s second most important drug, is also doing consistently well and has multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. All these factors bode well for the stock.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

255,AMGN,"2017 has been a pretty good year for pharma and biotech stocks where FDA decisions are concerned. The regulatory body has approved 40 novel drugs so far in 2017, easily surpassing last year’s total tally of 22.There were quite a few landmark approvals this year including the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah for the treatment of certain pediatric and young adult patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) and Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a cell-based gene therapy for the treatment of adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.Other key approvals this year include Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of December.Cardiovascular Outcomes Data to be Part of Amgen’s PCSK9 Inhibitor Label? Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) is looking to add cardiovascular outcomes data to the label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. With the FDA granting priority review to the company’s regulatory application, a response should be out on December 2.With cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death around the world, the addition of this data to Repatha’s label could boost the product’s sales. Sales of PCSK9 inhibitors, which were once considered to be worth multi-billion dollars, are yet to ramp up significantly. Repatha sales in the first nine months of 2017 were $221 million.Amgen continues to work with payers to improve patient access to Repatha. If the FDA allows the addition of the cardiovascular outcomes data to the label, the company will be in a position to promote Repatha's ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.Amgen’s shares are up 17.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 1.4% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to. While Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will the FDA Approve Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar? Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner Biocon should also get a response from the FDA for their biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab) this month. The FDA, which had previously extended the target action date for the biosimilar in order to review some clarificatory information provided by the companies, is expected to give a response on December 3.   We remind investors that earlier this year in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) had voted in favor of approving the biosimilar. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels.Mylan’s shares are down 3.4% year to date, compared to the 30.2% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Will the FDA Follow its Advisory Panel’s Recommendation for NVO’s Diabetes Drug? Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report), a key player in the diabetes market, will get to know the approval status of its latest diabetes product offering, semaglutide, this month. Once-weekly semaglutide is under FDA review for the improvement of glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes. With an FDA advisory panel voting in favor (16-0) of approval, chances of gaining approval look high.Novo Nordisk’s shares are up 43.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 16.2% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Christmas Cheer for Aclaris? Aclaris Therapeutics (ACRS  -  Free Report), which is focused on addressing significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology, is seeking FDA approval for its lead pipeline candidate, A-101 40%, a topical treatment for seborrheic keratosis (“SK”). According to information provided by the company, 83.8 million people in the United States are affected by SK, a common non-malignant skin tumor, with current treatments (cryosurgery, curettage, electrodessication and excision) being painful or invasive. Timely approval would make A-101 40% the first FDA-approved medication for the treatment of SK. The FDA action date is December 24.Aclaris’s shares are down 14.4% year to date, compared to the 3.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Valeant Eye Drop for Ocular Redness under Review: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.'s (VRX  -  Free Report) New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Luminesse (brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.025%) is under FDA review with a PDUFA action date of December 27. The topical vasoconstrictor formulation has been developed to relieve redness of the eye due to minor eye irritations. If approved, the eye drop will be the first over-the-counter (“OTC”) product to be developed with brimonidine tartrate for the treatment of ocular redness.  Valeant’s shares are up 13.3% year to date, compared to the 3.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

256,AMGN,"It was a relatively slow week given the Thanksgiving break. Key developments this week include Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) deal with Alkermes (ALKS  -  Free Report) and Regeneron’s (REGN  -  Free Report) disappointing data on Eylea.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBiogen Inks Deal with Alkermes for MS Drug: Biogen, a key player in the multiple sclerosis (“MS”) market, has signed up with Alkermes for the worldwide development and commercialization of ALKS 8700. ALKS 8700, a novel, oral, monomethyl fumarate (“MMF”) small drug molecule, is currently in late-stage development for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS.Under the terms of the deal, Alkermes will receive 50% of the costs it incurred in 2017 related to the development of ALKS8700 (an upfront payment of $28 million) as well as royalties in the mid-teens rate on worldwide net sales. Alkermes could also receive up to $200 million on the achievement of certain milestones with the first payment of $50 million to be recorded in 2017.With this collaboration, Biogen is basically looking to protect the sales of its blockbuster oral MS drug, Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate). A new drug application (“NDA”) for ALKS8700 will be filed in 2018 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway referencing Tecfidera. ALKS8700, which has been associated with a differentiated gastrointestinal (“GI”) tolerability profile, is also in a head-to-head study with Tecfidera evaluating the GI profile (Read more: Biogen Acquires Worldwide License for Alkermes' MS Candidate). Alkermes’s shares were up 1.6% on the agreement while Biogen was up 1.7%.Biogen’s shares are up 11.8% year to date, compared to the 1.1% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Eylea Combination Falls Short in Mid-Stage Studies: Regeneron provided a disappointing update related to its plans for expanding the label of its flagship eye drug, Eylea. The company said that a combination of Eylea and nesvacumab, an Ang2 antibody, evaluated in a couple of mid-stage studies, did not show sufficient differentiation compared to Eylea alone to justify advancement into late-stage development.While one study was in patients with diabetic macular edema (“DME”), the other was in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). This is not the first time that Regeneron has faced a setback in its efforts to co-formulate the blockbuster drug. Last year, the company had announced that a mid-stage study evaluating Eylea in combination with rinucumab, an anti-PDGFR-beta antibody, failed to show improvement over Eylea alone in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).Next up is data from a late-stage study evaluating Eylea in diabetic retinopathy, a growing patient population with significant need – these results should be out in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Regeneron's Stock Falls as Mid-Stage Eye Disease Studies Fail).Catalyst Drug Positive in Second Phase III Study: Catalyst Pharmaceuticals’s (CPRX  -  Free Report) shares were up 10.3% on positive top-line results from a second late-stage study on Firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (“LEMS”), a rare autoimmune disorder. The company said that it remains on track to file for FDA approval in the first quarter of 2018. Firdapse has breakthrough designation in the United States (Read more: Catalyst Reports Positive Phase III Data on Firdapse).Catalyst is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Bristol-Myers has the option to select up to ten oncology targets and two non-oncology targets. Including CTLA-4, Bristol-Myers has selected five oncology targets until now.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was up 0.2% over the last four trading sessions. Among major biotech stocks, Biogen was up 2.6% while Regeneron declined 4.8% reflecting investor disappointment about the Eylea pipeline setback. Over the last six months, Biogen was up 26.5% while Regeneron lost 19.6% (See the last biotech stock roundup here: RARE drug Gets FDA Nod, Acorda, Cytokinetics Hit by Pipeline Setbacks).What's Next in the Biotech World?Watch out for the usual pipeline and regulatory updates. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) should get a response from the FDA on December 2 regarding its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the inclusion of risk reduction of major cardiovascular events based on data from the large Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study. Repatha is Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

257,AMGN,"Shares of Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) have been up almost 306% this year so far, substantially outperforming the industry’s increase of 3.9% during the period. Let’s analyze the factors that led to this massive rally.Nektar’s rapid progress on a robust pipeline this year including several study initiations and strategic collaborations, has pushed up its share price consistently.The company’s PEGylation technology has facilitated development of its several approved products in the United States and the EU through partnerships with healthcare companies namely, AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) Movantik, UCB's Cimzia and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta, among others.Notably, a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) began on the company’s lead candidate, Onzeald, late last year. The trial compares Onzeald with a single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice in the patients with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases shortly. Positive results from the program could support a regulatory filing in the United States.Apart from Onzeald, Nektar is working on developing other candidates. In September, the company announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).A phase I/II study, evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, is also underway. The candidate is being examined across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications.Notably in May, the company entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Another candidate, NKTR-181, is being examined in a phase III study for treatment of chronic pain. In July, the company reported positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential (HAP) study, evaluating NKTR-181, to assess the opioid abuse potential compared with oxycodone. The company is planning to submit a new drug application (NDA) for the candidate by April 2018.Meanwhile, in March, the company initiated a phase I clinical study, evaluating NKTR-358, to treat a wide range of auto-immune diseases and inflammatory disorders.Subsequently, in July, Nektar entered into a co-development deal with Elly Lilly and Company for NKTR-358. Pursuant to the agreement, the company will be responsible for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. Both companies will share phase II development costs with Lilly capturing the lion share (75%) of the total costs.Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will boost the company’s top line, considering the lucrative markets they are targeting.Nektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

258,AMGN,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is currently going through a transitional stage. The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, EU and Japan.  The loss of patent protection for these top-selling drugs continues to hurt sales. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the United States and the EU. Oncology drugs are facing new competition from immuno-oncology therapies. Moreover, certain patents and extensions covering Afinitor and Gilenya will expire in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The negative impact of generic competition will impact sales by $2.5 billion in 2017.CEO Joseph Jimenez will step down from his position in 2018. Vasant Narasimhan, M.D., Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, will replace him effective Feb 1, 2018.Nevertheless, we believe that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs will boost the company’s top line.Psoriasis drug, Cosentyx, was approved for the treatment of two new indications — ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in 2016. The uptake of Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016 recording over $1 billion of sales. Novartis expects to garner $2 billion and $500 million of sales from Cosentyx and Entresto, respectively in 2017. Other approvals include Farydak, Odomzo and the combination of Tafinlar + Mekinist.Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and an improved formulation of Exjade. The oncology portfolio received a further boosted with the approval of new drugs. The recent FDA approval of Kisqali, for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer will boost the sales. The drug was also approved in Europe. Meanwhile, the FDA also approved a label expansion of Zykadia to include the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The European Commission (EC) has recently approved Tasigna for the treatment of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) and pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib.The FDA recently approved breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse. Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy approved. The approval provided a major boost to Novartis.  The approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immune-cellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL which comprises approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children under 15 years. It is the most common form of childhood cancer in the United States. Kymriah has been launched in the United States.Moreover, Sandoz holds a leading position in the biosimilars space with a portfolio of five marketed biosimilars currently and a deep pipeline. The biosimilar version of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab). Rixathon was approved by the European Commission in June 2017. It is currently under review in the United States. The biosimilar version of Humira is also under review in the EU.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 19.5% year to date compared with the industry’s 18.1% gain. In the first half of 2017, Novartis announced that it is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering. The company believes that the Alcon division has revived and hence a decision on a possible spin-off will be taken in 2019.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

259,AMGN,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced the submission of regulatory applications to the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (""EMA"") seeking label expansion of its multiple myeloma (“MM”) drug Darzalex in the first-line setting.A potential approval will allow Darzalex to be used in combination with J&J’s proteasome inhibitor MM drug Velcade (bortezomib), melphalan and prednisone to treat MM in treatment-naïve patients who cannot have autologous stem cell transplantation in bone marrow. If approved, this will be the fifth indication for the drug.We are encouraged by J&J’s efforts to expand Darzalex’s label further, a drug which generated one-sixth of the company’s total oncology sales in the first nine months of 2017. We note that Darzalex was first approved in November 2015 as monotherapy for MM in patients treated with at least three prior lines of therapy, followed by approvals in the past two years as combination therapy in second and third-line settings.J&J’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The company’s shares have gained 20.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.8%.J&J has submitted top-line data from the phase III ALCYONE study to support its regulatory applications in both the geographies. Data from the study showed that the Darzalex combination therapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50% when compared to treatment with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (standard of care) alone.J&J will present the data at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology scheduled to be held between Dec 9 and Dec 12.We note that J&J licensed Darzalex from Genmab through its subsidiary, Janssen, in 2012. J&J holds the worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the drug and has to pay milestone payments to Genmab.Per the National Cancer Institute, 30,280 new patients are likely to be diagnosed with MM and it will cause 12,590 deaths in the United States in 2017 alone.Darzalex competes with other approved and marketed treatments for MM, which include Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid, Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Kyprolis and Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Emplicti.Johnson & Johnson Price  Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson QuoteJ&J carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch device was approved by the FDA in September.Amgen’s shares have rallied 16.2% this year so far, better than the industry’s growth of 1.5%.Sales of Amgen’s largest product Enbrel have been soft for quite some time now. Pricing pressure and stiff competition are hurting sales of Enbrel, one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues. Enbrel has recorded sales of $4.01 billion in 2017 so far, a decline of 7% year over year.The RA market is extremity crowded, given the presence of treatments like AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz among others.It remains to be seen if this new device for Enbrel can lead to some improvement in sales. However, on the Q3 conference call, Amgen had said that the declining trends in price and market share will continue in 2018.In Europe, while biosimilar versions of Enbrel are available, in the United States, Sandoz, the generic arm of Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), has received FDA approval for its biosimilar version of Enbrel, Erelzi.

261,AMGN,"The biotech industry turned around this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.It had a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.However, after rising 15.4% in the first nine months of the year (January-September), the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has declined 13.4% so far in the fourth quarter (Oct 1 - to date). Both macro and industry specific factors resulted in the sudden downfall.Uncertain Macro PictureA big component of this sell-off is the confusion over the passing of the tax reform. The reform aims to bring down corporate tax to stimulate economic as well as employment growth.The proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last. It goes without saying that significant uncertainty regarding the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform has cast a shadow over the future of the biotech sector.In October, President Trump once again criticized high drug prices. This came at a time when investors had started to expect that Trump's action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared, sending health-care stocks lower.Tepid Q3 ResultsComing to some industry specific factors, most big biotechs beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q3. However, shares of most of these companies declined post earnings release for various reasons.Although Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the third quarter, it witnessed continued decline in sales of its HCV drugs — Harvoni and Sovaldi — as a result of competitive and pricing pressure.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and sales in Q3 and raised its earnings guidance for 2017. However sales declined year over year, which resulted in share price decline post the earnings call. Sales of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, were also disappointing.Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares plunged following the release of third-quarter results. Although Celgene’s earnings topped estimates, revenues fell short. Moreover, the company lowered its 2017 outlook for Otezla sales as well as its total revenue and earnings outlook for 2020.Although Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third-quarter results were better than expected, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza.Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates but missed on revenues in the third quarter.Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) were the only two outperformers in Q3.ConclusionWe believe that the biotech space should be back on track if there is more certainty regarding the timing of the tax reforms. This is because the fundamentals of the sector remain strong. Meanwhile, with the Q3 earnings season now behind us, stocks should start picking up. Positive data from key clinical studies can drive the sector up as share price of biotechs is correlated to success in key studies. The major biotech players need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buying assets from outside. Strategic deals signed by these biotechs can also push the stocks higher.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

262,AMGN,"AstraZeneca, plc (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval to its asthma disease candidate, benralizumab. Benralizumab, approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in patients aged 12 years and older, will be marketed by the trade name of Fasenra.Shares of this London, United Kingdom based pharma giant were up more than 1% on Tuesday. So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have gained 21.7%, comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 14.4%.Fasenra will be given as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection via a prefilled syringe, once in every eight weeks, making it the first respiratory biologic medicine to be approved with the convenient 8-week maintenance dosing schedule. GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK  -  Free Report) Nucala (subcutaneous administration) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' (TEVA  -  Free Report) Cinqair (intravenous infusion) are presently marketed for the same indication but administered once every four weeksThe FDA approval of Fasenra was based on positive data from pivotal studies, SIROCCO and CALIMA, which showed significant reductions in exacerbations and improvements in lung function on treatment with benralizumab. Meanwhile, another phase III study, ZONDA, showed that adding benralizumab to standard of care led to statistically-significant and clinically relevant reduction in daily maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS) use with two benralizumab dosing regimens compared with placebo.Severe asthma patients whose disease is driven by inflammation of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, have until now had only limited treatment options, mostly oral steroids. Fasenra, which distinctively targets and rapidly depletes eosinophils, has shown the potential to reduce oral steroid use in such patients.Fasenra is under regulatory review in the EU, Japan and many other countries. Earlier this week, AstraZeneca said that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended marketing approval of benralizumab.Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of breathlessness and has a significant unmet medical need. This is because it affects 315 million individuals worldwide and up to 10% of patients who have severe asthma, which can become uncontrolled despite receiving high doses of standard of care medicines and require the use of chronic OCS.Benralizumab is also being evaluated for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in late-stage studies. Other severe asthma candidates in AstraZeneca’s portfolio are tralokinumab and tezepelumab — in partnership with Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) .AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Among major news this week, Dynavax Technologies (DVAX  -  Free Report) finally gained FDA approval for its hepatitis B vaccine while Loxo Oncology (LOXO  -  Free Report) was in the news for its collaboration agreement with Bayer.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLoxo down despite Bayer Deal worth Up To $1.55 Billion: Loxo, which is focused on the development of highly selective medicines for patients with genetically defined cancers, saw its shares lose ground despite the announcement of a collaboration agreement with Bayer that could be worth up to $1.55 billion. The companies are collaborating for the global development and commercialization of Loxo’s highly selective TRK inhibitors, larotrectinib and LOXO-195, for patients with TRK fusion cancers.The agreement terms include a $400 million upfront payment. Loxo could receive another $450 million on the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones and an additional $200 million for milestones related to LOXO-195. Development costs will be split equally by the companies. The companies will co-promote in the United States while Loxo will receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales, and sales milestones totaling $475 million for ex-U.S. territories. Larotrectinib is scheduled to be filed for FDA approval in late 2017/early 2018.Loxo’s shares were down 4.1% on the news with the investment community expressing disappointment about the sharing of profits in the United States as well as the absence of an outright acquisition deal.FDA Nod for Dynavax Hepatitis B Vaccine: It turned out to be third time lucky for Dynavax with the company finally gaining FDA approval for its hepatitis B vaccine, Heplisav-B. The regulatory action makes Heplisav-B the first new hepatitis B vaccine in the United States in more than 25 years and the only two-dose hepatitis B vaccine for adults.Hepatitis B, a highly infectious and potentially deadly virus, affects a wide range of adults in the United States with infections on the rise given the absence of any cures. However, hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination.Heplisav-B is the first FDA-approved product for Dynavax and the company expects to launch the vaccine in the first quarter of 2018.Achillion Slips on Secondary Offering News: Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Approval for this age group would expand the targeted patient population by about 3,400 patients. A decision should be out within three months. Orkambi, which is already approved for this age group in the United States, is expected to bring in revenues of $1.29 billion - $1.32 billion in 2017. Meanwhile, the company expects to seek regulatory approval for the use of Orkambi in children with CF in the two to five years age group who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the first quarter of 2018 (Read more: Vertex Gets CHMP Recommendation for Orkambi Label Expansion).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 2.5% over the last four trading sessions.

264,AMGN,"Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz, reported data from four clinical studies. The studies compared proposed biosimilar adalimumab and biosimilar rituximab to reference drugs, AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) MabThera respectively.The studies included two innovative trials involving switching and two pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies.A phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety study met its primary endpoint in the proportion of patients who achieved a 75% improvement at week 16.  The study confirmed that there were no meaningful clinical differences in efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients who continuously received adalimumab, those who continuously received the reference drug and those who switched between biosimilar adalimumab and reference drug on multiple occasion.In addition, a phase III study evaluated rituximab retreatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who had already received reference rituximab for treatment of RA in the past. The study evaluated the biosimilar and the reference drug in terms of safety and immunogenicity in patients who switched from the reference drug to biosimilar rituximab and in those who continued treatment with the reference drug.In addition, the PK and PD data demonstrated equivalence as the phase I PK study met its primary endpoint as bioequivalence was demonstrated between the biosimilar adalimumab and the reference drug. We note Sandoz holds a leading position in the biosimilars space with a portfolio of five marketed biosimilars currently and a deep pipeline.The biosimilar version of rituximab, Rixathon, was approved by the European Commission in June 2017. It is currently under review in the United States. The biosimilar version of Humira is also under review in the EU.Meanwhile, Sandoz witnessed strong growth outside the United States buoyed by biosimilar launches of Rixathon and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in Europe. However, pricing pressure intensified in the United States.  The company expects low single-digit sales decline at Sandoz in the fourth quarter, mainly due to seasonal shipment phasing and continued pricing pressures in the United States.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 17% year to date compared with the industry’s 17.6% gain. In the first half of 2017, Novartis announced that it is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering. The company believes that the Alcon division has revived and hence a decision on a possible spin-off will be taken in 2019. The recent approvals of Kymriah and Kisqali will further boost the oncology portfolio and drive growth.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Amgen is looking to get Nplate approved for use in pediatric patients (one year of age and older) who are refractory to other treatments like corticosteroids and immunoglobulin.The positive opinion was based on five studies demonstrating that Nplate reduces the rates of bleeding in children with this rare blood disorder.Amgen’s shares have rallied 17.8% this year so far, better than the industry’s growth of 2.3%.In a separate press release, Amgen and partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the CHMP has rendered a positive opinion for the marketing application of its biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Avastin, ABP 215. According to the companies, this may be the first bevacizumab biosimilar, which has been recommended for approval in the EUThe Avastin biosimlar was approved in the United States in September and will be marketed by the trade name of Mvasi.We remind investors that Amgen and Allergan have collaborated for the worldwide development and commercialization of four oncology antibody biosimilar medicines including Roche’s Avastin, Herceptin and Ritixan.In fact, Amgen has 10 biosimilars in its pipeline. Its biosimilar version of Abbvie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, Amjevita, was approved by the FDA last year and in the EU in March this year for the same indications.

266,AMGN,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, significantly up 56.8% from the year-ago figure of 44 cents. The bottom line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents.Ligand’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has soared 42.5% compared with the industry’s 2.7% increase.Total revenues in the quarter surged 54.6% year over year to $33.4 million, mainly on the back of higher royalty revenues. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31 million.Quarterly HighlightsRoyalty revenues were $21.9 million in the reported quarter, up approximately 39.5% year over year. Higher royalties on sales of Novartis' (NVS  -  Free Report) Promacta, Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Kyprolis and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals' (SPPI  -  Free Report) Evomela drove this upside. Ligand licenses its platform technologies such as Captisol or OmniAb to partners for use in their proprietary programs.Material sales also soared by 83.3% to $7.7 million owing to the favorable timing of Captisol purchases for clinical and commercial use.License and milestone revenues were $3.8 million, registering a massive rise of 123.5% compared with $1.7 million in the year-ago period. This increase was courtesy of the favorable timing of milestones and license fees earned.Research & development (R&D) expenses marginally decreased by 18.6% to $4.8 million. However, general & administrative expenses increased 6.1% year over year to $7 million.Pipeline and Other UpdatesIn September, Ligand Pharmaceuticals announced positive top-line results from a phase II study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of its pipeline candidate LGD-6972, for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. The study achieved statistical significance in the primary endpoint of change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c after 12 weeks of treatment at all doses (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) tested.In July, the company announced that it has entered into a commercial license and supply agreement with Amgen, granting it rights to use Captisol in the formulation of its anti-CD33 x anti-CD3 (BiTE) bi-specific antibody, AMG 330. Under the terms of the deal, Ligand is entitled to potential milestone payments, royalties and revenues from the future sales of AMG 330.2017 OutlookLigand raised its 2017 earnings and revenue outlook.

267,AMGN,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) posted a loss of $1.31 per share in the third quarter of 2017, wider than the loss of $1.07 per share in the year-ago quarter and the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of $1.24. The year-over-year increase in net loss was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses.Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Radius Health, Inc. QuoteRadius Health’ share price had decreased 18.6% in the last six months compared with the industry’s fall of 2.6%.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $3.5 million while license revenues came in at $10 million. However, total revenues of 13.47 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.48 million.  Quarter in DetailResearch and development expenses for the reported quarter were $21 million, down 23.5% year over year due to a decrease in vasomotor project related spending, a $2.0 million decline in abaloparatide-SC project costs, and a $1.1 million fall in elacestrant (RAD1901) oncology project costs.General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter jumped to $47.7 million from $19.2 million.This increase was primarily the result of an increase of approximately $10.1 million in professional fees and support costs, including the costs associated with increasing headcount and preparing for the commercialization of Tymlos in the United States.Higher compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount were also responsible for increased costs.Pipeline UpdatesThe FDA approved Tymlos (abaloparatide) injection for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture.The company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-transdermal. In May, Radius Health announced positive top-line results from the completed 24-month ACTIVExtend clinical trial on Tymlos, which met all of primary and secondary endpoints. The company expects to submit a sNDA to the FDA in connection with the ACTIVExtend results by year end. The company also plans to initiate a clinical trial in men with osteoporosis, which, if successful, will form the basis of an sNDA seeking to expand the label to treat men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. The study is expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, Radius Health’ Marketing Authorisation Application for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Europe is under review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency. The company however suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. Consequently, Radius Health is working with the CHMP to address these issues and the company expects a response prior to the end of 2017.The company scheduled a meeting with the FDA in January 2018 to align on a regulatory pathway for a pivotal study for abaloparatide-TD.Meanwhile, the company discussed the regulatory pathway for elacestrant for breast cancer. In the meeting, the FDA indicated that, depending on the study results, which must demonstrate an improvement over the available therapies, the planned single-arm phase 2 trial could be considered a pivotal study for accelerated approval. However, a confirmatory study must be ongoing at the time of the NDA submission. Radius Health will provide further study details when the phase 2 study is initiated (expected in early 2018). The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to elacestrant in October 2017.  The candidate is also being evaluated at low doses as an estrogen receptor ligand for the potential relief of the frequency and severity of moderate to severe hot flashes in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. An update will be provided by 2017-end.Our TakeThe company’s wider-than-expected loss in the third quarter was disappointing as expenses continue to increase with the commercialization of Tymlos. A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost performance.Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen Inc's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia. Moreover, the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). The company also a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc.

268,AMGN,"Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.00 per American depositary share, which were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings declined 4.5% on a reported basis. However at constant currency rates (CER), earnings rose 1.1%.Third-quarter net sales rose 0.3% on a reported basis and 4.7% at CER to almost $10.59 billion (€8.05 billion). Sales, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.93 billion. Unfavorable exchange rate movements hurt sales by 4.4%.In January 2017, the French drug maker swapped its Merial Animal Health businesses with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business. Reflecting this exchange and full consolidation of Sanofi’s European vaccines operations, sales declined 0.2% at constant structure (CS) and CER.Sales declined 2.4% at CER in the United States. However, sales rose 11.4% in Emerging Markets, 8.2% in Europe and 9.1% in the Rest of the World (Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico).All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at CER.Segmental PerformancePharmaceuticals sales (including emerging markets) increased 3.2% to €7.14 billion. However, at CS and CER, Pharmaceuticals sales declined 1.2% as double-digit growth of multiple sclerosis drugs and vaccines franchises and robust growth in emerging markets was offset by a decline in diabetes, established products and generics sales.Sanofi reports through five Global Business Units (GBUs) – Sanofi Genzyme (Specialty Care), Diabetes & Cardiovascular, General Medicines & Emerging Markets, Consumer Healthcare and Sanofi Pasteur (Vaccines).Sanofi Genzyme/Specialty Care GBU sales (including emerging markets) increased 12.5% to €1.63 billion, driven by strong U.S. launch of Dupixent and higher sales of multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs.Sales of MS drugs Aubagio rose 19.2% to €382 million while sales of Lemtrada went up 5.4% to €113 million. However, sales of both these drugs declined sequentially in the quarter.Meanwhile, sales of rare disease drugs like Myozyme/Lumizyme improved 5.9% to €191 million while Fabrazyme sales were €175 million, up 4.5%. Cerdelga sales came in at €31 million, up 14.3% while Cerezyme sales rose 1.6% to €178 million.Oncology sales rose 5% to €363 million driven mainly by higher sales of Jevtana and Thymoglobulin. Jevtana sales were up 6.8% to €90 million while Thymoglobulin recorded sales of €71, up 5.7%. Taxotere sales rose 2.2% to €42 million.

Dupixent generated sales of €75 million in the third quarter compared with €26 million in the previous quarter. Management is pleased with the drug’s uptake and said that in the United States, the drug has been prescribed by over 7,100 physicians. Meanwhile, Dupixent was approved in the EU in September and is expected to be launched in Germany by the end of this year. Kevzara and Dupixent generated total immunology sales of €77 million in the third quarter.Diabetes and Cardiovascular GBU (including emerging markets) declined 9.1% to €1.68 billion. The Diabetes franchise (including emerging markets) declined 10% to €1.55 billion due to lower sales of key drug Lantus.Sales of diabetes drugs in the United States declined 22.4% to €725 million due to a tough U.S. payer environment. Sales of diabetes drugs in Emerging Markets were up 17.3% while in Europe it declined 3.1%.Lantus sales declined 15.5% to €1.12 billion in the quarter. Lantus sales declined 25.4% in the United States due to lower average net price and exclusion from the CVS and United Health formulary plans while Europe sales declined 14% due to biosimilar competition and patient switching to Toujeo.Toujeo generated sales of €198 million in the reported quarter, which, though up 23.4% on a year-over-year basis, declined 5.7% sequentially.Soliqua, a once-daily titratable fixed-ratio combination of Lantus and Lyxumia, was launched in the United States in January and in Netherlands (trade name – Suliqua) recently. Soliqua/Suliqua generated sales of €8 million in the quarter compared with €5 million in the previous quarter.Management warned that U.S. diabetes franchise sales will decline at an accelerated rate in the fourth quarter due to CVS/United Health formulary exclusion plans and difficult comparisons with the last year. Considering recent market trends, Sanofi now expects its global Diabetes sales to decline in the range of 6–8% CAGR over the 2015–2018 timeframe. Previously, Sanofi had guided sales decline in the range of 4% to 8%.In the cardiovascular franchise, Sanofi’s anti PCSK9 therapy, Praluent garnered worldwide sales of €42 million in the reported quarter, flat sequentially. Incidentally, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), which reported last week, also did not report a very significant sequential improvement in sales of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Uptake of these drugs has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions.General Medicines & Emerging Markets GBU sales came in at €3.31 billion, down 2.7%. Sales of Established products were €2.26 billion, down 6.5% as strong performance in emerging markets was offset by lower sales in Europe and generic competition for Plavix in Japan and Renvela/Renagel in the United States.Sales of Generics declined 0.9% to €433 million due to lower sales in Europe. Consumer Healthcare GBU sales were €1.13 billion, up 48.5%. However, sales were up only 1% excluding acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim’s Consumer Healthcare business due to increased competition in developed markets.Third-quarter consolidated Sanofi Pasteur (Vaccines) sales increased 11% to €1.92 billion due to the strong performance of pediatric combinations and booster vaccine, Menactra. Vaccines sales reflect the termination of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint-venture with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) in Europe from December 2016.Costs RiseSelling general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 5.9% at CER in the quarter, reflecting launch costs of Dupixent and Kevzara. R&D expenses were up 12.9% at CER, reflecting higher pipeline development costs in oncology (isatixumab, PD-1) and sotagliflozin.2017 OutlookSanofi maintained its previously issued financial outlook.Sanofi expects 2017 business earnings to be broadly flat at CER. It anticipates a negative currency impact in the range of 1%-2% on business earnings in 2017. This compares unfavorably with the prior expectations of a positive currency impact of 1%.Our TakeSanofi’s third-quarter 2017 results mixed as it reported in-line earnings and missed sales expectations. Strong performances of multiple sclerosis and vaccines franchises, successful launch of Dupixent and robust emerging market sales could not make up for the weak performance in the diabetes and cardiovascular unit. Shares of Sanofi  were down slightly more than 1% in pre-market trading.So far this year, Sanofi’s share price has risen 14.9%, slightly worse than a 15.1% increase for the industry.However, despite greater-than-previously expected headwinds from currency, the company maintained its earnings forecast, which was encouraging.We are encouraged by the strong performance of MS drugs like Aubagio and Lemtrada. We are also optimistic on sales prospects of Dupixent, which could prove to be an important growth driver for the company.However, headwinds include a bleak outlook for the Diabetes franchise, generic competition for many drugs and slower-than-expected uptake of new products like Praluent.Sanofi Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sanofi Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sanofi QuoteSanofi currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

269,AMGN,"Major biotech companies reported earnings results over the last five trading days. While companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) topped expectations, it was a mixed quarter for companies like Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Alexion (Read more: Alexion Tops Q3 Earnings, Lags Sales, 2017 View Up) and BioMarin (Read more: BioMarin Q3 Loss Narrows, Profit Guidance Raised).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Earnings Results: It was all about earnings this week with several key names reporting third quarter results.

Under the deal, signed in February 2015, Sanofi had an exclusive option for ex-U.S. development and commercial rights to VY-AADC. The deal terms included upfront payments of $100 million as well as future potential development and sales milestone payments of up to $745 million, plus tiered royalties on product sales.According to Voyager, Sanofi decided to exit the deal as the option did not include rights in the United States. With Voyager gaining global rights to the VY-AADC program for advanced Parkinson’s disease, the company said that it remains on track to dose the first patient during the second quarter of 2018.GW Finishes Rolling Drug Submission for Epilepsy Drug: GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the rolling submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) in the United States for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) as adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome.

270,AMGN,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 67 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents by 3.1%. Earnings also rose 10% year over year driven by slightly higher sales and lower costs and share count.The pharma heavyweight delivered revenues of $13.17 billion, which were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues rose 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported as well as operational basis.Sales in DetailCurrency movement hurt Pfizer’s third-quarter revenues slightly ($54 million) while the divestiture of Hospira infusion systems business hurt sales by 2% in the quarter. In February 2017, Pfizer divested its Hospira infusion systems (HIS)business to ICU Medical, Inc. (ICUI  -  Free Report). Excluding currency headwinds and HIS revenues, sales rose 4%.Strong performance of newer products like Ibrance (breast cancer), Xtandi (prostate cancer) and Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) offset lower sales of Enbrel, Viagra and the Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise and loss of exclusivity for some products.International revenues rose 2% (up 3% an operational basis) to $6.63 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues were flat at $6.53 billion.Segment DiscussionPfizer’s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 11% on a reported and operational basis from the year-ago period to $8.12 billion. Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Ibrance and Eliquis globally and growth of Lyrica and Xeljanz primarily in the United States.While Ibrance revenues rose 60% to $878 million in the quarter, Xeljanz rose 48% to $348 million. Lyrica sales rose 10% to $1.15 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 43% to $644 million.Revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the September 2016 Medivation acquisition, also contributed to U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $150 million in the quarter compared with $141 million in the second quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in the United States and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra.Enbrel revenues declined 13% to $613 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the United States and Canada. Total Viagra (IH+EH) sales declined 20% to $308 million. Lower demand and wholesaler destocking ahead of the potential generic competition in December hurt sales of Viagra.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues declined 1% to $1.52 billion. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 4% in the United States due to continued decline in revenues for the eligible adult patient population. However, Prevenar 13 revenues rose 5% in international markets due to favorable timing of government purchases in some emerging markets.Consumer Healthcare revenues rose 4% to $829 million. Global Oncology revenues surged 46% to $1.62 billion driven by Ibrance. Global Vaccine revenues rose 1% to $1.65 billion. Internal Medicine rose 9% to $2.46 billion. The Inflammation & Immunology franchise rose 4% to $1 billion. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 3% to $569 million.Earlier this month, Pfizer said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision is expected next year.Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 12% (down 11% operationally) to $5.05 billion. Excluding HIS revenues, EH sales declined 7%.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products primarily Pristiq in the United States and Vfend and Lyrica in Europe, lower revenues from legacy Hospira products due to product shortages and divesture of HIS. However, in the EH business, biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck’s blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $34 million in the United States and $112 million globally, all other biosimilars brought in sales of $28 million (down 16%) from outside the U.S. markets. Emerging markets revenues grew 7% operationally.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses declined 1% (operationally) in the quarter to $3.48 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses also declined 1% to $1.85 billion.2017 Guidance UpdatedWhile Pfizer raised its adjusted earnings guidance, it tightened the revenue expectations for the year. Revenues are expected in the range of $52.4 billion to $53.1 billion compared with $52 billion to $54 billion expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $52.65 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.58 - $2.62 compared with $2.54 - $2.60 expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.56 per share.At the mid-point, adjusted EPS is expected to increase 8% (previously 7%).Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $7.5–$7.8 billion (previously $7.5–$8.0 billion), while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $14.0–$14.5 billion (previously $13.7–$14.7 billion).Our TakePfizer’s third-quarter results were mixed as it beat earnings estimates but delivered in-line sales. However, the company raised its adjusted earnings guidance for the year. Shares were down 0.5% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Pfizer’s shares are up 8.2%, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 14.6% for the industry. Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition, which are hurting the top line. Nonetheless, we believe that new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance.Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects a “multiyear wave of potential new product launches and product line extensions.” Bavencio is being considered a key long-term growth driver for Pfizer.Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March this year and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio was also approved in EU and Japan in September for MCC.Two other leukemia treatments — Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) — were also approvedby the FDA in the third quarter. Besponsa was also approved in the EU in June.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Pfizer, Inc.

271,AMGN,"The earnings season is off to a flying start with equity markets scaling record highs, owing to a slew of upbeat economic data, strong corporate performance and President Donald Trump's tax reform proposal. However, the performance has been a mixed bag for biotech companies, with some beating market expectations, while a few failing to do so (read: U.S. Fiscal Deficit at 3.5% of GDP: ETFs in Focus).We will now discuss the performance of a few biotech giants such as Amgen Inc (AMGN  -  Free Report), Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report), Biogen Inc (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) (read: Should You Keep Your Portfolio Healthy with Biotech ETFs?).Earnings in FocusAmgen reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $3.27 per share on Oct 25, 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 and increasing 8.3% from $3.02 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the revenue front. Amgen reported revenues of $5.773 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.743 billion but decreased 0.7% from $5.811 billion in the year-ago quarter.The company updated its full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance to the range $10.96-$11.20 from the previous guided range of $10.79-$11.37, owing to hurricane-recovery costs. It also updated its revenue guidance to the range of $22.7-$23 billion from the previous guided range of $22.5-$23 billion. The company’s shares lost around 0.8% during after-hours trading on Oct 25, 2017, after it revised down its guidance.Gilead Sciences reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.06 per share on Oct 26, 2017, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 and decreasing more than 25.1% from $2.75 per share in the year-ago quarter. However, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the revenue front. The company reported revenues of $6.512 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.329 billion but decreased more than 13.2% from $7.500 billion in the year-ago quarter.The company updated its full-year revenue guidance to the range of $24.5-$25.5 billion from the previous guided range of $24-$25.5 billion. The company’s shares fell around 3.8% in after-hours trading on Oct 26, 2017, owing to the EPS miss.Biogen Inc reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.31 on Oct 24, 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.70 and increasing 21.6% from $5.19 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company reported revenues of $3.078 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.036 billion and increasing roughly 4.1% from $2.956 billion in the year-ago quarter.The company’s shares declined 3.9% at market close on Oct 24 due to weaker-than-expected sales of its sclerosis franchise.Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 on Oct 26, 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 and increasing roughly 17.1% from $1.23 per share in the year-ago quarter.

272,AMGN,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) reported mixed results in the third quarter of 2017. The company surpassed earnings estimates, while posted in-line revenues during the period. Importantly, the company raised its long-term sales expectations of its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, despite rising competition in the market. In response, shares nudged up almost 2% in pre-market trading.In the year so far, AbbVie’s shares have surged 48.6%, significantly outperforming the industry’s 16.1% rally.The biopharmaceutical company reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.41 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 by 1.4%. The bottom line grew 16.5% year over year.The company posted revenues of $7 billion in the reported quarter, having met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues also increased 9.5% year over year. Excluding a 0.7% favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, operational revenues climbed 8.8%.Quarter in DetailKey drug Humira recorded sales growth of 14.8%, on an operational basis, with revenues coming in at $4.7 billion. Sales in the United States rallied 19.1% to $3.2 billion. Humira sales in the ex-U.S. market were up 6.8% on operational basis and 9.7% on reported basis to $1.55 billion. Growth across all three major market categories drove the upside, despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs as well as an indirect biosimilar competition in international markets.Third-quarter net revenue from Imbruvica stood at $688 million, up 37.3% year over year. U.S. sales of Imbruvica were $574 million, up 31% compared with the year-ago figure. AbbVie recorded $114 million of international profit sharing with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Other products that delivered an impressive performance include Duodopa, showing revenue growth of 22% on operational and 26.3% on reported basis. Another product called Creon witnessed an increase of 14.8% in revenues on both operational and reported basis.HCV (chronic hepatitis C virus) product recorded sales of $276 million, down 27.7% and 26.8% on operational and reported basis, respectively. The downside can be attributable to intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Adjusted SG&A expenses were up 5.8% to $1.45 billion, while R&D expenses escalated 13.3% to $1.19 billion in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 43.1% of sales in the reported quarter.AbbVie announced an 11% hike in quarterly dividend to 71 cents per share from 64 cents per share. The increased payment will begin with the dividend payable in February next year.2017 OutlookAbbVie raised its adjusted earnings for 2017 in the range of $5.53-$5.55 compared with $5.44-$5.54, expected previously. The earnings guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 14.9% at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $5.53 per share.Long-Term GuidanceAbbVie projects adjusted EPS in the range of $6.37-$6.57 for 2018, showing an approximate 15-19% rally from the mid-point of the revised range of 2017 outlook.AbbVie estimates Humira to generate global sales of $21 billion in 2020, higher than $18 billion, predicted previously in 2015.Several companies are working on biosimilar versions of Humira. Though Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Humira biosimilar received an FDA approval in September 2016, its launch is delayed to 2023 due to settlement of its patent dispute with AbbVie. This will make Humira free from competition for a few more years. Also, AbbVie has a robust intellectual property, which is expected to generate positive sentiments among the investors.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

273,AMGN,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) reported narrower-than-expected loss in the third quarter of 2017 but missed estimates for sales. The biotech also raised its previously issued adjusted net income guidance for 2017.So far this year, BioMarin’s shares have underperformed the industry. While BioMarin’s shares are down 0.4%, the industry has witnessed an increase of 3.7%.Loss Narrower than ExpectedThird-quarter loss of 7 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 22 cents. A one-time upfront payment received from Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT  -  Free Report) primarily led to the narrower loss in the quarter. In July, BioMarin entered into a license and settlement agreement with Sarepta resolving the exon-skipping patent litigation. Excluding this one-time upfront payment of $31.5 million and a contingent consideration gain, adjusted loss per share was 27 cents in the third quarter.Sales MissTotal revenue came in at $334.1 million, up 19% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $348 million.Quarterly DetailsProduct revenues were $298.8 million in the quarter, up 7% year over year.Kuvan revenues rose 16% to $105.8 million, reflecting patient growth in North America and continued growth in the ex-North American territories acquired in 2016. The number of patients on Kuvan therapy in the United States increased 9% in the third quarter.Naglazyme sales declined 7% year over year to $72.1 million.Vimizim contributed $90.3 million to total revenue, up 12% year over year. However, Vimizim sales declined 12.5% sequentially.Naglazyme and Vimzim revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of central government orders from some countries, mainly Brazil.Earlier this month, at its R&D day, BioMarin had said that a slowdown in federal purchasing orders in Brazil have hurt Naglazyme and Vimizim product revenues in the third quarter.Moreover, at that time, BioMarin had said that if the slowdown continues in the fourth quarter, it will only be able to meet the lower end of the total product revenue guidance ($1.25 billion and $1.3 billion, not including milestone payment from Sarepta). However, in the earnings release, BioMarin said that since the R&D day, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has initiated a purchasing process and it expects 2017 revenues to be within the guidance.BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties – totaling $22.4 million (down 5%) – from Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) Genzyme in the quarter.Brineura received approval for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease – a form of Batten disease – both in the United States and the EU in the second quarter. The newest drug in BioMarin’s portfolio generated sales of $3.1 million in the third quarter compared to $0.3 million in the second quarter. The company said the worldwide launch of Brineura was in-line with expectations and it achieved sales in the United States and in the European countries of Germany, France, Italy and Argentina.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 4.2% owning to lower spending on the Brineura program and the discontinuance of the Kyndrisa program last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.8% primarily due to increased expenses related to the acquisition of international Kuvan rights, costs associated with the Brineura launch and higher stock compensation expenses.Pipeline UpdateRegarding pegvaliase, which has been developed to treat phenylketonuria (PKU), the company plans to submit a marketing application in Europe in the first quarter of 2018, slightly delayed from the end of 2017 as guided previously. In the United States, pegvaliase Biologics License Application (BLA) is currently under priority review. Last month, BioMarin announced that the FDA is not looking to hold an advisory panel meeting for the company’s BLA for pegvaliase. Earlier this month, the company said the FDA is expected to give its decision in the first half of 2018.Meanwhile, two phase III studies (one in high dose (6e13 vg/kg) and one in mid dose (4e13 vg/kg)) on its hemophilia A candidate valoctocogene roxaparvovec (formerly BMN 270) are expected to be initiated before the end of the year. Concurrent with the earnings release, BioMarin announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to valoctocogene roxaparvovec based on positive data from phase I/II study.Earlier this month, BioMarin also announced that it has selected BMN 290, a small molecule drug, as its next development candidate. BMN 290 will be evaluated for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia (FA), a rare autosomal recessive disorder for which no disease modifying therapies are currently approved. An Investigational New Drug (IND) application to begin phase I studies is expected to be submitted in the second half of next year.2017 Outlook The company tightened its previously issued 2017 sales guidance. However, it raised its adjusted earnings guidance while lowering its expectations for operating costs.BioMarin expects total revenue in the range of $1.29 −$1.32 billion (including milestone payment from Sarepta) compared with $1.285 −$1.335 billion previously.  This represents year-over-year growth of 15.5% to 18.2%.Vimizim sales are expected in the range of $400–$420 million (previously $400–$430 million). Kuvan sales are projected in the range of $400–$420 million (previously $380−$410 million). Naglazyme sales are projected in the range of $310−$330 million (previously $300−$330 million).Expenses related to R&D are expected within $600-$620 million, down from $610-$640 million while SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $530-$550 million, compared with $530-$560 million previously.The bottom line, on an adjusted basis, is expected to turn positive in 2017. The company raised its 2017 adjusted net income guidance from $30 - $70 million to $60 - $80 million. Meanwhile, management is committed to profitability improvements over the longer term.At the call, BioMarin also said it expects its present marketed products plus pegvaliase to drive the top line at a 15% compounded rate through 2020 while costs will rise at a lower level.BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

274,AMGN,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2.  Radius’ share price has decreased 22% year to date compared with the industry’s 6.6% decline.Radius Health has a disappointing track record so far. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in three of the four trailing quarters with a negative average surprise of 6.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayRadius focuses on the development of therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases.The company’s lead drug, Tymlos, was approved in the United States in April. The drug was approved for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture and multiple risk factors for fracture. The drug can also be used for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.The company reported sales of Tymlos of $1.0 million from the first four weeks of launch.  The company is moving ahead with its plans in contracting with managed care organizations with access to over 133 million covered lives across Commercial and Medicare Part D plans.Hence, we expect investors to focus on the uptake of the drug during the upcoming earnings call.Although the osteoporosis market in the United States has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience osteoporotic fractures each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen. Inc’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Meanwhile, the company’s Marketing Authorisation Application for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) in Europe for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was under review.  However, the company suffered a setback when the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide-SC. Consequently, Radius is working with the CHMP to address these issues and the company expects a response for Eladynos prior to the end of 2017.In May, Radius Health announced positive top-line results from the completed 24-month ACTIVExtend clinical trial on Tymlos, which met all of its primary and secondary endpoints. The company expects to submit a sNDA to the FDA in connection with the ACTIVExtend results by year end.The FDA granted Fast Track designation to pipeline candidate elacestrant, an experimental selective estrogen receptor down-regulator/degrader for the treatment of women with ER+ and HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The elacestrant clinical development program is currently ongoing with two phase I studies in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been heavily pre-treated (median of three prior lines of therapy) and have evaluable disease.Hence, we expect the management to throw light on pipeline progress.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Radius is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Radius Health is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of $1.28. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter..Zacks Rank: Radius Health has a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is a pharma company that you may consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +40.11% and a Zacks Rank #3.

275,AMGN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $3.27 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 by 5.8%. Earnings increased 8% from the year-ago period backed by lower operating costs, which offset the year-over-year sales decline.Including costs related to discontinuation of a pipeline candidate (AMG 899, an oral CETP inhibitor), reported earnings were $2.76 per share, up 3% year over year.Total revenue of $5.77 billion in the quarter slightly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 billion. Revenues declined 1% year over year. An unfavorable impact of foreign exchange hurt sales by 1% in the quarter.While U.S. revenues declined 2%, ex-U.S. sales grew 5%, excluding currency headwinds.Quarter in DetailTotal product revenue declined 1% (including negative currency impact of 1%) from the year-ago quarter to $5.45 billion (U.S.: $4.3 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.16 billion) as strong demand for newer products like Prolia, Kyprolisand Blincyto was not enough to make up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.Revenues of Amgen’s erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), Aranesp, declined 3% from the year-ago quarter to $516 million due to lower demand.Revenues of the other ESA, Epogen, declined 21% to $264 million due to lower selling price owing to a recently negotiated contract with DaVita Inc. Unfavorable changes in inventory also hurt Epogen sales.Neulasta revenues declined 6% to $1.12 billion from the year-ago period dueto unfavorable shift in timing of purchases by some large customersand increased competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies. However, the Neulasta Onpro kit (on-body injector) continues to perform well, commanding a market share of about 56% in the United States for all Neulasta sales.Neupogen recorded a 25% decline in sales to $138 million due to biosimilar competition in the United States. Zarxio, Sandoz’s (Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm) biosimilar version of Neupogen, was launched in the United States in September 2015 and is hurting sales.Enbrel delivered revenues of $1.36 billion, down 6% from the year-ago quarter due to lower selling prices and increased competition, which hurt demand.Enbrel lost market share by less than 1 point in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments.Prolia revenues came in at $464 million, up 22% from the year-ago quarter due to higher demand. The osteoporosis drug witnessed market share gains in both the United States and international markets.Meanwhile, Xgeva delivered revenues of $387 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter mainly due to unfavorable shift in timing of purchases by some large customers.Sensipar/Mimpara revenues increased 10% to $457 million due to higher price increases.Vectibix revenues came in at $168 million, up 2%, driven by higher demand.Kyprolis recorded sales of $207 million, up 13% year over year driven by higher demand and robust uptake from outside U.S. markets.Amgen’s regulatory applications in the United States and EU to include overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis are under review. The study demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Velcade plus dexamethasone. This overall survival data, if approved, can help drive usage and boost sales of Kyprolis. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Apr 30 next year.Blincyto sales surged 79% from the year-ago period to $52 million, reflecting higher demand. In July, the FDA approved the inclusion of overall survival data from the TOWER study on the label of Blincyto to convert the accelerated approval to a full approval. The addition of the data must have boosted sales.Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha generated revenues of $89 million, not a very significant improvement from $83 million in the second quarter. Changes in inventory and accounting adjustments that favourably affected second-quarter sales were missing in the third quarter.Uptake of the drug, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent. The priority for Amgen right now is to improve patient access to Repatha.Amgen’s regulatory applications to include data from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER) on Repatha’s label is under priority review with a decision from the FDA expected on Dec 2. We remind investors that data from the FOURIER study, presented in the first quarter, had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes. The data is key to commercial success of Repatha as it will broaden the use of the drug. Though data from the study looks good, it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data.Operating Margins IncreaseAdjusted operating margins rose 270 basis points (bps) to 55.6% due to lower operating costs, reflecting continued benefits from transformation and process improvement efforts.R&D expenses declined 11% in the quarter due to lower late-stage pipeline related costs and lower upfront payments for in-licensing transactions than third quarter of last year. SG&A spend declined 6% due to the October 2016 expiration of Enbrel residual royalty payments, which offset investments to support new product launches.Amgen bought back shares worth $0.8 billion in the quarter. This month, Amgen’s board of directors approved a new share buyback plan of $5 billion.2017 GuidanceWhile Amgen slightly raised the lower end of the previously issued sales outlook, it raised the earnings guidance on the back of effective cost management.The company expects total revenue in the range of $22.7 billion to $23.0 billion compared with $22.5 billion to $23.0 billion expected previously. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of $12.50 to $12.70 in 2017 compared with $12.15 to $12.65 per share expected previously.However, the company tightened its reported earnings guidance to a range of $10.96-$11.20 per share from $10.79-$11.37 to account for the costs related to the hurricane recovery efforts at its Puerto Rico manufacturing facility. Though the company does not expect any negative impact on product supply, the expenses related to Hurricane Maria are expected to hurt earnings per share by 15-18 cents.Operating expenses are expected to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third.Our TakeThough Amgen beat expectations for both earnings and sales and raised its earnings guidance for the full year, shares lost more than 1% in after-market trading due to the decline in sales and probably due to disappointing sales of Repatha, a key new drug. However, so far this year, Amgen’s shares are up 21.4%, better than the 6.9% increase registered by the industry.Though Amgen’s newer products – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well, their volume growth may not be enough to offset the decline in mature brands like Enbrel due to competitive pressure. However, Amgen’s restructuring plan should make it leaner and more cost efficient. Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline, including biosimilar drugs.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
